</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was absent from the House last 
Friday due to a death in my family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, during Friday's sitting, I was the victim of false and 
vicious attacks by certain members of the opposition.  My 
privileges as a member were breached, and, today, I would like 
to set the facts straight clearly here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These members based their remarks on an article in Montreal's <I>La 
Presse</I>, which was full of errors and insinuations.  Paying no 
attention to the categorical denial I had issued Friday morning, 
certain opposition members not only repeated the falsehoods in 
the article, but went even further.  Let us review the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last May, a woman of Italian origin, unknown both to me and to 
my staff, contacted my riding office with an enquiry about her 
immigration file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action surprised no one, since I am the only Italian 
speaking MP in Montreal, hundreds of people in greater Montreal 
automatically contact my riding office concerning their 
immigration files or other matters of concern to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec had approved the woman's investor 
immigrant application, and she wanted to know the status of the 
federal portion of her file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My assistant therefore followed the usual procedure and sent a 
fax to client services at Citizenship and Immigration Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the fax was not sent to a specific 
person, but to a service of the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message's single paragraph read “Simply to find out the 
status of the residence file”.  How much more clearly could a 
person indicate that this document was merely a simple request 
for information without any form of support or reference?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The memo continues with the following three questions “have the 
audits come in?”—and I stress the question mark—, “And what 
about the medical results?”—again with a question mark. The third 
question was “Do you think the visas will be issued shortly?” 
Here, again, there is a question mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That memo does not exert any kind of pressure whatsoever and 
there is not the least bit of involvement in the decision. That 
document was signed by my riding assistant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The note is clear and to the point. It is similar in every 
respect to the more than 40,000 such notes sent each year to 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada by the members of this House. 
In fact, I intend, with leave from the House, to table a copy of 
that note at the end of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders what motivates journalists, who obviously had a copy 
of that note, but chose to write that I had personally sent a 
letter, which was not the case, and insinuate, in a very 
underhanded way, that I exerted pressure in that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue will be settled at another level, since I asked my 
lawyers to order <I>La Presse</I> and the journalists involved to 
withdraw these comments as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first time that I have been the target of such 
underhanded attacks. Each time, an investigation was held and I 
was cleared of all allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our work as members of parliament we cannot check in advance 
the background of all those who call on our staff to follow up 
on a federal issue. This means that we are all vulnerable. This 
is why my staff follows very strict procedures to serve the 
public diligently and effectively, without engaging in 
favouritism or discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, given the behaviour of some opposition members and 
journalists, it is easy to say, as a well known radio 
commentator pointed out this morning, “If my name were Lapierre 
or Arcand, this sort of thing would not happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, I have no intention of leaving my ministerial 
responsibilities, because, with regard to this issue, my staff 
simply did its work and I am completely blameless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I hope that opposition colleagues will withdraw their 
allegations and apologize. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member has offered to table a document.  I 
wonder if he would also be willing to table all other documents 
relating to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is the only 
document I have and, as I said, I am ready to table it.

with.  The Chair will leave it at that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance)</B>  moved that 
Bill C-244, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
mechanics' tool expenses) be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am truly delighted to be able to rise 
to debate this bill once again.  I first introduced it in the 
House in 1997, four years ago.  It has been debated on at least 
five days since then and I have spoken on it myself four or five 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that we have had no action from the government, but 
I am quite confident that we will have after today's debate.  I 
believe it will go to committee at some time in the near future 
and some action will be taken. 
However, it will certainly require the continued efforts of 
mechanics, technicians and others across the country to ensure 
that this happens.  It is not something we can take for granted.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I introduced my bill four years ago and in fact in the two 
months immediately following that, I received over 7,000 letters 
from technicians and from people who owned businesses that did 
mechanical repairs on vehicles and so on, from right across the 
country, from British Columbia to Newfoundland.  The support for 
that bill was widespread indeed.  Since the member from the Bloc 
introduced the same bill just before the last election, we have 
received over 70,000 postcards from right across the country. The 
support for the bill is undeniable.  I will talk about that 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the bill is that technicians and mechanics who, as 
a condition of employment, are required to purchase tools and to 
maintain a line of tools are not allowed to deduct for tax 
purposes the cost of these tools.  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems completely inconsistent when we have other groups of 
people such as artists and others who are allowed to deduct from 
their incomes the cost of the equipment they purchase to carry 
out their occupations.  It is also inconsistent when we see that 
business people are allowed to claim these expenses as the cost 
of doing business, whether they run the corner garage, a large 
machinery dealership or a farm implement dealership.  They are of 
course allowed to claim all the costs of doing business and that 
includes the cost of tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the problem arises from the disappearance of tools.  As 
a farmer, I have done a lot of mechanical work and I have seen a 
lot of tools disappear.  That was okay until my kids were old 
enough so that I could kind of point the finger of blame at them; 
every time a tool disappeared I could say my kids walked away 
with it, that it was not my own carelessness.  The problem is 
that with the kinds of conditions we work in, tools do disappear, 
and if the tools are owned by the business owner, they probably 
disappear a little more often, because someone is not quite 
careful enough to collect them after finishing a motor job or 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases no doubt they are stolen, but in most cases it is 
just a matter of carelessness.  Sometimes they are left on a 
vehicle and when it is taken out for a test drive or when farm 
equipment is taken out to be tested or used again, the tools are 
gone.  It adds up to thousands of dollars.  It is a serious cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, we have seen right across the country a common 
requirement of employment that mechanics purchase their own 
tools.  That is a condition of employment, so there is the 
problem.  Business people do what makes sense, because they know 
that technicians and mechanics will be a little more vigilant 
when they are dealing with their own tools and when they have to 
purchase out of their own pockets any tools lost.  Yet in spite 
of that, technicians and mechanics are just not allowed to claim 
the cost for tax purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the issue here and it is a serious one.  Because of this 
there is a shortage of mechanics and technicians right across the 
country right now, with no indication that the shortage will be 
reduced in any way.  It is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do with the rest of my presentation today is to 
demonstrate that there is broad support for this change and to 
explain how it is an issue of tax fairness and how the finance 
committee of the House, on different occasions, has indicated 
that this is a change which should be made because it is an issue 
of tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then want to close by talking a bit about the process to date 
with the bill in the House, to explain to Canadians and to 
technicians that it has been a long process, too long, I would 
argue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to carry on by talking about the support.  I have already 
referred to over 7,000 letters that I personally received from 
technicians on this issue, and the 70,000 postcards.  I know that 
every member of parliament in the House has received letters and 
phone calls from technicians about this piece of legislation.  I 
doubt that there is one who has not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was introduced by the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans and made 
votable in the last parliament, it was widely supported by 
members of every political party in the House, including the 
governing party.  There is support for the piece of legislation 
in every way imaginable.  There is no need to belabour the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about tax fairness.  It is about giving mechanics 
what is already available to certain other groups in society and 
what is already available to the business people who hire 
mechanics, if they choose to purchase tools for their use. 
Clearly it is a matter of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the December 1997 House of Commons 
finance committee prebudget report which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee believes that all Canadian employees should be 
allowed to deduct from their income the cost of large mandatory 
employment expenses.  Special provisions in the Income Tax Act 
already apply to artists, chainsaw operators and musicians.  To 
deny this tax treatment to apprentices and technicians in the 
automotive industry is not only unfair, it also imposes an 
impediment to employment, especially for the young who might 
choose to work as apprentices.  Revising the tax treatment of 
such expenses would remove the impediment that exists under the 
present tax rules. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee was very clear, and it was repeated later 
by the finance committee.  The finance committee is controlled by 
a majority of members from the governing side. They recognize 
that this change should happen.  I do not understand where the 
resistance is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is funny that the government only seems to act on a situation 
of tax fairness when it means more revenue and when it means that 
it can raise the taxes of a particular group in society.  In this 
case we are talking about lowering the tax load of technicians 
and mechanics.  Under those circumstances the government really 
does not seem that keen to act at all.  Sad as it is, that is the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I normally would quote from some of the people who have written 
to me on this issue, but I want to leave some time to explain 
what has happened with this piece of legislation in the House to 
date.  It is worth pointing out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first brought the bill forward in 1997.  A couple of weeks ago 
I found out that in 1992 a Liberal member when in opposition 
brought forth a similar bill except that it had no specifics 
attached to it.  It was a general statement indicating that 
mechanics or technicians should be allowed to deduct the cost of 
purchasing tools.  It had been put before the House in 1992.  I 
introduced it and debated it in the House in 1997.  I debated it 
when the Bloc MP had his name drawn and his bill was chosen. Only 
the dollar value was changed somewhat in his piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He indicated that tools which cost $225 or less should be fully 
written off in the particular year for tax purposes and tools 
above $225 should be claimed through capital cost allowance.  The 
figures were changed slightly, but that bill was debated a couple 
of months before the last election and passed by the House.  This 
shows there is support for the legislation in the House.  I do 
not think we should have to argue the point anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are again with the bill before the House.  This time it 
is Bill C-244.  The figures I have used in the bill are the same 
ones I used when I first introduced and debated the bill in 1997. 
Tools under $200 could be fully claimed in that year and tools 
valued at $200 or more could be claimed through capital cost 
allowance.  Insurance and so on could be claimed as business 
expenses.  That is completely consistent with what happens with 
farmers and other small businesses.  My bill is completely 
consistent with the Income Tax Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have chosen this bill on two occasions when my name has been 
drawn.  I do not understand why it has not been made votable. 
Yet when the Bloc member introduced substantially the same bill, 
in fact it was identical except the number was slightly changed, 
it was made votable on two occasions.  I cannot understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to deal with the piece of legislation.  I know 
my time is up, but I should like to close my presentation by 
asking for unanimous consent of the House to refer the bill to 
the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we could deal with the issue in committee.  It would not be 
held up any longer.  Finally we could end the government's 
balking on the issue.  We could have it put before the committee 
to amend it or draft its own legislation so that it could be 
carried forward on behalf of technicians and mechanics across the 
country, and indeed on behalf of all of us who depend upon them 
to keep us going, whether it is by air, by car or by rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should act on it quickly so that they will be treated fairly 
under the tax laws.  I ask for unanimous consent for Bill C-244 
to be referred to committee so that there will be no more 
hesitation on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent to send the bill directly to the finance committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Lakeland for his tenacity on this 
bill.  Of course another bill, which is almost exactly the same, 
has been deemed votable and will be coming to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill proposes changes to the Income Tax 
Act to help mechanics defray the cost of providing their own 
tools when it is a condition of employment.  The changes would 
allow mechanics to deduct the cost of buying, renting, insuring 
or maintaining their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An income tax deduction would be available for tools costing 
less than $200.  This amount may be adjusted according to 
inflation.  For larger amounts, the tool costs would be subject 
to capital cost allowances and these allowances would be set by 
regulation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian employers normally provide workers with the tools and 
other resources they need to do their jobs.  Even so, all 
Canadian workers bear some job related costs.  Whether these are 
the costs of getting to and from work, the costs of uniforms or 
other work clothes, the costs of eating away from home, or the 
costs of keeping up with trade journals.  These costs are 
something that all Canadians incur when they take a job. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These normal work related expenditures are recognized in the tax 
system through the basic personal amount.  The government 
increased this amount substantially since the elimination of the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to remind members that the 1998 and 1999 budgets 
increased the basic personal amount by $675.  Budget 2000 went 
even further with measures to ensure that the tax free amount 
would be more than $1,500 higher in 2004 than in 1997.  More tax 
free income helps low income workers offset normal employment 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House aims to recognize that employed 
mechanics face exceptional work related costs.  The Government of 
Canada understands that the costs can sometimes be a significant 
burden, particularly at the start of a career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer, for example, a Nova Scotia newspaper reported the 
case of a young apprentice mechanic.  He was earning $18,000 a 
year working in a garage service station.  He had invested some 
$10,000 in his tools.  On top of that he said he had to pay 
insurance costs, another $100 per $1,000 of tools.  For him that 
was another $1,000 per year.  I think all members would 
appreciate that is a large amount for one making only $18,000 a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect this young man also had other bills to pay like 
groceries, heat, rent, et cetera.  Clearly the costs that this 
young man incurred were worth it to him.  The tools he purchased 
will serve him for years to come.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely these costs were a big financial burden as well. Upfront 
costs should not be a barrier to an individual's ability to enter 
an occupation which at least in the longer term could provide a 
living income. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the government understands the difficult issue 
that this bill is trying to address.  We can support the 
principle that underlies. it, but I must nevertheless point out 
that this specific bill in many ways does not adequately address 
the issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to explain.  The bill would allow mechanics to deduct 
even small expenditures related to their tools.  As I said 
earlier, most Canadian workers have specific job related costs 
that they need to cover out of pocket.  What about carpenters, 
for example, or computer operators? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that the tax system provides some recognition 
with to the basic personal amount.  Instead of just covering the 
exceptional tool expenses that a mechanic might incur, the bill 
would give mechanics preferential tax treatment on normal work 
related expenditures.  It would simply be unfair to other tax 
paying Canadian workers.  If tax relief is provided for specific 
groups, it should be limited to extraordinarily high 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also opens the door to other inequities.  For example, 
it does not adequately ensure that tax relief is provided only 
for items genuinely required as a condition of employment. 
Employers should have to certify that the expenditures are a 
condition of employment.  Further, the principle of fairness 
would dictate that the tax benefit should be adjusted when tools 
purchased for work are subsequently used for other purposes or 
when tools are sold, for example.  There is no provision in the 
private member's bill to ensure that this takes place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would briefly note that this bill creates unnecessary 
administrative complexities.  Instead of using the existing 
regime for capital expenditures, the current capital cost 
allowance regime, this bill would set up a parallel system for 
employed mechanics.  This is not warranted since the existing 
capital cost allowances would achieve essentially the same 
results as the private member's bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very substantial employment expenses incurred by some 
employed mechanics are certainly a concern.  There is merit in 
the idea behind the private member's bill.  The lack of tax 
recognition for exceptionally high work related expenses should 
not be a barrier that prevents people from participating in the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust as well members agree that the bill would create 
inequities and unfairness in the tax system.  That is why much 
more work and thinking is needed to develop a workable solution 
to this important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government examines the issue it intends to work with 
representatives of the automotive industry, particularly with 
respect to the challenges faced by apprentices, to find a way to 
address the shortcomings in the private member's bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to speak to Bill C-244 introduced by the Canadian Alliance 
member for Lakeland, particularly in view of the fact that a 
member of the Bloc examined this issue for a long time and had 
previously introduced almost exactly the same bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have another opportunity in this 37th parliament to 
consider the Bloc Quebecois bill introduced by the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré, since his bill deals with the 
same subject, except that the Canadian Alliance deduction is set 
at $200 compared to $250 for the Bloc. But the real difference 
is the fact that the bill introduced by the Bloc Quebecois 
member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans will be 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will be allowed to vote on this tax deduction which is 
a rather important issue for the low and medium wage workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, I might even look a bit surprised after what I have 
just heard from the government, since as a result of the work of 
the Bloc member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, members have 
already voted on a similar bill to grant a $250 tax deduction 
when buying tools, insurance or anything else pertaining to this 
kind of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except maybe for a few members on the front benches, the 
Liberals had for the most part voted in favour of the bill. If I 
remember well, I think the House voted for the bill 180 to 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Even some ministers voted for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> As one of my colleagues points out, some 
of the Liberal ministers even voted for that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the member to read the notes again and look at what 
the government has done, since that is very important for those 
workers. He said that this would create inequities. For my part, 
I say that the system as it exists now is already creating 
inequities for them. We should check again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the member to look at what has been done, not only 
during the 36th parliament but also during the 35th, the 34th 
and the 33rd parliaments. Liberal members, who at that time were 
sitting in the opposition, brought in a bill almost identical to 
the one we are discussing today and to the one we will be 
discussing another day, the bill presented by the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill that is approved unanimously in the various 
parties, since the Liberals had introduced a similar bill when 
they were sitting in the opposition. The Canadian Alliance is 
introducing a similar bill, the NDP has already introduced one 
and so has the Progressive Conservative Party. I find it strange 
that as soon as a party moves across to the other side, it 
forgets legislation it had introduced previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all honesty, I call on the member to reread the speeches the 
Liberals made on this issue. He will see that there are indeed 
inequities for these workers and that we have to deal with these 
inequities, something that ultimately could be done quite 
easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need a royal commission to study whether mechanics 
should be allowed a $250 credit. We do not need to study the 
issue for years, for that has already been done. 
This issue has been on the table for at least 15 years in the 
House of Commons, but a party, once it is in office, never 
thinks about these workers who are doing an extremely important 
job in a society such as ours, a consumer society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in the House does not have a vehicle? Who in this House 
does not use a vehicle for work? It is very important to have 
good mechanics. It is extremely important to have mechanics who 
are at the cutting edge of the whole mechanics industry. Today, 
auto parts are quite different from what they were 20 years ago. 
Tools bought by mechanics are not screwdrivers from the dollar 
store. They are very expensive equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that, during the last election campaign, the 
government member listened carefully to all these technicians 
who told him that these tools are now costing a fortune. 
Yes, these people have a passion for mechanics. Yes, they do 
this job because they love it and because it is gratifying in 
many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also think about the next generation. When a young 
person gets out of school and has to buy $5,000, $10,000 or 
$15,000 worth of tools—it could be as much as $20,000 to $25,000, 
depending on the specialty—because he needs these tools to get a 
job, he should at least be allowed to deduct a certain amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have heard this morning from the government members is 
that they do not understand or do not want to understand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand. At one time, the Liberals were ready to help big 
sports clubs, and sports millionaires. For these people, they 
could afford millions. Luckily enough, the opposition could stop 
them and bring them back to their senses, but they were quite 
ready to help the sports millionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to mechanics and ordinary workers, it is 
another story. These people who earn their living honestly are 
not millionaires. Their working conditions are sometimes quite 
difficult. I would not like to be a mechanic right now, making 
oil changes and repairing cars that have been riding on our 
roads in Quebec and Canada. In the summertime, their working 
environment can be very hot. 
Everybody knows the working conditions of mechanics. These 
workers are very useful to the economy in Quebec and Canada. The 
government should be a little more sensitive to their needs, and 
more consistent in its approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the hon. member said that this would create a degree of 
unfairness in the system. But the system is already unfair. How 
can you explain that to mechanics? During the last campaign, I 
had to discuss this issue with them. How can you explain to them 
that they cannot have a deduction, when their boss, who demands 
that they have their own tools to work, can claim depreciation 
for his own tools, just because he has a company. It is hard to 
explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> The hon. member does not like to hear 
the truth. It is always unpleasant to hear things you do not 
want to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you explain that a mechanic cannot deduct the cost of his 
tools while a forest worker can deduct the cost of his 
chainsaws? Forest workers can claim deductions for their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Musicians can also deduct the cost of some of their instruments. 
I am not saying they should not do so, it is normal for them to 
do so because they use their instruments to earn their living 
just like a mechanic uses his tools to make a living. Without 
tools, he cannot work. If he does not work, he does not earn any 
money; if he does not work, he does not pay any taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you explain the situation to mechanics? I tried during 
the last election campaign, but I could not do it. 
I only promised them that, at the very first opportunity, the 
member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Îles-d'Orléans would 
reintroduce a bill so that finally the government and the House 
of Commons would be able to vote on these very important tax 
deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for us, the highly competent member of the Bloc 
Quebecois promptly introduced this bill. He argued his case and 
the House will vote on the bill. Until then, I hope government 
members will listen to our concerns, show some compassion and 
vote in favour of this bill, as a vast majority of members did 
in the 36th parliament, so that mechanics in Quebec and in 
Canada will be able to deduct the cost of part of the insurance 
coverage and the tools they need to practice their trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
begin by thanking the member for Lakeland for allowing us the 
opportunity to debate this important issue once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previous speakers have pointed out, it is an issue of great 
interest right across the country, and certainly in the House, 
proven by the fact that every political party currently sitting 
in the House has introduced this issue.  Even the Liberal Party, 
when it was in opposition, saw fit to try to get some relief for 
ordinary working people when it came to the high cost of tools 
needed to do their jobs and earn their livings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I differ with the hon. parliamentary secretary.  This is an 
issue of tax fairness.  This would not exacerbate any unfairness 
in the tax system.  It would give some relief and recognition. 
Working people also deserve the ability to ply their trade and 
not be hampered by the unbelievably high cost of a working 
person's tools.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill specifically cites mechanics.  There is good reason for 
this because there are probably the most glaring examples of 
difficulties in this area.  An apprentice mechanic has to put 
together a tool kit costing anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 
worth of expensive tools.  A mechanic's job gets more complex and 
technical with diagnostic equipment.  It is no longer tuning up 
an old six cylinder in-line six with a simple set of tools.  It 
is very complex and very technical.  We do not recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real frustration for me is the government's unwillingness to 
recognize working people in this way.  This fuels the whole blue 
collar stigma that blue collar work and trades are not valued by 
the government.  Therefore, it is even more difficult to attract 
and retain young people in the industry.  There is evidence of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a journeyman carpenter and the average age of a carpenter 
today is 49 years old.  We cannot attract young people to the 
trade.  In part it is because of this overwhelming feeling that 
their jobs are not valuable.  Only the high-tech jobs appear 
sexy.  People feel they should be going into the B.A. program 
even if their skill set would point them in the direction of 
being a skilled trades person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root of the problem of who gets to deduct their expenses can 
be found in the definition of the independent contractor.  What 
is a truly independent contractor as opposed to an employee?  If 
a mechanic hangs out his or her shingle as an independent 
entrepreneur, the person can deduct everything from the space 
rented, to the tools purchased, to the depreciation on those 
tools and even the truck he or she drives.  All those things are 
tax write-offs because he or she is now a small business person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry has taken advantage of this.  Mechanics are 
different from the average hourly paid employee in most shops. 
They are actually paid by piece work.   They are not paid by the 
hour anymore, they are paid per job.  If it takes 2.1 hours of 
labour to do a head job on a Honda Civic, that is what they get 
paid whether they take three hours or one and a half hours to do 
it.  In that sense they differ from the traditional relationship 
of employer and employee.  They are independent to some degree. 
This is not recognized in the tax system which is one of the 
basic problems.  Other workers in the country also suffer from 
the same ambiguity in the definition of what an independent 
contractor is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House of the plight of the rural route mail 
couriers who find themselves in the same situation.  They are 
actually wholly dependent on one source for their income but they 
are not categorized as employees.  As such, the rural route mail 
couriers get it from both ends.  These individuals are dependent, 
not independent, but they do not get any of the advantages of 
being employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This basic tax unfairness helps to fuel the whole skill shortage 
problem faced in all of the skill trades.  This is because we do 
not recognize how very difficult it is for apprentice mechanics 
to rack up what is really a small business loan, up to $20,000, 
just so they can start plying their trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might say that most trades people make more money than the 
average industrial worker and that higher wage offsets the 
additional costs they must go through to be able to practise 
their trade.  That really is not true.  If a survey was done on 
what a mechanic makes, the amount would be anywhere from $15.00 
to $21.00 per hour.  There are people working in pulp mills with 
none of the risk factor or the additional costs of buying their 
own tools who make more than that.  The compensation package is 
not offsetting the additional expenses they have in setting up 
shop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most galling things in hearing the Liberal government 
refusing to entertain this very modest tax relief idea is that it 
just spent $100 billion in tax relief in its last announcement. 
The government plans to give tax relief right across the country 
in the figure of $100 billion, some of which is to corporations. 
The corporate tax rate will go down from 17% to 16%, which is a 
huge benefit to the corporate sector.  Capital gains taxes will 
be reduced for high income earners.  Do not tell me there are 
some high income earners here who applaud that.  There are a lot 
of mechanics who do not find any comfort in that whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not tell me that the bureaucrats who put together the tax 
relief package were not aware that this was a pressing national 
issue.  They were reminded every year in the House of Commons by 
every political party that this was pressing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lakeland pointed out that he had some 70,000 
pieces of correspondence, not just from employees but from 
employers in the industry, who are very concerned that their 
inability to attract young people into the industry is affected 
by the lack of recognition that skilled trade gets from this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hearing the Liberal Party talk about apprenticeship in the 
Speech from the Throne and then failing to recognize one of the 
most pressing problems that apprentices face today by failing to 
introduce any tax relief for working people when it had the 
opportunity to do so, tells me that it is really just lip 
service.  The Liberals are not really seized of the issue of 
those blue collar trades, the apprenticeship industries.  They 
are more concerned with the high tech field or providing tax 
relief to corporations so that something will trickle down to 
ordinary working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which has been raised to virtually every member 
of parliament in the House.  I doubt there is a person here that 
has not had some communication from a mechanic, a carpenter or an 
industrial electrician who has to shell out a great deal of money 
just to ply their trade, so they can get up in the morning, go to 
work and do what they are trained to do.  They do not get any of 
the recognition that even a small businessman or an entrepreneur 
might get if they went into business on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue of tax fairness or tax unfairness that 
working people face.  As a journeyman carpenter, many times I had 
to cross the country looking for work.  I had to go where the 
work was.  I had to throw my tools into the back of my pickup and 
then drive from B.C. to Thunder Bay to look for a job.  None of 
that can be written off.  If I was going to a job and was 
actually hired at the other end with the proof that I had a job, 
I could write off my moving expenses.  If I showed enough 
initiative to look for work and kept travelling until I found a 
job, none of that can be written off.  This is another example of 
how we are overlooking a whole sector of the population who make 
their living by their skills, who have to go where the work is 
and who are not being recognized by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final piece of evidence that I would offer to show that the 
government does not really care about apprenticeship, the skilled 
trades or even the industries that employ skilled trades people, 
is the EI treatment of apprentices.  When I went to trade school, 
after I had left my job to go to the community college component 
of my schooling, EI kicked in immediately.  There was no 
interruption.  I have income maintenance to survive that six week 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one of the changes made in 1996.  Now when apprentices 
leave their job to go to a community college they have a two week 
waiting period as if they were unemployed.  They not unemployed. 
They are just doing the learning component of their 
apprenticeship. The government has been reminded of that 
oversight time and time again.  Now it has put forward amendments 
to the EI bill and it has chosen not to address the issue that 
faces apprentices, the one single issue that has been brought to 
its attention by the building trades council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My compliments to the member from Lakeland for letting us have 
the opportunity to debate this again.  It is a shame the Liberal 
government does not see fit to meet the needs of industry by 
addressing this pressing concern. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I am 
standing in today on behalf of our finance critic, the hon. 
member from Kings—Hants, who has spoken on previous occasions in 
the House in support of this particular initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member for Lakeland for bringing this issue 
forth and joining almost a chorus of parliamentarians who have 
been in support of this particular initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon the first look at a deduction of this sort, there is 
something that I and I know the Progressive Conservative Party 
categorically believes in, and that is that the our tax code is 
far too complicated on a broad based perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I am very reticent to say that we will have 
the broad based tax relief that this country requires in order to 
maintain our capacity to be competitive.  I do not think we will 
see that from this government in the near future, in any way, 
shape or form.  The minimum that we owe the mechanics and the 
people in this particular sector is to accept the recommendations 
that were brought forth by the member for Lakeland and by other 
members of parliament in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are at least 115,000 mechanics working and paying taxes in 
Canada, mechanics who make a very significant contribution to our 
economy but who have to make a very significant initial cost to 
enter this particular trade.  I know a lot of Canadians would be 
alarmed or shocked to know that in order to even gain entry into 
this particular field a Canadian has to spend from $15,000 to as 
much as $40,000 in order to acquire the necessary tools to 
participate in these particular trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the New Democrats who spoke just a few moments 
ago pointed out that we have a massive demographic shift taking 
place in a lot of the trades, whether it is in carpentry, 
mechanics, welding or other trades.  They are not attracting the 
numbers of young people that they should.  One of the reasons 
right now is that the startup costs are quite prohibitive for 
them to be able to make this particular investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, I 
would support the initiative from the member for Lakeland.  This 
initiative was brought forth by the finance committee, not just 
once in 1996 but on a second occasion in 1997.  Although an 
argument can be made that this does complicate the tax code, it 
would also bring forth meaningful tax relief to individuals who 
are in those particular trades, which is a necessary component of 
our labour sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this initiative as we would all broad based tax 
relief.  The Government of Canada still does not understand that 
currently we have the second highest personal income taxes among 
all G7 nations as a percentage of our economy.  It should 
recognize the fact that our trading partners are making massive 
leaps.  It should be providing Canadians with the broad based tax 
relief that we need to maintain our position in the world.  It 
believes that its initiatives with respect to tax reductions that 
were made in the mini budget this past September were initiatives 
that addressed this concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the rest of the countries in the OECD are taking massive 
steps in terms of tax reduction, the Government of Canada, the 
Liberal Party of Canada, is taking baby steps.  The result is 
that Canada is falling farther behind and losing its place as a 
competitive nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that we provide the broad based tax relief 
that we categorically need.  We know that the Government of 
Canada is not providing that particular tool to our economy as it 
should be doing.  We know we are probably heading into an 
economic slowdown of some nature, the magnitude of which is still 
to be determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take this opportunity to challenge the government.  If we 
are on the eve of any form a slowdown, we need to send the right 
signal to the investment community that Canada is a place in 
which to grow, to profit and to invest.  I also want say to the 
Minister of Finance that not only should he be supporting the 
member for Lakeland's position on this particular initiative but 
it is almost unprecedented for the Government of Canada not to be 
tabling a true budget on schedule as it is supposed to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to support this private member's bill.  It is an 
issue that has come up in my riding over and over again.  There 
are a number of people in my riding who actually work in machine 
shops, car dealerships and other places where this issue of 
deductibility of the cost of their tools is a very real item.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned here today that this issue has been before 
the House on a number of occasions.  I will not digress long, but 
I will take the risk for 30 seconds or so to say that this is an 
issue that underlines the ineffectiveness of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that has come up over and over again in the 
seven years that I have been here and it has been spoken in 
favour of by members from all parties.  Even the Liberals spoke 
in favour of the bill when they were in opposition.  The issue 
deals with basic fairness to a sector of Canadians who right now 
are being unfairly treated by the Income Tax Act.  However, for 
some reason when the people on this side get to the other side, 
as happened in 1993, I do not know what happens.  Is there a 
machine half way across the aisle that performs a frontal 
lobotomy on these people so that when they get over there they 
can no longer think for themselves nor speak for themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to offend them so I will not go that way.  I just 
want to appeal to them.  We are backbench members and this is 
private members' business.  The issue will be up before the House 
again and again until it is finally corrected.  Perhaps these 
members now on the other side could be in the forefront of 
leadership, on behalf of mechanics in Canada who are being 
unfairly treated, and perhaps vote in favour of the bill when it 
comes to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Lakeland brought the issue before the 
House shortly after the 1993 election.  At that time I remember 
speaking to people in my riding.  A number of my constituents 
work at Petersen Pontiac Buick, a major dealership in Sherwood 
Park.  I do not think they are related to the hon. member 
opposite who perks up at the sound of his name.  It is certainly 
a good dealership.  The mechanics who work at Petersen Pontiac 
are required to have their own tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At issue here is that it is just good business sense for each 
mechanic to have his or her own tools because when one owns one's 
own tools one pays closer attention to one's security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done my own mechanical work for many years.  On Saturday 
I always like to get underneath my car and get my hands dirty 
changing the oil and doing some other work.  It has happened to 
me, as meticulous as I am, that I have occasionally lost one of 
the tools I was working with and I had to replace it. I am not a 
professional mechanic so I go out with after tax dollars and 
replace it.  However, the mechanic who is making his living with 
these tools has no choice as to whether or not to replace it.  He 
or she must buy a replacement with after tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another important issue here.  We have to recognize the 
importance to our country of this sector.  We are so dependent 
upon mechanical devices, such as automobiles, buses and trucks, 
for our transportation, not only for getting ourselves from place 
to place but also for the goods and services that we produce in 
Canada.  If it were not for mechanics and a very healthy number 
of people in that trade we would be in trouble.  We need to have 
an adequate supply of personnel.  Frankly, I believe they are 
being discouraged from entering this profession because of the 
immense high cost involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When most mechanics graduate from their training at the 
apprentice level, and even as they are being trained, they have 
to acquire these tools and pay for them with after tax dollars, 
which is grossly unfair.  Every other profession is permitted to 
deduct the cost of their equipment from the bottom line.  A 
mechanic working as an employee is not permitted to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has said that the government is 
concerned about this because it will open up the floodgates and 
make the tax code very complicated.  Well it is complicated 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this little amendment will make anyone unhappy 
but it will make a lot of mechanics very happy.  Members on the 
other side claim this is a matter of fairness and that therefore 
they will deny it to mechanics because they are denying it to 
other groups.  We all know there are some groups that have these 
deductibilities.  For example, musicians and artists make their 
living from their trades.  They use tools.  In a way we could 
call a violin a tool of the trade.  That is deductible and it 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand by what reasoning one can then conclude that 
a mechanic who is required to have tools should spend his after 
tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a math lesson.  We have a tendency when we talk 
about taxation to talk about the percentage rates.  It is well 
known that in most provinces the marginal tax rate is around 50% 
if we add federal and provincial taxes together.  Since that is 
taxable, and with the present tax agreements between the 
provinces and the federal government, any tax incurred federally 
is automatically also a provincial tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the consumer's point of view and from the mechanic's point 
of view they now have a bill to pay which, if they earn some 
money to buy a product, they will spend 50% of what they earn on 
taxes.  I will give a numeric example of what that means.   Let 
us say the individual needs to buy $1,000 worth of tools.  The 
person must earn $2,000 in order to pay for them because after 
the marginal tax rate of 50% he or she is left with $1,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our mistake is that we measure that as a percentage of the money 
earned.  When we pay the GST it is a percentage of the product we 
are buying.  If we look at this as a percentage of the product 
the mechanic is buying, it is a taxation rate of 100%.  To buy 
$1,000 worth of tools the mechanic had to pay $1,000 worth of 
taxes, which is a 100% tax rate.  It is very discriminatory.  I 
urge all members to vote in favour of this motion when it comes 
again to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Pursuant to Standing 
Order 95(2) the mover of the motion, the hon. member for 
Lakeland, has five minutes to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by 
thanking not only my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance but also 
the members of all other political parties for giving resounding 
support for the legislation, with the exception of the governing 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the parliamentary secretary, puppet to the finance 
minister.  It is interesting that almost all members of the 
governing party voted in favour of the legislation just before 
the election.  There were 11 ministers, if I am not mistaken, who 
voted against it.  Some ministers supported the bill before the 
election.  Of course now it is a different ball game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how the governing party views democracy.  It is wrong 
and improper.  It is undemocratic and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary to the finance minister stood up 
today and gave a speech, probably prepared by the finance 
minister—and a sad speech it was—arguing against the bill on 
the grounds that a personal exemption was already in place to 
cover those things.  He said that the bill would create inequity 
in the Income Tax Act.  He also said that it would allow 
mechanics to deduct even small costs.  He went on to say that 
tools may be used for non-work purposes.  In other words, he was 
saying that mechanics would cheat and claim tools that were being 
used for personal use.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will respond to some of the things the parliamentary secretary 
has stated.  Regarding his statement on personal exemptions, a 
personal exemption is not there to cover things like this. 
Employees who do not have to buy anything as a condition of 
employment, which is most employees, get the personal exemption. 
Every employee gets the personal exemption.  It is a nonsensical 
argument, and I cannot believe that the parliamentary secretary 
came up with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has been campaigning on increasing 
personal exemptions some $3,000 more than the government and 
$4,000 more in the case of spousal exemption.  The government has 
been very weak on that, but it has nothing to do with the issue. 
It is an important issue, something the Canadian Alliance feels 
is important, to increase personal exemptions, but the government 
is not doing that at any meaningful rate.  It has nothing at all 
to do with the issue, so I cannot understand the parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that the bill would create inequity.  I would 
like the parliamentary secretary to think about that comment. 
When mechanics or technicians choose to work on their own they 
can claim all the costs.  They can claim the cost of the tools 
they buy and any other costs related to the business.  However, 
if they work as an employee, maybe in the same shop, even if it 
is a condition of employment that they purchase their own tools 
they are not allowed to deduct the cost.  How is the bill leading 
to more inequity?  It is leading to equity and fairness under 
the tax act.  That was another absolutely ill conceived answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary argued against allowing mechanics to 
deduct small costs.  What is wrong with that?  Mechanics use a 
lot of things that as individual items do not cost a lot, but 
they add up to thousands and thousands of dollars.  That is 
exactly what the bill is intended to deal with.  What is wrong 
with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that tools may be used for non-work issues. 
That is the case in every area of the tax act.  If someone is 
prone to cheating, and I guess the parliamentary secretary 
believes that perhaps all taxpayers are cheats and we should 
watch against that, of course they could be used for personal 
use.  However, most technicians are honest, hard working people 
and they should be respected for that.  It is disgusting for the 
parliamentary secretary to indicate otherwise.  I think that is 
completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen with the bill in the House?  Before the 
election almost all government members, along with all members of 
the opposition, voted in favour of the same bill.  However now 
the parliamentary secretary is saying something entirely 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if backbench members of the governing party will vote 
against the bill this time, now that the election is over.  I 
really wonder.  I cannot believe they would do that, but they did 
vote against their red book promise, a promise taken from the red 
book and put forward as a motion from the official opposition. 
They voted against that, so who knows what they will do?  They 
may well vote against the bill.  That would be very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about tax fairness for technicians and mechanics who as a 
condition of employment must buy their own tools?  They have to 
pay for $15,000 to $70,000 worth of tools with before tax 
dollars.  It is unfair.  This is an issue of fairness.  Let the 
government bring the issue forward as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask now for unanimous consent of the House to make the bill 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the bill be 
votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the consideration of 
private members' business has now expired.  As the motion has not 
been designated as a votable item, the order is dropped from the 
order paper.

<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK17">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That section (5) of Standing Order 76 and section (5) of Standing 
Order 76.1 be amended by adding at the conclusion of the notes 
thereto the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage and, in 
exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be guided 
by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the United 
Kingdom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
speak to the motion before us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this motion is straightforward.  It is to 
reconfirm the authority of the Speaker to select motions for 
debate and, of course, for voting, at the report stage in the 
manner that was intended when our present legislative procedures 
were adopted some 32 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my discussions with other House leaders, we have canvassed a 
wide variety of options that might be followed in the interest 
of making the report stage a more effective part of the 
legislative process. 
These included possible changes to the committee stage and to 
the time allocation rules, as well as changes to report stage 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it became clear to me that such an approach more properly 
should be considered in the context of House of Commons 
modernization and that, today, we should simply confine 
ourselves to restating, as it were, the authority which the 
Speaker has always possessed or exercised in the 32 years we 
have had this procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This left us today with a single issue, but a very confined one, 
that had become a problem for the House in recent years and I 
was convinced by some of my honourable friends opposite that I 
should confine my initiative to addressing that single point, 
which is what I am going to do. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years successive Speakers have felt progressively less 
and less justified in exercising their authority, with the 
consequence that the report stage has been rendered vulnerable to 
unsatisfactory and, shall I say, clearly unintended uses. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December, 1999, the House was obliged to spend 42 consecutive 
hours voting on 469 report stage motions, most of which were 
concocted for the sole purpose of delaying the House.  Changing 
commas to semicolons, and attempting to obstruct the 
parliamentary process has nothing at all to do with democracy. 
That is not democracy; it is the opposite. And all members know 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> That is what democracy is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> The one doing the heckling ought to know.  In 
March, 2000, there was a similar exercise.  The House had to 
vote for 36 consecutive hours on 411 motions. 
Worse, in December, 2000, the House faced the prospect of having 
to deal with 3,133 motions, which would, in theory, have taken 
more than two weeks of non-stop sittings to be voted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a member decided to do in September, 2000, was to latch 
onto a sort of personal veto over the 300 other members of the 
House, since it is, of course, all but impossible to vote on 
3,133 motions, unless we were to sit for months on end solely to 
deal with report stage of one bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can no more claim that democracy is improved by such an 
action than we can claim that heckling in the House today 
contributes in any useful way to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Well, no, this is a dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> It is clear that the Standing Orders were 
never intended to pave the way for such shenanigans.  And we all 
know it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, I and a parliamentarian from another party visited 
Great Britain's parliament, on whose procedures we modelled this 
standing order 32 years ago.  There, I saw how this legislative 
procedure worked. It was plain that it was never intended to 
obstruct the parliamentary process. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1968, the report stage procedures were adopted by 
the House.  I am being reminded by members that perhaps what we 
have done here is more important than from where we got the rule, 
which was in the U.K.  Okay, then, let us limit ourselves to what 
was done here when we adopted the rule in December 1968.  The 
then chairman of the House procedure committee, which is what it 
was called then, proposed these rules.  He said when he put them 
into place—these are his words, not mine—that his “description 
of the legislative process substantially applies to the 
proceedings of the United Kingdom parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, when the rule was put in place in 1968, the 
chair of the procedure committee recognized that he went to the 
U.K., received the rule there and applied it to the Canadian 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same debate, the acknowledged master parliamentary 
philosopher of the time and another member of the Special 
Committee on Procedures of the House—and I am sure my hon. 
friend from Winnipeg will want to speak of this—the late Stanley 
Knowles spoke about how this rule should apply.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, however, the whole tenure of our 
recommendations has been to try to eliminate duplication of 
debate and to facilitate the possibility of the nation's business 
getting before parliament and being dealt with. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of the day, Mr. Trudeau, said with respect to 
report stage: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new power to be given to the Speaker to permit him to marshal 
proposed amendments and to select those that best permit the 
House to express its views will help to focus and to improve 
debate. 
If adopted, this will be one of the first instances in which the 
House has made use of the Speaker's new status in order to 
improve its own procedures. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the words of Prime Minister Trudeau when we put that 
rule in place in 1968. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just enumerated three sources:  one, the chair of the 
committee that put that rule in place; two, an opposition member 
and very eloquent spokesman, the late Stanley Knowles; and of 
course, the former Prime Minister, the late Right Hon. Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to me that the framers of the report stage rules 
want this to be very clear.  Here I draw attention to the words 
of former Speaker Marcel Lambert, a former Conservative member of 
parliament as well, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your Honour will have the task of marshalling these amendments 
and frankly, with the greatest respect, I do not envy you your 
task. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Marcel Lambert, a former Speaker himself prior to 
that time, said.  I believe he was Speaker around 1962, during 
the Diefenbaker years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Mr. Lambert was saying was that you, Mr. Speaker, will have 
a hard job of selecting through these amendments, ensuring that 
only the proper ones will be votable and so on.  That was what a 
Conservative member of parliament said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus we see that at the time the report stage procedures were 
adopted in Canada, it was clearly anticipated that the Speaker 
would exercise the very broad powers of selection that are 
exercised in the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May's <I>Parliamentary Practice</I> discusses the power 
of selection on page 466 of its twentieth edition.  Here is what 
it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Selection is made by the Chair in such a way as to bring out the 
salient points of criticism, to prevent repetition and 
overlapping, and, where several amendments deal with the same 
point, to choose the more effective and better drafted. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same point. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience has shown that, in most cases, the discretion 
conferred on the Chair to select the amendments which may be 
moved is the best method of securing reasonable opportunities for 
all varieties of opinion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what was said by Erskine May.  The book is on our table 
in front of us as a reference manual, so I am not exactly 
inventing new parliamentary law here.  It was clearly the 
intention of the designers of the Canadian report stage that 
detailed legislative work would be done in committee, that the 
great majority of amendments would be disposed of in committee 
and that the report stage would be confined to amendments that 
could not have been moved in committee or that enabled the House 
to address major points of criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Marleau and Montpetit, or M and M, as we sometimes refer to 
it now, indicates at page 663, the designers of this process 
intended that all members, not just those on the committee, 
should have the opportunity to propose suitable amendments, but 
the intent was not for this stage to become a repetition of 
committee stage.  That is not Erskine May this time.  This is 
our book, Marleau and Montpetit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time, Speakers ceased to exercise that authority—I will 
not be challenging how Speakers have administered it, as these 
things happen—with each successive Speaker being less assertive 
than his or her predecessor.  As a consequence, the report stage 
of bills took on what I would call an exaggerated place in the 
process at the expense of other stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the reform of the House of Commons special committee, 
the McGrath committee—there is one member of that committee 
serving in the House and he will probably speak later—urged that 
the Speaker exercise the power to select, but the only practical 
consequence was that amendments that had been defeated in 
committee were routinely not selected at report stage.  The 
member was a prominent member of that committee, as I have said, 
and is very much a prominent member of the House today and a very 
respected member as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, the practice arose whereby members 
simply did not propose their amendments in committee at all, 
reserving them instead for report stage.  This is only one of the 
problems.  This further diminished the committee stage and 
exacerbated the already inflated role of report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  It was not long before the usual operations of 
report stage began to be employed for purposes for which they 
were never intended, rendering the process not merely one that is 
exceedingly unpleasant for members but also one that brings the 
House into what I will call public disrepute.  I do not think 
Canadians watching us vote 24 hours a day 3 days in a row on 
changing commas to semicolons can be impressed by our collective 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen before that when someone in the House stumbles upon 
a dysfunctional method of asserting political disagreement, it 
may start as the nuclear weapon of the parliamentary arsenal:  we 
use it the first time because it is the greatest and most 
important issue ever to have hit the legislature, but in not too 
long a period of time it becomes the sine qua non of 
parliamentary opposition.  In other words, we use it the first 
time because it is earth shattering, the second time we use it 
because it is very important, and the third time we have to use 
it, otherwise we are not serious at all.  This is a little bit 
like the bell ringing incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Just like time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would gladly talk about 
time allocation at some other point, because in fact if we go 
back to the U.K. House, every bill is time allocated to one day, 
as we know, and yes, there is discretion for the Speaker to add 
an hour at the end of the day if the debate has not been long 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, in my discussions with other House leaders it 
has become clear that there is a broad range of issues with 
regard to the legislative process.  I want to engage my 
colleagues and other parties toward all of that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not what we are doing today.  Today we are only repairing 
something that is broken in the rule in order to make parliament 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a case during debate on the Young Offenders Act in the 
last parliament where there were hundreds of amendments only to 
change the implementation date of the bill.  Remembering what we 
said, what the authors of the particular parliamentary reform 32 
years ago wanted this procedure to do, clearly no one had in mind 
that we would have 3,133 amendments to a bill.  No one ever had 
in mind that it was to be used for repetitive report stage 
amendments to change an implementation date.  Certainly no one 
ever designed this system to permit one MP to have a veto over 
the legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were what the authors had in mind, why would they have 
done it?  Why would they, in their wisdom in 1968, have brought 
in a procedure so that every member who did not like a bill and 
was creative enough to produce sufficient numbers of amendments 
could stop parliament from dealing with the legislation?  Let us 
get serious.  Nobody ever wanted the procedure to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there are other things that can be done to report stage. 
Perhaps there are other improvements or changes.  If so, they 
should be done at another time because that would constitute a 
form of parliamentary reform I would like to discuss with other 
parties, but that is a different issue and that is why this 
motion does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I would have liked it to have done other things at 
the same time.  I have had conversations with others.  I will not 
describe the nature of each one of those because I never divulge 
the content of a House leaders' meeting. I will not, not here or 
anywhere else.  Sometimes to my peril I have not made public what 
has happened with other House leaders, but I think it is the only 
reason we are able to do anything around here, so I will not do 
that right now either. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the months and even days to come, I would like to speak with 
my counterparts in the other political parties with a view to 
introducing a system of modernizing parliamentary rules which 
would include reciprocity, and ultimately result in an improved 
parliament for Canadians.  I think that that is what we all 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a discussion for another time, not for today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile there is one rule that is not working and it is this 
one.  The difficulties with that procedure not only threaten the 
ability of all members to do their work in a reasonable fashion, 
but it tends to bring the House into disrepute.  I would be 
remiss in my duties in the House if I did not propose this 
correction, and I am. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making this proposal, I am not attempting to change the rules 
of the House.  I am merely reaffirming the authority of the 
Chair as it was expected to be exercised by the framers of the 
rules 32 years ago.  That is all I am doing today. I am merely 
reaffirming the views of the chairman of the committee that 
preferred those rules.  I am referring to Gordon Blair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am merely reaffirming the views of great parliamentarians like 
Stanley Knowles and Marcel Lambert, a former Speaker of the 
House. I am merely reaffirming the views of the McGrath 
committee. 
I am merely reaffirming my faith in the judgement and fairness 
of the Speaker of the House of Commons.  I urge all my 
colleagues to pass this motion so that parliament can do its 
job, nothing more and nothing less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
frequently when we rise in debate we begin our speech by saying 
“I am pleased to be able to stand and speak to this debate”.  I 
have the extraordinary honour today of being the leadoff speaker 
for the opposition on this government motion.  Pursuant to 
Standing Order 43, I am going to jolly well take my time doing it 
before the government prevents us from speaking at all on 
anything at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader seems to pride himself on the fact that we are 
patterned after the United Kingdom parliament.  He gets a little 
smile on his face when he says “Over there, every bill is time 
allocated”.  He seems so happy about that.  I am very concerned 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I became a member of parliament in 1993.  I have been around 
here for approximately seven years.  In that time I have given 
some serious thought to what this place is.  I have often said 
that I wish I would have learned French when I was young.  I 
lived far away from French speaking people and I was so 
interested in science and math that I took those options and did 
not learn French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one of the words in French that I know is parlez-vous; 
parle.  It has something to do with speaking, does it not?  It 
has something to do with debates.  If parliament is not the place 
of debate then what is it?  What then is our purpose for being 
here if we do not have adequate opportunity to debate issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite aware of the fact that the motion today has nothing 
to do directly with debate.  It is dealing with the question of 
whether or not members of the opposition, or any other members, 
can propose amendments.  Backbenchers really do not have that 
much freedom to propose amendments, although I suppose legally 
according to the standing orders they could.  What is really 
being proposed is a limitation on members of parliament, who are 
not in the front inner core over there, to put forward amendments 
at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to interrupt the flow of my speech for just a second.  I 
am aware that there are hundreds, probably thousands, of 
Canadians watching this debate.  It is Monday morning.  Out west 
right now it is approximately 10.30 a.m.  There are a lot of 
people who said they were going to leave their jobs for a while, 
watch CPAC and this important debate.  The whole future of our 
parliamentary system hangs on this debate.  I believe they are 
glued and riveted to their television sets right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to interrupt the talk about the proposed motion to 
describe very briefly how things work around here.  People out 
there ought to know that we have three readings of bills.  The 
first reading is usually the introduction of the bill.  It seemed 
strange to me, when I first came here in 1993, that there was no 
vote on the first reading of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker gets up and asks if the minister is present.  The 
minister usually does not even rise.  The Speaker will read the 
motion or the bill then the Clerk will stand and acknowledge it. 
Then it will be said that bill is deemed to have passed, or words 
to that effect.  I see the House leader is having major problems 
with what I am saying.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has gone through the first reading stage, which is the 
stage deemed accepted without a vote.  I thought that was strange 
but I can see why.  The introduction of a bill only needs to be 
deemed to have been accepted by the House.  I can see why neither 
the government nor probably the other members would want to come 
into the House to simply vote for something that says that the 
bill will be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government introduces a bill and it is put on the 
order paper.  The bill comes up for second reading on a 
subsequent day as given by the government House leader.  Second 
reading of the bill is a discussion on the principles of the 
bill.  It is a relatively short discussion as the normal rules of 
debate limit that time.  Most of us give 10 minute speeches at 
that level.  After second reading there is a vote and the bill is 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have enjoyed my committee work.  I have had some frustrations 
there but committee work is very enjoyable and useful. Committee 
work has a lot of potential for being a really important and 
pivotal part of the democratic process, the process of producing 
bills and motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee stage, the committee does a number of things.  It 
usually gives an opportunity for people at large, whether they 
are a group, members of an association or individuals, to appear 
before the committee.  Depending upon the importance, magnitude 
or how far reaching the bill is, the number of witnesses may be 
relatively small or may be quite large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I was a member of the finance committee in the last 
parliament when it was considering Bill C-38, a bill which 
unfortunately died on the order paper.  Bill C-38 would have 
amended the way banking structures would operate.  The committee 
heard information from many interesting and informed guests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize the stages of a bill, there is first reading and 
introduction and then second reading.  After debate at second 
reading, the bill is voted on, agreed to and then referred to 
committee for members to consider at committee stage.  Before the 
bill is returned by the committee to the House, the committee 
looks at all the suggestions and presentations made by different 
people.  Committee members, utilizing not only their own skills 
but the skills of other staff and experts, may come up with 
amendments to the bill or to the motion.  There may be an 
amendment that says that we will change a section, delete a 
section or add something.  Those are amendments that come from 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee reports the bill back to the House it simply 
means that the committee has finished its process.  The bill 
comes back to the House for debate and for a vote on the 
amendments.  It is called the report stage of the bill.  At this 
stage we look at the amendments that the committee brought 
forward.  This is where the system falls down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the motion before us today is trying to kill a gnat 
with a sledgehammer.  Because the committee stage does not work 
the Liberals want to bring into the House rules and regulations 
that would prevent backbench members and opposition members from 
having an opportunity to adequately put forward their motions or 
amendments to a bill or a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this particular motion is passed, and using the clout of the 
parliamentary majority that the government has I believe it will 
pass, I predict that the motion will be subject to time 
allocation. I will talk more about that a little later on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion will prevent members of parliament from getting their 
issues on to the floor of the House.  There is a rule right now, 
and the government House leader made allusion to the fact that 
there is a standing order which prevents members in the House 
from moving amendments that were already dealt with at committee 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a committee brings back a report with proposed amendments 
that were defeated in committee, they cannot be brought in again 
in this place.  A certain argument can be made for that since 
they were already presumably dealt with in committee.  On the 
other hand, any amendments approved by the committee will be 
included in the report of the bill back to the House for the 
House to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my observation in the seven years that I have been 
here that pretty well every amendment passed in committee is 
passed there because the parliamentary secretary who sits on the 
committee brings in the information from the minister and the 
minions which says that they want the amendment.  Very often they 
are government proposed amendments and of course they pass. 
However if an opposition member puts in an amendment it is almost 
certain to fail since the committee has more Liberals on it right 
now, because the Liberals are in government, than it has other 
opposition members combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the only amendments brought in are those which have 
the approval of the minister.  His tentacles reach into the 
committee and basically control what happens there.  The Liberals 
present in the House may be howling in protest, but that is my 
observation.  That is what I have seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember proposing some amendments after my first election in 
1993.  I do not even remember now what the bill was, but I 
remember that I proposed some good amendments very early on. They 
were so good that some government members on that committee told 
me privately they were good ideas and even went so far as to say 
that they supported them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week or two later, after we heard from some more witnesses in 
committee, we came to clause by clause consideration.  For the 
benefit of those thousands of people watching CPAC today, clause 
by clause consideration is when the chairman of the committee 
simply goes through the bill and asks whether the clauses should 
pass.  Sometimes he speaks much more quickly than I was speaking 
now, but I am trying to give a little consideration to the 
interpreters who are working so hard for me this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go through the clauses very quickly.  If we have an amendment 
for which we have given notice, we must be right on the bit when 
the chairman asks whether a clause should pass. Right then we 
must jump up and say that we have an amendment. Even if we have 
given notice of it, if we do not move it right at that instant it 
will not be dealt with and the clause will have passed unamended. 
That is how that works in committee.  The last thing is whether 
the title should pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that has been dealt with, the chairman asks if the bill 
should be reported to the House.  There are also usually enough 
members in the committee to cause that to pass.  Then it is 
brought back here, and that is what we are dealing with now. The 
bill or motion is reported back to the House, having gone through 
introduction, second reading, and study and clause by clause 
consideration at committee stage.  Then the bill is back here for 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, any amendments which have been dealt with in 
committee, in order to avoid duplication, are not permitted to be 
brought up here.  Any amendments that have not been brought up in 
committee can be brought up by any member of the opposition or 
any backbencher on the government side.  The government can also 
introduce amendments at report stage in the House which have not 
been dealt with in committee. 
That would deal with last minute technical changes or things of 
which it becomes aware.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we vote on each of the amendments.  This is where the 
problem comes in.  This is where the government just has 
convolutions of hopelessness.  If we have a lot of amendments and 
if we on this side of the House force a standing vote on it, as 
opposed to just a voice vote which is called on division, then 
the government members could be literally forced to stand for 
hours, one at a time, voting against our amendments to prevent 
any amendments from going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if I can give my observation, over all the years that I 
have been here now, there have been maybe three or four 
amendments put forward by opposition members that have passed in 
the House.  I remember I had one.  It was the first one in the 
35th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  There were two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  My hon. friend over on the other side is 
indicating that there were two.  I do not remember.  It was long 
time ago and a lot of water has gone under the bridge betwixt 
then and now.  However, there have been very few.  Most of them 
are just routinely rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to the fundamentals of this.  The 
fundamental is that committee stage does not work.  That is the 
problem as I see it.  If we would have a truly independent 
committee, one that was not controlled by the minister, his 
office, his parliamentary secretary and the minions, if we had 
true freedom to express ourselves and to vote freely on proposed 
amendments, very often we could improve legislation.  It would be 
better for the country, the nation as a whole and for our 
citizens.  It would increase the respect that Canadians have for 
the House of Commons, if we could actually do that without being 
coerced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish my little digression and say how this 
bill now finishes.  After we have dealt with it in the House at 
report stage, it then goes to third and final reading.  As we 
know, that also then includes debates.  When the debate is 
finished, we vote on it.  If there are sufficient numbers 
demanding it, there can be a demand for a standing vote, in which 
case we once again all come into the House.  As we stand 
individually to express our yeas or nays, the clerk responds by 
stating our names from memory, which is quite a remarkable feat, 
and we then go on record as to whether we are in favour of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After it is passed here, it goes to the Senate and goes through 
a similar process there.  If the Senate amends it, it comes back 
here.  If the Senate does not amend it, it gets royal assent and 
goes on from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just happens that what the government House leader is doing 
today is throwing a monkey wrench into the process by claiming 
that he wants this place to be like the house of commons in Great 
Britain.  Of course he is very selective.  He is being very 
careful to make sure that he just picks those parts which will 
promote his and the government's agenda but he does not pick the 
other parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in Great Britain, it is not at all uncommon for 
opposition members to be the chairs of committees.  What do we 
have here?  We have the government coming to a committee.  It has 
been predetermined who is going to be the chairman.  The one day 
we will get a full contingent of the members of the government 
side in the committee is when they want to out vote anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have this absurd way of electing the chairman of the 
committee.  The whole issue is that usually when there is an 
election there is a list of candidates.  When I ran for election 
as a member of parliament, there were four or five candidates 
each time and people had to choose from among these different 
candidates.  There were actually more than six 
candidates on the ballot in 1993. 
There were some fringe parties there as well.  There are some who 
want to call us the fringe party.  That obviously is not true 
since we are the only party other than the Liberals that went up 
in popular vote in the 2000 election.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not elect the chairman by having a list and a ballot so we 
can check who we want.  We do this in the House of Commons. We do 
this for our elections in the ridings.  There is only one name 
permitted on the ballot.  The name on the ballot is the first 
person who yells out his or here nomination after the clerk has 
taken the chair at the organization of the committee. One of the 
government members will immediately say that he or she nominates 
this person or that person to be the chairman.  That is it.  The 
motion does not have to be seconded.  There is a vote on it.  All 
the members who are in favour say “yes” and all who are opposed 
say “no”.  There is no list of candidates.  There is no secret 
ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through this recently in the finance committee.  I made 
a very strong argument for a secret ballot in order to free up 
the members on both sides of the table to vote freely without 
fear of recrimination.  Incredibly, on command, the government 
members refused the request for a secret ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not have these members go to their constituencies at 
election time, stand up on a platform and have the people yell 
who they want to vote for?  Every vote should be public.  Why do 
they insist on it?  What is so scary about a secret ballot?  It 
is incredible that these members, who love to talk about 
parliamentary reform to make this place more meaningful, cannot 
see that a secret ballot is important and that there should be a 
list of candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the particular case of the finance committee, I said I would 
vote for the person who won.  I cannot say his name and I do not 
know the name of his riding.  The person who became the chairman 
of the finance committee had my support.  For the most part he 
has been fair, good to work with and has a good way of running 
the committee.  Sometimes he goes a little fast but most of the 
time he is okay.  I would have supported him.  I had no problem 
with that.  I do not think that is a place where we should have 
overt partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backbenchers are not prepared to free themselves up in 
committee in order to express themselves without fear of 
recrimination.  Even though they had the opportunity, they 
refused a secret ballot.  It is interesting that the request for 
a secret ballot on whether or not to vote for the chairman by 
secret ballot was refused.  That would require unanimous consent 
and it was denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the broad picture of why the motion is here 
today.  It is here because committees do not work.  The motion 
would be totally unnecessary if the government of the day, or the 
Conservatives for nine years prior to that, had done its job. 
Since the Liberals have been in power we have had two elections 
in seven years.  Running a $200 million election every three and 
a half years is a total lack of respect for taxpayer dollars. 
That is an aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that in the past seven years has just not 
been open to amendments.  We would like to see some glimmer of 
hope that some of the amendments would be given careful 
consideration, not simply given time to talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has arisen because opposition parties have used 
report stage in the House to demand standing votes on a number of 
motions to amend which are, not only in the words of the 
government House leader but also in motion before us, deemed 
frivolous.

<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Speaker will not select for debate a motion or series of 
motions of a repetitive, frivolous or vexatious nature or of a 
nature that would serve merely to prolong unnecessarily 
proceedings at the report stage— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do opposition members do this?  I think back about a year 
ago, when we were dealing with the now famous Nisga'a treaty. 
There was a lot of fuss made about it.  The government House 
leader and some of the other members of the Conservative Party 
and the NDP said it was a waste of time.  I agree with them.  We 
started on a Monday night and we finished Thursday morning.  We 
stood up and sat down for many hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of thing does not stand well in building respect for 
this place.  If all we are going to do is hit that on the head 
with a mallet to make that go away and not deal with the root 
cause is like a surgeon.  Instead of removing a wart on the hand, 
he takes an axe and cuts off the hand at the wrist.  He has 
removed the wart all right but it is overkill in a gross degree. 
That is what this motion is.  It does not deal with the root 
cause of why we in the opposition would come up with such a large 
list of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when we were dealing with Nisga'a.  I explained it to 
the people back home this way.  I said that it was an important 
agreement and that it affected the well being of natives 
basically in perpetuity from that point onward.  It also affected 
the non-native neighbours in perpetuity from that time onward 
because, among other things, it involved changes to the 
constitution.  It involved permanent changes on how we would deal 
with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong to do things like that without giving adequate time 
not only for this place to debate it, but also for us to have a 
wider debate with Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saying which states that democracy only works 
when the governed agree to be governed.  It is called the consent 
of the governed.  That is so true.  I often speak to students in 
schools and explain to them how in this country we have a system 
of government completely different from governments that have 
existed in history.  Instead of having a king with absolute 
power, his soldiers and other people who did his will and imposed 
it on the people, we have the potential for having a true circle 
of responsibility and accountability where members of parliament 
are elected by the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members come here reflecting the will and the wishes of the 
people.  They make rules that govern our society.  The people, by 
virtue of the fact that they consented to this motion or bill 
through their parliamentarian, agree to be governed by that rule. 
What happens if we break the circle of accountability?  What 
happens if along the line we impose a dictator, someone who has 
absolute authority?  The circle of accountability is broken and 
no longer can we expect Canadian citizens to willingly consent to 
be governed when they are being dictated to by somebody who is 
out of the circle of accountability.  It has to be the people, 
the parliament, the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are responsible for obeying the laws of the country which 
are put together by parliament.  However, parliament is 
accountable and responsible to the people who send us here.  If 
we lose that circle, the system is flawed and it will fail. 
I am sure one of the reasons there is now such a lack of respect 
for this place is that in total this place does not reflect the 
will of the people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now answer the question of why members of the opposition 
are bringing forward these amendments.  As I was saying, I 
explained the issue to my constituents right after we had that 
long vote.  I said that it was so important to Canadians that it 
demanded the time of parliament.  For us to give notice to the 
government that this is so important that in one way or another 
we will use one week of parliament's time, that notion is a valid 
notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first choice by far, rather than voting for three days or 
three and a half days, would have been to debate the issue here 
in the House of Commons.  We did not have adequate debate.  The 
record of the government shows that over and over it has invoked 
time allocation to limit debate after the debate has just started 
or, in some instances, even before it has started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of occasions on record where the government 
has moved time allocation on this and all subsequent stages 
before we were even at the subsequent stages.  In other words, we 
are not supposed to talk about it; we are just supposed to do it. 
The government is the bully in the schoolyard, the dictator.  It 
is out of the circle of accountability and responsibility, and 
that does not serve democracy well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel obliged to go back into the records because there was a 
very fine speech given in the House almost three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier:</B>  Never one by you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  The member says that it was not by me.  I 
will concede that it was not by me.  It was by one much greater 
than me.  It was the previous leader of the official opposition 
who spoke on an issue very similar to what we are speaking to 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the speech is already in the <I>Hansard</I> of the 
day, I want to give portions of it today.  I will read it back 
into the record because it was a very interesting story given by 
the leader of the opposition at the time, the member for Calgary 
Southwest.  This is basically what he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once upon a time there was a king named Jean I, who presided over 
a castle surrounded by a moat with a drawbridge.  The inhabitants 
of his castle were divided into two classes: lords and ladies who 
occupied the front benches of the royal throne room on state 
occasions and the peasants who occupied the backbenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day a group of peasants, or backbenchers as they were 
called, went out to toil in the fields.  As they crossed the moat 
and started down the road they passed a cave from which emerged a 
great dragon breathing fire and smoke.  The fire consumed 50 of 
the backbenchers and sent the rest scurrying back into the 
castle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When King Jean was told of this terrible tragedy he resolved to 
investigate it himself.  To help him he took along two of his 
most trusted knights.  They included Lord Bob, the keeper of the 
royal whip, and Lord Boudriavere who had once been a bus boy in 
the castle cafeteria but had risen to high rank through his 
faithful service to King Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they surveyed the scene of the tragedy they observed three 
things.  They saw the 50 fried backbenchers and said that was too 
bad.  They saw the dragon lying dead from overexertion.  They 
also noticed that the dragon's fire had ignited a seam of coal in 
the cave from which smoke continued to billow. 
Lord Bob, who was a straightforward fellow, and had been a sword 
fight referee in another life, said the obvious “The dragon is 
dead.  This is good news.  Let's go tell the backbenchers”.  But 
Lord Boudriavere, who had once been a bus boy in the castle 
cafeteria and had risen to high rank through faithful service to 
the king, said “Not so fast”.  Turning to King John he said “I 
see an opportunity here to maintain and increase our control over 
the peasants.  Let us imply, indirectly of course, that the fiery 
dragon still lives.  We can point to the smoke belching from the 
cave as evidence of this.  Let us tell the backbenchers that 
henceforth they can only go out of the castle with royal 
permission and under the supervision of myself and Lord Bob, for 
the safety and protection, of course, of themselves and the 
castle”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>King Jean thought this was a splendid idea and thus the myth of 
the fiery dragon was established.  It was used to coerce and 
control the backbenchers of the kingdom until King Jean was 
defeated in battle by a knight from the west which is another 
story I will tell on some other occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a myth in the House that lurking out there somewhere is 
the fiery dragon of the confidence convention, the erroneous 
belief studiously cultivated by the government that if a 
government bill or motion is defeated, or an opposition bill, 
motion or amendment is passed, this obliges the government to 
resign.  This myth is used to coerce government members, 
especially backbenchers, to vote for government bills and motions 
with which they and their constituents disagree and to vote 
against opposition bills, motions and amendments with which they 
substantially agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the fiery dragon of the confidence 
convention in its traditional form is dead.  The sooner the House 
officially recognizes that fact, the better for all.  It is true 
that there was a time when the rules supported the traditional 
confidence convention but that is not the current situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition then quoted from Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, which outlined our existing practice: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The determination of the issue of confidence in the government is 
not a question of procedure or order, and does not involve the 
interpretive responsibilities of the Speaker. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop reading from his speech, but he goes on to point out 
that the use of confidence is totally a tool of the government 
and that it is not for the Speaker of the House to determine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to talk about this because it is very important to the 
motion today.  We are being told that because the government 
controls the committees no amendments can be dealt with 
rationally, reasonably and honestly there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As opposition members we have all had the experience of deciding 
not to bring up an amendment in committee because we know that 
the government will defeat it and no one will even know about it. 
We decide rationally to bring it in at report stage so that at 
least we can get a bit of debate on it and make our point to the 
people of Canada, who usually pay more attention to this place 
than they do to committees in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Leader of the Opposition was talking about when 
he spoke about the dragon of confidence.  He was referring to the 
fact that if government members should somehow vote for a bill or 
a motion or an amendment that came from the opposition side, it 
would necessitate calling an election.  That has been one of the 
huge frustrations to me over the years in this place.  We can be 
voting on anything, whereas what we are really voting on every 
time is whether there will be an election.  It does not matter 
what the issue is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Backbenchers on the government side, currently the Liberals but 
whatever party is in power, have their hands tied.  They cannot 
vote against a bad motion or for a good motion if one or the 
other of them has come from the wrong side of the House.  That is 
a huge handicap to our effectiveness in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me relate to members that in my previous life, among other 
things, I was involved in a lot of voluntary work.  For seven 
years I was the chairman of a school board. 
We had about 15 or 20 members on the school board.  It was a very 
interesting and democratic place.  Most of the people on the 
board were parents of the children in our school.  They were 
there to represent the wishes of their children and also the 
well-being of the school.  As the chairman for seven years it 
gave me the opportunity to serve the people of my community.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been thinking about this in retrospect now that I have 
been here for seven years.  I spent seven years on the school 
board and I have spent seven years here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the seven years I was on the school board I have no idea how 
many motions were defeated.  Maybe a parent, a teacher or a 
student would come up with an idea and one of the board members 
would pick up on it and take it to the board.  To adhere to 
<I>Roberts Rules of Order</I>, I had a little rule that we would 
not discuss things until there was a motion.  If someone was 
willing to make a motion and someone was willing to second it we 
would start debating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say a motion was made and we would start debating it. One 
or two members would speak in favour of it because on the surface 
it sounded like a good idea.  Then one of the people on the board 
would wonder what would happen if we passed it.  He would begin 
thinking about the law of unintended consequences and, even 
though our intentions may have been good, that something 
detrimental could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member may think of another reason the motion should not 
be adopted.  In about 10 or 15 minutes of debate on the issue our 
board would clearly develop a consensus that the motion would be 
good for our school, our students, our staff, our parents and 
maybe the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens?  Well, I am the chairman.  When the debate is 
finished and everyone has had their say, I would call for a vote. 
Only one person would vote for the motion:  the guy who made it, 
because he somehow feels obliged to.  The other 14 or 15 members 
vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have effectively done exactly what parliamentarians are 
supposed to do.  They are supposed to pass good laws and to 
prevent bad laws from being passed.  Here was a motion that was 
bad, and in our wisdom we were able to detect that and defeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did I, as chairman of the board, ask the board members not to 
vote against the motion because one of our guys made it and if we 
defeat it we will have to resign and call for the election of a 
new school board? It would be the height of stupidity if a 
school board acted like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a motion we debate the motion.  When the vote is 
called we vote on the motion.  If the motion is good we pass it 
and go to the next item of business.  If the motion is bad, dumb 
or stupid we defeat it.  We congratulate ourselves for having 
defeated a motion that should never have been brought in and we 
go on to the next order of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do in this place?  There is a motion in front of the 
House to amend a bill.  A lot of members think the amendment will 
improve it.  We have motions that sometimes stand alone as very 
good motions but they come from this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are members on the other side free to vote for it because it is 
a good idea?  Are they free to vote for it because I and some of 
my members were able to articulate a solid argument in favour of 
the idea?  No.  The Prime Minister tells them that this is a 
confidence motion.  There is the dragon.  He tells them that if 
they vote for it and the government falls, an election will 
have to be called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While those of us on this side are proposing a motion that would 
be good for Canada and for its people, the other side is voting 
on whether we should have an election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder it is totally dysfunctional.  No wonder government 
members must now bring in a mallet to beat down the gnat.  They 
cannot get it into their heads that the changes were necessary 
considerably previous to the issue that is before the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not whether the House does not work in report stage.  It 
is because we are not able to deal honestly, openly and 
forthrightly with amendments in committee with free votes.  That 
is really the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a distress to me to have to deal with issues like 
this one over the last seven years, but I am not the only one.  I 
have observed that other members have had the same frustrations 
and difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, our House leader, who recently gave a very 
important speech about invoking closure, made an appeal to the 
Speaker not to allow time allocation because sufficient time had 
not been given.  In that particular case the issue was not 
allowed.  The vote went forward and it proceeded anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I and other members of the opposition, 
including the Liberals when they were in opposition, have had 
frustrations over the years with the problems that arise from a 
dysfunctional parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote some important comments on the topic of 
closure.  That is really what we are talking about here.  We are 
talking about the way we deal with parliamentary debates.  When 
the Liberals were in opposition and closure was proposed, it was 
one Lloyd Axworthy, whose name we can now say since he is no 
longer a member of the House, who said “It displays the utter 
disdain with which this government treats the Canadian people”. 
That is how he spoke about not being able to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My whole thesis today is that the motion is necessary because we 
are not permitted to debate or to have free votes in committee. 
We are not permitted to debate and to have free votes in the 
House to get the best rules.  What do we do then if there is a 
detrimental and negative bill or a motion before the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small group of people make the decisions.  They do not even 
hear the arguments.  They are busy in their offices while we are 
discussing these bills and motions. They just blindly and 
bullheadedly push forward and say that it will go through the way 
it was first devised, no ifs, ands or buts.  They say that if we 
do not vote for it they will have to call an election.  It is 
total control and total lack of respect for parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person who is now the government House leader said in 1992 
that he was shocked.  He said it was just terrible.  He said 
“Shame on those Tories across the way”.  That is when the now 
government House leader was sitting on this side in opposition. 
He was speaking to members of the Tory government on the other 
side.  They were trying to talk about a major piece of 
legislation and they would not let them talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of other quotes which are available in 
<I>Hansard</I>.  I have a quotation from a person whose name I 
will not mention.  How do I identify this person? I will be 
brutal.  He is the present Speaker of the House.  We all remember 
him fondly.  When our present Speaker was a member on the 
government's side he had a way of giving some really great 
oratorical diatribes against the party on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who have been here since 1993 remember when he used 
to read from the little green book of quotations or something 
like that.  He had so much fun with that.  We are very glad that 
he has now progressed to a high degree of impartiality and has 
taken on the job of the Speaker as an impartial judge of how 
things are done here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of his quotes.  I quote him simply because he is 
an honourable, respectable member, who spoke of the limitations 
of the freedoms of members of parliament to adequately debate 
when he was on this side.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is an absolute scandal in terms of the 
government's unwillingness to listen to the representatives of 
the people in the House.  Never before has the government been so 
reluctant to engage in public debate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point exactly.  We chose to have four days of stand 
up votes because we said to the government that this issue was so 
important that one way or another we would be spending a week of 
parliament on it.  It should have been more but we would be 
spending at least a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government did not comply and allow us to talk, we would 
be doing this.  The advance notice was given.  It was the 
government leader who made the decision for us to stand up on 
four days of standing and sitting down.  Then he has the audacity 
to stand on the other side and say we are wasting time. The same 
time could have been used for debates if he would have permitted 
it but he chose not to do so.  No wonder we are where we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also need to say something else about the debate.  The debate 
is not only about parliament, the place of speaking and the place 
of many words.  I guess I am guilty of many words today. Actually 
I do not think I am guilty of anything.  I am merely 
participating in that rare occasion when I am not limited to 10, 
20 or 40 minutes and can actually speak my mind.  Today I am 
doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to my earlier statement about the consent of the 
government.  It is important when we deal with issues that are 
important to the country like the Nisga'a agreement and others 
that we give time in the House to debate them.  Then we could 
give time to our parliamentarians to go back to their ridings to 
discuss the issues with the people we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unconscionable that we should rush head long into some of 
these agreements, treaties and other matters without bringing the 
people together.  We do not achieve unity or harmony by simply 
taking these people who presumably are feuding and bumping their 
heads together.  No, we get them talking to each other and 
compromising.  We get them to talk and work out the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of some of the issues that have been brought to the 
House of Commons through our people out in the field via our 
members of parliament, it is really too bad that we do not have 
the opportunity to debate those issues, to persuade our fellow 
parliamentarians and to allow them the opportunity to respond to 
a rational argument rather than just an emotional response 
because we are on the wrong side or a response of blind obedience 
to a party system which is no longer a workable model in modern 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we start to look at what it means to have a 
representative in parliament.  If members of parliament come here 
and have their hands totally tied and duct tape over their 
mouths, what is the point of sending them here?  We could save 
money.  Let us have a king over there that rules the land and 
forget about having a parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  We already do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  We already do.  The Prime Minister was in 
China.  I do not know what Liberal members think about it, but I 
was incensed when it was reported that he said he would like to 
have stone statues in parliament because they could stand up and 
vote.  He could set the statues in place of the chairs and they 
would be standing all the time.  He thinks that would be a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a Liberal member of parliament and my leader said that 
I probably would not criticize him publicly, but I would take him 
aside and ask him if that was really the way he felt about me. If 
that is the way he feels I would wonder why I joined his party, 
why I ran under this platform and label, and why I even came 
here.  According to his philosophy of parliament I would be 
totally useless. 
That is how I would respond, and I would talk to him privately 
about that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the government's approach to legislating is a 
disgrace.  It cuts back the time the House is available to sit 
and then it applies closure to cut off the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if anyone in the House has noticed, but the 
government has very seldom invoked closure.  Instead, it uses the 
clause in the standing orders called time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose that in the House just as the Canadian flag is a prop 
so too are the standing orders.  I have to keep them hidden but I 
have the standing orders on time allocation and closure.  Mr. 
Speaker, you are very familiar with them, but perhaps some of the 
thousands of listeners out there in CPAC world are not.  I will 
give a very brief description on the difference between closure 
and time allocation and why the government has chosen time 
allocation over and above closure about 99% of the time.  I think 
we may have had a couple of closures, but it has almost always 
been time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference between time allocation and closure is simply 
that under closure, the motion is that the House do not adjourn 
until the debate collapses.  That is basically it.  We have in 
the House 301 members of parliament.  Under closure, 
theoretically, members could stand up one after the other and 
keep on talking and we could debate.  Instead of standing up and 
voting during all hours of the night, to the next morning, to the 
next noon, to the next evening and right through the night, we 
could actually be debating at those times.  That is what closure 
is as I understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is time allocation?  Time allocation says that no more than 
one sitting day be allocated, and that is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My understanding is that we are only debating this until 
2 o'clock.  I wonder whether the member who is so against closure 
is imposing his own kind of closure on members of other parties 
by going on so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Respectfully, the intervention by the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona is not a point of order and 
certainly the member for Elk Island has unlimited time as the 
rules are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I recognize that and I think we 
should debate this longer.  I do not think we should quit at 2 
o'clock today.  It is up to the government to bring this back and 
then everybody will have their say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is such an important issue that I think I am well within my 
means to debate.  It is the first time in my whole career that I 
have been able to speak without a time limit.  I do not mean to 
take it out on my other colleagues, especially those on this side 
of the House but also on the other side.  If any of them want to 
speak, I would urge them to make sure that the House leader 
brings this issue to the House again.  Let us debate it.  Let us 
have the procedure and house affairs committee debate these 
things and get down to the root of the cause and not deal with 
how we can handle the hammer here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to deal with these issues in a 
rational way.  Instead of the government allowing debates and 
free votes in committee and debates and free votes here, which 
would solve the problem, it is saying that it will not permit us 
to bring in amendments that it thinks are frivolous. In other 
words, if the only purpose of it is to try to draw the attention 
of the public to the issue, then that is not a proper use of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to disagree with the government.  If we had not done 
what we did on the Nisga'a agreement there would not have been as 
many people informed about the issues as there are now. It did 
serve a purpose, albeit a secondary purpose, because the primary 
purpose was totally derailed by the government House leader and a 
government that would not listen to our reasoned debates.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear occasionally from the other side that we on this side 
are obstructionists.  I know the words have been applied to Bloc 
members.  They are called obstructionists when they want to 
discuss the Young Offenders Act.  We have been labelled that way 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the people listening to know and I want all members here 
to know that we are a responsible official opposition.  We oppose 
things which we believe need opposing.  We stand in favour of 
things which we think should be supported.  I am not sure about 
this, but I think the present official opposition is unique in 
that it has voted for more government bills and motions than 
other oppositions before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have supported around 50% of government measures.  I am 
talking, for example, about Bill C-8, the new bank bill. 
Primarily we support it.  There are some small areas where we 
wish there would be some amendments, but we are not an opposition 
that is here merely for the sake of being in opposition.  We want 
to be and we are a constructive opposition pointing out to the 
government where motions need correction and offering positive 
solutions for correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were a free vote over there and we failed to persuade 
them intellectually or by debate or parley, and they voted 
against it, I would say that I guess we lost that battle. However 
if I am able to persuade them and they say to me individually 
that they are persuaded but then vote against it, I am 
frustrated.  I feel the purpose of parliament is being thwarted 
by that kind of basic philosophy of the way parliament works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot to say.  I do not feel like ending.  I know that I 
have spoken about an hour now.  Whereas some other members would 
have to stop for a lunch break, since I have a reasonable bank 
account on which to draw I do not really need to do that. It is 
only 1.30 p.m. so I think I will just say a few more things which 
are on my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out something of greatest importance.  How do I 
say this without it coming back to me?  I do not like to use the 
word arrogant because when we call someone arrogant somehow just 
saying it reflects back on us.  I do not mean it as a pejorative 
term.  I use the word arrogant to describe government members in 
the sense that they are isolating themselves from the people and 
discounting the necessity of being responsible to the people who 
sent them here.  They do not believe in the basic elements of 
democracy and of representative government.  That is the whole 
reason for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could very frankly summarize what I have been trying to say 
in the last little while, I would put it this way:  A mallet is 
being used to kill a microscopic gnat because we are not willing 
to look at the source of the gnat.  The source is that the 
government will not permit true, open, free debate and votes, 
especially in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees should have the freedom to work through a bill or a 
motion and to improve it on behalf of Canadians.  If by debate I 
can persuade my fellow members, I am incensed that the system 
here prevents them from supporting it with their vote.  I really 
am.  That needs to be corrected.  That is the nub of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government has used time allocation in the 
House over 70 times now.  It is a record breaker.  The government 
uses it routinely.  As I said earlier, it brings in time 
allocation before a stage of a bill has even been introduced.  It 
announces time allocation in advance so it can do it on the first 
day. 
I use the word arrogance in an intellectual meaning, not a 
pejorative meaning, when it ignores the rights of 
parliamentarians to debate the issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal minister of public works agrees with the principle 
of the amendment.  He recommended in the 81st report of the House 
management committee in 1993 a change to the standing orders.  I 
am talking about our present minister of public works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He supported the motion recommending that time allocation and 
closure motions could be moved unless it appeared to the Speaker 
that such motions were an abuse of the standing orders of the 
House or an infringement of the rights of the minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the actual amendment which was read into the 
record earlier, and much to the joy of my colleagues I will not 
read it again, basically it says that if we use a means that is 
available to make our voices heard when the government in its 
arrogance will not hear, then the Speaker, according to the 
government House leader, will have the ability to disallow the 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the position of the Chair of this place to ensure that 
parliamentarians have the opportunity to represent their 
constituents in vote and in debate.  The task of the Speaker is 
being changed by the motion.  That will bring the Speaker into 
the realm of the government side to control the debate further 
than it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the minister of public works supported the motion, with 
this provision: “unless it shall appear to the Chair that such 
motion is an abuse of the rules of the House, or an infringement 
of the rights of the minority”.  It is the job of the Speaker to 
ensure that members of the opposition have their full rights in 
this place to represent their constituents and like-minded 
constituents across the country who perhaps do not have a member 
of the opposition in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get thousands of letters from people across the country who 
write to the official opposition because the government is doing 
things that they believe are wrong.  They want us to draw 
attention to those things and to correct them.  We represent 
those people as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government invokes time allocation on the legislation and 
we are forced to stop speaking to it, the people of the country 
will be ill served by this motion.  I appeal to all Liberal 
members sitting in their places, real or imaginary, to think 
carefully when they vote.  Undoubtedly they will be told by the 
Prime Minister and his minions that it is a confidence vote.  He 
will tell them that an election will be required if it is not 
passed.  I assure those members that is garbage.  It is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let them think the issue through.  Let them vote with their 
conscience.  Let them vote with their heads.  Let them vote 
freely.  Let them throw off the shackles that have prevented them

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not 
like to be in your shoes at this moment, but even more so after 
the government motion is adopted by the House, because this 
motion will presumably be adopted quite swiftly given the large 
number of members the government can count on. This is the whole 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the government leader, who said that we are going 
to import from the British parliament an interesting feature for 
the conduct of our debates. To begin with, I would like to 
explain that, unless we want this parliament to end up looking 
like a circus, we cannot picked out rules here and there in 
other parliaments and other standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must understand that the standing orders governing the 
debates of the House of Commons, be it here or in another 
parliament, are a set of rules which, taken individually, 
probably do not make much sense, but if taken as a whole 
complete one another. They allow us to preserve what has to be 
preserved in a parliamentary system, namely a fair distribution 
of powers and the capacity to influence the decisions brought to 
the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personally warned the government leader about the danger 
of upsetting a balance which is already too fragile in this 
parliament. I warned him about the danger of weakening even more 
the power relationship between opposition members and government 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we absolutely want to bring Canadians to the conclusion 
that it is no longer useful to elect members to parliament, 
unless this is our goal, we must not upset the balance between 
parliamentarians. Most of all, we must not change the rules a 
piece at a time, thinking that small changes here and there will 
have no consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary rules and the functioning of this House are 
like a huge block set or a house of cards. It works. It may even 
be pleasant to look at in some ways; it can be artistic. 
Changing a single piece in the middle of the structure can only 
result in the collapse of the whole structure. Such are the 
rules of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, this sounds simple, very simple. The government House 
leader's motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage and, in 
exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be guided 
by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the United 
Kingdom. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who reads that or who is listening to us today must 
wonder who could be against the Speaker having the right to 
exclude repetitive, frivolous and vexatious motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second question comes to mind. This would give a great deal of 
power to the Speaker of the House, whose responsibility is to 
ensure that all members, particularly those who do not benefit 
from the protection of the governing party, get to express 
themselves, to express the opinion of their constituents and to 
influence the debates that we have in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a frivolous amendment, in the opinion of the Speaker of 
the House of Commons? Can we say today that all the Speakers, 
Deputy Speakers and all those who occupy the chair will use the 
same arguments to say that an amendment is frivolous? How many 
amendments among the 200 that were moved by the government on 
its young offenders bill will be judged frivolous? Can we say 
instead that it is the government that is frivolous because it 
did not present a well thought out bill in the House, a bill 
that respects the rules and the will of the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If by moving 200 amendments we are accused of trying to hold 
up debate, of using delaying tactics, I want to say today, and 
the people must know this, that the Government of Canada is its 
own worst enemy. It is using its own delaying tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it does so is this: the government is targeting only 
amendments moved by the opposition. It is clear that in today's 
motion, the government House leader has not thought for one 
minute that that the Chair would rule that 25, 50, or 75 
amendments, among the 200 it moved to amend its own bill, were 
frivolous amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the government House leader would have an 
absolute fit if the Chair said that a government amendment was 
frivolous and used only as a delaying tactic. It is only the 
amendments moved by the members of the opposition that are at 
issue here, therefore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we about to acknowledge that only the Liberals in this House 
can come up with well thought out motions? Is everything coming 
out of the Alliance, the Bloc, the NDP or the Conservatives 
frivolous or of a nature that would serve merely to filibuster? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members stand up to defend the youth justice system in 
force in Quebec, because that system has been yielding 
incredible and outstanding results, well above those in the rest 
of Canada. Is the Bloc frivolous? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in Quebec, whether they are Liberal, Bloc or 
Conservative, agrees that the system is in jeopardy. Is it 
frivolous for the Bloc to defend that system? Is it frivolous to 
bring forward amendments to a bill that was flawed right from 
the beginning and completely out of touch with reality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time has proven us right, because the work of the Bloc 
Quebecois, especially the amendments brought forward by my hon. 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm, got the government to 
reconsider and bring more than 200 changes to its bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what they want to avoid. The government does not 
want to relive that situation. The opinion of the opposition is 
no longer significant. It is frivolous. Our debates are 
frivolous. My colleague from the government has unfortunately 
said more than once that the time we use in parliament to debate 
such frivolous issues in his view and to vote for hours on end on 
all kinds of amendments costs $27,000 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suggestion to make. 
If he really wants to save money, he should eliminate the other 
House, which costs $50 million a year.  That would be a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B>  We could use the money for more useful 
things such as giving the right to speak to those who represent 
the public, who were democratically elected on the strength of 
political platforms and who have something to say.  As far as 
the $27,000 an hour argument is concerned, I suggest that the 
leader of the government first abolish the other House where 
nobody is elected and where members only represent themselves or 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation motions were first introduced in the House of 
Commons in 1971.  At that time, the government said that they 
would only be used exceptionally, on occasion, that they would 
simplify the procedure, allow the government to govern and keep 
the opposition from stopping government initiatives 
thoughtlessly.  Although rarely, there would be times when the 
government would resort to time allocation motions. 
Unfortunately, things have evolved and the leader is an expert 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1984 to 1993, under the Tory government, there were 49 time 
allocation motions in the House, and a total of 519 bills. 
These are the real statistics; I did not invent them, they are 
the figures of the House of commons.  These 49 gag orders were 
all vehemently condemned and the opposition of the day gave some 
solid arguments against them, but that opposition is now our 
government and now it resorts to gag orders.  Therefore, under 
the Tories, we had 49 gag orders for a total of 519 bills; that 
means 9.4%. During the Tory regime, over a seven-year period, 
9.4% of bills ended with a gag order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this government presented over 60 closure motions in the 
case of some 350 bills introduced in the House, a ratio of 
17.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives in the previous government were criticized for 
being undemocratic, because 9.4% of parliamentary initiatives 
ended through closure.  The figure for the current government of 
17.4% is nearly double that.  It is a cause for some concern 
when the government to all intents and purposes doubles the 
number of closure motions in order to settle bills and debates 
in the House and when this same government today wants to 
prevent the opposition from introducing amendments or at least 
to give the Speaker the right to decide whether an amendment is 
valid or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I contend that this government is trying to 
transfer to you the responsibility that is ours here, namely 
that of voting on and deciding at some point whether what has 
been submitted to parliament is valid or not, must be selected 
or rejected, especially in the context of the passage of a bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never agree to let the Speaker of the House assume the 
power given its members by their electors to express their 
points of view, exercise their judgement and decide whether an 
amendment or a bill should be approved or rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never agree to let the Speaker of the House of Commons 
be invested with such power by the government, not because the 
Speaker wants this power, but because the government in its 
laxity wants to divest itself of its responsibilities by giving 
the Chair the duty and obligation to impose closure on the 
members of the opposition, on amendments and on debates in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, when the debate was going on, my colleague told me that 
in today's parliament our debates are merely a way of passing 
time until it is time to pass a bill. This is a far cry from 
what parliament was at the beginning. We are passing time until 
the bill is passed. It is indeed how things now work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is far from those great debates when openness and human 
intelligence prevailed in this House, when the government would 
listen to the opposition, including third parties, express its 
views as to how things could be done. This is far from the days 
when people truly believed that they were mandating members to 
represent them here and work in their best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, all too often, government orders are initiated by teams of 
public servants who are out of touch with reality and they are 
sponsored by ministers who lack independent thought. Bills are 
introduced in this House, but the government does not want 
openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice should have shown some openness toward 
the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, who proposed very 
significant and interesting amendments to improve this bill, a 
bill drafted behind closed doors by the minister's officials. 
But no. As is the case with all the debates, the Minister of 
Justice listened to us, but it was difficult for her to do so. 
It was already taking too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the debates are just a way of using up the time 
while waiting for the government to pass its bills, it has 
become too much to bear. It is hard for the minister to have to 
listen day after day to opposition members using strong 
arguments and logic to show that her bill is not a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely difficult, but the government has reached the 
point where it does not even want to assume its responsibility 
to listen to the representatives of those who did not elect a 
Liberal candidate, but a candidate from the Bloc Quebecois, the 
Canadian Alliance, the NDP or the Progressive Conservative 
Party.

resort to serious violent crime in order to cope.  Such an excuse 
is an insult.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Amodeo is an alleged hit man and he is on Interpol's most

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

than just visiting.  It is very clear that Mr. Amodeo's wife 
approached the public works minister to get assistance with the 
visa application in spite of the fact she is not a constituent of 
his.  The issue could not have been language because in Mrs. 
Amodeo's constituency, which is different from that of the public 
works minister, those particular services are offered in Italian 
by that member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was it and why was it that Mrs. Amodeo felt she could get

</I></B></P><P align=left>He should also know that before anyone is granted permanent 
residence status in Canada, if he or she applies to the province 
of Quebec as an independent immigrant, under the Canada-Quebec 
accord Quebec must issue a selection document. That was done in 
this case.  The processing time was the average processing time 
for visa posts around the world.  There was nothing that was done

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

about the status of a file with Immigration Canada on behalf of 
a citizen of the riding.  The letter clearly requests that a 
visa be, and I quote, “issued shortly”.

to discover what stage the permanent residence file has reached 
with the federal government, I know that the CSQ is valid until 
June 2000 and that the visitor's visa is valid until 2001. Have 
the audits come in?  And what about the medical results?  Do you

application was fast tracked after the letter was written.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

someone who is on Interpol's 500 most wanted list turns out to 
have been in our country since 1998.  Apparently the minister of 
immigration knew nothing about this.  Canadians are a little 
worried about how these crime figures could be given safe haven 
in our country and apparently our officials are ignorant of their 
whereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to explain to Canadians why on earth this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  He will know that 
the Business Development Bank of Canada Act came into force on 
July 13, 1995.  It requires the designated minister to review the 
provisions and operations of the act in consultation with the 
Minister of Finance within five years. 
According to the law, that review should have started last July, 
seven months ago.  A report has to be submitted to parliament no 
later than this July.

started the review?

<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me try something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the president of the Business Development Bank was 
stripped of his power respecting loans, he had recommended that 
the bank consider calling the loan of the Auberge Grand-Mère, 
which at that time was a loan in default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell the House—and I am sure it 
has been discussed in cabinet—did the Prime Minister know of 
that recommendation by Mr. Beaudoin to call the loan before the 
president's powers were changed?  Did the Prime Minister know in 
advance of the action by the board of the intention of the board 
to strip the president of his normal authority respecting loans? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will get the hon. member a detailed answer to his 
question, but does he know that Mr. Beaudoin is the subject of a 
counterclaim in the pending court case, because the auditor 
general found that Mr. Beaudoin inflated his pension by some half 
a million dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the hon. member basing his questions on something as 
contentious as the comments of Mr. Beaudoin? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, speaking of the Business Development Bank, on April 
21, 1997, Yvon Duhaime wrote the Prime Minister begging for help 
with the Business Development Bank loan, one which it had 
recommended against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have obtained documents today that show that on May 6, 1997, 
the HRD said that funding was assured from the Business 
Development Bank.  That is lightning speed.  That is just a 
matter of days.  It had already been recommended that this loan 
not be complied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, how did it happen that through the maze of 
bureaucracy this loan found its way through and was assured in a 
matter of days at lightning speed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not accept the premise of my hon. friend's question 
that the loan went through with lightning speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been informed, however, that this loan was approved and 
participated in by the local caisse populaire and the Fonds des 
travailleurs du Quebec, both bodies not connected with the 
federal government nor with the Prime Minister, and their 
judgment was that the loan was a valid commercial transaction. 
She ought to take that into account before raising the kinds of 
empty questions she does whenever she has a chance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me quote from the actual document.  It says: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding is provided by the Business Development Bank of Canada. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems pretty clear that the funding is assured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it was during an election time and the Prime 
Minister was in the political fight of his life.  He was not only 
trying to retain his seat during that time, he was trying to 
retain the financial shares that he had in the neighbouring golf 
course of the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is very simple.  Why was the Prime Minister 
interfering with the business of a crown corporation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member, who I commend for her French, did not 
make clear what she was quoting from.  She should do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor found that the Prime Minister was not 
interfering with the work of a crown corporation.  He was doing 
no more than what members on all sides of the House do, making 
enquiries and making representations on behalf of a constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member thinks that is wrong, then I think she ought 
to make a fresh start on learning her duties as a member of 
parliament.

not need visas to come in or out of Canada.  I am a little 
puzzled about this since Mr. Amodeo was in Canada on a tourist 
visa and his wife was in Canada on a visitor's visa.  Clearly 
they did have visas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to explain that and also tell the

our borders wide open?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

uninformed.  In fact, there are some countries in the world where 
visitors visas are required and where security checks are done 
before those visas are issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is commonly known that for Americans, western 
Europeans and many countries in the world there is no requirement 
for a visitor's visa before someone enters Canada. Similarly, we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

get this information out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question for the minister.  Is Italy one of the 
European countries from which its citizens can come in and out of

check at all on people coming in and out of our country?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

important for the member to know and to understand, most of 
western Europe, including France, Germany, Italy and most of the 
other western European countries, although I will not take the 
time to name them all, their citizens can enter Canada without a 
visitor's visa.

complaint that has yet to be heard some six months later and 
could result in permanent protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, Air Canada wants protection from the big, bad

<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

apply to Quebec then he or she must receive a selection 
certificate called a CSQ from the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government maintains the statutory requirements,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

would ask her how someone on Interpol's 500 most wanted list got 
a visitor's visa to Canada in 1998 and is still in the country.

uninformed is that when individuals from certain countries, 
including western Europe, Italy, France and others, arrive at our 
ports of entry their passports are stamped.  That is their visa. 
They do not have to apply for it in advance.  They do not have to 
satisfy anyone except the port of entry official as to their 
reason for being in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-284, an act to amend the Criminal Code (offences 
by corporations, directors and officers). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, prior to the last election and just 
prior to the summer break, the House and all parliamentarians 
supported the move for the government to introduce legislation to 
address the issue of corporate manslaughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few Canadians are not aware of the situation that took 
place in Westray a number of years ago in which 26 miners were 
killed when there was no question whatsoever that it was through 
the negligence and disregard of their managers, corporation and 
workplace inspectors as well as governments in general to ensure 
that there was a safe workplace.  Safe practices were not 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Richard at that time said that the government needed to 
bring forth legislation to hold those corporations accountable 
for criminal negligence.  He also said that the corporations and 
corporation management should be charged and held accountable in 
a criminal court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would do what the government has neglected to do.  The 
Liberals made a promise before the election and assured us that 
this would happen, but the minister has given no indication that 
she intends to address this issue now.  Therefore, this private 
member's bill will once again give parliamentarians the option of 
voting on the bill.

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have the pleasure to introduce three petitions today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition seeks and calls upon parliament to repeal 
section 43 of the criminal code which is a very antiquated 
section that has been determined as a legal approval of violence 
against children. It is very contrary to our children's 
fundamental rights to security of the person as outlined by our 
charter of rights and freedoms and the UN convention on the 
rights of the child.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition was signed by a number of petitioners who are 
very concerned about the high cost on individuals and communities 
of not being able to find adequate treatment and responses for 
those in our society who face addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition calls on all members of government to work together 
to provide what we call treatment on demand to ensure that there 
are adequate resources for those who are faced with this terrible 
situation.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CHILD POVERTY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
third petition was signed by people in Canada who are very 
concerned about growing child poverty in our country, and the 
fact that parliament has not been able to fulfil its obligation 
put forward by Mr. Ed Broadbent in 1989 that the House of Commons 
should end child poverty by the year 2000.  The situation is 
worsening.  The petitioners call on parliament to provide the 
resources and attention to eliminate child poverty in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have the pleasure of presenting a petition on an issue that is 
important to all of us.  We all recognize that in this era of 
divorce there can be custody battles for children with respect to 
the parents.  However, we sometimes lose touch with the fact that 
this also affects grandparents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a petition to present which asks the government to amend 
the Divorce Act to allow access for grandparents to their 
grandchildren when there are divorce proceedings.  This is a very 
serious issue and I hope the government will take it as such.

<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to present a petition signed by a 
number of constituents and other residents of Winnipeg, Manitoba 
who are very concerned about the state of our health care system. 
They have signed a petition calling on the government to make 
health care a priority and to take the necessary actions to 
preserve our public health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners believe that the federal Liberals actually 
opened the door to two tier American style health care in Canada. 
They would like to see the government redress that situation and 
take meaningful steps to stop the slide toward privatization and 
for profit hospitals and clinics in Canada today.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT

<A NAME="LINK200">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-11, an act respecting immigration to 
Canada and the granting of refugee protection to persons who are 
displaced, persecuted or in danger, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present Bill C-11, the 
immigration and refugee protection act to the House for second 
reading.  When the business of the House came to a close because 
of the election call, the progress of Bill C-31, the previous 
immigration and refugee protection act that I introduced in the 
House last spring, was of course brought to a halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time however has given me the opportunity to review in 
detail the many discussions that ensued and the many submissions 
which were received subsequent to the introduction of the 
previous bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT53"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT53"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the time has given me the opportunity to consider 
carefully what Canadians were saying about the bill, both in its 
broad orientation as well as in specific detail.  I can say I was 
pleased to note that Canadians were generally quite supportive of 
the previous bill known as Bill C-31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also expressed a few concerns. I am happy to say that I 
have addressed many of those concerns and the issues that were 
expressed.  In Bill C-11 we have addressed what I believe were 
the most serious of those concerns.  I have incorporated a number 
of recent proposals and I will describe those momentarily.  I 
want to be clear that Bill C-11 maintains the core principles and 
the provisions of the previous bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important legislation, legislation which will be of 
great benefit to the country.  The reason why is quite simple. By 
saying “no” more quickly to those who would abuse our rules, we 
will be able to say “yes” more often to those immigrants and 
refugees who Canada will need to grow and prosper in the years 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new legislation flows from four years of consultation.  We 
had consultation with our constitutional partners in immigration 
matters, the provinces and the territories and with others 
interested in immigration matters.  Those consultations have been 
both substantive as well as extensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have been quick to point out that we will only be 
able to increase our overall immigration levels, as the 
government is committed to, if we are prepared to improve our 
ability to absorb and to integrate those increased numbers.  I 
understand and I accept this completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also consulted wisely, widely and substantially with 
many non-governmental groups and others involved in the business 
of settlement services for immigrants and refugees.  I have met 
with Canadians, with permanent residents, with those who have 
been here for generations and with those who are newcomers.  We 
have consulted as well with business leaders about the need for 
skilled workers.  We have worked out innovative new ways to see 
that highly skilled workers on the move around the world will 
identify Canada as their destination of choice, our communities, 
our culture and our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy has benefited enormously from immigration in the 
past.  The evidence is seen all around us.  We must continue to 
welcome new arrivals so that Canada will continue to grow and 
prosper and continue to be recognized in the years ahead as the 
best place in the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we know that Canada is increasingly being challenged 
by other countries that are competing for the world's best and 
brightest who are seeking opportunities abroad.  This competition 
will only grow more intense in the years ahead as more countries 
desire the benefits of immigration and experience the demographic 
changes that I believe and I know most western countries are 
facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new century will belong to those who are best able to 
develop and expand their collective human capital.  The knowledge 
based economy has become a reality.  If Canada is to compete and 
succeed, we must continue to attract skilled workers from across 
the globe, to share their knowledge and their skills and to build 
bridges with the rest of the world.  This means attracting not 
just skilled and hardworking individuals, it means reuniting them 
with their families as quickly as possible and welcoming them 
into the Canadian family.  It means honouring our proud 
humanitarian tradition which begins with our commitment to 
provide safe haven to those in genuine need of our protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent Speech from the Throne the government committed to 
modernizing and streamlining Canada's immigration and refugee 
protection systems.  With Bill C-11, we are doing it.  The bill 
simplifies the current Immigration Act.  It enhances the safety 
and security of Canadians and of Canada's borders.  It 
strengthens our ability to attract the immigrants we need and 
reaffirms our traditional openness to newcomers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it provides us with all that we need to fulfill our 
dual mandate, which is to close the back door to those who would 
abuse our generosity and not obey our rules, so that we can open 
the front door wider to the immigrants and refugees like those 
who came before them, who came here to build this wonderful 
country.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will enable us to meet the challenges and take 
advantage of the enormous opportunities that the new century 
holds for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 remains a tough bill.  However, I want to emphasize 
that it is tough on criminal abuse of our immigration and refugee 
protection systems.  The bill creates severe new penalties for 
people smugglers and for those caught trafficking in humans. 
These are deplorable activities.  There will be fines of up to $1 
million and sentences of up to life in prison for persons 
convicted of smuggling and trafficking in humans.  It will also 
allow our courts to order the forfeiture of money and other 
property seized from traffickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill clarifies our existing grounds for detention and our 
criteria for inadmissibility to Canada.  It provides immigration 
enforcement officers with the tools they need to see that serious 
criminals, threats to national security, violators of human 
rights, participants in organized crime and members of terrorist 
organizations are barred entry to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 will introduce front end security screening of all 
refugee claimants, fewer appeals for serious criminals and 
suspension of refugee claims for those charged with crimes until 
the courts have rendered a decision.  This is what Canadians want 
and this is what we have delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 will also streamline the refugee determination 
process.  Referrals to the immigration and refugee board will 
take place within three working days of a claim.  By 
consolidating several current steps and protection criteria into 
a single decision at the IRB and, moreover, by combining 
increased use of single member panels at the board with an 
internal paper appeal on merit, we will see faster but fairer 
decisions on refugee claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Combining grounds for protection at our IRB, Bill C-11 will 
maintain due process and a fair hearing for refugee claimants, 
while offering fewer opportunities for protracted judicial review 
at the federal court.  Once again, this is a good example of 
streamlining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should note that Bill C-11 does not expand on the existing 
grounds for protection.  It simply consolidates several current 
protection criteria and corresponding protection decisions into a 
single step.  Grounds for protection will remain the same as they 
are at present in keeping with Canada's international human 
rights obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 also takes steps to address the frustrating revolving 
door syndrome that has become associated with repeat claims. 
Failed claimants removed from Canada after receiving a fair 
hearing and due process, should they return to Canada to make a 
repeat claim, will no longer return to the immigration and 
refugee board.  Instead, if they return to Canada seeking 
protection after six months, they will be given a pre-removal 
risk assessment to determine whether circumstances relevant to 
their previous claim have changed.  Before six months, they are 
entitled to seek refugee protection only at our missions outside 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 will also strengthen the integrity of our immigration 
system.  It will tighten up sponsorship provisions to see that 
those who sponsor new immigrants are both able and willing to 
meet their financial obligations.  They will be required to keep 
their promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 will improve our ability to recover the costs of 
social assistance in the cases of sponsorship default.  In 
regulations to accompany Bill C-11, we will deny sponsorship to 
those in default of spousal or child support payments, those on 
social assistance and those convicted of spousal or child abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 will also establish a new class of inadmissibility for 
those who commit fraud or misrepresentation on immigration 
applications.  It will create a new offence for those caught 
helping anyone to gain status in Canada through fraud or 
misrepresentation.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>New arrivals would be required to demonstrate reasonable 
attachment to our country in order to maintain permanent 
residence status.  Bill C-11 would require physical presence in 
Canada for at least two of every five years for new immigrants to 
maintain their permanent residence status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are very important for one very simple reason.  It 
is about respect. In my many discussions with individuals and 
organizations across Canada, I can assure members that this point 
has been made abundantly clear.  Canadians want a system that is 
based on respect, both respect for our laws and our traditional 
openness to newcomers.  Bill C-11 would do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke of the steps to close the back door, but equally Bill 
C-11 would allow us to open the front door wider.  We would 
improve our ability to attract skilled workers and speed up 
family reunification.  In regulations authorized by Bill C-11, we 
would modernize our selection system for skilled workers. 
Independent immigrants would be selected for their adaptability, 
level of education and training, language skills, experience and 
general level of employability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's rapidly evolving labour markets we need people who 
are best able to adapt to new occupations as the needs of the 
labour market shift over time.  These are people who would thrive 
and contribute to our prosperity in the economy of this new 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 would also provide easier access for highly skilled 
temporary foreign workers so that Canadian businesses can stay 
competitive and seize every opportunity for expansion.  Many 
skilled workers who come to Canada on a temporary basis are 
subsequently offered permanent positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations to Bill C-11 would allow these workers to apply 
for landing from within Canada under certain conditions, just as 
it would allow foreign students who have graduated and worked in 
Canada also to apply for landing from within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 also recognizes that family reunification has always 
been a cornerstone of Canada's immigration policy.  Canadians 
know that new arrivals establish themselves more quickly and much 
better when they have the support of their extended families. 
Bill C-11 and its supporting regulations would allow spouses, 
partners and dependent children to apply for landing from within 
Canada provided that they are already here legally and that they 
made appropriate admissibility provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started my remarks by making references to the improvements I 
made in the bill to address some of the concerns that had been 
raised in relation to Bill C-31.  I will say a few words about 
the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One key concern that I heard was that the previous bill had to 
do with the idea of framework legislation.  I understand the 
concern but I consider it all the same.  Framework legislation 
remains essential to the efficient administration of the 
immigration program, particularly in the context of changing 
global environment in which it operates and would continue to 
operate.  Framework legislation allows us the flexibility to make 
changes through regulation when sudden, unforeseen circumstances 
require.  However I made a commitment to see that all key 
principles and policies are set out explicitly in the act rather 
than in regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 enshrines in the act the principles of equality, 
freedom from discrimination and the equality of English and 
French as official languages of Canada. It also makes explicit 
the provision that parents are members of the family class. There 
is, moreover, an explicit provision now in the act that sponsors 
spouses, partners, dependent children and refugees resettled from 
abroad, along with their dependents, would not be denied 
admission on grounds that they would create an excessive demand 
on our medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 also affirms in legislation the principle that 
children should only be detained as a last resort.  It provides a 
clear definition of permanent resident to distinguish the rights 
of permanent residents from those of other foreign nationals.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oral hearings have been reinstated for those facing loss of 
permanent resident status, and provisions have been clarified for 
allowing new evidence to be presented at those appeals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 would also facilitate the return of permanent 
residents with expired permanent resident cards if they have been 
outside Canada for less than one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have built in a higher threshold for examination within 
Canada related to inadmissibility and immigration officers would 
now require a warrant to arrest a permanent resident on any 
immigration matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before denying access to the refugee determination system to 
persons convicted of serious criminal offences outside of Canada, 
the bill requires a ministerial danger opinion.  This provision 
is a safeguard to protect those who may have been convicted of 
politically trumped up charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill makes explicit our policy that people refused refugee 
resettlement overseas by a Canadian visa officer would 
nonetheless be able to apply for refugee status from within 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I am happy to say that the United Nations high 
commissioner for refugees will be allowed to observe IRB hearings 
and participate as an intervener in cases before the refugee 
appeal division.  I believe these improvements both strengthen 
the bill's integrity and protects the rights of individuals 
before the immigration and refugee protection systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 gives us a balanced approach to immigration and 
refugee protection policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the initial passage of the current Immigration Act in 
1976, I know we all agree that the world has changed 
dramatically.   More than ever before, people are on the move for 
trade, tourism, investment and education in order to develop 
their skills, to share their knowledge, to pursue their dreams, 
to find safety and to reunite with family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been the enormous beneficiary of this global movement 
of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The swift passage of Bill C-11 into law would allow us to 
modernize our immigration and refugee protection systems.  It 
would allow us to meet the challenges and take advantage of the 
opportunities that lie ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the House that regulations in support of Bill C-11 
will be developed in as an open and consultative manner as this 
bill has been developed.  It will give members of the House, key 
immigration stakeholders and individual Canadians ample 
opportunity to share their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues of immigration and refugee protection are very important 
to the country.  They take us to many of our core values that we 
as Canadians share.  An open and transparent regulatory process 
would ensure that Canadians support the rules that are put in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also assure the House that Bill C-11 recognizes that 
immigration is an area of jurisdiction that the federal 
government shares with the provinces and territories.  Bill C-11 
would commit the Government of Canada to continue consulting and 
working with our partners, the provinces and territories, in 
these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is fully committed to the social union framework 
agreement and recognizes that immigration does impact on areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, such as health care, education and 
social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, immigration also brings enormous social, cultural and 
economic benefits to Canada, its provinces and cities, benefits 
that must be weighed against the short term costs. Indeed, it is 
one of the reasons that so many of our provinces are currently 
looking to attract more immigrants. They know as we all do that 
immigrants and refugees built this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new provisions of Bill C-11, immigrants and refugees 
would continue to help build the country in the future.  I am 
proud to move adoption and second reading of Bill C-11.

next 24 years.  The act was repealed in 1947. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I immigrated to Canada in 1955 as a seven year old.  I do not 
believe for one minute that my grandfather would ever have 
envisioned that some day his grandson in the future would be 
standing in the House of Commons debating immigration 
legislation.  I am doubly honoured to rise in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that a minister of the crown during the 
last federal election made some disparaging remarks about the 
Canadian Alliance.  It was possible that these remarks were made 
in the heat of battle.  We all do that from time to time. 
Unfortunately these remarks still irritate over three million 
Canadians who voted for the Canadian Alliance Party.  I hope I am 
correct in saying that the minister did not mean what she said. I 
only wish the minister would do the right thing to resolve this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance Party is pro-immigration.  I will read our 
policy statements on immigration from the past election. Canadian 
Alliance promised to welcome new Canadians and at the same time 
keep out the criminals.  Canada is a nation of immigrants.  We 
have always been enriched by new arrivals to our shores.  A 
Canadian Alliance government would maintain the current level of 
immigration.  We would make it easier for immigrants who possess 
advanced skills and training to enter Canada, and we would make 
the family reunification process truly responsive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are also angered by policies which have let dangerous 
criminals into our country and unscrupulous human smugglers who 
bring in illegal migrants, jumping the queue and hurting the 
integrity of the system.  The Canadian Alliance immigration 
policy would accommodate legitimate immigrants and their families 
who seek to contribute to Canada, while locking it tight to those 
who would abuse the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration is the story of Canada.  Immigrants have been coming 
to Canada since Cartier and Champlain.  Canada was built on the 
backs of the immigrants who came here from around the world.  We 
are fortunate that after the 1900s, Canada adopted a somewhat 
open door policy to immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, as a country we have had our bleak moments, starting with 
the aboriginals, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Jews, the 
Ukrainians and the blacks.  Despite all these bleak moments in 
history, we have fared quite well.  Certainly over the last 50 
years Canada has become an example to the world.  Our diversity 
is a strength and not a weakness.  We have shown the world that 
people from around the world can live and work together under one 
tent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should always see ourselves as Canadians first before our 
country of origin.  Otherwise we will become a patchwork of 
ethnic communities, which will weaken our resolve as a nation.  I 
agree with the author John Boyko who in his book entitled <I>Last 
Steps to Freedom</I> wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unity should be the goal of diversity rather than diversity 
existing as an end into itself. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion this is basically the weak link in Canada's 
multicultural initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the member for Kitchener—Waterloo for his principal 
stand during the 36th parliament in his advocacy for those of us 
who are Canadians by choice in the citizenship act debate.  There 
is no doubt the House will hear more from the hon. member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo when we debate Canadian citizenship in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's only option for population growth is through 
immigration.  Smart immigration policies will create the 
opportunities for the country to create wealth.  We need to keep 
better track of the different groups to determine how they are 
doing in the country, both in the short and long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes there needs to be a balance 
between access to Canada and security of our country from the 
world's criminals and terrorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to emphasize integration into Canadian society for both 
immigrants and refugees.  The act mentions integration but does 
not specify how it is to be carried out.  Canada has had many 
integration initiatives, both long term and administered by the 
government.  They all have some level of success and failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with a larger number of both refugees and immigrants we 
need to look at a consistent approach to helping immigrants 
integrate into Canadian society.  We know that most refugees have 
many needs including language.  A clear plan of action should be 
in place to ensure that refugees receive basic needs, language 
training, education and skill training so they can become 
integrated into all aspects of Canadian life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a desire by the populace to see that new Canadians are 
distributed throughout the country so that they do not all end up 
in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.  All parts of Canada need 
population growth.  The federal government must come up with a 
new integration program in consultation with the municipalities 
and provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary, the member for Gatineau, and I 
along with other members had lunch with a Danish delegation to 
talk about immigration issues.  It was interesting that the 
Danish government had put in place new legislation called the 
integration act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Danish integration policy is based upon the fact that 
immigrants and refugees on the whole, and especially the newly 
arrived, have a disadvantage in linguistic and vocational fields 
which prevent them from participating in society on an equal 
footing with the rest of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Danish policy was necessary, while respecting the principle 
of non-discrimination, to implement special integration measures 
which aimed to ensure that immigrants and refugees would be able 
to participate fully in education, the labour market and all 
other areas of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integration act shifted responsibility for integration 
measures for the newly arrived from the federal level to the 
municipal level, which it felt had the best capacity for 
implementing a comprehensive and co-ordinated set of integration 
measures concerning housing, community information, education, 
vocational training and an introduction to the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That makes a lot of sense.  In Canada it is unfortunate that 
after the first year of arrival most immigrants somehow end up in 
big cities like Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.  It will be 
interesting to see the results of the Danish initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance Party believes Canada needs to do its part 
in taking in refugees.  We understand that refugees are not 
immigrants.  Immigrants choose to move to another country. 
Refugees are forced to flee, often leaving family and belongings 
behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty per cent of the world's refugees are women and children. 
In refugee determination, Canada should enforce section F(b) of 
article one of the United Nations convention relating to the 
status of refugees, which states that refugee status should not 
apply to those who have committed a serious non-political crime 
outside the country of refuge prior to his or her admission to 
that country.  Canada cannot afford to take in another country's 
criminals regardless of whether they are an immigrant or a 
refugee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government calls the new Bill C-11 a framework document.  I 
agree that all it has is the frame.  It is short on content. This 
type of enabling legislation leaves a lot to be desired. 
Unfortunately the regulations are authorized by order in council 
and sometimes have little resemblance to the legislation. 
Enabling legislation like Bill C-11 leaves too much authority in 
the hands of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a reality check on immigration happenings in Canada. 
As the House knows, I was appointed the Canadian Alliance chief 
critic for citizenship and immigration last August.  Since that 
time there has been no shortage of immigration stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would agree that our immigration system needs a 
serious overhaul.  Will the new Bill C-11 do the job at this 
stage?  I do not think so.  These stories occur almost daily and 
show the shortcomings of our immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the problems that have occurred over the 
last year.  Last August the supreme court ruled on the human 
smuggling trial in British Columbia.  The trial should have sent 
a wake-up call to the federal government that it must revamp the 
immigration system.  The federal government continues to tout its 
tough federal legislation, but after the verdict there is no 
doubt that Canada will remain a number one target for human 
traffickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-11 there is a $1 million penalty, but the problem is 
catching the culprits. 
Enforcement is the key problem.  All the legislation in the world 
will not help if there are no resources to see things through. 
The staff must be commended for the job they do in spite of 
waning resources.  It takes a long time to process those coming 
ashore, and quick action is needed to determine whether the 
immigrants are bona fide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign nationals without status should not be under the 
protection of the Canadian charter.  The new immigration act will 
broaden the definition of who can become a refugee in Canada, 
which goes well beyond the United Nations' definition of a 
refugee.  If they are criminals they should not be accepted by 
Canada as refugees.  That is within the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While most other western nations are working to tighten their 
laws, Canada will remain the easiest target in the developed 
world.  We must not forget who is paying the bill: the poor 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has learned very little since boatloads of 
illegal migrants from China made their way to Canada's shore last 
year.  The auditor general's report of April 2000 noted serious 
deficiencies in the management and delivery of the Canadian 
immigration program.  Such deficiencies led the auditor general 
to conclude that the program's integrity was at risk and to 
question whether the department could handle applications and 
ensure compliance under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last August 28, the media reported corruption allegations at 
Canada's high commission in Hong Kong amid reports that 
immigration officials accepted gifts while working in Hong Kong. 
There were also reports that the RCMP official who blew the 
whistle on the scandal may be fired.  That should have been 
reason enough to call for a third party probe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September the department had to deal with health problems 
associated with testing.  Following the report of a malaria 
outbreak in Quebec, the government should have beefed up standard 
health testing for refugees and overseas applicants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general called 10 years ago for serious upgrades of 
health standards.  Medical staff to conduct such crucial tests 
has been reduced and the results are outbreaks like the one we 
heard about in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the April 2000 report from the auditor general, several 
deficiencies within Canada's immigration program were brought 
forward.  Questions were raised about the standard health tests 
used by the immigration department and the number of physicians 
involved in checking for infectious disease.  Some 240 refugees 
who came to Canada from central Africa in August were exposed to 
the malaria virus.  Several of them started turning up in 
hospitals after joining host families when they arrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in September the minister stated that she would act on 
Health Canada's recommendation to test immigrants for HIV and 
reject applicants who tested positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The threat of AIDS is nothing new.  The government has failed to 
protect the health of all Canadians by not acting sooner.  In 
1994 the hon. member for Calgary Northeast raised a motion in the 
House calling for AIDS testing and the government voted it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the kind of leadership Canadians can trust in the 21st 
century? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago there were 44 physicians to check for infectious 
disease.  Today there are something like 22 and they are expected 
to process over 200,000 claims.  The government has failed to 
address the work overload thrust upon immigration department 
physicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By November Canada had become the home of Mr. Lai Changxing, 
arrested for allegedly having smuggled billions into China.  It 
was discovered that he had been residing fraudulently in Canada 
for the past 15 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lai is a prime example of what is wrong with our immigration 
system.  A wanted criminal from China simply walked into Canada 
without the benefit of a background check and in doing so 
compromised the safety of the people of this country.  If he is a 
proven criminal beyond a reasonable doubt, then he should be 
deported to his home country which is eager to welcome him home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court decision on deportation has really thrown a 
monkey wrench into the case.  A wanted criminal of Mr. Lai's 
stature should never have been allowed into Canada.  The court's 
decision served only to send a message that if people break the 
law they can hide here.  That is why Canada is the most 
attractive destination for the criminals of the world.  Under the 
current system people can claim to be refugees and immigration 
Canada will allow them to remain in the country regardless of 
their criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we about to create a new category called a criminal refugee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Provencher, the former 
attorney general of Manitoba and our Canadian Alliance justice 
critic, expressed strong disapproval at the Supreme Court of 
Canada ruling in Minister of Justice v Burns and Rafay.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Provencher said it would create a haven for any 
violent criminal, Canadian or otherwise, who would come to Canada 
to escape the death penalty in the United States or any other 
country.  He also stated that after this precedent setting 
decision Canada would become a sanctuary for murderers and other 
violent criminals, putting the safety of law-abiding citizens at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Provencher.  I believe the decision 
rendered by the supreme court, if it was to have been made, 
should have been made in the House.  There is no doubt the 
decision has tied the hands of both the immigration minister and 
the immigration legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December the people of Hamilton received a scare when it was 
reported that some 1,200 people had been exposed to a deadly 
strain of drug resistant TB carried by a new immigrant.  That is 
another example of the quality of screening that takes place 
before entry into Canada.  Again, the first priority of the 
government should be to protect the lives of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after the Hamilton scare I wonder if immigration has fixed 
the problems relating to health testing standards.  The auditor 
general in his April 2000 report made recommendations to improve 
co-operation between the immigration and health departments, to 
make adequate resources available to enforce the testing process, 
and to have a clear definition of what tests should be 
administered before entry into Canada is allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has been telling the immigration department 
there were serious risks and flaws in the system as far back as 
1990.  I believe very few improvements have been made since then. 
It is time the auditor general's advice was taken seriously.  We 
need a defined list of diseases to be tested for, both here and 
abroad, and resources need to be made available to employ 
adequate numbers of physicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least there must be a very clear and definitive 
minimum standard of health requirements for entry into Canada, a 
set of diagnostic procedures for each test administered and an 
accountable process to monitor immigrants admitted into Canada 
while undergoing treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other questions that need to be addressed regarding the health 
screen process followed by Immigration Canada in granting 
entrance to immigrants and refugees are:  How is it kept up to 
date?  Are there minimum standards? How are they enforced?  Is 
there a process for follow up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general made further recommendations for 
improvement, and here they are.  The first one was to ensure in 
establishing a regular review system that the current list of 
prohibited diseases keeps pace with world health issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second was to establish, review and ensure a minimum 
standard of health requirements for entrance into Canada that is 
strictly enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third was to establish minimum qualifications and 
requirements for physicians completing or interpreting test 
results that would certify an applicant's admissibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth was to establish a minimum of diagnostic procedures 
that must be completed before entry is granted, i.e. TB skin 
tests, chest x-rays and blood tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last was to establish standards and guidelines for follow up 
of those who are allowed entrance while undergoing treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 2000 the auditor general also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also very concerned about the lack of rigour and 
consistency in the overall management of medical assessment 
activities, including the procedures for supervising the 
designated local physicians who perform medical examinations of 
prospective immigrants abroad. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the House what is more important in immigration 
than health standards.  Perhaps it is time to incorporate these 
core principles into the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week federal statistics were released which show the number 
of deported individuals is up and that there are about 15,000 
missing individuals with warrants.  Of the 8,640 deportees in the 
last year 2,000 were violent criminals who required a personal 
escort by Canadian officials as they posed a threat to the 
public.  The missing 15,000 are believed to have gone underground 
and into hiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should come as no surprise to anyone who follows the news. 
Rarely a day goes by without an article on immigration. Canadians 
should know that we do not keep exit data.  We do not know how 
many foreign nationals are here at any given time.  Even if they 
came into the country on a visa, we do not know if they left the 
country when their visa ran out.  Why would Canadians therefore 
be surprised at the high number of individuals with warrants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the number one destination for criminals to hide out 
from the law.  We should not be surprised that with the recent 
supreme court ruling on deportation the numbers being deported 
will dwindle.

the world's criminals.  Even Toronto police chief Julian Fantino 
agrees.  He said “You commit your crime in one place, you run 
from consequences and accountability and where do you go? You go 
to a place like Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-11, the government borrowed from private member's 
bill, Bill C-333, an act to amend the Immigration Act and 
criminal code, refugee or immigration applicants convicted of an 
offence on indictment.  This was tabled in the 35th parliament by 
the member for Vancouver North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liked the tough talk from the minister last week in the media 
about deporting criminals.  Unfortunately, it is tougher walking 
the talk, especially now that we are living in a post-supreme 
court period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recent as last Friday the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> reported 
that a suspected Italian Mafia hit man moved freely across the 
Canadian and U.S. border while courts in Europe were charging him 
with murder.  Immigration Canada alleged that the man knew about 
the charges but failed to mention them while renewing his visa, a 
violation of Canada's Immigration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the papers it appears that Canadian security and 
Interpol did not compare notes on this dangerous criminal.  What 
will happen at this deportation hearing if this man claims harm 
and fears for his life if deported?  The examples are endless. 
They all show the same thing.  Our immigration system needs a 
major overhaul beyond the creation of a new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the lawyers in the country are not happy with the current 
immigration system.  I will quote from the August-September 2000 
issue of the <I>National</I>, a publication of the Canadian Bar 
Association.  In fact, the minister of immigration is in that 
very publication.  This was what some of the members had to say 
when asked what was wrong with Canada's immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first quote is from Allen Ruben of Fredericton, New 
Brunswick.  He said “The 1994 budget cuts at the immigration 
department sliced away one-third of its human and financial 
resources, leading to processing delays of up to three years in 
the entry of urgently needed foreign workers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second quote is from Isabelle Dongier of Montreal.  She said 
“The immigration rules are so complicated and hard to understand 
that they are very irregularly applied and interpreted.  If you 
present a case at the border you can sit there with five 
different officers and have five different interpretations of the 
same situation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last quote is from Michael Greene of Calgary.  He said 
“There is hardly any regulation for unscrupulous immigration 
consultants, some of them disbarred lawyers who prey on 
ill-informed and vulnerable immigrants.  It is astounding that a 
government department would take so little care of the people it 
deals with, especially when they know they are dealing with 
people who are particularly ignorant of our laws and customs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the lawyers are frustrated with our immigration system. The 
most reliable scrutineer of the government of the day, as we all 
know, is the office of the Auditor General of Canada.  Much of 
what was said 10 years ago by the auditor general on the 
immigration file was repeated in his April 2000 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, I will read the auditor general's news release 
dated in Ottawa on April 11, 2000.  It was titled, “Immigration 
services abroad are in trouble and need urgent attention”, 
chapter 3.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his Report tabled today in Parliament, the Auditor General of 
Canada, Denis Desautels, notes serious deficiencies in the 
management and delivery of the economic component of the Canadian 
Immigration Program, whose aim is to recruit skilled workers and 
business immigrants.  Immigration offices abroad are overtasked, 
controls to protect health and safety of Canadians are deficient, 
and the Department is vulnerable to fraud and abuse.  In 
addition, the Department is open to criticism of the quality and 
consistency of its decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Immigrants provide a steady flow of talent and new skills to 
our labour force.  The deficiencies we noted in our audit 
seriously limit Canada's ability to get the economic and social 
benefits that immigration affords and seriously weakens the level 
of protection for Canadians intended in the Immigration Act”, 
said Denis Desautels.  He added that it is highly questionable 
whether the Department has the capacity it needs to meet the 
annual immigration levels set by the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that immigration levels have been set for the past two 
years at between 200,000 and 225,000.  In 1999 approximately 
190,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada; 56% were economic 
immigrants, skilled workers, entrepreneurs, investors and 
self-employed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the findings of the report were the following.  First, 
selected criteria and process were not conducive to a rigorous 
selection of immigrants who were highly qualified and able to 
contribute to our economy.  Second, applicants could wait up to 
three years for a decision. That is intolerable.  Third, there 
were significant weaknesses in medical assessment of prospective 
immigrants.  The same routine tests have been required for the 
last 40 years, despite the emergence of new diseases.  Canadians 
should be concerned about their health.  Fourth, some immigrants 
were admitted to Canada without reasonable assurance that they 
had not committed crimes abroad.  Fifth, there were inadequate 
controls over revenue, visa forms and computer systems in offices 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general urged the department and the government to 
take immediate action to address both policy and administrative 
issues.  The statement of Mr. Desautels from April 2000 went on 
to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It is disappointing to note that several of the problems we 
raise today are similar to those reported in 1990”, said Denis 
Desautels.  “Employees responsible for processing applications 
in offices abroad are deeply concerned about the present state of 
affairs and I share their concerns”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can see, our immigration system is in dire need 
of a major overhaul.  The question is how will the new act fix 
the old problems that go as far back as 1990?  How accountable 
will the minister be in getting these problems rectified.  The 
buck does stop at the minister's desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old saying goes that it is always easier to criticize.  In 
other words, what would the Canadian Alliance do to fix the 
problems?  Let me, on behalf of the Canadian Alliance, present 
some solutions.  Let me begin by saying that we will make the 
system work.  The current system of immigration is workable.  It 
is just very badly mismanaged and underfunded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department works with at least three other federal 
departments; health, foreign affairs and human resources.  Better 
co-operation and communication among all these other parties 
would be a good first step in correcting what is wrong with the 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Staff at all levels need to be better educated as to their role. 
The roles need to be standardized across the board. Those with 
the most experience in security, for example, should probably 
handle security matters.  If the RCMP and CSIS are on board to 
help at all immigration offices around the world, then their 
expertise in determining security risks should be utilized. If 
the RCMP and CSIS are not using their expertise in determining 
security risks, then it is high time they were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is long overdue for an overhaul of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board system, beginning by making this system more 
transparent, less partisan and more credible.  Members of the IRB 
should be hired on merit, not politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department needs to undergo a full financial audit to 
determine areas of overlap and waste.  There is currently not 
enough staff to handle the workload.  The latest budget cuts have 
reduced the medical staff both in Canada and overseas 
assignments.  It is interesting that the auditor general made 
these same complaints 10 years ago.  There must be put in place 
an evaluation process to determine whether the system is working 
as a unit.  There is no doubt that better co-ordination needs to 
take place between overseas offices as well as those in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of what a bona fide refugee is must be clear.  We 
need to follow the UN convention to which we are a signatory. As 
is currently happening, almost anyone entering Canada can claim 
refugee status.  By the time they are processed and heard, many 
years have passed.  Most Canadians agree that refugees should not 
be detained for long periods of time and that the determination 
process must be compressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want an immigration system that protects their borders 
from the criminals and terrorists of the world.  Our security 
system needs to be addressed.  Proper training in criminal 
background checks and risk assessments should be mandatory for 
all these officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have illustrated throughout this debate, there are numerous 
problems with the issue of security.  The question which is 
always raised is how did these undesirables get here in the first 
place? 
Our research shows that there is very little communication or 
information sharing, sometimes none between the RCMP, CSIS and 
other international security agencies such as Interpol.  A recent 
Montreal case is a good example.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem we learned is what information is shared is 
sometimes undisclosed in a court during an appeal on an 
application.  Therefore, visa officers are reluctant to decline 
applications on the basis of inadmissibility for security 
reasons.  It is very difficult to prove the standards of 
inadmissibility.  Further, there is no deterrent against 
applicants repeatedly submitting false applications, therefore 
increasing their chances of getting through the system.  There 
needs to be sharing of information between RCMP, CSIS and visa 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration in its 
report entitled, “Refugee Protection and Border Security: 
Striking a Balance”, recommended that the Government of Canada 
increase resources for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the 
Canadian Security and Intelligence Service and the RCMP so that 
they would be able to meet the challenges posed by traffickers in 
people and ensure the safety and security of Canada and its 
people.  Perhaps it is time Canada stationed members of both the 
RCMP and CSIS permanently at our overseas locations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that once an applicant has been found to have 
willingly turned in a false application, which is a breach of the 
act, that person should not be allowed to reapply for entry into 
Canada.  If we take our security seriously, the penalty for lying 
needs to be equally harsh.  The minister should have the 
authority to deport an individual or decline the entry of an 
individual based on criminal, violent or terrorist acts without 
question or appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole system of processing refugees must be addressed.  We 
need to process refugees expediently.  It is inhumane to detain 
or lock up refugees for long lengths of time, as was the case on 
the west coast where foreign nationals who claimed refugee status 
were locked up for over a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would make the process work smoother if we adhered to the 
definition as written by the United Nations, that a refugee 
arrives, not by choice for economic gain but is here due to 
persecution based on race, religion, ethnic origin or political 
opinion.  I must say that 95% of the refugee claims are credible. 
It is the 5% that we are concerned about and many of them are 
criminals who we do not need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way of dealing with these criminals who claim refugee status 
is that we should not be giving them full charter status until 
they have been declared bona fide refugees.  Canadians wonder how 
foreign nationals can have full charter protection when they are 
foreign nationals before being declared bona fide refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penalties for those abusing the refugee claimant system should 
be steep and serve as a deterrent for all future would be 
fraudulent claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I would like to raise.  Perhaps it is 
time that Canada should keep exit data so that we know who is in 
the country.  Otherwise Canada is a pretty easy place to hide 
once inside its borders.  Maybe it is time to photograph all 
those entering across our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must be more accountable for the operation of her 
department.  Canadians are tired of hearing immigration problems 
almost daily on the news.  They are asking the question, who is 
minding the store.  There is a consensus that the immigration 
system in the country needs a major overhaul.  Bill C-11 is only 
one step to help rectify the problems.  It is long overdue that 
the government of the day to introduce new legislation since this 
current act is of 1976 vintage.  The bill needs changes like all 
bills at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that immigration is everybody's business.  I 
would say that most Canadians can relate personally to 
immigration, if not in their immediate family, then certainly in 
the heritage of their parents, grandparents or 
great-grandparents.  We all know that immigration will play a 
major role in the future of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance will take a constructive approach to Bill 
C-11 at committee.  We will continue to hold the government 
accountable for its lack of action.  We will put forth amendments 
to strengthen the bill.  We will listen to Canadians as they come 
forth with their ideas for improvement.  Immigration is 
everybody's business.  All Canadians need to be aware that a new 
immigration bill is in the making.  Persons wanting a copy of the 
bill should contact their member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite our viewers and all Canadians to communicate with their 
members of parliament, or with me as chief opposition critic, 
concerns and changes that they would like to see in this draft 
piece of legislation called Bill C-11.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the citizenship and immigration critic for the Bloc Quebecois, I 
am pleased to rise at second reading of Bill C-11, an act 
respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, introduced for first reading on February 21, is 
almost identical to Bill C-31, which was introduced in March 
2000, in the previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back later on to the differences between Bill C-31 
and Bill C-11 now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current immigration act came into effect in 1976 and has 
been amended about thirty times since then. It is therefore 
important to undertake an indepth review of the legislation in 
order to meet the needs of immigrants and refugees in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early February, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
tabled in the House of Commons her department's projections for 
the levels of immigration to Canada in 2001 and 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief review of the figures for the last 20 years shows that 
150,000 applications for immigration were approved in 1980. In 
the next five years, the number of landed immigrants dropped. In 
1985, there were less than 100,000 immigrants. Starting in 1986, 
the number increased, until it reached an all time high in 1992, 
with well over 200,000 immigrants. In the following years, the 
number decreased to fewer than 175,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the department's estimates, Canada will receive 
200,000 to 225,000 immigrants and refugees in 2001, nearly 18% 
of whom will settle in Quebec. For 2002, the estimates are 
increased by some 10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and Quebec are welcoming nations. The bill before us 
should be aimed at establishing a fair and equitable framework 
to meet the needs of newcomers as humanely as possible, whether 
they are immigrants or refugees, in accordance with 
international conventions and with the values that are important 
to both Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With free trade, with the break up of political structures, like 
in Eastern Europe for example, with serious conflicts raging in 
Asia, Africa and Europe and with the globalization of 
communications, more and more people will be tempted if not 
forced to embark on the adventure of trying to starting a new 
life in a new country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new legislation should open the door so they can contribute 
to the enrichment of the community of which they will become 
part. Their skills, their experience and their personal 
qualities are all essential to the development of both Canada 
and Quebec as nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of the bill. However, 
we will have to look at this bill more closely in committee 
because certain aspects of it need to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was the case with its predecessor, Bill C-31, the main thrust 
of Bill C-11 is harshness towards illegal immigrants. Indeed, a 
large part of the bill puts the emphasis on closing the door to 
illegal immigrants, strengthening the measures designed to fight 
fraud, false statements and abuse, prohibiting  criminals and 
those who present a security risk from entering Canada, and 
imposing harsher penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, this bill, as drafted, seems to suggest that 
Canada has been invaded by all kinds of criminals and that the 
door is too wide open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not share that view, which can only 
serve to reinforce prejudice against refugees and immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the minister is seeking among other things to 
respond to a strong current of public opinion in the United 
States which feels that Canada has become a kind of Club Med for 
terrorists.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the measures aimed at discouraging illegal border 
crossings, the bill includes the imposition of heavy penalties, 
namely fines of up to $1 million and a life sentence for human 
traffickers and smugglers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revision of the act, as well as cracking down on illegals, is 
also intended—and this is good news—to lighten the load on a 
system that does not allow Canada to achieve its annual 
objective of 300,000 newcomers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, there are more than 400,000 people within Canada 
and elsewhere who are awaiting word on whether they will be able 
to settle in Canada. Canada is a popular destination. 
So, there is a problem with delays and I am sure that many 
members of this House could provide examples in their own 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speeding up the refugee determination process is one of the most 
positive measures contained in this bill. Indeed, the minister 
has indicated that, from now on, it will take 72 hours instead 
of 3 months—this is nothing short of extraordinary—for a refugee 
claim to be filed with the Immigration and Refugee Board, which 
will have to bring down its decision within six to nine months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also pointed out that her bill would significantly 
streamline refugee claim processing in order to reduce the 
maximum time frame from five to two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New measures will also be put in place to modernize the 
procedure for selecting skilled immigrant workers and temporary 
workers. 
It must be said that these measures will never apply in Quebec, 
since under the Canada-Quebec agreement of 1991, Quebec selects 
its own economic immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Refugee selection and family reunification remain under federal 
jurisdiction.  It is time, however, the law explicitly 
recognized Quebec's jurisdiction.  In this regard, section 10 of 
the current law is very weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a signatory to international human rights documents, Canada 
has obligations as well with respect to the rights of non 
citizens.  The new bill must take the standards established in 
these texts into account.  Unfortunately, and although it refers 
to them, the bill does not incorporate the relevant texts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three international conventions.  The first, the 1959 
convention relating to the status of refugees, provides that the 
mandate of the high commissioner for refugees to protect 
refugees falls as well to the countries signing the convention, 
including Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic instrument, indeed the cornerstone of the 
international refugee protection system, is respect for the 
principle of non return recognized by the countries and 
enshrined in article 33, which provides that “No Contracting 
State shall expel or return, refouler, a refugee in any manner 
whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or 
freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, 
nationality, membership of a particular social group or 
political opinion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill currently before the House should also include sexual 
orientation, specifically, as grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 97(1)(<I>a</I>) of the bill refers to the convention against 
torture and provides for the protection of persons threatened 
with torture, as defined in article 1 of the convention. 
However, the bill does not fully respect article 3 of the 
convention, which prohibits the return of any individual to face 
torture.  In fact, the present bill does not prohibit returning 
people deemed inadmissible for reasons of serious criminality 
and security.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 3 of the convention on the rights of the child requires 
governments to give the child's best interest primary 
consideration in all actions that concern him or her. Bill C-11 
proposes that the best interest of the child be taken into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides for the automatic detention of any person 
entering Canada as part of an organized operation. The previous 
bill gave no special status to refugee status claimants who were 
minors. Under Bill C-11, a minor child shall be detained only as 
a measure of last resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many more quotes concerning the rights of children that I 
would love to read to the House, but since I have several pages 
left in my speech, I will not do it. However, I would be more 
than glad to provide them to any member interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recently published 
a report on the Canadian refugee determination system. Bill C-11 
before us today addresses two of the report's recommendations by 
linking the appeal on the merits for refugee status claimants to 
the pre-removal risk assessment part of the decision taken by the 
Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are many other recommendations which the bill 
completely fails to address and which aggravate the existing 
situation. For instance, the report recommends that the decision 
as to admissibility should be the responsibility of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. 
The bill widens the categories of people whose claims will be 
deemed inadmissible and who will therefore never have an 
opportunity to be heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is particularly concerned by the fact that 
the bill provides for the automatic detention of any person who 
arrives in Canada in the context of an operation organized by 
traffickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc criticized Bill C-31 because it did not grant any 
special status to refugee claimants who are minors, in spite of 
the fact that the UNHCR recently pointed out to Immigration 
Canada that it was contrary to the international rules governing 
the detention of young refugees, except in certain cases and for 
very short periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seems to have heard the message since Bill C-11 
provides for the detention of young refugees only as a last 
resort. However, the notion of “last resort” has yet to be 
defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to illegal immigration, the bill mentions three 
main reasons for detention, namely the risk that the person will 
flee the country, the fact that the person may be a threat to 
public security, or cases where it is not possible to establish 
the person's identity. These three reasons are already included 
in the current act. However, in several respects, the bill 
broadens the scope of the provisions on detention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives new powers to immigration officers to detain 
individuals at points of entry for purposes of “administrative 
expediency”. The officers may also detain people when they have 
reasonable grounds to suspect that they are inadmissible on 
grounds of security or on grounds of human rights violations. 
One might wonder whether this addition of new grounds for 
detention based on expediency and suspicion is not a cause for 
concern.  It seems to us that the grounds of danger to the 
public and the risk of failure to appear already cover all the 
situations in which detention is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also broadens the provisions with respect to detention 
on grounds of identity.  Any requirement to provide proof of 
identity poses a serious obstacle for many refugees. 
In fact, these people are often forced to flee without their 
papers because their identity is precisely what exposes them to 
persecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, detentions for lack of identification can 
only take place at entry points. With this bill, a person will 
now be able to be detained within the framework of any procedure 
covered by the law if he or she does not establish identity.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means, for instance, that refugee claimants could be 
detained if they do not establish their identity at the hearing 
to determine refugee status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-11, what are presently two distinct decisions, refugee 
status determination and review of the risk of removal, will be 
a single decision made by the Immigration and Refugee Board. 
For every claim for refugee protection, and every application 
for examination of risk of removal, the board will decide 
whether the claimant is a convention refugee, whether the 
claimant is a person in need of protection, that is to say a 
person who would be subject to a danger of torture in their 
country of origin and, finally, whether the claimant is a member 
of a class of persons whose need for protection is recognized 
through regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the exception clauses in the convention 
on refugees apply to refugees in the meaning of the convention, 
and to persons in need of protection.  These exceptions are 
aimed at criminals, those who have committed serious common law 
crimes in another country and anyone convicted of actions 
contrary to the goals and principles of the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centralization of decision making within the Immigration and 
Refugee Board of Canada will no doubt make for a more effective 
and rapid process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference to the convention against torture is new and 
significant.  We should note, however, that the definition of 
protected person contained in the bill is not absolutely 
consistent with the provisions of the convention against 
torture, which, unlike the convention on the status of refugees, 
contains no exclusion clause.  Article 3 of the convention 
against torture prohibits the return of any person who may be 
subject to torture, regardless of what the person may have done 
in the past or may do in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill and consistent with the situation 
currently, only claims for refugee status approved by 
citizenship and immigration may be heard. 
However, the bill provides that an examination of an applicant's 
criminal records potentially leading to an inadmissible claim 
will now be conducted on entry into the country and no longer at 
the end of the process, once the claimant has been given refugee 
status.  The bill also expands the categories of persons whose 
claims are deemed unacceptable, which means they will not be 
referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for a 
hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, the claims are inadmissible only for reasons of 
criminality and if the minister issues a certificate of public 
danger.  Now, claims will be considered inadmissible if the 
claimant has been found guilty in Canada of a crime punishable 
by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years and for 
which a sentence of at least two years was imposed. 
A claimant will also be ruled ineligible if he has been 
convicted of an offence outside Canada that, if committed in 
Canada, would constitute an offence under an act of parliament 
that may be punished by a maximum term of imprisonment of at 
least 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that automatically excluding 
persons convicted of offences outside Canada poses a threat to 
refugees. Too often, the criminal justice system is used as a 
means of persecution. It is not unusual for victims of 
persecution to be sentenced on the basis of false accusations 
manufactured in order to convict them of crimes they did not 
commit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, applications for protection will be heard by the 
refugee protection division. Applicants will have a hearing 
before a single board member, whereas at present a panel of two 
hears the case. 
Appeals against a decision by the refugee protection division 
may be submitted to the new refugee appeal division by the 
applicant or the minister. This division will not hold a 
hearing, but will base its decision on written submissions. We 
also deplore that this bill does not include any change to the 
appointment process of board members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several years, the Bloc Quebecois has repeatedly 
criticized the Liberals for making political appointments to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. We believe it is essential that 
any change in the asylum claim process should seek to guarantee 
the integrity of the refugee status determination system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve that, it is critical to establish a 
transparent process to appoint and replace IRB members, so as to 
ensure full impartiality and selection based on the candidates' 
qualifications and professional experience, and not, as is often 
the case now, on their political affiliation. 
Since the bill provides that the decisions will be made by a 
single member, it becomes even more important and in fact 
essential that all the decision makers have the highest 
qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of appeals on the merits addresses one of the 
fundamental weaknesses of the present refugee determination 
system. The absence of an appeal mechanism was very recently 
criticized by the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights in 
its report on the Canadian refugee determination system. It 
should be noted, however, that the proposed appeal provides only 
limited protection to refugee claimants because it is based on 
written submissions only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large percentage of claims are ruled ineligible on grounds of 
credibility. It will therefore be extremely difficult to 
challenge such rulings of non-credibility in writing. 
Furthermore, written submissions also raise the problem of 
claimants without representation, which is often the case 
because of the inadequacy of legal aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides no guarantee of the independence of the 
refugee appeal division or of the greater expertise of its 
members with respect to refugee determination. If an appeal is 
to adequately correct the errors of the first level, the appeal 
division must obviously be a distinct and higher level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it seems hard to guarantee the impartiality or 
appearance of impartiality of the process when the members of 
the appeal division are called upon to judge decisions made by 
their own colleagues in the section of first instance. Such a 
structure, in which members of the division are required to 
review themselves, does not imply a critical eye and cannot 
therefore in our opinion present the necessary guarantees of 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois regrets the harsh tone used by the government 
in presenting this bill and in the related public announcements. 
The government's approach seems designed to reassure the 
Canadian right and strengthen prejudice against refugees and 
immigrants. 
It is thus encouraging division and fanning the flames of 
xenophobia and racism in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the Bloc Quebecois has said on several 
occasions that Canada's refugee determination system should have 
two essential features: it must be quick and fair to a person 
who is legitimately seeking asylum and it must deter those who 
overburden the system with unjustified claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This slowness in processing claims results in unacceptable human 
tragedies and puts people and families in extremely difficult 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the average time to process a claim at the IRB's 
Montreal office is 10 months. Moreover, at the end of December 
1999, there were over 7,000 asylum seekers in Montreal alone who 
were waiting for a hearing. That is one third of all cases in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that the new bill on immigration does not 
reflect explicitly enough the actual scope of all the powers 
gained by Quebec in this area. According to Quebec's former 
minister of public relations and immigration, Robert Perreault: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will have to include firm commitments in this regard. 
Provisions will have to be added to the current bill to ensure, 
among other things, the respect of Quebec's powers regarding the 
selection of immigrant workers or the maintaining of a distinct 
program for immigrant investors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will therefore have to contain a specific provision to 
this effect. In addition to the issue of Quebec's jurisdiction, 
it is important to mention that, although the bill proposes 
amendments with respect to refugee claims, nowhere does Ottawa 
undertake to assume the costs resulting from its handling of 
those claims.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, if the federal government believes in the 
effectiveness of the measures proposed in its bill, it should be 
able to undertake to assume these costs, and to do so until 
those affected have been granted refugee status, have been 
granted permanent residence, or have left the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, in February, it will be recalled, Quebec joined with 
Ontario and British Columbia in criticizing the federal 
government's handing of the movement of asylum seekers, calling 
for major changes, and demanding that the federal government, 
which is responsible for the entire refugee determination 
process, assume all the costs of providing services to these 
individuals, including social assistance, legal aid, education 
and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind members that, right now, it is costing Quebec 
over $100 million annually to look after people waiting for a 
ruling from the federal government's Immigration and Refugee 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is greatly concerned by the 
fact that many crucial points are relegated to the regulations 
rather than being part of the bill itself. This means that the 
government is basically excluding these rules from the scrutiny 
of the House. This also opens the door to many changes, at the 
whim of the government, or because of public pressure or 
discontent with a court decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At second reading stage, the Bloc is supporting the principle of 
this bill. However, a lot remains to be done. 
We sincerely hope that, instead of just rubberstamping the 
legislation, the Liberal government will consider improvements 
to it, at committee stage, in order to meet the needs of those 
who have chosen to settle here to build a better life for 
themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Winnipeg 
Centre who has served as the NDP critic for immigration and 
citizenship over the past year.  He has played a very important 
role in providing insight into the forerunner of the bill.  He 
will continue to play a role in ensuring that we get the best 
possible legislation out of this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be here today as the new NDP critic for 
immigration and citizenship.  I have much to learn as we begin 
this process.  I am sure the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and other colleagues in the House will understand if 
I make any errors of fact, or if I have not clearly understood 
all of the issues at hand.  I trust that there will be 
understanding and patience as we work on it together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to indicate what drives me and what perspective I bring 
to this debate.  It is a perspective that I share very much with 
the member for Winnipeg Centre partly, because of the kinds of 
constituencies we represent.  It is fair to say, if we look at 
the ridings of Winnipeg Centre and Winnipeg North Centre, that 
together we represent two of the probably most diverse areas in 
the country with a very high number of ethnocultural groups 
represented in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Winnipeg North Centre has an incredible diversity of 
ethnocultural groups.  It is an area with very strong 
multicultural roots that has always welcomed immigrants from 
every continent.  Historically it experienced a large influx of 
people of Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish and German heritage.  More 
recently immigrants have come in large numbers from the 
Philippines, India, Portugal and from many Asian, Latin American, 
African and Eastern European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency is home to many ethnocultural groups, many 
multicultural organizations, and many services involved in the 
preservation and the celebration of our rich and diverse 
heritage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, those kinds of contributions, that kind of makeup, 
make for a very active, very vibrant community working to ensure 
an understanding of the differences among us and a respect for 
one another.  There are many churches, synagogues, temples, 
gurdwaras, service groups and volunteer associations, all devoted 
to immigrant settlement, refugee sponsorship and anti-racism 
programs.  I very much value the contributions of those 
organizations to my community and I value what they have taught 
me in terms of understanding the broad parameters of policies 
pertaining to citizenship and immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of this debate and the committee meetings to 
follow, I hope I will be able to reflect and represent the values 
of my constituents, which I believe are the values of Canadians 
everywhere.  Having listened carefully to the critic for the 
Alliance, who was very careful in his choice of words around the 
policy issue, I would dare to say that if there is one thing that 
unites us in the House today it is that we all very much believe 
in the value of multiculturalism in the country today.  We all 
want to continue the tradition that Canada has established for 
itself around the world in terms of being a country that is open 
to new citizens and that operates on the basis of humanitarian 
principles, offering refuge for people seeking asylum, for people 
in need and for people wanting to be reunited with family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also bring to this debate a personal conviction from my own 
background.  Many of us in the Chamber today have a makeup of 
many ethnocultural backgrounds, each and every one of us.  In my 
own case, I am proud to say that my mother is Dutch, married to a 
Ukrainian Canadian, and that I am married to an Amish Mennonite. 
I say that because for me it is part of who I am and part of what 
I bring to this debate and what I hope to transmit to other 
members in the Chamber.  It is something I value and cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this also because I get concerned when I hear members of 
the media or even members of the House suggesting that we have to 
be watchful and mindful of all the different pockets of 
ethnocultural groups in the country today because that can lead 
to a patchwork of groups across the country and take away from 
the goal of national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at it from another perspective.  I think this is where my 
colleague, the critic from the Alliance, and I will have to 
disagree.  I tend to believe that the richness of my background 
and of so many other Canadians in terms of ethnocultural 
diversity is a positive, an added benefit, something to be 
celebrated, not worried about.  In fact I feel I am doubly 
endowed as a Canadian with the kind of background I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than worrying about pockets of ethnocultural groups, I 
think we need to reflect on the value of diversity.  We then need 
to work to ensure that our policies encourage the celebration of 
that diversity so that we, as a nation, gain strength from it and 
are able to meet challenges we would not otherwise be able to 
meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say all of that because my biggest worry about Bill C-11 is 
the same worry that my colleague for Winnipeg Centre raised with 
respect to Bill C-31, that is, it seems to be more preoccupied 
with keeping people out of the country and protecting Canada from 
the world as opposed to reuniting families here in this country 
and ensuring that we respect our humanitarian traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some changes have been made by the minister.  I know she 
has made some improvements to the bill based on suggestions by 
members of the House and representations from various groups, but 
there is an overriding concern that we all share, at least those 
of us in the NDP caucus, about the tone and tenor of the bill and 
its focus on protecting Canada from the world as opposed to 
reuniting families in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes that happens, in fact, when members in the House, as 
has happened quite regularly with the Alliance, tend to focus on 
the exceptions to the rule, on those few examples where a 
criminal element has entered our society or where people may have 
brought a disease into this country, as opposed to looking at the 
benefits from the thousands and thousands of immigrants and 
refugees who have helped to make this country what it is today.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that focus and that kind of dominant thrust the 
minister is facing daily from the Alliance and other extreme 
elements in our society today, I worry that we will in fact lose 
sight of the important humanitarian role Canada has played on the 
world stage and of the extent to which those who have received 
sanctuary have contributed to our country's economic, social and 
cultural development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe I have only two minutes left to 
give some opening remarks on the bill.  I do want to say that 
there are a number of concerns which have to be addressed in the 
process surrounding the bill.  I hope the committee process for 
receiving the bill will in fact be open to the many organizations 
and groups that have great knowledge and enormous interest and 
expertise in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will be looking for some answers on issues not addressed 
by the bill.  For example, there is the whole question of 
visitors' visas, an issue we deal with on a daily basis in our 
constituency offices.  There is the issue of the ongoing head 
tax.  Although the government has lifted it in regard to 
refugees, it still is an ongoing concern in terms of it being a 
barrier to people who want to come to Canada and settle here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be raising concerns about the live-in caregiver program. 
We will be raising concerns about the adherence of this country 
to the Geneva convention around refugees in ensuring that our 
country provides the appropriate travel documentation for and 
acceptance of refugees here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be raising concerns about the family class issue, 
acknowledging that the minister has moved parents into this 
group.  This is a concern we have raised before and we appreciate 
the change.  However, given the need in this country for a 
significant increase in immigrants, we still wonder why this 
government is not looking at a broader definition of family class 
and why we are not taking more steps to reduce the barriers to 
immigrants and refugees, to ensure that in fact this country is 
respectful of our past and is prepared to celebrate the diversity 
that makes it so strong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to refute the assertions of the NDP member, 
who said that the Canadian Alliance focuses its point of view on 
the criminal element and that this element is a small number.  I 
would say to the hon. member that 15,000 people out on warrants 
is not a small number, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Canadian Alliance Party takes a very balanced view. 
We have a pro-immigration platform and we agree with the auditor 
general that the health of Canadians is very important and needs 
to be protected.  This is why the screening process has to 
improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Canadians do not want migrants coming to our shores 
claiming refugee status to be locked up for a year or more. 
Number one, it is unfair to the individual.  Number two, it is 
taxing on the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by asking the hon. member if she does not agree 
with the auditor general's report of August 2000 pointing out 
these shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will start by 
saying that I was certainly not singling out the Alliance or the 
member for Dauphin—Swan River in terms of these broad 
pronouncements that are being advanced to the minister and are 
therefore having an influence on her policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was suggesting, in fact, that in terms of the issues raised by 
the Alliance in the House and in terms of many media reports 
about the exceptions to the rule, we end up with a situation in 
which this government feels it necessary to emphasize the 
protection and enforcement elements of the bill as opposed to 
ensuring that our policies, programs and practices are conducive 
to people who want to come to Canada, so that they are able to 
settle here without financial and other barriers.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that if we do not deal with that kind of negative 
message and this continual focus on enforcement, we fuel, by a 
process that just flows from that, the flames of racism and 
xenophobia. I think that is the last thing we want to do. 
Instead, through this bill and this process we want to educate 
and inform Canadians about the need for immigration, about how we 
have to get the numbers up in terms of the demographics of the 
country, and about how much we value our past immigration and 
refugee policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we all share concerns about the 
auditor general's report.  We all want to make sure we have the 
best practices in place to deal with any bad apples in the 
system, but we cannot let that be the dominant theme.  We cannot 
let that fuel any sense of intolerance and racism in the country 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to work together to send the minister and the government 
a clear message that what they ought to do is use this moment in 
our history as an opportunity to expound upon the virtues of 
immigration and to ensure that we do everything possible to 
reduce barriers and encourage settlement of people who want to 
live here, who want to reunite with their families and who want 
to make a contribution to this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, Health; the hon. member for St. 
John's West, Natural Resources; and the hon. member for Edmonton 
Centre-East, National Defence.

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start by complimenting the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre for an excellent first speech in her new critic area 
as the NDP caucus critic for citizenship and immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She very accurately laid out some of the concerns we in the NDP 
have about Bill C-11, not just about content but, as she said, in 
tone and about the overall impression we are sending by a bill 
that is overwhelmingly preoccupied with enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we have been critical for years.  The Liberal 
government seems to be yielding to the voices of those who are 
against immigration, period.  It is yielding by putting a 
disproportionate allocation of energy and resources to keeping 
people out of the country or to catching people who may have been 
sneaking into the country rather than promoting Canada as a 
destination for more immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the clear point of view of the NDP caucus that we welcome 
immigration.  We recognize immigration as an engine for economic 
growth.  In fact, in areas like the ridings of Winnipeg Centre 
and Winnipeg North Centre we feel we are not getting our fair 
share of new Canadians.  By ratio and proportion, Manitoba should 
in fact be getting 8,000 to 10,000 new immigrants per year as our 
share of the overall number of people who come to Canada.  We are 
actually getting less than one half of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in our ridings and in our world view we welcome more 
new Canadians.  We would hope that the government would use the 
introduction of a new immigration bill to send that message to 
the world:  that Canada has an open door policy and we welcome 
new immigrants and the contributions they can make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are critical as well of the tone of the bill, which seems to 
concentrate on welcoming people with specific skills to fill 
specific skills shortages.  In other words, it is immigration 
driven by the labour market.  This illustrates a fundamental 
shift in policy over the years.  This never used to be the case. 
We would invite immigrants to come to our country and, regardless 
of their skills or literacy levels, they could begin to make a 
contribution the very day they got here by being active consumers 
and purchasing goods.  Then they could make the contribution they 
were able to make as they grew with our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it is amazing how many entrepreneurs, business people and 
people who have made enormous contributions started from those 
humble roots.  I believe that by being too selective not only are 
we limiting the overall numbers of people we are welcoming, but 
we may be missing a lot of awfully good talent.  I am fond of 
reminding the people from the Canadian Alliance that Einstein was 
a refugee.  A lot of skilled and qualified people are.  Our own 
Governor General was a refugee.  Members of my staff were 
refugees.  No one asked them what their post-secondary education 
was before they were welcomed here. 
They started making a contribution when they arrived on these 
shores.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were hoping that Bill C-11 would be fundamentally different 
from the previous Bill C-31.  We did hear a number of quality 
presentations at the committee stage where shortcomings of Bill 
C-31 were cited. The minister took note and we thought that we 
had pretty broad agreement, at least on some of the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, one of the things that we would have moved as an 
amendment was incorporated into the new bill, that is, 
considering parents as part of the family class.  Family 
unification is one of the three legs of immigration policy in 
this country.  We certainly welcome that change within the bill 
and not just within the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things that we do not see addressed.  We pointed 
out repeatedly the aspects of the bill that would bar entry to 
any person who had been convicted of a serious crime.  By 
definition, a serious crime is one that is punishable by 10 years 
in prison or if a person serves two years or more of a penalty of 
up to 10 years.  A person who has been convicted of a crime like 
that in their country of origin would never be allowed entry into 
this country.  We pointed out the anomaly, in that somebody like 
Nelson Mandela would have been barred from entering this country 
as a refugee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that some people who have been branded 
criminals in their own country are political dissidents who are 
standing up for the rights and principles that we would be proud 
to have in our own country.  We should be recognizing the fact 
that many of the migrants in today's world are decent people who 
were forced into activities that may be considered criminal in 
that country.  There is no denying that Nelson Mandela was part 
of an armed insurrection to overthrow a despotic state.  That is 
just one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increased penalties and the absolute zero tolerance rule for 
anybody who is engaging in any kind of trafficking of human 
beings can also be unfair.  Canada is proud of its history with 
the underground railroad.  What was that if not the trafficking 
and smuggling of people from persecution into freedom?  The 
people who hid Anne Frank in their attic would have been guilty 
of taking part in the illegal trafficking and movement of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that there are political situations in the 
world today where desperate people are taking desperate measures 
to seek asylum and freedom.  We do not see the protection in the 
bill where we recognize the realities of many places in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Bill C-11 should have taken steps to change the 
previous Bill C-31 and to modify other aspects.  It was pointed 
out by a number of people who made presentations to the committee 
that risk assessments should be conducted by CIC officials rather 
than the Immigration and Refugee Board.  We fail to see that 
recommendation incorporated into Bill C-11 even though we thought 
there was broad consensus that it would be an improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also point out that Bill C-11 should have responded to the 
numerous presentations that we heard which would spell out 
specifically that we do adhere to the United Nations convention 
against torture and that under no circumstances would we ever 
send anyone back to a situation where they would face torture. 
When challenged at the committee stage, where officials came and 
made representations, as to whether they could point out a single 
other country in the world, which is signatory to the UN 
convention against torture, that even contemplates the idea of 
sending people back to where they may face torture, they were 
unable to answer.  They said that they could not think of a 
single example where that was the case.  Again, we were hoping 
that Bill C-11 would have reflected that at least.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment we would have made dealt with the UN 
convention on the rights of the child.  As was pointed out in the 
speech by the member from the Bloc Quebecois, we fall short of 
the language called for in the UN convention.  It says that the 
rights of the child must be the primary consideration for any 
decisions made on the future of the child.  We say that the UN 
convention on the rights of the child must be of principal 
consideration.  Not being a lawyer I do not know how that would 
hold up when we compare the absolute primary consideration versus 
a principal consideration.  I think it is far weaker.  I do not 
know why we would hesitate to use the strongest of language in 
that laudable concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share the concerns voiced by the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre.  We do not want to pander to the xenophobia that we 
saw in this country, where it raised its ugly head just 18 months 
ago when the Chinese boat people landed on the shores of British 
Columbia.  At that time we saw the Canadian Alliance members 
stand up and call for Canada to not follow through with the 
supreme court's decision on the rights of a refugee, which was 
that when they placed a foot in Canada, they should be given a 
hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Alliance held a press conference saying 
that the refugees should be put on a boat and sent back to where 
they came from.  They said that we should not waste money on jail 
time or feeding these people while they waited for their hearing. 
They wanted to put them on that leaky tub and did not care if it 
sank.  That was the kind of hysteria we saw whipped up by 
irresponsible people in the Reform Party or Alliance Party, and 
that is what the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre was making 
reference to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want policy shaped by xenophobic hysteria whipped up 
by people who are simply against immigration period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been in the House listening very 
carefully to the critics from the opposition parties.  I will 
start by saying that while I do not agree with everything that 
was said, I do appreciate the thoughtfulness of the presentations 
and I am looking forward to answering their questions and to 
being at committee for a full review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The predecessor to Bill C-11, Bill C-31, was referred to 
committee last June but it did not have the kind of full public 
debate and hearing at committee, as members know, because of the 
election call.  We had the opportunity, over the course of the 
summer and the fall, to give careful consideration to briefs 
received by the department and by my office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill C-11, which is before the House today, responds 
at great length to many of the issues and concerns that were 
raised regarding the original immigration and refugee protection 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having listened to my very thoughtful critics, I believe there 
are a number of areas, which they have addressed, that are 
actually addressed in the bill, or which could and would be 
addressed by the regulatory package that would accompany the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people who are unaware of parliamentary procedure, it 
is important to know that the formal regulation making process 
does not begin until after the bill is enacted.  However, I have 
made a commitment, as I did with the previous legislation, that 
we would have a discussion paper at the committee so that we 
could start to discuss what the regulations would look like and 
how they would inform the debate and the policies enshrined in 
this framework legislation which is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my critics for their thoughtful comments.  I look 
forward to debate at committee.  I wanted to take this 
opportunity during questions and comments to say how much I 
appreciate everything that they have had to say and look forward 
to further discussion at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the minister's 
remarks and the fact that she did stay to listen to all of the 
critics speak about Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we were dealing with Bill C-31, the predecessor to Bill C-11, 
we were often told that the issues we raised would be dealt with 
in the regulations and that we should not be concerned because we 
would probably get satisfaction on our issues.  We never did get 
a chance to get to that stage with Bill C-31.  In a sense we were 
being asked to buy a pig in a poke because we had no real 
assurance or any guarantee that the issue would be dealt with.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If what the minister says is accurate, and I have no reason to 
believe it is not, would she table the draft regulations now at 
this early stage of Bill C-11 so that we might have a more 
informed review of them rather than what happened to us with Bill 
C-31? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I find it astounding that the member for Winnipeg 
Centre would spend his time attacking another member of the 
opposition and continue to call the official opposition Reform. 
The official name of this party is the united alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  The Canadian Alliance Party.  My mistake, 
Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I raise is that as a member of this side of the House 
I would suggest it would be more productive if he would spend his 
time criticizing the actions of the government.  That is why we 
are called the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reason I called the 
official opposition the Reform Party is that at the time the 
Chinese boat people landed on the shores of British Columbia and 
at the time all those press conferences were held calling for 
these people to be sent back where they came from without even a 
basic hearing, the CA was in fact called the Reform Party.  I 
know the name of the party.  I have the name clear in my mind but 
I am not sure the member does.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in this 
afternoon's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, like the critic for the NDP, have just taken on the 
responsibilities for our party for cartage of the immigration 
file.  I must say that there is indeed a large learning curve 
which I have been rather proactive at trying to acquire over the 
last little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my remarks I want to compliment the minister on 
the tenor of the approach she has taken so far with respect to 
this particular debate in seeking input and listening to the 
different perspectives from all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party and the government will concur in a vast 
majority of the bill, but it is also our job in opposition to 
point out where the bill goes in the wrong direction, where it 
needs improvement and, in some cases, where sections of the bill 
may not be as warranted as they could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tenor of the minister has been quite co-operative but I wish 
to send a signal that my colleague from the NDP touched on as 
well.  I caution the minister and people within her department 
not to get drawn in or eclipsed by the debate surrounding 
immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite concerned when I read the very first press release 
out on the bill.  It states that the Minister for Citizenship and 
Immigration tabled the immigration and refugee protection act in 
the House of Commons today reaffirming her commitment to be tough 
on criminals first, while strengthening efforts to attract 
skilled immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that to be the tenor of the minister on this 
particular issue but immigration in this country is a Canadian 
necessity.  It is something to which we should extend our hands 
in welcome.  We need to have more confidence in and respect for 
human diversity so that we do not get sucked into the debate of 
always having to add the word criminal in a paragraph related to 
immigration.  I would like to flag that particular aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The object of the bill is to provide an efficient framework for 
immigration while at the same time ensuring that Canada, being 
the society that we are, remains a safe haven for refugees who 
are escaping persecution for a myriad of reasons.  That is our 
job, our human responsibility, as a responsible society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am going to talk about areas in which the bill 
progressively steps ahead with measures that are great additions 
to the country's immigration and refugee protection policy.  I 
would also like to discuss some problems that are not part of the 
bill which should be included.  They are problems of status quo 
which the bill does not necessarily resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on the refugee issue.  I refer to the 
Singh decision of 1985.  We as a society established for the 
first time that we needed to have immigration and refugee board 
so individuals could make oral presentations that could have an 
effect on their lives.  It was a step in the right direction. 
Before that decision, I am sad to say that we made those 
determinations based quite often on files and paper.  At the end 
of the day when it comes to refugees, we are actually dealing 
with people.  That is what this particular aspect is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that immigration is a demographic necessity for Canada. 
We must continue to improve the framework which administers this 
very important aspect of our society.  The importance of Bill 
C-11 has exponentially increased due to such things as the fact 
that as Canadians we are human resource hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Baby boomers are very well aware of the fact that not too long 
from now that they will begin to retire en masse.  We are going 
to need to attract many individuals in order to address that 
demographic shift in our economy so that our society and our 
country can continue to grow in a manner that is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key foundation of Canada's program is that it is colour 
blind.  We have access points across the world to enable 
immigration and refugee protection.  That is the noble goal of 
this egalitarian policy but the administrative reality is quite 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point this fact out to the minister.  Of all the 
offices that Canada has abroad, there are very few in regions 
where we take in most of our immigrants and refugees.  They are 
in countries such as Africa, India, the Philippines, China and 
even Hong Kong.  There are offices in big cities like Manila, 
Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai and New Delhi.  There are offices in 
African cities like Nairobi or Pretoria, despite the fact that 
there are over 30 countries in Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we expect thousands of people to make their way across 
borders to a few places where Canada actually has an office?  We 
cannot simply state that we have a colour blind system, if we do 
not make access to the system much more universal.  Canada needs 
more offices and access points for immigrants, now.  The minister 
needs those resources in order to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we have few offices in areas swamped with immigrants 
and refugees but those that do exist are swamped.  The auditor 
general in his April 2000 report said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found that immigration offices abroad are overtasked.  They 
have much difficulty in coping with the volumes of work and 
responsibilities assigned to them.  Immigration levels set by the 
government not met and applicants are waiting longer and longer 
for the applications to be finalized. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point out another red book promise.  The other day we 
voted down a red book promise but I will try to keep this on the 
straight and narrow for this particular debate.  This red book 
promise states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new Liberal government will move Canada's immigration levels 
closer to 1% of the population each year and ensure that 
sufficient resources are available to help families settle 
properly in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister appreciates the favour I am doing for her in 
this speech.  The political heat that she is taking at this 
moment is clearly an indication that the minister does not have 
the financial resources abroad or domestically in order for her 
to carry out her mandate, as required and as outlined by the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is always very 
willing to help the Liberal Party and show it the way as we did 
with free trade and other initiatives in that regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Latest figures show that around 225,000 immigrants or refugees 
landed in the year 2000, with expectations of a slight increase 
for the upcoming year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also pointed out one deficiency which should 
be highlighted.  The audit revealed: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—significant weaknesses in the management of medical assessments 
or prospective immigrants.  Since our last audit in 1990, the 
Department of Health Canada have been unable to take a position 
on whether changes to standards for medical examinations are 
required to determine if an applicant poses a danger to public 
health and safety, or could place excessive demand on health care 
systems. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the context of debate, we are going to have to address 
this particular issue in terms of what tests, what diseases and 
what maladies should or should not be tested for.  It is 
imperative that we bring this forth and look at this in the 
context of the year 2001.  The fact is we are really using a 
framework that is essentially a quarter of a century old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this particular issue because I know the government is 
going to be somewhat uncomfortable with the fact.  The 
Progressive Conservative Party and a number of opposition parties 
find it very draconian that the government still has its $975 
entrance feel.  I hate the term, but like it or not, this is 
still a head tax on new Canadians.  If this $975 were an 
administrative fee, it would be in a stand alone account.  It 
would be utilized as a servicing account to provide for language 
training and other things which new Canadians need assistance 
with.  If money goes into general revenues and is not set aside, 
by definition it is a head tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect which I would like to speak about is the issue of 
credentials.  However, to be honest I believe this is outside the 
purview of Bill C-11.  I applaud the government in its approach 
to this.  It has gone away from an occupation based criteria in 
attracting economic immigrants to a skill based scenario.  Skills 
need to be transferable in the context of a modern economy.  That 
is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister to work in collaboration with the 
Minister of Labour, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and the provinces to ensure that the credit agents, whether they 
be from engineering, or medical or other professional 
designations, have some way of being integrated into our Canadian 
economy.  That way immigrants will have a larger capacity to make 
more of an impact right from the start.  They will be able to 
contribute to the growth of this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise a concern that the Progressive 
Conservative Party has with respect to division 4, clause 
36(3)(b) of the bill which states “inadmissibility cannot be 
based on a conviction in respect of which a pardon has been 
granted”. How can we judge if it is a valid pardon.  What about 
violent crimes?  What about situations where an individual has 
been pardoned within some form of regime for consistent and 
habitual spousal abuse or something of that kind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the minister would have the flexibility and the purview 
to block that particular issue because she could conceive that 
the individual could be of a violent nature and a harm to 
Canadian society. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see during the course of committee an amendment 
or something with respect to the pardon.  If an individual has 
been pardoned for a serious or violent crime, he or she should go 
through a higher degree of scrutiny than is outlined in the bill. 
This is something the minister should consider as we debate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another clause I am concerned with, although I think the 
government is in the right direction in its approach, is a when 
foreign national, other than a permanent resident, is 
inadmissible on grounds that another family member is 
inadmissible.  I am talking about a situation where an individual 
has lied or misrepresented the facts in some shape or form and 
that individual was deemed to be inadmissible and sent back to 
his or her country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us envision this situation.   As it is in the bill right 
now, family members, whether they be a child or a spouse, would 
be deemed inadmissible as well.  Also, there might be a situation 
where a 20 year old has in Canada for quite some time.  However, 
after a long time we find out that one of his or her parents 
should not have been granted admissibility into Canada.  That 20 
year old could be sent back to the country of origin.  That child 
could have lived here all his or her life.  We are concerned 
about that possible connector.  We think that would be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give credit to the minister and her department in that there 
is less room in this bill for regulations compared to the 
previous attempt in Bill C-31.  There is a fair amount of 
legislative license afforded to the minister.  We would like to 
be able to find out a little more about the regulatory regime 
before we have a blind faith in the bill.  The minister has been 
quite genuine in that she would share that regulatory regime with 
us.  We will clearly take her at her word.  We will work in 
conjunction with the regulations and the bill.  It is a step in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the government's initiatives with respect to stopping 
multiple claims, where foreign nationals, other than the 
permanent residents, must answer truthfully all questions put to 
them and produce all documentation that the officer reasonably 
requires.  This particular initiative is something that deserves 
some accolades as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another house cleaning item in the bill, which the Progressive 
Conservative Party firmly supports, is the government would 
update the statute for same sex partners.  That is a step in the 
right direction and is in the context of the modern, open and 
tolerant society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 goes on to conclude that people would be inadmissible 
if they lie or omit information, or if they commit an act 
referred to in the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act, or 
if they are convicted of a crime or an offence outside of Canada 
which would be punishable by more than 10 years of imprisonment 
in Canada.  Some individuals who may actually consider that 
particular approach to be draconian.  At the end of the day, if a 
person has been sentenced to a crime of that nature, it is 
clearly in the purview of the Canadian government to take 
appropriate steps and deport that individual immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-11, an 
act respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying with respect to those very rare exceptions, the situations 
that do not happen every day, contrary to what our colleague in 
the Alliance has stated in his speech, it is clearly in the 
purview of the Government of Canada to make initiatives when 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some safeguards in the bill as well.  The case was 
mentioned of Nelson Mandela.  Clearly the Government of Canada 
would address trumped up political charges of that nature.  There 
is enough ministerial licence to be able to address such 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the government with respect to its approach toward 
human trafficking and toward the people who profit from such 
initiatives.  I think the government has stepped in the right 
direction in terms of addressing such completely unacceptable 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Progressive Conservative Party will be 
supporting the bill at second reading and reserving our judgment 
on support at report stage and at third reading, subject to our 
capacity to augment the bill and ensure we have the best piece of 
legislation for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud the member for Fundy—Royal on his call 
for the elimination of the head tax.  Members of the Canadian 
Alliance take the same position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the country will learn the lesson going back 100 
years, that a head tax is exactly that. As the member for 
Fundy—Royal indicated in his speech, the money is thrown into 
general coffers.  The last thing new Canadians need is another 
tax they cannot pay, even though under the current circumstances 
the government will lend them money to pay the head tax.  It 
makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that there are 150 million migrants on the move 
around the world.  There is no doubt that Canada is a major 
destination.  What position does the member's party take in terms 
of the immigration numbers we should accept into the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, immigration into the 
country is an economic necessity.  With respect to the numbers we 
have right now, an academic study shows the numbers of immigrants 
we are currently taking in are drastically too low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada set the minimum number at 1% of the 
Canadian population.  It needs to be more aggressive in hitting 
that target.   Sometimes, however, the target number can be 
somewhat negative.  There is an exponential amount of room to 
increase the numbers we have now, and we must recognize the 
economic necessity of immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be square with the hon. member from the Alliance, I do not 
have a specific number.  Something in excess of the government's 
number of 1% of the population would be comfortable for us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member would agree that we need more 
co-operation with the provinces to ensure we get a fair share of 
new Canadians in all regions of the country and not just in the 
urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the member from the Alliance that we are doing 
the minister a direct favour by attacking the head tax.  If it is 
not a head tax then the moneys should be allocated directly 
within the purview of her department.  If it is an administrative 
surcharge in some form it would rest with her department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would not satisfy the Progressive Conservative Party or, I 
believe, the Canadian Alliance.  We would rather do away with the 
$975 charge altogether.  Until it is in a stand alone account in 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, it is a head tax. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-11, an act respecting 
immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee protection to 
persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to replace the Immigration Act of 
1976.  The current bill takes into account various facets of the 
standing legislation and attempts to make the legislation much 
stronger.  While the legislation may be well intended, our 
analysis shows that the outcome will not serve its stated 
purpose.  That was very eloquently mentioned by our chief 
immigration critic in his speech a while ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I analyze the speech in depth, I would like to tell the 
House and Canadians who are watching that I am a new immigrant to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance and I respect the multicultural diversity 
of our country.  I and my party also respect the contribution 
made by immigrants to our great country.  Canada is a country of 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to remarks made earlier by some members in the House 
during debate, our policies are pro-immigration.  I would remind 
the House that approximately two to three years ago I moved a 
motion at the immigration committee that the discriminatory head 
tax should be removed.  Government members in committee opposed 
the motion.  The government has taken away the head tax on 
refugees.  The discriminatory head tax still continues for 
immigrants.  That shows that I and my party supported the right 
measures whenever we needed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past I spoke to Bill C-31 a few times, probably at all 
readings.  In my first speech three years ago I used the analogy 
that we should open the front doors to immigrants but diligently 
monitor them.  I also mentioned that we should close the back 
doors, including the windows and ventilators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House the minister used my analogy.  She said that 
she intends to open the front doors and close the back doors. 
However, I believe that by messing with the act she has lost the 
opportunity to fix it again.  She has not opened the front doors, 
nor has she been able to close the back doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will justify what I am saying.  The minister has installed a 
third door in the House, a revolving door.  The people who enter 
through the back door are stuck in a revolving door in Canada. 
People trying to immigrate to Canada through the front door are 
also stuck in the revolving door, as are their sponsors. 
There are unnecessary delays.  People are harassment on medical 
grounds.  Those people suffer various kinds of harassment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has not been able to open the front door or close 
the back door, but has instead installed a revolving door in the 
bill which will cause further problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the kind of approach we should take to the 
immigration legislation.  We need an immigration system that is 
faster, but we also need fairness in processing.  We need a 
system that shows openness to newcomers but also addresses abuse 
of the system.  We need a system that demonstrates clearly our 
social and humanitarian values but gives due consideration to 
Canada's economic interests.  Therefore we need a balanced 
immigration and refugee legislation to meet our immigration 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend, at the consultations in Ottawa for the World 
Conference Against Racism, the statement by the immigration and 
refugee caucus expressed huge dissatisfaction with Bill C-11. 
According to the statement, of which I have a copy, the 
criticisms are due to issues ranging from negative language and 
stereotypes to discrimination against certain groups.  They also 
mentioned the lack of protection for stateless persons and the 
detention and imprisonment of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement also highlighted that Bill C-11 falls short of 
Canada's international commitments to human rights.  I was 
surprised when I saw that even at the World Conference Against 
Racism the legislation was not appreciated.  It received 
criticism from all over, including from the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has little transparency.  So many things in it are not 
clear.  The lack of real enforcement behind the legislation will 
ultimately cause more trouble than the legislation it purports to 
replace, simply due to a lack of clarity in the bill and its 
reliance on a myriad of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has not addressed the discriminatory head tax placed on 
prospective immigrants.  It also has not addressed the 
recognition of foreign academic credentials by the immigration 
department, by other departments and by industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent supreme court ruling also has serious implications on 
any power the minister of immigration had in the past to deport 
people.  Therefore the efficiency, effectiveness and toughness of 
the bill is nullified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill allows extended absence from Canada.  It will limit the 
number of humanitarian and compassionate applications to one per 
year.  As well, the sponsorship period for new prospective 
immigrants has been reduced from 10 years to 3 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things in the bill are reasonably good but let us see how 
we can make the existing system work.  The way the Liberals run 
our immigration system is like a clogged plumbing system in a 
house.  It needs to be cleaned up and made workable. 
Improvements, additions and elimination of overlap need to take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Staff at immigration postings is in short supply, inadequately 
trained and overworked in coping with the demands.  That creates 
unacceptable delays and mess ups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important aspect of the bill is security.  Staff problems 
also create security risks, as we have seen with Mr. Lai 
Changxing, the accused kingpin smuggler.  He landed in Canada 
through queue jumping and was not detected by the visa officer. 
There is also the example of a fellow who came to Canada with an 
active case of tuberculosis and exposed some 1,500 people to the 
deadly bacteria.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having enough well trained staff to enforce the legislation is a 
must in order to effectively do the job.  Visa officers, our 
frontline defence team, need to be properly trained to identify 
undesirables from immigrating to Canada.  They should have 
clarity of law and a clearer criterion for processing immigration 
cases.  In her speech the minister mentioned front end screening. 
This security clearance check only applies to refugees and not to 
immigrant applicants.  This is what we heard when department 
officials gave us a briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no indication in Bill C-11 as to whether or not staff 
will get the proper training to enforce this security clearance 
check.  The bill contains no deterrent from repetitious 
fraudulent applications that cause endless paperwork for our visa 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been numerous incidents of fraud by the staff, 
particularly locally hired staff, in our foreign missions abroad. 
In certain instances they can make more money than their whole 
year's salary by defrauding a single immigration case.  There is 
no punishment in the bill for the applicants or the staff 
committing fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill promises to deliver better enforcement of security 
measures for both refugees and immigrant applicants, but there is 
no plan of action set out in the bill to explain how it will 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be mandatory communications among the RCMP, CSIS 
and other international criminal investigation units.  I do not 
see anything mentioned in the legislation about that.  That is 
very important, particularly in the light of the question during 
question period about someone who came to Canada without being 
detected at the entry port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is critical in his report that this type of 
communication is imperative.  Mr. Lai Changxing may never have 
got into the country if there was communication with Interpol 
because he was one of the most wanted persons on the Interpol 
list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should be allowed into Canada without proper checks 
concerning the possible risk they may pose to our country.  That 
is a legitimate request that we have for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration into Canada should be simple:  either they meet the 
criteria or they do not.  It is one of the two.  There is nothing 
in between.  Either they meet the criteria or they do not meet 
the criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration is an important aspect.  We have to look into the 
bill very seriously.  If we do not meet the immigration targets 
or quotas promised by the Liberals in any given year it is not a 
crisis.  Quality must not be compromised or sacrificed for 
quantity.  We have to be careful who are coming to Canada.  Of 
course we welcome genuine refugees with open arms.  We welcome 
immigrants with open arms, but it is the bad apples we are 
talking about that should not be entitled to come to Canada and 
put our citizenry at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be encouraging open and accountable 
discussion that needs to take place between CIC, Health Canada, 
HRDC, DFAIT, as well as the provinces and non-government 
immigration organizations, the NGOs.  It is missing that 
opportunity with its proposed changes to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code would include human trafficking and smuggling 
as federal offences for a change.  Conviction of this offence 
would be life imprisonment or a fine up to $1 million.  Repeated 
offences of these crimes, such as possessing fraudulent 
passports, visas or any other travel documents, would also 
receive monetary fines and jail time.  That is a good thing in 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes a very stiff penalty for human traffickers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals convicted of political crimes or other serious 
crimes can now be considered for risk of removal assessment. This 
may turn Canada into a haven for those criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to refugee processing, one of the key changes proposed 
in this bill includes referring refugees to the immigration 
refugee board within three working days.  However, the processing 
time of the claim will remain the same, at 90 days or more.  Our 
experience has shown that the UN convention relating to the 
status of refugees is simply too vague.  The refugee definition 
needs to be clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians know what a true refugee is and we support doing 
our part to help those who are truly in need.  Keeping them 
clogged in the system is not helping them, especially when they 
are found not to be genuine refugees and are deported.  Their 
lives are ruined after so many months or even years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this from practical experience in my own constituency.  I 
have been dealing with about 45 refugee cases where those 
refugees are in the revolving door I mentioned; they have been in 
the revolving door for seven, eight, nine or ten years.  In the 
meantime, they cannot unite with their families, they cannot work 
properly and they cannot have peace of mind.  They are in the 
revolving door.  They do not see the world the way the rest of us 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also gives refugees as well as refugee applicants full 
charter protection, so if someone is either denied access to 
Canada or is refused refugee status for any reason, he or she is 
entitled to a full set of appeals.  It is like the layers of an 
onion; he or she can keep peeling one layer after the other.  It 
also means he or she is given full rights as a citizen of Canada. 
No other country in the world does that, not a single country in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of course provides an elimination of appeal for those 
who are serious criminals, for people who present security risks, 
are members of criminal organizations or war criminals, and for 
both fraudulent and seriously criminal applicants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health testing is another important ingredient for prospective 
immigrants when they come to Canada.  There is no provision in 
this legislation to update the standard tests performed on all 
immigrant applicants, nor is there anything in the bill to 
increase the number of department physicians, either here in 
Canada or abroad in our missions.  There are currently 22 
department physicians, 11 here and 11 abroad.  These physicians 
are responsible for the paperwork at the completion of the health 
testing.  They are also responsible for contracting out to local 
physicians who do the actual testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These standard tests I am speaking of are up to 40 years old. We 
know how the world has changed in 40 years and how technology has 
evolved, particularly in the medical field, in the last 40 years. 
Often, local doctors abroad are not aware of the criteria that 
need to be met for admittance into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign local doctors also need to be periodically audited to 
ensure that no form of malfeasance is occurring.  There have been 
many complaints in my constituency office about the ethics of the 
testing physicians abroad, from bribery to all kinds of 
malpractice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently Canada will accept applicants who do not pose a danger 
to the Canadian public or place a strain on the Canadian health 
system.  A list of what conditions and ailments we will and will 
not accept is needed and it is not in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing to streamline medical testing for families.  I 
have seen a number of cases in my constituency office where 
medical testing of all family members was not co-ordinated. They 
tested one member of the family, waited for three or four months 
and then started processing.  By that time, the medical testing 
has expired.  Then they went on to the other members.  They keep 
on juggling the medical tests, sometimes for four years.  I have 
one applicant in my constituency office whose family has been 
medically tested three times.  They passed every time.  Each time 
they had to go for medical tests it cost them money, real money 
in their country's local currency. 
It not only puts unnecessary financial strain on prospective 
immigrants but also causes long delays.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am running out of time, Mr. Speaker, let me sum up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under discretionary powers in the bill, the dual intent of the 
applicant is now recognized.  That means someone can be a visitor 
to Canada and an immigrant to Canada at the same time.  I believe 
this will put a strain on the visitor visa.  The visitor visa, 
which is never addressed in any of the legislation, will have 
serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a more open system and a far more communicative 
department, the bill will not achieve its intended goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no set standards for operation of any of our overseas 
offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health standards, as I mentioned, have not been updated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, I would like to say that the Canadian Alliance would 
increase the number of staff, as I mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 promises to modernize the selection system, but unless 
the amendments are accepted we will be unable to support the 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the speech our colleague made.  Of course he 
has a lot of first-hand experience with immigration issues, and I 
would like him to just expand on the last part of his speech.  He 
seemed to run out of time, and I think he still had some really 
important things to say.  I wonder whether he has any further 
comments to make before he gives his notes away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you very much.  I 
think I need unanimous consent to go on for another 10 minutes, 
but I will try to finish in the little time I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention the accountability part, which is another very 
important aspect of the bill.  Positions on the Immigration and 
Refugee Board along with all positions within the Department of 
Immigration, such as citizenship judges, department physicians 
and visa officers, need to be publicly advertised before people 
are hired.  It should not be up to the minister to appoint 
someone to these important positions, because the criteria lack 
accountability, clarity and efficiency for the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I want to mention is that the minister in her 
speech this afternoon mentioned regulations.  There are 89 pages 
of regulations attached to the bill.  When we have a bill in the 
House with not much solid content, where only the intent is there 
but there is no solid plan of action, we have to govern 
ourselves, or the legislation has to be effective through the 
back door, which I call regulations.  That is never effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been co-chair of the House and Senate Standing Joint 
Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations.  There are over 900 
regulations in the pipeline.  Hon. members will be surprised to 
learn that many of them have been in the pipeline for the last 25 
years. They have also not been tackled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governance by regulation is not the right way to do it.  All 
those regulations should be brought back to the House in their 
respective bills so that we can debate them in the House.  We 
cannot debate the regulations.  None of the members in the House 
will ever get the opportunity to see those regulations and debate 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect is about a court decision.  The 
Canadian Alliance supports deporting undesirable individuals 
without question or delay in the cases of criminal activity or 
non-compliance with the Immigration Act.  Bill C-11 purports to 
do the same.  However, the minister, who had little power to do 
so before, is now completely stripped of her right to deport 
those who have either broken the law or have come to Canada to 
escape the law.  The Supreme Court of Canada ruling in the case 
of the Minister of Justice v Burns and Rafay, which came down on 
February 15, 2001, applies to those individuals who face a threat 
to their person if deported from Canada.  I believe this ruling 
will limit the minister's authority to deport any undesirable 
element from Canadian society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could make more points, but I will leave some time for members 
to ask questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that all members 
and people who are watching the debate realize how important it 
is for the bill to go to committee so that the public can have 
its say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-31, its predecessor, had extensive debate in the House. I 
know many questions were raised in the House which do not 
accurately reflect what is in the bill.  Some are changes that 
have been made to the bill, and I know that the public will want 
to have its say.  Those who are experts in immigration will want 
to have a chance to come to committee and to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is one point that I wanted to make.  Canada is a 
world leader in our ability to remove those who do not have the 
right to stay in Canada.  We believe as a matter of policy and 
principle that we can live up to our human rights obligations, 
that we can abide by the rule of law in Canada and still deport 
those who do not belong in Canada.  Those two principles, rule of 
law and human rights, go hand in hand.  They are Canadian values 
and we believe that the bill would enshrine those principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can boast here a bit. 
I have extensive experience dealing with immigrants.  My 
constituency of Surrey Central is the largest constituency in 
Canada in terms of population since the constituencies are 
divided based on registered citizens who can vote, the electors. 
It has a high population of immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through Bill C-11 very thoroughly.  I also attended the 
minister's briefing.  The briefing was very good.  I appreciate 
that.  The minister mentioned that the bill is going to 
committee.  We appreciate the opportunity to come forward with 
amendments, but I hope the minister will listen to those 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last time when we were debating the same bill in its previous 
form, Bill C-31, we did not have opportunity for the minister to 
listen to us properly and accept our amendments.  Our chief 
critic for immigration came forward with very good amendments but 
they were not accepted.  That is why we are in this mess and 
dealing with it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the minister mentioned that Canada is a leader in removing 
the people who do not belong in Canada.  That is not true. 
According to the auditor general we have 15,000 people still in 
Canada but whose whereabouts are not known.  Could the minister 
track those people?  No, she has been unable to track those 
people.  They do not belong in Canada but they have been consumed 
in the system.  They are hiding but they are there somewhere and 
we cannot remove them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general's report, 60% of visitors who 
come to Canada to apply for refugee status come without 
documents.  When they board the plane they have documents because 
the airlines will not allow them to board without them, but when 
they land in Canada 60% of them land without documents.  What has 
the minister done about it?  Nothing.  The auditor general's 
reports for the last 10 years have been critical one after the 
other, but the minister has chosen not to take any strong action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate we are hearing some good intentions, but we 
appeal to the minister to come with a proper action plan.  Let 
her address the real hot buttons in the bill so we can make the 
system more efficient, effective, absolutely accountable and 
clear.

<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak today on Bill C-11 dealing basically with 
immigration and refugee protection. I am rather familiar with 
this bill, on which my colleague very eloquently expressed her 
point of view just a few minutes ago. This bill is quite similar 
to former Bill C-31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a number of issues during my speech, including 
the population movements which occurred in the 20th century and 
which were important often for economic reasons, but also for 
political reasons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the detention of children. 
During consideration of Bill C-31, I was among those who thought 
it was crucial to address this particular issue for all kinds of 
reasons, for instance, because Canada has signed the 
international convention on the rights of the child. In my mind, 
it was important to uphold the rights of the child, but also the 
international conventions signed by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the whole issue regarding the detention of children 
should be clarified in Bill C-11, the Immigration and Refugee 
Protection Act, and not in future regulations, as the government 
intends to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to touch on another issue, namely the 
administrative slowness of the Immigration and Refugee Board. 
This is a reality we have to deal with in urban ridings. It is 
part of our life. People come to see us in our constituency 
offices because they are facing unacceptably long delays, which, 
we have to admit, causes terrible human tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families are often the main victims of this administrative 
slowness in the application review process by the Immigration 
and Refugee Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also say a few words about illegal immigrants. When the 
government introduced Bill C-31, it was more or less responding 
to an alleged new reality that was emerging mostly in western 
Canada, where more and more illegal immigrants were coming to 
our country, particularly from Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must realize that this phenomenon, which is indeed new, 
is marginal. It is not true that the majority of those who want 
to come here, either as permanent residents or as refugees, do 
it by illegal means. Yes, this phenomenon exists, but it is 
marginal. Unfortunately, the government is trying to use 
legislative amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection 
Act to respond to a new current in western Canada even though it 
is in fact a minor problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the question are the costs entailed by the 
slowness of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada process. 
I will come back shortly to a number of figures that are 
specific to the Montreal offices in terms of claimant waiting 
time and the number of claimants waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably, this time frame and the slow administrative pace 
result in significant administrative costs to the provinces and 
the Government of Quebec for which the federal government should 
assume responsibility at some point, insofar as the law does not 
speed up the process and satisfactorily address the claims 
currently before the Immigration and Refugee Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last part of my speech concerns the objectives Canada is 
setting for itself in terms of immigration, the number of new 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government has just reached, for the first time 
in many years, its immigration objectives for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec too has its objectives, it must be pointed out, which go 
far beyond the thirty thousand or so immigrants it would like to 
take in.  Often, the slow pace of the process blocks claims 
currently being made abroad.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking, among others, of immigration and the embassy in 
Paris, where Quebec would like to attract francophone 
immigrants.  Unfortunately, Quebec cannot achieve its objectives 
because of the substantial amount of time involved in the 
administrative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to what I was saying before. The first point 
concerns the matter of population movement.  The movement of 
people in search of a land of refuge has been a striking 
phenomenon of the 20th century, which, far from improving, has 
increased in recent years, through an increase in situations of 
organized violence, of violations of human rights, of wars and 
of conflicts on the international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees 
estimated that there were 26 million refugees in the world and 
30 million displaced persons.  Because western countries will 
take them in only in very small numbers, the great majority of 
refugees head for the poorest nations, those close to their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the governments of these nations are beginning to 
feel that the demand exceeds what they can offer.  Many have 
adopted very restrictive deterrence measures which have shifted 
the demand to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canada is one of the rare western countries to which 
those in danger may still try to apply for asylum under the 
Geneva convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Geneva convention confirms the right of an individual to 
request asylum in a third country, but does not oblige the 
country to which application has been made to grant the request, 
in accordance with the rights and privileges of nations, whence 
the common notion that asylum is not a right but a privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the welcome reserved for those seeking asylum is 
becoming increasingly limited, as can be seen from policies and 
procedures with respect to entry, application for refugee status 
and permanent residence, and from the policies regarding the 
support programs and services for which they are eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1980s saw an increase in the number of people requesting 
asylum in Canada.  The average since 1989 has jumped from 25,000 
to 30,000 a year, one third of whom have settled in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they only represent a small proportion of the world total, 
these people in distress, who are largely from southern 
countries and therefore more visible than those who came in 
previous decades, because of their unfamiliar cultural and 
linguistic profiles, did disturb government authorities and the 
public in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when we politicians, the media and the public, in Quebec 
and throughout Canada, began using expressions such as phony 
refugees, abusers of the system and cheaters. Ten years 
later, these expressions are now commonly used but are not 
enough to move public opinion. This is why the government must 
now also protect the public against terrorists and 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the new arguments used by Canada to justify the 
implementation of increasingly harsher policies against people 
seeking refuge here. The major argument used remains the 
economic weight of these asylum seekers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While recognized throughout the world for its humanitarian 
traditions, Canada quickly developed, in the eighties, a 
tendency to restrict its open door policy for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today those who apply for refugee status from abroad or in 
Canada must overcome numerous obstacles before being allowed to 
settle here. The federal government has put in place measures to 
intercept, in transit areas abroad such as airports, people who 
have fled their country without first obtaining the documents 
required by Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT88"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT88"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1815

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet those who flee their country often do not have access to 
these documents, either because they would risk their lives if 
they tried to get them from the authorities that deliver these 
documents, or because there is no place where they can get these 
documents given the country's political instability or state of 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they finally make it to Canada, the people are faced with a 
cumbersome and very slow legal process that can have a severe 
anxiogenic effect on them. First, the refugee status claim 
process is complicated and also costly since the claimant needs 
legal counsel to prepare and present his or her claim before the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. Then, the operations of the board 
need to be taken into consideration, including the way the 
hearings are carried out, the attitude of the commissioners and 
the nature of the arguments presented if a claim is rejected. 
Also, when a claim is turned down, no appeal on the merits can 
be made, the claimant can be sent back to his country of origin 
even if his life is in jeopardy because his country is at war or 
is guilty of massive violations of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that Canada no longer deports claimants 
to Burundi as of June 1993 and to Afghanistan and Rwanda as of 
April 1994. Following many representations by the Canadian 
Council for Refugees and the Table de concertation des 
organismes de Montréal, Canada stopped deporting claimants to 
Algeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire. 
However, Canada has found a way around its commitment by sending 
back to the U.S. claimants who have come here through the United 
States, who have no qualms about deporting them to their 
countries of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when claimants are granted refugee status, after being 
either selected overseas or recognized by the Immigration and 
Refugee Board, policies concerning permanent residency 
applications and family reunification can become a major 
disincentive to settle in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, precisely when asylum seekers are most in need of 
services they are not entitled to them. During the crucial 
period when they begin to adapt to their new environment and 
build their own perception of this new society, they are denied 
the right to be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are destabilized the most, and when the risk of 
experiencing mental and physical health problems is the highest, 
they would be completely shut out, were it not for the human and 
social conscience of non governmental organizations working for 
the recognition of their rights. This is another issue I dealt 
with when Bill C-31 was debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised another issue in committee, and I remember asking a 
number of questions to the government, the officials and the 
minister. 
It had to do with the detention of minors and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has signed the international convention on the rights of 
the child, which prohibits the detention of children in a number 
of situations. I asked the government to recognize this 
protection in a clause of the bill, and not in regulations, like 
it intended to do. I am forced to recognize that this will not 
necessarily be done this time around either.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out that this bill, and this is important, must in 
this respect correspond to a number of articles and not simply 
lead us back to a number of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is basic is to have this bill correspond to the convention, 
and more specifically to article 37(<I>b</I>) of the convention on the 
rights of the child, which provides that States Parties shall 
ensure that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or 
arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child 
shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a 
measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period 
of time; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect of the convention is article 22, which 
provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a 
child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a 
refugee in accordance with applicable international or domestic 
law and procedures shall, whether unaccompanied or accompanied 
by his or her parents or by any other person, receive 
appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the 
enjoyment of applicable rights set forth in the present 
Convention— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want this protection enshrined in the law.  Naturally we will 
have work to do in committee, and I am sure my colleague will 
see that these guarantees are clearly written into the law so 
that Canada may be consistent with the convention it signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect is the whole issue of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. This bill and the minister's statements clearly 
show a willingness to improve the claim review process by the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are totally open to this willingness to improve. Looking at 
the current situation, it is clear that the system is not 
working. We do not have to watch our words because it is clear. 
All those of us who have had to deal with refugee claimants in 
our ridings know that the system is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Montreal office of the Immigration and Refugee Board, the 
average time for processing claims is estimated at ten months. 
People have to wait an average of ten months to have their 
claims processed. 
This means that, while these people wait, terrible human 
tragedies unfold. The other aspect is the whole issue of 
claimants. Their number exceeded 7,000 in the Montreal office at 
the end of 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, we are open to this bill. We hope the willingness shown 
by the government will lead to positive results in the 
application of the act. We will certainly work to improve this 
bill in committee.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Rosemount—Petite-Patrie for 
his comment that sometimes the numbers do not reflect reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He used the example of the boat people on the west coast over 
the last couple of years.  When we look at the real numbers, 
there were approximately 600 refugees that came via the boat 
route.  When we look at the big picture, we had about 24,000 
refugees enter during that same time period.  Therefore sometimes 
the reporting is out of balance.  That is the way I would put it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good example occurred during the last federal election. 
I do not need to tell members that one of our Canadian Alliance 
candidates by the name of Betty Granger made the statement 
“Asian invasion” in her comments in Winnipeg. 
I truly believe that it was taken out of context.  I assure the 
House that comment was pretty common language, going back to the 
late seventies and early eighties when the economic class of Hong 
Kong were scrambling to leave that country for fear of the 
Communist takeover.

It made sense and people used the statement “Asian invasion” 
quite frequently during the late seventies and early eighties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately when it is taken out of context and in light of 
what happened in the last federal election it can be disastrous 
as results have shown.  Unfortunately, again, a lack of balance 
in reporting, too focused on one way of looking at two simple 
words, creates a lot of problems.  Worse still, it creates an 
image that Canada is not a tolerant society.  I think that is the 
sad part about the events that occurred, because in large part we 
are a tolerant society and we do accept migrants from all over 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to ask a question of the member for 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie.  He talked about supporting the people 
that come to this country.  I believe that is a shortfall of the 
government.  We need better planning.  I looked at the history 
and I know that in the past we have had both voluntary and 
government programs that were sometimes piecemeal.   What kinds 
of support programs are in place for integrating new Canadians 
into the province of Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to come back to what my 
colleague first said. The numbers speak for themselves: 600 
people arrived by boat, as he just said, out of 24,000. It is a 
mere 2 to 3%. It is a minor current. This is in fact the 
problem. We tend to let a few minor currents like this one 
influence us to strengthen legislation. This is dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still think that the illegal arrival of boats, particularly on 
the west coast, is a minor current and nothing to worry about. 
There are of course a number of shortcomings in the system 
itself, but I think strengthening the legislation and creating a 
detention process is going too far. 
I also agree with my colleague when he says that we will also 
have to strengthen our policies in general to make sure that we 
can integrate the newcomers in a society that really meets 
modern needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking in particular of the situation in Quebec. Quebec 
needs important resources to help the immigrants and the 
newcomers to Quebec society to integrate into the French 
community in a sensitive, warm and responsible way. In this 
respect, federal government resources are essential, 
particularly for those who are responsible for the integration 
of the newcomers into Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The hon. Minister for

that some statistics be on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the targets that Quebec established for itself for 
immigration have been met over the last numbers of years.  My 
department has made a concerted effort, and last year we achieved 
the levels that had been established the year before.  We did so 
with the additional $139 million that was in the budget and 
because of the tremendous effort to ensure that Canada's targets 
were met not only for immigration but for government sponsored 
refugees and privately sponsored refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all of my critics would take a moment to thank the 
officials who work so hard around the world to help us achieve 
those goals which are in Canada's interests.

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I asked a question of the Minister of Health 
sometime earlier in the session with respect to the Virginia 
Fontaine clinic in Manitoba receiving a $37 million grant through 
the government.  The clinic itself is owned by an individual by 
the name of Perry Fontaine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence of highly questionable funding and spending practices 
accompanied the exorbitant amount of money that was approved by 
Paul Cochrane, assistant deputy minister of health at the time. 
Mr. Cochrane later resigned in January.  It came to light that 
his wife had in fact purchased condos at Mont Tremblant on behalf 
of the same Mr. Fontaine who received the government grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 6 when I asked the Minister of Health about this 
situation and if he could explain how his former assistant deputy 
minister could authorize such an enormous amount of cash with 
little or no departmental scrutiny, the minister's response was 
that the transactions were the subject of an inquiry by the 
police, auditors, or both, and that the matter was before the 
courts in Manitoba.  This would ensure that the department would 
get access to all documents and would understand exactly how the 
public funds were spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He assured the House that the department would do everything 
possible to trace every one of those public dollars, if any was 
misspent, and to recover them on behalf of the public.  We would 
like to know whether the minister was aware of this at an earlier 
time and what he did.  Why was there a delay with respect to this 
important question?  We have seen over the last seven years 
massive funding cuts to health care, while at the same time there 
is increasing evidence of irresponsible spending on the part of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the HRDC scandal we found that being close to the Prime 
Minister in the Liberal government is often of great benefit and 
a great privilege to those who are in receipt of this kind of 
money.  Whether it is extravagant cruises, water fountains in the 
Prime Minister's riding, canoe museums, monkey pavilions or a 
hotel, all these things raise great doubts and great concerns on 
the part of Canadians when it comes to the spending of taxpayer 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister at the time whether a forensic audit would 
inquire into why department officials delayed so long before 
acting on this matter.  There was no response forthcoming.  The 
minister simply gave a non-answer, stating that the department 
had suspended further payments to the centre until all questions 
were answered.  There are still a number of questions 
outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Virginia Fontaine clinic simply provides another example of 
highly questionable spending practices on the part of the Liberal 
government, which also leads to a question of ethics, which again 
brings back questions on the HRDC scandal, the case of Pierre 
Corbeil who was criminally convicted in his fundraising 
activities, and the Prime Minister's bank loan controversy 
concerning the auberge.  All of these raise questions of ethics 
and raise questions of government priorities and how it is 
spending taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is wrong with the traditional job fund that is out 
there, but it is the way in which the follow up is done or not 
done.  It raises alarm bells when it comes to the amounts of 
money that hard working taxpayers are paying to the government 
only to see these programs go awry and the money being spent in a 
highly questionable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair and the opportunity to 
make these points on a question that I raised in the Chamber.

that no further funds be paid to the Virginia Fontaine Addictions 
Foundation until all outstanding questions were answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes strongly that all public money be 
accounted for carefully and the department assures the House that 
it will do whatever is required to trace public spending by this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some 
time ago I asked a question of the Minister of Natural Resources 
concerning the construction of a transmission line between 
Labrador and the province of Newfoundland.  I was basically 
asking about the proposed development of the lower Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked around the answer, mainly because at the 
time he could not remember the exact status in relation to the 
specific question which was more or less on a study undertaken by 
his department into the feasibility of the construction of such a 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1998 the then premier of Newfoundland, who is now a 
minister of everything in the House and the then premier of 
Quebec, met in Labrador for what turned out to be a photo op to 
talk about the development of the lower Churchill.  Their plans 
were disrupted by the native people who were extremely upset, and 
rightly so, because they had not been brought in on the 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of all this a commitment was made by the Prime Minister 
and the then premier of Newfoundland and Labrador to conduct a 
feasibility study into the construction of a transmission line 
from the lower Churchill development to the island of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people fail to realize that Newfoundland does not have a 
lot of clean power left.  Nor does perhaps the rest of the 
country.  The lower Churchill is one of the greatest, if not the 
greatest, supplier of clean power that is left in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A transmission line to the province would provide the island of 
Newfoundland and the Labrador section with a tremendous amount of 
cheap, regular, clean power which is in such demand. Just 
recently we heard concerns expressed by the United States, 
specifically in California, when it had a number of power 
shortages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the major IT companies made it quite clear that they 
could not continue to operate in an environment where there was a 
shortage of power because of the dependency on their industry. 
They were to look at setting up backup support in areas that 
could provide cheap, clean, regular power.  A place such as 
Newfoundland could do that.

are many other partners besides Quebec to help develop our 
resources.  The study that was requested is extremely important 
in setting the groundwork for this work.

and financial feasibility studies of electricity supply options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joint Canada-Newfoundland studies were undertaken to determine 
the best option for meeting Newfoundland's future electricity 
demands.  Two options were examined: one, building a transmission 
line, infeed, from the proposed new Labrador hydro electric 
project; or two, expanding on-island capacity and selling all the 
Labrador power to other markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This work proceeded until May 2000 when the governments of 
Quebec and Newfoundland issued a joint statement announcing the 
scaling back on negotiations and work on the Labrador power in 
light of uncertainties over electricity pricing in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the decision by the premiers of Newfoundland and Labrador,

project, work on the joint feasibility studies on electricity 
supply options was suspended until the scope and the structure of

in question period by the Minister of National Defence on 
February 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that his response failed to encompass the full scope 
of the situation of Canada's military preparedness and readiness. 
The comments I made were based on the fact that since the Liberal 
government took over in 1993, the Aurora and Arcturus patrol 
aircraft patrol time has been cut from 19,200 hours to just 
11,500 hours, and the minister wishes to cut that further, to an 
unacceptable 8,000 hours a year.  This is in spite of a written 
recommendation by the chief of the air force who states 
emphatically that less than 11,500 hours would result in an 
“unacceptable impact”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the response did not encompass the real problem 
and one of the main purposes for the patrols, arctic sovereignty. 
I believe that with the Northwest Passage being used more and 
more and polar overflights increasing in number on a day to day 
basis, one might argue for more patrolling hours, not less, in 
order to assert our presence and our sovereignty in the far 
north. 
We must remember the <I>Manhattan</I> and how it challenged our

</I></B></P><P align=left>For these and other reasons, the minister must respond to these 
concerns, the concerns of northern sovereignty patrols being cut, 
army truck wheels, moisture in our CF-18 wings, wear on Leopard 
tanks, new barracks crumbling, PMQs in need of repair, soldiers' 
health concerns, lack of heavy lift capability and, of course, 
our ongoing helicopter issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public needs answers to these questions about our military 
readiness and our Canadian armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I was going to be very 
generous with you, as I was with my colleague, but you chose not 
to continue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know you will give me 
the same time tonight that you give all parliamentary secretaries 
so that I can go through all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raises concerns and questions about the 
operational readiness of the Canadian forces.  The government is 
committed to ensuring that the Canadian forces has the people, 
equipment and training it needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we have undertaken a new far-reaching program aimed at 
preparing the Canadian forces for the 21st century, including an 
investment of $2.5 billion in new funding in the last two 
budgets.  To this end, a number of initiatives are underway to 
ensure that the CF can fulfil its mandate into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue our investment in people, equipment and training, we 
must identify the essential capabilities needed to perform the 
CF's core tasks and missions, and this is what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all Canadians should take great pride in the work 
performed by the men and women of the air force at home and 
abroad.  Every day Canadian forces aircraft operate throughout 
the country and around the world, performing various and 
demanding missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of their most important roles is performed here at home, 
patrolling the world's longest coastline, maritime approaches and 
territory, a tall order that requires an aircraft with a 
tremendous endurance.  This task is fulfilled by the CP-140 
Aurora, a long-range patrol aircraft able to fly over 9,000 
kilometres without refuelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CF-140 fleet procured in 1980 is based in 14 Wing Greenwood, 
Nova Scotia and 19 Wing Comox, British Columbia.  In classic 
mythology Aurora was the goddess of the dawn, the goddess of 
light.  From surface to subsurface surveillance, the Aurora plays 
a dynamic role for the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Designed originally for anti-aircraft warfare, the Aurora is 
also capable of assisting in a wide variety of government tasks, 
including:  surveillance of Canada's airspace, territory and 
maritime approaches; search and rescue; disaster relief; and 
assisting other government departments in areas such as fisheries 
protection, environmental surveillance and drug interdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An excellent example of the capabilities of our Auroras and 
their crews with respect to this latter role was witnessed just 
this past Wednesday, when an Aurora from 19 Wing Comox played an 
integral role in assisting with the U.S. coast guard arrest of a 
suspected drug smuggling vessel on the west coast.

motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24.
