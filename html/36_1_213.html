</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this week is organ donor week and today is national organ and 
tissue discussion day.  On the occasion of both I am pleased to 
have the honour to present to the House, in both official 
languages, the fifth report of the Standing Committee on Health 
entitled “Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation:  A 
Canadian Approach”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), your committee proceeded to 
consider the state of organ and tissue donation and 
transplantation in Canada.  The report was developed following 
intensive consultation and provides a comprehensive and national 
approach sought by numerous groups and individuals already 
working in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee requests that the 
government table a comprehensive response to the report within 
150 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all of my colleagues on the standing committee, from 
both sides of the House, for the dedication and energy which they 
have put into this very important and comprehensive study.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

and consolidate certain acts respecting food, agricultural 
commodities, aquatic commodities and agricultural inputs, to 
amend the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, the Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act, the Health 
of Animals Act, the Plant Protection Act and the Plant Breeders'

amend the Income Tax Act (medical expenses). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I thank the seconder of this bill, the 
hon. member from Burnaby—Douglas.  In summary, we hope that this 
private member's bill will assist thousands upon thousands of 
Canadians who obtain their medical prescriptions from a licensed 
physician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to expand the list of allowable 
medical expense deductions in the Income Tax Act to include 
expenses incurred due to a herbal remedy prescribed as a 
substitute for a prescription drug that would qualify as a 
medical expense under the act, but which a person cannot use 
because he or she has severe allergies or environmental 
sensitivities to that drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the environmental health clinic of Nova Scotia, 
which is in my riding, in Fall River, for helping us to draft the 
legislation and all those people in Canada who have supported the 
bill.

introduce Bill C-497, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act 
(reimbursement of election expenses). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce this, my 
first, private member's bill in the House.  It amends the 
Elections Act by allowing a registered party reimbursement of 
part of its election expenses, when at least 30% of the total 
number of elected candidates endorsed by it are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that concrete mechanisms must be put in place 
immediately, which is why I am proud to introduce this bill.  As 
I have already said, this bill constitutes a major step in 
relation to the presence of women in politics.  I would remind 
my colleagues that 52% of the population are women.  Now is the 
time to act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-498, an act respecting the establishment and 
award of an Organ Donation Medal to commemorate a person for the 
posthumous donation of an organ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on this very 
special day when the health committee will be introducing its 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my hon. colleague from Dewdney—Alouette for 
seconding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to introduce my private member's bill, which I call the 
organ donation medal act.  If passed, the bill will serve to 
formally recognize posthumously those who have given of 
themselves through organ donation so that someone else may live a 
richer, fuller life.  This medal would be awarded to a family 
member to recognize the gift of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today over 3,000 Canadians are waiting for life-giving organ 
transplants and Canada has one of the lowest donation rates in 
the world.  We know that needs to be changed.  As a parliament 
and as a society we can take steps to change this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is without precedence and I hope that through this 
small step we can ensure that more of those 3,000 people will be 
able to receive the organ donation which they so desperately 
need.  This bill would help those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members on all sides of the House will give this 
bill the non-partisan support it deserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP)</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I move that the seventh report of the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, presented on 
Thursday, December 10, 1998, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I want to admonish 
the House that members who rise to speak under motions will be 
asked to be strictly relevant to the motion on which they rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should inform the 
House that I will be dividing my time with the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have moved concurrence this morning in the seventh report of 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.  The report was presented to the House on December 10, 
1998, which was International Human Rights Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is profoundly important.  It concerns nuclear 
disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the role of NATO.  The 
report raised a number of profoundly important questions and made 
a series of serious recommendations.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving concurrence in that report today is timely. We are 
literally on the eve of the 50th anniversary of NATO's founding. 
There will be a major NATO summit meeting in Washington, D.C. 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My New Democratic Party colleagues and I call on the government 
to use this as an opportunity to put forward visionary and 
forward thinking proposals.  It should show leadership 
particularly on two fundamental issues, on the issue of the 
review of NATO's strategic concept and on the response of NATO to 
the ongoing humanitarian and military tragedy in Kosovo and 
Serbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say parenthetically that clearly in the context of a 
debate around NATO there are obviously broader questions as well. 
But bearing in mind the admonition of the Chair not to venture 
onto that turf I will not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I historically 
have taken the position and continue to take the position that 
given the dissolution of the Warsaw pact and the growing 
irrelevance of NATO, Canada could play a far more constructive 
role working within the framework of the United Nations and other 
regional security bodies.  Canada should withdraw from NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note as well with sadness the fact that a number of 
profoundly important issues around NATO, including the 
fundamental issue of the expansion of NATO, were never addressed 
in any meaningful way by this parliament.  However, that is a 
debate for another occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of the recommendations of the 
parliamentary committee on nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation, as my colleague from Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre stated, Canada has failed to show any serious leadership 
in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question we welcome the call of Canada for a review 
at the NATO summit tomorrow of NATO's strategic concept. But on 
the fundamental key issue that is involved in that strategic 
concept, NATO's absurd and destructive clinging to a policy of 
first use of nuclear weapons, what does the Government of Canada 
have to say? To this day we do not know what the government's 
position is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a background document on the NATO summit prepared and 
circulated to members of the House, all the government says is 
that Canada believes that nuclear weapons are far less important 
to NATO's strategy than in earlier years.  It is time we had far 
more leadership than that and that Canada took to the table a 
clear policy of no first use of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee urged the government to move ahead to support the 
call for conclusion of a nuclear weapons disarmament convention. 
There again the government has failed to respond positively. The 
committee made recommendations as well around MOX fuel regarding 
the total unfeasibility of that as a concept.  Here the 
government has shown contempt for parliament in moving ahead with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I are urging the government to show leadership 
with respect to the issue of the nuclear weapons test range at 
Nanoose Bay.  Just this week four very distinguished Canadians, 
Dr. David Suzuki, Dr. Michael Wallace, Elizabeth May and David 
Cadman, urged the Canadian government to seek an advisory opinion 
from a Canadian court to determine whether the activities at 
Nanoose Bay are in fact in defiance of international law, and in 
particular a decision of the International Court of Justice. I 
urge the government to respond positively to that request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of Canada's strategy in Kosovo and 
Serbia, this weekend at the NATO summit Canada does have an 
opportunity, and my colleagues and I believe a responsibility, to 
show leadership.  Instead, as the leader of the New Democratic 
Party pointed out yesterday, Canada is blindly following a 
consensus instead of showing any leadership whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are asking a growing number of questions about NATO's 
whole approach to this humanitarian and military disaster.  Just 
what are NATO's objectives in these air strikes? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially we were told that it was military targets.  We know 
now that the bombing has expanded far beyond that.  We know now 
that NATO is bombing party headquarters in the heart of Belgrade, 
Milosevic's home, and a PVC and VCM plant at Pancevo in 
Yugoslavia which proposes a profound threat to the environment. 
We know they have expanded far beyond military targets and are 
bombing many non-military targets. There have been tragic losses 
of civilian life in convoys in Kosovo, trains in Serbia and 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the guidelines?  What is Canada saying?  Has Canada 
voiced its concern about this very dangerous expansion beyond 
military targets?  We know that the United States, the so-called 
supreme command, is making the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are asking if Canada is speaking out forcefully within 
NATO.  Will we speak out this weekend about the uses of depleted 
uranium in that conflict?  We know that the A-10 helicopters are 
going to be there and they use depleted uranium. This poses a 
very grave long term environmental and humanitarian disaster as 
we have seen in Iraq and elsewhere.  What does Canada have to say 
about that?  Absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the refugees within Kosovo?  There are some 400,000 
desperate people with no food, no water and no shelter.  NATO's 
only strategy appears to be to keep bombing and it could last for 
months.  In the meantime what does Canada have to say?  What is 
Canada's position with respect to this?  Are we prepared to talk 
about getting desperately needed food in?  The Greeks have made a 
proposal which would lead to getting some food on the ground. 
Where is Canada's leadership?  There is silence here as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally and most important, what concrete diplomatic initiatives 
is Canada putting forward?  At the foreign affairs committee this 
week we heard from Jim Wright, a director general and 
spokesperson for the government in this area, that the key to a 
negotiated settlement is getting Russia on board.  Indeed the 
Russian special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, is in Belgrade now. 
We also know that the key issue for Russia is the composition of 
the international peacekeeping force.  Jim Wright said that that 
was the only outstanding issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that our government refuses to take to the NATO summit 
a clear proposal that that international peacekeeping force 
cannot be a NATO led peacekeeping force.  It must be a UN led 
peacekeeping force.  Why is Canada not showing leadership on this 
front which could mean that we could return to the table?  Why is 
Canada not urging to move forward with the uniting for peace 
resolution at the United Nations similar to that which Lester 
Pearson moved forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that Canada has failed abjectly to show leadership 
here.  The United Nations Association in Canada has urged a 
number of proposals.  It has urged NATO to consider a temporary 
halt in the bombing, urgent consultation with like-minded states, 
moving ahead within the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada cannot simply blindly continue to follow.  We have an 
opportunity tomorrow at the NATO summit to show leadership.  My 
colleagues are calling on the government to end its following, to 
stand up and show leadership on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to 
questions and comments the title of the report to which the 
concurrence motion refers is “Canada and the Nuclear Challenge: 
Reducing the Political Value of Nuclear Weapons for the 
Twenty-First Century”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When ruling on relevance, that is what the Chair will be ruling 
on in the questions and comments and on debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sit on 
the committee and took part in the nine months plus of listening 
to witnesses from across Canada.  A lot of questions were raised. 
I believe all parties could agree with a lot of the questions 
and issues that were raised, like the dangers that MOX fuel might 
possess and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with parts of that report and I would like to hear 
the member's comments.  So much of it seemed to me to deal with 
an idyllic world.  All of us would like to get rid of all the 
nuclear weapons.  That goes without saying. 
The reality is that we are going into a more dangerous world in 
the 21st century than we came out of after the cold war in the 
early nineties. I would like the member to address that.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder from some of his comments whether he believes that 
Canada really does have an agreement already with NATO in terms 
of our plans for Kosovo. The third and final point is on the big 
problem with the international force and having talked to the 
Russians as recently as this morning, Milosevic refuses to have 
the Russians as part of any force as well.  He does not want any 
force in there, peacekeeping or otherwise, made up of anyone, 
including the Russians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
to question the relevance of the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The first part of 
the question is relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the 
issue of nuclear weapons, the committee's proposal was that the 
committee call on the Government of Canada to urge a review of 
NATO's strategic concept.  It is not a particularly revolutionary 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us on the committee wanted to go further.  Some of us 
clearly suggested that Canada should show leadership within that 
review process and urge an end to the policy of first use of 
nuclear weapons.  The World Court ruling, the International Court 
of Justice ruling was a very compelling and very powerful 
argument in support of that.  It was a very compelling and very 
powerful argument in support of negotiating a nuclear weapons 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians are absolutely appalled by is the position of the 
Reform Party which is that NATO should not even review its 
strategic concept on nuclear weapons.  That is absolutely 
unbelievable.  That is the position of the Reform Party. That is 
the position of the member.  It was not even do not call for an 
end to first use of nuclear weapons.   The Reform Party with its 
head in the sand, back in the cold war, said “Forget about that. 
We do not think NATO should be reviewing its strategic concept 
at all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about a failure of leadership on the part of 
the government, that is an abject and shameful failure of 
leadership by the Reform Party of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think I should say a few words about why we moved this motion 
today.  We feel that there has not been enough opportunity to 
debate the things which the foreign affairs committee report 
addressed.  This is certainly one way of creating that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report deals not only with nuclear weapons but with the 
ongoing role of NATO and the need for NATO to review its 
strategic concept which includes a great many things. We have not 
had the opportunity in this parliament, when it comes to policies 
adopted by NATO, to have the kind of debate we ought to have in 
this place with respect to the review of the strategic concept. 
Presumably this will be done this weekend at the NATO summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet has parliament had an opportunity to debate this and express 
ourselves about the very survival of the planet and whether NATO 
which contains a majority of the nuclear powers on the face of 
the earth is actually going to take some bold step to review its 
strategy, in particular its first use strategy or not? Surely 
that is something this parliament should have had an opportunity 
to address itself to. This is what we are trying to do here this 
morning, however briefly, depending on what the government's 
response is to this, whether it wants to continue the debate or 
whether it wants to snuff out the debate by moving to go to 
orders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were concerned, as I think we ought to have been, that there 
was no debate in the House about the enlargement of NATO.  It was 
a major decision that was debated in every other parliament of 
every other NATO country. This is embarrassing.  Are we a banana 
republic run by order in council and executive committee?  Even 
in the U.K., where it was not required that they do so, they had 
a debate in parliament about the enlargement of NATO.  In every 
other country it was a requirement that their congress or their 
parliament address this issue. Yet here in Canada we just read 
about it in the <I>Gazette</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is happening with respect to a number of issues 
on this. 
The same thing is happening now with respect to the strategic 
concept, and whatever it is the government proposes to contribute 
to the debate at the summit about review of the strategic 
concept, about out of area operations on the part of NATO which 
we are seeing precedents set for in Kosovo, without there having 
been a debate in this parliament about the principle of out of 
area operations by NATO, and what grounds and what criterion 
would be used or whether or not it is a good idea at all to 
transform NATO from a defensive alliance into an alliance that 
sees itself as policemen of the world or at least policemen of 
Europe in this case.  We have never had that kind of debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that the committee addressed itself to 
primarily was the whole question of strategic concept.  In that 
there is the key question of the first use of nuclear weapons, 
which has been and continues to be one of the primary objections 
of the New Democratic Party to the way in which NATO understands 
itself, the way in which it conducts itself and one of the 
primary reasons why we have had a policy over the years of 
withdrawal from NATO.  We think that a policy of first use of 
nuclear weapons, and let us call it what it is, is terrorism writ 
large.  In the name of whatever interest it is that NATO might 
think of itself as defending, we would be willing, if not to 
destroy the planet and the environment, to destroy civilian 
populations in ways that make Hiroshima and the bombing of 
Dresden and other calamities seem insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the moral high ground of the 20th century that our 
strategic concept rests upon waging war against civilians in a 
way unknown in human history and waging war against the 
environment, therefore not just against our own generation but 
against all the generations to come? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a question of intergenerational morality in the final 
analysis.  This is fine enough or stupid enough or criminal 
enough if we wanted to destroy ourselves, but to destroy the 
environment for future generations and perhaps even to destroy 
the human prospect is, as has been rightly called on many 
occasions, a blasphemy to set ourselves up as God and say “We 
will decide the future of the planet.  We will decide whether the 
human prospect continues”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this deep rooted objection to nuclear weapons 
themselves, but also to a doctrine of first use of nuclear 
weapons, that the NDP raises this motion today.  We think nothing 
could be more important than for parliament to address itself to 
this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the question of MOX?  The Minister of Foreign Affairs 
holds this up as one of the ways that Canada could contribute to 
the elimination of nuclear weapons.  We could do a lot more to 
contribute to the elimination of nuclear weapons if we used what 
influence we have within NATO and at the United Nations to work 
for the abolition of nuclear weapons, not just some fine tuning 
of NATO strategic concept, and that may not happen in any 
significant way, but to work for the abolition of nuclear 
weapons.  That is the way in which we could contribute to this 
process, rather than becoming a nuclear waste dump for the United 
States and perhaps for other countries as well, all in a way that 
is open to the charge that this is just a way of trying to keep 
the failing nuclear industry in this country alive by giving it 
some raison d'être or justification that is slipping away from 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot to be debated here.  I would hope that the 
government will seize this opportunity.  It says we have an 
opportunity to do this because we have take note debates about 
various things that happen, particularly with respect to NATO and 
peacekeeping.  However, that is not enough.  We do not get to 
vote.  We could vote on concurrence in this committee report. The 
House could express itself as to whether or not it agreed with 
the committee or with the government on these matters. If it 
comes to a decision with respect to the deployment of ground 
troops, we could have a vote in the House about that.  Surely 
parliament should vote on the important things and not just on 
what it suits the government to have parliament express itself 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not playing into the hands of Mr. Milosevic or whatever 
silly thing the Prime Minister said.  How could the genuine, 
authentic exercise of democracy play into the hands of someone 
who is anti-democratic?   Every time we confront a difficult 
situation do we put our democratic values aside? 
This reminds me of of what we did at APEC.  Instead of showcasing 
democracy to the visiting totalitarian leaders by showing how we 
allow protesters and demonstrators to be seen by the people who 
they are protesting and demonstrating against, we hide them away. 
We become more like the people who we are allegedly trying to 
convert to our values.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we get the argument from the Prime Minister, “Oh, no, we 
don't want a vote in parliament.  That might show division.”  It 
might, but we do not know yet.  I do not think the Prime Minister 
should presume upon the judgment of the House.  However, even if 
it did, what would be wrong with that?   What would be wrong with 
showing that we are a country in which people hold a variety of 
views and that those views are expressed in the parliament of 
that country.  I do not understand the government's reluctance 
when it comes to involving parliament in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck by the irony the other night when President 
Clinton, responding to the massacre, the terrible tragedy in 
Littleton, Colorado at the Columbine High School said “We have 
to teach our children that we need to solve our problems with 
words and not weapons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are urging upon our own government with respect 
to Kosovo, that it go to NATO and say that the strategy that it 
employed and which we approved in the beginning under 
circumstances that have now changed and under criteria that have 
now been abandoned, has failed.  That it seek to solve this 
problem with diplomacy because obviously what it set about to do 
in a military context has not worked.  It is time to review that 
concept, not just NATO's strategic concept, but to review this 
very significant approach that was being taken by NATO in Kosovo 
and get back to the table, consider some of the things that have 
been put forward by Mr. Pearson's son, Geoffrey Pearson and 
others, and see if we cannot find a way out of this mess that 
does not bring back the threat of cold war and an arms race 
escalation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I got a letter from the Physicians for Global 
Survival saying that one of the things that NATO and others 
should be considering is de-alerting all the nuclear forces on 
the planet for the year 2000 because of the Y2K concern.  This is 
one of the biggest concerns that Canadians have with respect to 
Y2K, not whether their lights will be off for two days but 
whether they will have nuclear bombs raining down on them by 
accident.  This is something it should be considering at the NATO 
summit as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO could show leadership here and say it will de-alert and 
take all its bombs off alert until it is absolutely certain that 
the problem is settled.  Better that it took them off and kept 
them off but at the very least it could do that.  I would hope 
that would be something the government would take to that meeting 
in Washington this weekend.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
member who just spoke gave an excellent speech.  He has a lot of 
experience in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether they vote for the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois or 
the Progressive Conservative Party, the people have the 
opportunity every four years to elect parliamentarians to the 
House of Commons to assume their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is up to the House of Commons and to each of the 
members present to assume their responsibilities.  One of our 
responsibilities is to know whether the government supports all 
NATO's decisions.  If that is the case, it is a bit worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If NATO decides for the Government of Canada, and we as 
parliamentarians have no part to play other than to bow and nod 
in agreement, as the Prime Minister does without even consulting 
the House, it is worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, the Bloc Quebecois presented a motion asking the 
government for the opportunity to exercise a very democratic 
right in the House of Commons: the members' right to vote and 
give the government the mandate to takes its responsibilities in 
terms of honouring commitments made to NATO.

Government of Canada have the resources and materiel to respond? 
Things are getting complicated.  Are civilians going to be 
called on to meet NATO's standards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to ask the member a question.  I do not know 
whether he agrees with me, but I am sure the Prime Minister does 
not have the backing of his own government and he cannot take a 
vote, because he is afraid his own government will vote no, when 
decisions have to be made in the war in Kosovo. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot say for sure what 
the mind of the Liberal caucus is on this or whether that is the 
reason the Prime Minister does not want to have a vote.  It may 
be so, but I would not underestimate the power of the Prime 
Minister to bring all his members into line even if some of them 
were against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raises a good point when he talks about the 
Prime Minister's response to the whole question of Canada's role 
in NATO.  The Prime Minister said that he would not be the only 
one not to go along and that he is a part of team, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should unpack this team analogy for a few seconds 
because there are different people on the team.  We can go all 
the way from the captain to the water boy.  They are all on the 
team.  What we are saying about Canada being a part of the NATO 
team is that we should have something to say in the huddle.  To 
use a football analogy, we should have something to say about 
what the play is going to be and what we are going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, are we going to seek a diplomatic solution?  Are 
we going to be open-minded about various other ways of creating 
openings to get back to the table?  No matter how many guys are 
lined up, are we going to keep pushing through and trying the 
same plays over and over again regardless of whether or not they 
work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister would do well to reflect on his own team 
metaphor for NATO.  We know that Canada cannot be the captain. 
We know who the captain is.  However, we can have members on the 
team who have something significant to say and something 
significant to contribute and that is what we ask of Canada in 
this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The technical changes submitted to the approval of this House 
are based on our government's concern to ensure fairness to 
Canadian taxpayers, but also to our current and past employees. 
The existing public service pension plans were established some 
50 years ago and they clearly must be adjusted to the new 
realities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain.  When the Canada pension plan was established it 
was agreed with our employees that their annual contributions to 
the public service plan and to the Canada pension plan combined 
would not increase over the percentage of their wages that they 
were then paying, which was 7.5% of their salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original contribution rate of employees to the CPP has risen 
over time from 1.8% in 1966 to 3.5% today.  The CPP rate, as 
agreed by the federal government and the provinces together, will 
climb by 2003 to 4.95% of the wages and salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, each time our employees contribution rate to the CPP 
increases their contribution to the government's pension fund 
decreases since their total contribution cannot exceed 7.5% of 
their wages.  Historically the government and its employees 
shared pension plan costs on a 60:40 ratio.  With the increase in 
CPP premiums this proportion has gradually changed to 70:30 and 
it will be 80:20 in 2003 if we do not act now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members would no doubt suggest that the government could simply 
increase contributions, reduce benefits or let the pension funds 
accumulate shortfalls even if the benefits of the pension plans 
were eventually reduced.  To all of these options the proper 
answer is no, and that is the whole reason for Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three acts that govern the government's pension funds 
restrict contributions to the ceiling of 7.5% of earnings, 
prohibit the reduction of benefits, and require the government to 
cover all annual shortfalls in its pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it fair for federal employees to enjoy both the guarantee of 
always paying the same percentage of premiums and the guarantee 
of benefits that will never be reduced while Canadian taxpayers 
are constantly assured of paying a bigger and bigger share of the 
pension plan of government employees, as well as funding any 
shortfalls?  The government does not think so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that, ultimately, the government represents 
taxpayers who, in addition to having to save up for their own 
retirement, must also assume the costs of federal public 
servants' pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is neither right nor fair that taxpayers are having to save 
up more and more for their own retirement, when public servants 
are contributing less and less.  Fairness to our employees 
cannot take precedence over the fairness we owe Canadian 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, public service, RCMP and National Defence 
services pension plans have built up a surplus of approximately 
$30 billion.  Regardless of what employee unions think, this 
money belongs to Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, it is taxpayers who have absorbed all the 
deficits run up by government employee pension plans.  It is 
taxpayers who have therefore assumed all the risks while our 
employees rested easy in the knowledge that their retirement was 
looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing legislation provides for mechanisms to manage 
pension plan deficits, but none for accumulated surpluses.  In 
other words, the existing legislation accounts for surpluses, 
but the government, and therefore taxpayers, must assume all 
deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will address surpluses and deficits alike, and will 
provide for mechanisms to dispose of future surpluses.  Existing 
surpluses will gradually be reduced to an acceptable level over 
a period of up to 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People may wonder how we propose to dispose of any surpluses in 
the future.  As things now stand—and this is what the bill 
provides for right now—Treasury Board will decide how these 
surpluses will be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if representatives of present and retired employees 
were to agree to share the risks with Canadian taxpayers, we are 
completely prepared to co-manage and therefore to share any 
future surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could, for example, decide together to give a contributions 
holiday to plan participants, or to the employer, or both, or to 
withdraw all or part of the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will ensure the long term financial stability of our 
employees' pension funds.  To that end, it will create a public 
sector pension investment board, which will be responsible for 
investing future employer and employee contributions in the 
stock market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, contributions are used only to purchase government 
savings bonds.  In future, their investment in diversified 
portfolios will give a better yield and thus will make it 
possible to offer a better guarantee for the future, to limit 
the increase in costs, and eventually to improve benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a 1% improvement in the long term performance of 
the public service plan could reduce its overall costs by 15% to 
20%.  This new public sector pension investment board will be 
completely independent of the government and of plan 
participants.  It will therefore be totally free in its 
investment decisions, having the sole objective of maximizing 
the holdings of the public sector pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other public pension funds in the country already make 
market investments.  This new provision will enable more 
Canadian businesses access to a new source of financing.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be of the utmost interest to our employees.  If the 
return on the investments which I just mentioned is lower than 
expected, employees would receive the same level of pension to 
which they had contributed during their careers, including 100% 
inflation protection.  The government guarantees the integrity of 
the benefits of our employee pension funds and will continue to 
cover the shortfalls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 is part of an overall plan.  It re-establishes 
fairness between taxpayers and our employees in the funding of 
the pension plans.  It strengthens the long term sustainability 
of the plans and will attempt to reduce the costs for all 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part, Bill C-71, the budget implementation act, proposes 
improvements to the Public Service Superannuation Act, the 
Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pension benefits will be calculated in the future using the 
average of the best five consecutive years of earnings rather 
than the best six consecutive years, as in the current plan, 
applying a five year average of the year's maximum pensionable 
earnings to calculate the CPP/QPP related reduction, rather than 
using the current three year average.  In short, the government 
will increase employee pensions while freezing contributions to 
the employee plan for at least four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 also includes a series of technical changes to improve 
the benefits linked to federal employee pension plans.  It will 
reduce the contribution rate of the supplementary death benefit 
plan, the government's group life insurance program, and increase 
the paid-up benefit amount.  It will reduce by 25% the 
contribution rate of employees who contribute at the rate of five 
cents per month for every $250 of coverage.  It will double to 
$10,000 the benefit to eligible employees having already reached 
age 65 and it will extend eligibility for paid-up benefits and 
delay the onset of coverage reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these improvements will be made possible by a $1 billion 
surplus in the supplementary death benefits account, due in part 
to increased life expectancies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will also award survivor benefits to same-sex spouses 
who apply for them.  The applicable criteria will be the same as 
for common-law spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would do away with Treasury Board's discretionary power 
in relation to survivor benefits and will set criteria for 
eligibility for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada would thus be bringing its pension 
plans into line with those of the governments of Nova Scotia, 
British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan. 
We would also be in compliance with a number of recent decisions 
by courts favouring the granting of benefits to same sex 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions would also apply to members' pensions.  These 
changes will increase the number of people entitled to 
survivor's benefits under the terms of the three major pension 
plans to some 50 new beneficiaries a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will also finally establish a separate pension plan for 
Canada Post employees.  It makes sense for Canada Post to manage 
its own pension plan, as all major employers do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan would come into effect on October 1, 2000 and would 
reflect the reform to the Public Service Superannuation Act. 
The value of past service for pension purposes will be totally 
protected.  Employee benefits will be the same as under the 
Public Service Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms of the plan would be negotiable under the terms of the 
Canada Labour Code after one year of activity.   The 
negotiations would not affect benefits accumulated to date. 
However, in negotiations held after October 1, 2001, Canada Post 
and its employees' bargaining agents could negotiate change as 
they wish.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the plan to be self-sufficient, future contributions by 
employees and the Corporation would be invested in the market in 
accordance with the Pensions Benefits Standards Regulations. 
Canada Post could set up an independent investment office to 
oversee investments.  Under the bill, the Canada Post 
Corporation should also establish a life insurance program 
similar to the supplementary death benefit plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post retirees will also be happy to learn that Canada 
Post intends to established a shared cost voluntary dental plan, 
which would cover their survivors and eligible dependants. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure members of the House that these measures are in 
no way an indication of plans to privatize Canada Post.  Separate 
pension plans already exist for other crown corporations, such as 
the CBC and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  These 
plans have not been privatized, nor will they be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that our proposed technical amendments to the 
three public service pension plans are realistic and fair.  They 
will be beneficial to all of the stakeholders, namely, our 
employees, the government and ultimately Canadian taxpayers. 
Some people will blame us for having acted unilaterally in 
determining these major changes to our employees' pension plans. 
However, we have to remind the House that we have consulted with 
our partners over many months on the challenges that I have just 
described, but unfortunately we were unable to reach an agreement 
on the necessary reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time to act is long overdue.  The action we are taking is 
being taken in a spirit of fairness, both toward our employees 
and toward all Canadian taxpayers.  As I have tried to show in 
the past few minutes, this bill will modernize and improve the 
public service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of our public servants and the work which they do on 
behalf of all Canadians.  I am convinced that the majority of 
them believe we are acting to protect their future retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I hope that all members of the House will support the 
government and will vote in favour of Bill C-78. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise this morning to take part in this 
initial debate on Bill C-78, an act to establish the public 
sector pension investment board, to amend the Public Service 
Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, the Defence 
Services Pension Continuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Pension Continuation Act, the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada Post Corporation Act, and 
to make a consequential amendment to another act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the minister's comments with some interest.  In 
his concluding remarks he mentioned that he felt this legislation 
was fair.  I suspect it would be most fair for the government in 
its administration of the affairs of Canada, and perhaps least 
fair for the Canadian taxpayers.  On that basis I would like to 
focus the majority of my time today speaking to several of the 
technical aspects of the bill before us.  I am sure that a number 
of my Reform colleagues later today will focus on other specific 
aspects of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to establish an independent public 
sector pension investment board with a mandate to invest employee 
and employer pension contributions that were made under the 
public service, the Canadian forces and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, if passed, will become effective on April 1, 2000. 
It would also allow the Canada Post Corporation to establish an 
independent pension plan by October of next year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would amend these present plans so that the employee 
contribution rate under each is set independently from those 
under the Canada pension plan.  It would de-link the CPP from 
these plans, as it was originally linked when the CPP was 
established.  Employee rates under each plan would be frozen 
until the year 2003, but would rise from 10% to 40% of the cost 
of the plans in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government would pay 60% of the cost, it would also 
claim all of the surpluses.  While the government would be 
responsible for all actuarial deficits, and we can expect that 
there will be actuarial deficits in the years ahead, the main 
benefit to the government would be the ability to claim the 
present $30 billion surplus.  I will talk about that a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three existing pension advisory committees would be changed 
so that employees would have some say in the design, 
administration and funding of the plans, and there would be 
employee representatives on these committees.  I try to give 
credit where credit is due, but unfortunately this bill does not 
go far enough.  In the balance of priorities it falls short. 
Employee representation is a far cry from the employees 
administering the funds, and that is not what we are calling for. 
Would the advice they offer be accepted or rejected?  What 
influence would they really have?  Is this mere window dressing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other proposed changes include improvements to life insurance 
components of the public service plan and the extension of 
survivor benefits.  This is again on the plus side.  This 
includes the extension of benefits to same sex partners, but it 
does so without any reference to gender.  The convoluted wording 
and the ambiguity in the bill in this respect is unacceptable. 
When reading this section of the bill we do not really know what 
the government means at all with respect to who is entitled to 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of extending survivor benefits is not large, but rather 
small, amounting to a quarter of one per cent or approximately $5 
million a year.  However, as I am sure members are aware, these 
changes have been anticipated for some time now and like many of 
my colleagues I have received correspondence on this issue from 
concerned pensioners who are worried about the proposed changes. 
There has also been a significant amount of press coverage on 
this issue.  I am sure that as we debate this issue over the next 
few weeks we will hear even more from people who are concerned 
about the proposed changes in Bill C-78.  I invite Canadians to 
continue to raise their concerns with their members of parliament 
and with the government itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are unaware of why this is such a volatile issue, 
I can sum it up in one word, “surplus”.  There is a $30 billion 
surplus on which the government is itching to get its hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently read Paul Polango's book, <I>The Last Guardians:  The 
Crisis of the RCMP and Canada</I>.  He makes an interesting point. 
In the funding he shows that in the years 1996-97 the budgeted 
costs for the RCMP were $1,925,700,000.  The receipts, though, 
which do not go to the RCMP but into general revenues, come to 
almost three-quarters of a billion dollars.  Therefore, instead 
of $1.9 billion it comes out to $1.2 billion as the net cost of 
the RCMP to the government.  This is not really reflected in the 
costs of the RCMP because revenue to the RCMP is not balanced off 
against its account but goes into general revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense that is what is happening here too.  It is estimated 
that the surplus for this pension plan hovers at about $30 
billion.  With the way in which this pension is structured the 
money is more like a paper IOU rather than ready cash, but it 
still accounts for approximately one-fifth of the government's 
massive $6 billion debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past decade the government has already raided 
approximately $10 billion of the surplus and used that money to 
help to reduce some of the huge deficit racked up during the high 
spending eighties and nineties while still allowing for the 
wasteful spending of taxpayer money on programs such as the great 
Canadian flag giveaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like they are doing with the massive employment insurance 
surplus that has built up in recent years, government members are 
saying this money is theirs and they have a legitimate claim to 
take from this fund whenever they need a little extra cash 
because they would be responsible for shortcomings in the future. 
They fail to take into account, however, the burden the taxpayers 
have carried in helping the government overcome the difficulties 
it had resulting from its shortsighted and cynical attempts to 
decide for Canadians what is best for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized labour representatives, on the other hand, state that 
this is their money as their members have contributed to the plan 
in the past and will need the funds in the future.  The money 
should be theirs, they say.  They are calling what the Liberal 
government is doing legalized robbery.  Some have even taken 
legal action or have threatened to take legal action to stop the 
government from taking these surplus funds.  At this time I note 
that the existing legislation Bill C-78 would amend does not 
address who has any right to any surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unions are also upset that the government is not only 
raiding the surplus but is at the same time raising premiums. 
Under the bill the employee contribution would rise to 40% of the 
total contributions to the pension fund.  The unions are 
supportive of their members paying their fair share of pension 
contributions.  These changes will bring it more in line with 
other pension plans.  They are in agreement that with more 
benefits the rise in their members' share of the contribution is 
acceptable.  However, with the government's decision to take the 
surplus in the pension fund, the unions feel that the government 
has crossed the line of what is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the position of the official opposition that these 
surpluses belong to neither the government nor outright to the 
unions.  It is the taxpayers who are the forgotten partner in 
this debate.  It is the taxes they have paid over the years that 
give the government the money it has to satisfy its 70% 
obligation to these pension contributions.  Taxpayers have also 
over the past few years helped pay down the federal deficit and 
now the debt, with the enormous taxes the government has forced 
upon them.  In the past taxpayers have covered $13 billion 
shortfalls in the pension plans and are on the hook for any 
future shortfalls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is wrong to raid this money from the pensioners 
who have contributed to this fund over the years, as have 
Canadian taxpayers contributed to this fund.  We believe that the 
fair and smart thing to do with the pension surplus is to leave 
it inside the pension plans, not only to guarantee the solvency 
of the plans for the members but to cushion taxpayers from any 
potential shortfalls in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the current surplus is quite substantial, there still 
exists a strong possibility that it will be eroded so far that 
the pension fund will go into a deficit position.  It has 
happened before and it will very likely happen again given the 
volatility of the global economic environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would establish the public sector pension investment 
board, a 12 member board situated in the national capital region. 
It would be mandated to manage the funds in the best interest of 
the recipients, ensuring a maximum rate of return on the money 
that would be transferred to the fund, as stated in the bill, 
from the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, the Public Service 
Superannuation Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act.  That varies from the current way plans are 
managed. 
They are currently in long term government bonds, which in 
reality provide very little return.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The board would manage or supervise the management of the 
business and affairs of the funds administrators including an 
annual written statement of investment policies, standards and 
procedures for each fund they manage; monitor the officers of the 
board to ensure that they meet these standards; prepare both 
quarterly and annual financial statements for each fund they 
manage; set up conflict management procedures; establish a code 
of conduct for officers and employees of the board; and have 
someone monitor both the application of this code and any 
conflict of interest procedures.  These are all described in 
considerable detail in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the board and the officers who are delegated by the 
board would have the obligation to act honestly and in good faith 
with a view for the best interest of the funds and to act with 
care and diligence.  They are to bring with them any outside 
related knowledge, skill or education that they have and employ 
that in the best interest of the board in the application of 
their duties.  The directors and officers are to abide by all the 
bylaws and guidelines that have been established by the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a director, agent, officer, employee or auditor of the board 
or subsidiary makes a false statement or gives deceptive 
information, he or she would be guilty of an offence and could be 
liable on summary conviction for a jail term of less than a year 
and/or a fine of $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bylaws may be made by the board if they are consistent with the 
act in assisting or guiding the conduct and management of the 
board's business and affairs.  They can deal with the board's 
administration, management or control of their property holdings; 
the calling of meetings; the functions or duties of directors, 
employees or officers; and the establishment of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bylaws will be in effect when passed unless otherwise stated and 
are to be given to the respective ministers and will then be 
forwarded to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also sets up the power to delegate certain powers or 
duties of the board of directors.  However, there are specific 
limits as to what cannot be amended such as the adoption, 
amendment or repeal of bylaws; the establishment of investment 
policies and standards; any vacancy; the remuneration of board 
members; or the approval of any financial statements of the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nominating committee would be established by the President 
of the Treasury Board after consulting with the Minister of 
National Defence and the Solicitor General of Canada.  It would 
be chaired by an independent chairperson who has not or is not 
entitled to pensions from either the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act or the Public Service Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members of the nominating committee are to be chosen as 
representatives from the public service, the Canadian forces or 
the RCMP.  Nominating committee members could be reappointed 
after their five year term expires and removed at any time by the 
minister who appointed them.  Nominating committee members would 
have a variety of influences which would aid in the guidance of 
their decision including the disqualifying factors they should 
look for in directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also sets out a formula for the selection of directors 
who would be appointed by governor in council on the 
recommendation of the minister from a short list submitted by the 
nominating committee.  Directors would hold their office for a 
renewable term of three years and could be removed by an order in 
council.  There would be staggered terms of office so that no 
more than one-third of the board's term would expire in the same 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also sets out the guidelines for the resignation, 
vacancy and remuneration of board members, as well as the 
structure for the appointment, duties and removal of the 
chairperson who is to be chosen by the responsible minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is very specific in stating who cannot be considered as 
board members, listing several instances in which individuals are 
considered disqualified persons.  They include individuals who 
are under 18 years of age, those found to be of unsound mind by 
the court, an agent or employee of the government, an MP, senator 
or provincial politician, an individual who may receive or has 
received pension benefits that are covered by this act or from 
the consolidated revenue fund, an employee or agent of a foreign 
country, or a non-resident of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen so many times since the government began its 
mandate, the opportunity exists with this legislation for the 
government to use the board as a patronage reward for those who 
have supported the party in one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government insists that the board is to be independent and 
at arm's length from the government.  However, like we have seen 
time and again with the government, it does not always honour its 
word in this respect.  I am hoping that I am being a bit cynical. 
However the Liberal past practice in this regard has been most 
disappointing.  The high degree of cabinet and ministerial 
discretion this act allows makes it hard for me to believe that 
they will not take advantage of this as another patronage 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fiscal year of this board would be the same date as that for 
the government.  Bill C-78 would establish the procedures and 
parameters for the financial books and systems of the board. They 
are to have quarterly and annual financial statements that are to 
be approved by the board.  There is also to be an auditor chosen 
annually by the board of directors to audit the financial 
statements of the board in accordance with acceptable accounting 
procedures.  One wonders what the definition for acceptable 
accountable procedures would be considering the debate now going 
on between the government and the Auditor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor of the funds could be removed at any time by the 
board.  The bylaws are to be made public and are available at the 
board office.  The auditor has access to any documents from 
current or former board directors, officers, employees or the 
like in the preparation of the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ease with which the board could change or dismiss auditors 
is a concern for me.  I am concerned that the board holds the 
power to change auditors at its whim, which may not be in the 
best interest of pensioners.  The manner in which it can appoint 
and change auditors also does little to ease my concerns about 
the accountability both to parliament and to the pensioners to 
whom the board should be ultimately responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quarterly financial statements are to go to the responsible 
minister, as well as to the minister of defence and the solicitor 
general, within 45 days of the end of that quarter.  Annual 
reports are also to go to these ministers within 90 days after 
the end of that fiscal year and are to be tabled in parliament no 
later than 15 days thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This annual report is to include the financial statements, the 
auditors reports as well as the objectives of the board for the 
past year and for the foreseeable future.  A summary of its 
policies, standards and procedures; its code of conduct for 
officers and employees; and the report of any special audit is 
also to be included in the annual report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than the annual report there is little reporting to 
parliament.  I have some difficulties with this especially 
considering the high degree of power the minister and the cabinet 
have with relation to the establishment and the operation of the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board in effect is entrusted with the pension funds of some 
300,000 retirees and 345,000 members of the federal public 
service.  I would have liked to have seen more accountability to 
parliamentarians in the bill so that we could ensure the best 
interest of pensioners affected are indeed being looked after. 
With the government priority to raid surplus funds, what is the 
government's priority for its retirees?  As I mentioned 
throughout my speech today I have serious concerns about the 
overall lack of accountability to the pensioners covered by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area I would like to briefly highlight today and will 
elaborate on during later stages of the debate is the exemption 
of the legislation from the information sought through the Access 
to Information Act.  Why is the government so afraid of public 
scrutiny?  What is being hidden? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is intended to be kept from public scrutiny?  This secrecy 
is very disturbing.  This does not ensure us that the board 
members are totally accountable.  By not having access to this 
very important tool, the Access to Information Act, this 
legislation is not as transparent as it must be.  I believe the 
government should seriously reconsider this omission and make the 
Access to Information Act available through this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in this bill, the minister may appoint an auditor to do a 
special audit on the board or subsidiary, or may also cause a 
special examination to be carried out to ensure that it has met 
the requirements of the act.  This special examination must be 
carried out at least every six years, and before this takes 
place, the minister must consult with the minister of defence and 
the solicitor general.  The cabinet may also make a variety of 
regulations respecting the application of the board and 
subsidiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada is opposing the bill.  I would like 
to outline five significant reasons, among many, why I will be 
opposing the bill.  I will summarize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill allows the government to raid the fund's 
surpluses beginning with the existing $30 billion surplus.  This 
raid reminds me of the infamous national energy program where the 
federal government helped itself to an excess of $60 billion of 
petroleum revenues that belonged to the affected provinces, 
primarily the province of Alberta.  Bill C-78 gives the federal 
government authority to claim pension money for its general 
revenues and, in effect, another surtax on public service 
employees and Canadian taxpayers who are contributing to these 
pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill would give the government authority to provide 
new same sex benefits without debating family and same sex 
relationships that would be affected.  I think this is a back 
door way of dealing with the issue, and it is not acceptable. 
Public policy must be changed in the open and not in the back 
door through a bill like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill provides an open door for the government to make 
unchallenged patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, while the bill would provide parliament with after the 
fact reports from the minister responsible, altogether too much 
business will be conducted behind closed doors with no provision 
to use even the Access to Information Act.  Such secrecy is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth and last, why is the auditor general not the auditor given 
the mandate to annually audit this fund and the administration of 
these funds?  Why is it not in the open for the auditor general 
to make his examination and report to parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are changes that I believe need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, therefore, like to move a motion at this time.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK34">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78, an act to establish the Public Sector Pension 
Investment Board, to amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, 
the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension 
Continuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension 
Continuation Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act and the Canada Post Corporation Act and to make a 
consequential amendment to another act, be not now read a second 
time but that it be read a second time this day six months hence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  In my opinion the 
amendment is in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I welcome this opportunity to express my opinion and that of the 
Bloc Quebecois regarding Bill C-78, which was just tabled by the 
government, and the amendment that was just moved by the Reform 
Party member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first want to quote many people who wrote to us to express 
their disgust in seeing the government try to get its hands on 
the pension fund surplus to which they contributed and still 
contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the ministers to listen carefully. 
This is a rare opportunity for them to be in contact with the 
reality in this country and to learn first-hand what voters think 
of their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter to which I am referring begins like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to plunder my pension fund. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that it is the author of that letter who uses 
the word “plunder”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member is well 
aware that quoting from a letter is no excuse for using 
unparliamentary language. Therefore, I am asking her to be very 
careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne:</B> Madam Speaker, I will continue quoting 
from the letter nonetheless: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been proud to work in the public service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I think this pride has definitely taken a beating 
recently.  I will go on reading this letter, which was written 
by a Quebecker whom I will not name, because I did not have the 
time to contact him to ask for permission. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always easy because, as is now the case, the public 
service is the target of ambitious but petty politicians, such 
as— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then gives the name of the President of the Treasury Board, 
which I obviously will not read.  The letter goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our salaries have been frozen and the government has passed 
arbitrary back-to-work legislation instead of negotiating fairly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the writer conclude? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still the victims of political ambition. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And he goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance wants to become Prime Minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer any big secret that the Minister of Finance 
wants his boss's job.  The writer then says the following about 
the Minister of Finance: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has his eye on the pension plan surplus, which he sees as 
easy money for lowering the national debt.  He wants to make a 
name for himself as the one who lowered the debt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should listen to this message.  It is an 
impassioned plea from a public servant who is fed up with the 
government's offhandedness. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfair for the government to put its hands on the public 
service pension plans in order to reduce the debt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot do otherwise than to agree with this. The author of 
this letter adds: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless it also proposes to do the same to the surpluses in a 
number of private plans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder: is this prophetic?  We shall see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I would ask you to listen to the way the author 
ends his letter—and he has taken the trouble to underline these 
words, which goes to show how important he felt that his message 
was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tell these arrogant characters to keep their hands off my 
pension fund. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat this message, so that everyone will understand it 
clearly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tell these arrogant characters to keep their hands off my 
pension fund. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear.  I want this Quebec public servant to know that he 
is not the only one opposed to the government's attempt to get 
its hands on his pension fund. 
We are vehemently opposed to a number of the reforms proposed by 
the government in Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is supposedly designed to ensure the long-term 
viability of the public sector pension funds.  This is an 
in-depth reform of the administration of these funds as we now 
know it.  The bill is going to modify the way plans established 
under the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Pension Act and the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focal point of the legislation is the creation of the Public 
Sector Pension Investment Board to be responsible for 
administering the pension funds, which will in future be 
partially invested in the stock market. 
The government is announcing that the bill is improving the 
financial management of pension funds and employees' and 
retirees' benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, blinded by its own all too obvious arrogance, this 
government was not going to reveal all the unfortunate 
consequences of this bill to us.  Should everything in this bill 
be pitched?  No.  It even contains some good ideas and some good 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill in fact contains some things that will improve the 
situation of workers in the federal government.  Former 
employees, now retired, will also enjoy certain benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first improvement is in the number of years of service used 
in calculating the basic benefits a retiring public servant is 
entitled to. 
At the moment, basic benefits are calculated on the salary of 
the six best years of uninterrupted service.  The calculation 
will now be based on five years, rather than six. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out the change in the formula for calculating 
the public servant's pension benefit to shrink the amount of the 
pension benefit reduction when he reaches age 65 and receives as 
well his Quebec or Canada pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main positive change involves the investment of 
contributions in public markets.  For a long time now, a number 
of stakeholders, including employers' organizations, have been 
suggesting that pension funds be invested on the stock market. 
That is already being done in a number of countries, and the 
return on this sort of investment is higher than if the money 
had remained in government coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, the Auditor General of Canada examined the connection 
between the management of our debt and employees' pension plans. 
In his report, he pointed out the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial managers, actuaries and government officials generally 
agree that, in the long term, a diversified market security 
portfolio generates higher rates of return than the interest 
credited to pension accounts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general even retained the services of consulting 
actuaries to compare the theoretical return on investment of the 
pension fund on the markets to the investment strategy in 
notional bonds, which was adopted for pension plans during a 31 
year period, from 1959 to 1990. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230
<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These consulting actuaries came to the conclusion that a market 
investment strategy would have generated higher annual rates of 
return, by 1.5% to 2.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That component of the reform should ensure a higher return than 
the existing rate for the public service pension plan. This is a 
step in the right direction, since the bill will ensure a return 
that will more closely match that of private pension plans. 
There will be an independent fund with real money in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But—and there is always a but—this is by no means the perfect 
solution. 
Some provisions of the bill must absolutely be amended to avoid 
future disputes between the government and its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the appointment of the directors of the board. 
The President of the Treasury Board will appoint eight people 
who will form a selection committee. These eight people will 
provide a list of names to the President of the Treasury Board, 
who will recommend 12 of these people to the governor in council 
who, in turn, will appoint them directors of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that while the bill provides that the employees' 
representative is appointed to the selection committee, there is 
no requirement for the President of the Treasury Board to then 
recommend that person for the position of director. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see who the other members of the committee are. 
There is a chairperson appointed by the minister after 
consultation with a few other ministers concerned, specifically 
the Minister of National Defence and the Solicitor General of 
Canada.  All signs are that this chairperson will be a friend of 
the Liberal Party and not an employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other directors, it is more of the same, because 
there is only one public servant on the nominating committee. 
The government will not saddle itself with such a person on its 
board of directors if it does not have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the government follow the example of the 
Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.  In addition to the 
director general of the Caisse and the president of the Régie 
des rentes du Québec, the Caisse's incorporating statute 
provides for nine other individuals to sit on the board of 
directors. 
Of these, two must be public servants or directors of a 
government body, another must be a representative of an employee 
association, and another must be a director of a co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the composition of this board of directors is much more 
representative of the various stakeholders in the business world 
than what the federal government is paving the way for with Bill 
C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the shortcomings of this bill is the lack of predictable 
representation of beneficiaries of the pension plans operated by 
the future fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another shortcoming has to do with the use of any future fund 
surpluses. 
Bill C-78 amends the Public Service Superannuation Act by adding, 
among others, clause 44.4, which will leave the government free 
to take three possible courses of action in the event of a 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it will be able to reduce employee contributions for the 
period that the minister determines.  Second, it will be able to 
reduce Treasury Board contributions in the same manner. 
Finally, the surplus amount the Treasury Board determines may be 
paid out of the Public Service Pension Fund and into the 
Consolidated Revenue Fund, still on the minister's 
recommendation.  Our fear is that this way of operating will 
turn the future fund into another cash cow for the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in any way imputing motives to the government, for it 
has already stated its intention to get its hands on the 
surpluses in the public service pension plans.  Public servants 
are continually calling for the government “not to be allowed to 
get its hands on our surplus”, while the Treasury Board is busy 
manoeuvring in order to be able to do just that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These surpluses are estimated at more than $30 billion.  As at 
March 31, 1998, in other words more than one year ago, the 
public service pension plan reported a surplus of $14.9 billion, 
the RCMP's plan $2.4 billion, and the Armed Forces' plan $12.9 
billion, for a total of $30.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a lot of money, and obviously it could repay part of the 
debt, or fund phase II of the millennium scholarship program. 
Obviously, getting its hands on such a sum would—as my 
correspondent whom I have just quoted pointed out—allow it to 
score a lot of points politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government is wrong.  The minister responsible for the 
public service is wrong.  By getting its hands on its employees' 
superannuation funds, the government is trying to score points 
politically.  This approach did not succeed when it got its 
hands on the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is immoral for the government, which happens also to be the 
legislator, to take advantage of the fact that there are no 
legislative provisions relating to the present surplus to dip 
its fingers into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, there are 275,000 people paying into the 
fund, 160,000 government retirees, and 52,000 surviving spouses, 
who are watching the government meddle with their pension funds. 
It is true that there is a legislative vacuum when it comes to 
handling the present surplus.  The legislation to remedy that 
lack ought to call for part of the surplus to go back to the 
employees and the pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recently tried to justify its argument that any 
surplus belongs to it, because it is the one guaranteeing that 
public servants will get a pension. Indeed, the President of the 
Treasury Board recently explained that, since the government has 
had to shell out money in the past to ensure that public 
servants would have a pension when there was a deficit in the 
fund, it is only normal that the government should get any 
surplus. This is absolutely not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The normal thing to do would have been to lower employees' 
contributions, particularly when it was realized that a huge 
surplus was accumulating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument used by the President of the Treasury Board is also 
indicative of inadequate management by this government. Indeed, 
there is every reason to think that if, a few years ago, the 
government had set up a real retirement fund and had invested 
the money on the market, there would have been no deficit, or 
hardly any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Auditor General of Canada came to that conclusion 
in one of its reports released in 1994. He wrote, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The higher rates of return that the pension accounts could have 
earned, had a market investment strategy been followed over the 
long term, could have substantially reduced or totally 
eliminated these actuarial deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the deficit and debt accumulation could have been 
lower if a market investment strategy for the pension accounts 
had been followed from the start. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many employees have been asking for a long time that their 
superannuation fund be invested on the stock market, something 
that the government has so far refused to do. Now, these 
employees are being relieved of their fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be careful, because it is sending two 
negative messages to society. First, it is telling the public 
that it does not believe in fairness. In this particular case, 
fairness requires that part of the current surplus be applied to 
the pensions of current retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board is certainly aware—but are 
the other members of his government?—that the average annual 
pension benefits paid to former government employees is $9,680. 
These pensioners will not get rich on that kind of money.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government is telling other employers that it 
is alright to use the money in their employees' pension funds. 
For instance, a municipality might have a road to build but not 
have enough money to finance the project.  What could it do?  it 
could use its employees' pension fund. 
A company might wish to eliminate a recent deficit.  What could 
it do?  It could dip into its employees' pension fund.  The 
federal government is setting a dangerous precedent that may 
affect labour relations in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting today, the government must follow the example set by 
one of its own backbenchers, the member for Thunder Bay—Atitokan, 
who wrote in <I>The Chronicle Journal</I> as recently as March 29 that 
the government was again going to meet with public service 
employee representatives on the issue of pension fund surpluses 
in order to come up with an agreement acceptable to both 
parties.  The member concluded his letter with the statement 
that he was confident that such an agreement would be worked 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the member for Thunder Bay—Atitokan, like 
many others in his party who dare not express their views for 
fear of being sidelined, will lose their trust in this 
government that refuses to negotiate with its employees, the 
most basic form of civic-mindedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So as not to lose the often too-blind trust of its party members, 
and the slowly but surely declining trust of the public, the 
government must scrap the provisions in its bill that allow the 
unilateral diversion of $30 billion in surplus pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to helping those who are now retired, future 
negotiations between the government and public service employees 
would lead to the conclusion that it is a good idea to transfer 
the present pension fund surplus into the retirement fund this 
bill sets out to create.  The new fund would thus have start-up 
capital.  This is the only way of ensuring the fund's viability 
vis-à-vis the many challenges it will have to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these challenges is the imminent retirement of the many 
baby boomers.  The pension fund will be hard put to keep up. 
We must, however, remember that the current hiring rate in the 
public service is fairly low and that, accordingly, fewer 
workers will be paying into the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future fund must have a reserve of its own, in order to 
provide for a possible and probable need for money. 
Transferring the current surplus would seem appropriate to fill 
this role.  The surplus will serve as well to cover unavoidable 
losses from investments in the stock market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that a number of investment firms suffered in the 
recent Asian crash, primarily those whose portfolios were not 
sufficiently diversified.  Even the auditor general's report for 
1994 shows that, according to his findings, in certain 
periods—from 1970 to 1974 and from 1985 to 1990—a market 
investment strategy might not have produced the best results. It 
would have been useful to have a little room to manoeuvre, a bit 
of a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these various reasons, I hope the government will return to 
bargaining with its employees rather than try to have this bill 
passed.  It only partly resolves the current problems of 
managing a pension fund.  Accordingly, the government can make 
off with the money, no doubt causing increased tensions between 
the government and its employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I am passing the message along to the President of the 
Treasury Board: “Do not unilaterally take over the surplus in 
the pension fund.  Instead, put your bill on the back burner, 
while you reach an agreement with your employees on how to use 
the surplus.  And, most importantly, stop governing 
autocratically”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are now in the 
period of 20 minutes for debate and 10 minutes for questions and 
comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to speak to the motion and to the amendment to the motion. 
I firmly believe that the hoist motion was a very good idea 
because six months time may add some measure of reason to what is 
going on.  I am confident that within six months the two parties 
may reach the outcome that there be a negotiated settlement on 
what to do with the pension surplus in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the President of the Treasury Board is in for the 
fight of his political life if he continues on the road of moving 
forward with Bill C-78.  In the short time I have been here I 
have not seen the firing up of so much interest over an issue. 
The idea of taking, clawing back, or whatever we want to call the 
grab for the $30 billion surplus is such an emotional flashpoint 
with so many people across the country.  I predict interest of 
the kind we have not really seen since Brian Mulroney tried to 
deindex the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Brian Mulroney tried to deindex the Canada pension plan he 
started a grey hair revolution, a blue rinse uprising of senior 
citizens who demanded that it be stopped. Brian Mulroney and his 
government to their credit had the common sense to back off. They 
did not want to take on that group of people.  They are the most 
powerful voting constituency in the country.  Senior citizens, 
pensioners and retirees are well organized, well informed and 
they vote. They do not stay at home and grumble.  They get on 
their feet, come out and vote at voting time.  They are gearing 
up around this issue.  As I said, I have not seen a level of 
interest like this on any issue since I have been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today seniors organizations are on the hill.  They are paying 
close attention to the first day of debate on Bill C-78.  The 
Armed Forces Pensioners, the Association of Public Service 
Alliance Retirees, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, 
the CLC, the Canadian Pensioners Concerned, the Congress of Union 
Retirees of Canada, the Federal Superannuates National 
Association are all here.  I did a quick tally and they represent 
over 1.5 million retirees and pensioners.  They are watching this 
debate in West Block in a room which I rented for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that the hoist motion is at least the first 
glimmer of hope that possibly we can add some voice of reason to 
this whole debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not finish the list. There are others, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Veterans Association, the United Senior Citizens 
of Ontario Incorporated, the Ontario Coalition of Senior Citizens 
Organizations, the One Voice Seniors Network, and on and on.  Do 
the President of the Treasury Board and the government really 
want to take on those people?  They should think twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the talks broke down it led to the introduction of this 
legislation.  But the talks were not going that badly.  Progress 
was being made.  Virtually all of the clauses in Bill C-78, in 
the hundreds of pages of text, were agreed to by both parties. 
Some benefits were increased.  Obviously the representatives of 
the pensioners were pleased about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually everything else was agreed to, with the exception of 
this enormous, and I will avoid unparliamentary terms, grab of 
$30 billion from the pension fund.  I suppose the representation 
of the pension investment board was another hot point. But these 
were not insurmountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representatives of the pensioners were quite yielding in 
their arguments.  It is a basic tenet of the trade union movement 
that all pension surpluses are the sole property of the employee. 
They are not the employers' money to use as they see fit.  They 
are deferred wages.  It is our money, speaking on behalf of 
working people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representatives of the employees at the table were willing 
to move on that.  I have heard figures.  I will not mention them 
here but they were willing to share that $30 billion, some going 
to improve benefits and some going back to the employer to use as 
they saw fit, but not all of it.  That is where the impasse arose 
with the $30 billion.  There was no hint of increasing benefits 
to the retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker did a good job of pointing out what these 
retirees are really making.  There are more women in that 
beneficiary group than there are men.  The average woman with 20 
years of service makes a pension of $9,600 a year.  Whoopee.  It 
is a pension and I am sure they are glad to have a pension but it 
is not exactly a fat, lucrative pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $30 billion divided among all the beneficiaries would be 
$30,000 a year for each of them spread out over the term of the 
period they collect.  That could make a significant difference 
between living in poverty or living in some kind of financial 
security during their senior years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic the theme the government chose for international 
women's day this year.  Because it is the year of older persons 
the government chose “going strong, celebrating older women”. 
It should be “going wrong, robbing older women” because that is 
what the government is doing with this $30 billion grab of the 
pension surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 is a history of failures.  It is a failure to 
negotiate.  It is a failure to reach a conclusion by negotiation 
which was within reach.  It is a failure to manage the workforce 
adequately.  It is a failure in developing satisfactory 
relationships with employees where the government could deal with 
an issue like this at the table as civilized people as should be 
done.  It is a failure of epic proportions to live up to the 
promises of former Liberal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Les Barnes, a former PIPS leader, wrote a letter to the editor. 
Mr. Barnes was present in 1967 when a firm guarantee was made by 
the Pearson government that the terms and conditions of the plan 
would never be amended by unilateral government action.  Never. 
That was the trade-off to keep it off the bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensions are usually part of the collective bargaining process 
but the government wanted it removed and separated.  The 
government did not want it to be dealt with at the bargaining 
table.  Okay, it was a deal.  It was an arrangement, a pact, a 
contract.  The government would not talk about pensions at the 
bargaining table and the terms and conditions of the plan would 
never, ever unilaterally be altered. It is being done today in 
Bill C-78 and done very dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Barnes also talked about the Minister of Finance at the 
time, Walter Gordon, who wrote to the national joint council of 
the public service assuring its members that as a result of the 
integration of the plans, which is what they were trying to 
achieve then, there would be no increase in the rate of 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 is jacking up the rate of contributions by 33%, from 
30% of the total contributions to 40%, one-third of an increase. 
The government is jacking up the contributions and taking the 
surplus out in one fell swoop.  It is no wonder the seniors 
movement is mobilizing and building up a good head of steam to 
come to Ottawa and tell this Liberal government what they really 
think of Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made a very good and revealing speech.  One of the 
first remarks he made was that Bill C-78 is part of an overall 
plan.  You are darn right it is part of an overall plan. The 
government takes $25 billion out of the EI fund from unemployed 
workers and then it takes $30 billion from retired senior 
citizens, many of whom are living on an income of $9,600 a year. 
It is a plan all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is going to pay down the debt on the 
backs of the most vulnerable people in the country, unemployed 
workers and senior citizen women.  My mom is one of those senior 
citizen women.  She is 82 years old and is living on a public 
service pension plan.  She is glad to have it but she is not 
exactly living well. Who is next? The government will be stealing 
pencils from blind men's cups. It is getting ridiculous when we 
think of the choices the government is making in terms of the 
grabbing it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the Pearson years and so on and the current Prime 
Minister was part of that cabinet.  He was a part of the promise 
to not ever unilaterally alter the terms and conditions of the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 and 1992 the dialogue really began to amend this plan to 
make the changes that everybody agreed were necessary. 
At that time the union agreed to the private investment board, 
the 12 person board that was talked about earlier.  Had we 
reached agreement at that time and started investing privately, 
God knows where that plan would be now. Those were some very good 
high interest years.  That $30 billion might be $100 billion and 
we could really make some changes to the benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the advisory committee made a report and it struck 
another committee, a consultation group to start fine tuning 
things.  This is when the issue of the use of the surplus came to 
a head. In the last month of 1998 the consultative group broke 
down over the surplus and representation.  Then in March 1999, 
rather than trying to pull the pieces back together, Bill C-78 
was sprung on us.  Really, it is an abrogation.  It is an 
admission of failure or an admission of inability on the part of 
government to manage its concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about all the nuances of the bill and a few of its 
good qualities.  I will point out the things the retirees are 
glad to see in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a dental plan for the first time ever, albeit a 
lousy dental plan because it has a $200 deductible. I have been 
dealing with employee benefit plans all my working life as a 
manager of these plans and as a negotiator of union agreements. 
I have never seen a $200 deductible in a dental plan in my life. 
I do not know what kind of deal has been made or who the carrier 
of that plan is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recognition of same sex couples we applaud fully.  We are 
extremely critical that the government tried to sneak this in and 
wrap it up in a package of things that obviously no working 
person can support.  It has been rolled in there to make it very 
difficult.  It is a very cynical way of dealing with the good and 
the bad aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase going from six years down to five years with two 
years vesting, all these things obviously we can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big problem clearly is the use of the pension surplus and I 
will try to limit my remarks to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem lies in the attitude of senior officials and the 
minister himself.  Here is a quote from Alain Jolicoeur, the 
chief human resources officer of the Treasury Board Secretariat 
in 1998.  He said “Employees and retirees have no proprietary 
interest to the surplus in the superannuation plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Plain and simple, we are that diametrically opposed.  We argue 
that all pension surpluses are the sole property of the employees 
to be used only for the improvements of benefits.  That is what 
the whole purpose of a pension plan is.  The other camp is 
diametrically opposed 180 degrees and says there is no 
proprietary benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument is arrived at through a very convoluted bit of 
logic that the minister used again today.  I would like to 
explain how the government arrived at this position that it 
assumes part of the risk.  It assumes all of the risk for a 
deficit in the plan, ergo if there is any profit in the plan it 
is the government's to keep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a letter from Bob White to the 
President of the Treasury Board which was written in March. He 
puts it very well in one simple paragraph: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typically employers have tried to justify the removal of 
surpluses on the grounds that because they take the risks 
involved in providing defined benefits, therefore they should get 
the reward of the surplus in the form of surplus removal or lower 
employer contributions. This commonly articulated relationship 
between risks and rewards is far too simplistic for two reasons. 
First, the actuarial assumptions that are used to value pension 
liabilities are chosen with a deliberate view to making 
experience gains and surpluses far more likely events than the 
losses and unfunded liabilities. Thus, the risk for which a 
surplus is supposedly the reward is limited.  Second, if 
experience losses occur and employers are stuck with unplanned 
amortization payments, it is impossible to prevent the employers 
from lowering either the pension benefits of other parts of 
employee compensation from the levels they would otherwise have 
achieved. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the downside risks may be shifted to the 
employees despite appearances to the contrary. Really, there is 
very little downside risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the actuarial experts deal with plans, especially in a 
privately invested fund, it is far more likely that a surplus 
will occur than a deficit in the plan.  I would say 10:1 and I am 
pulling that number out of my hat.  If the tradeoff is “I will 
keep all the surpluses, but if there is a deficit, I will assume 
the risk there too”, that is a very good bet, frankly.  In a 
gambling hall that would be a very safe bet to undertake.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really the issue.  That is what is going to fire up the 
country.  It is only just beginning.  This is day one of what 
will prove to be a very long debate.  We are talking about a huge 
amount of money.  We are talking about an amount of money that 
could make a huge difference in the lives of the beneficiaries of 
public service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should put some of the facts on the record.  As of March 1998 
the public service pension plan had a $14.9 billion surplus, the 
RCMP plan had a $2.4 billion surplus and the Canadian forces plan 
had a $12.9 billion surplus.  We should think about how we 
arrived at such huge surpluses.  Nobody should be so bad at his 
or her actuarial research to arrive at such sloppy work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did some very obvious things which led to very 
predictable consequences.  The government froze people's wages 
for seven years.  Obviously, the pension people receive when they 
retire is going to be a heck of a lot lower if the wages are that 
much lower for that period of time.  It is kind of a double 
whammy, and even more so for women.  When the government refuses 
to pay up on pay equity, obviously the women's pension 
calculations will be a heck of a lot lower than they would have 
been had they been receiving fair wages the whole time.  There 
has also been a lower than expected rate of inflation.  We have 
an actuarial anomaly to wind up with this huge pension surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the net effect this whole thing is having on 
the morale of the public sector.  This is a group of workers 
which has suffered indignity after indignity.  Most people go 
into the public sector for a couple of reasons.  They are willing 
to accept lower wages because they trade it off for job security. 
After all the cutting and hacking and slashing and butchering of 
the public sector there is not a whole lot of job security left. 
The sword of Damocles is hanging over their heads every minute. 
Job security is out the window.  There is no longer any reason to 
work for the public security if job security is what you are 
after.  Let us face it, everybody is afraid for their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public servants are still plugging along.  They can expect 
reasonable wage increases, but they have had six to seven years 
of no wage increases.  They are falling way behind the private 
sector.  Not only do they not have job security, what are they 
making?  A carpenter makes eight bucks an hour less than an 
outside carpenter.  I was a union carpenter making $25 an hour 
and the guys working for defence or wherever as carpenters were 
making $15 an hour.  That is not bull.  That was the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least people could take some comfort in the fact they had a 
pretty good pension plan.  Pretty good?  Nine thousand dollars a 
year for 20 years of service.  That is not a pretty good pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, when there is an opportunity to sweeten the plan by taking 
that $30 billion and giving it to the people who paid for it, it 
gets taken away too.  It is no wonder there is poor morale in the 
public sector.  If people are concerned about productivity, or 
whatever the buzzwords are these days, that is certainly 
something they could look at because public servants are 
demoralized and browbeaten.  The government is pushing people too 
far.  That is all there is to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the gender issue once before.  This is very much a 
gender issue.  There are more women beneficiaries than there are 
men, and for good reason.  In the public sector there are a lot 
of clerical-type jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to win the argument on the whole issue of why that money 
is ours.  We think it is ours.  Obviously the minister thinks the 
opposite.  Let us look at why we would argue that it is ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a surplus in a private sector pension plan, the law 
of the province of Ontario is that 90% of employees have to 
approve any employer use of the surplus.  Clearly that 
contemplates that it is the employees' money.  Why else would 
they be required to vote on giving it away? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other evidence is that during public sector negotiations, at 
the bargaining table, the employer, time and time again, says, 
yes, they are getting lower wages and, yes, we will not provide 
much of a raise, but look at the great pension plan.  It clearly 
uses the pension plan as part of the wage package.  It uses it 
against the employees at the bargaining table and then reverses 
the argument when bargaining is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is jurisprudence.  Consider CUPE Local 1000 v Ontario 
Hydro.  CUPE initiated a legal challenge in response to Ontario 
Hydro's attempt to take a contribution holiday and it won. 
It won fair and square because the employer did not have the 
right to use the contributions for anything other than the trust 
document dictated, which was to improve the benefits to the 
employees.  It is there on the books and people should be looking 
at it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3, an act to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 
received royal assent in parliament in June 1998.  This 
legislation applies to private plans operating under federal 
jurisdiction.  It requires a two-thirds vote of the employees 
before the employer is allowed to use a single penny of the plan 
for anything other than improving benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is some of the more obvious jurisprudence.  I am sure there 
are many more who would argue that any pension surplus is the 
sole property of the employees who paid into the plan, whether 
the contributions are from the employer or the employee.  It is 
part of the wage package.  It is deferred wages for the 
employees' use and their use only.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the hon. member 
give examples that are not relevant and do not have the same 
pension plan description. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member knows that this is a legislated plan 
that is guaranteed by the government so that all employees and 
retired persons will receive a pension regardless of the economic 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were to be a deficit, the government would have to 
guarantee it, as it did at the time of the $8 billion deficit. 
Does the hon. member think it should be shared risk?  Should the 
union participate in the new plan so that, in effect, if there is 
a surplus it can benefit by it and if there is a deficit it will 
contribute toward it?  Right now it is the Canadian taxpayers who 
guarantee public service pensions to ensure that people receive 
the kind of income that has been guaranteed for 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member talks 
about shared risk, one cannot help but talk about shared 
management.  It has always been the goal of any pension plan to 
have joint trustees; representatives of the employees and the 
employer sitting on the same board, having some control and 
direction over investments made or the direction in which the 
plan might be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this was one of the sore points at the table when talks 
broke down in December 1998.  The government would not allow any 
input from employees in terms of ethical investment funds or 
control of the types of investments that the new public sector 
investment board would make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if the investment board wanted to invest in a janitorial 
company which had contracted with the federal government to clean 
the Wellington Building and, as a result, put public sector plan 
members out of work?  Frankly, under the board's fiduciary 
responsibility, if that janitorial company was paying on the 
stock market one quarter of a point higher than the other 
investment, it would be its obligation to invest there.  There 
can be no other consideration than to maximize the profits of the 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most plans are run that way, but many pension plans qualify the 
fiduciary responsibility by saying that there are secondary 
objectives which they are trying to achieve.  Maybe it is job 
creation for the plan members, or rural or regional economic 
development.  There could be any number of purposes.  When 
dealing with tens of billions of dollars of investment on the 
stock market, it could be directed to achieve secondary and 
tertiary objectives other than purely profit objectives.  That 
fell apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shared risk or responsibility dialogue was taking place at 
the same time.  There is far greater chance of there being a 
surplus than a deficit because of the actuaries who are hired to 
run the plan.  The way that any well managed pension plan is run 
is that premiums are set at a rate which will offset the 
liability at the other end.  Premiums will go up.  In the near 
future we will not see deficits, but rather humongous surpluses.

have done the right thing and are counting on their pensions.  He 
knows, or he should know full well, that these pensions are 
guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think it is appropriate to create this kind 
of mischief and fear among our senior population in this regard? 
Does he acknowledge that those pensions are in fact guaranteed 
and that we need not create this kind of fuss to stir up our 
seniors, as he is doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, nobody has to agitate or 
stir up the most powerful voting constituency in the country. 
They are well informed.  They are well organized.  They can 
mobilize well and they can vote.  That is what I was pointing 
out.  This government should be served notice that it should be 
very cautious about taking on this particular group of Canadians 
because it would do so at its peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, this particular voting constituency could bring the 
government to its knees if provoked, and I have every reason to 
believe that they are being poked in the eye right now.  They are 
are being provoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time in my speech did I ever imply that the current 
defined benefit they are enjoying is at risk.  What I was 
commenting on is that the $30 billion surplus that is going to be 
taken out of the plan could be distributed amongst those low 
income retirees and their level of benefit would improve. 
Frankly, it is a defined benefit and it cannot even be negotiated 
at the bargaining table.  The tacit agreement between the Pearson 
government and the employees at the time was that negotiations 
would never involve the pension.  The pension would be fixed and 
defined by the House of Commons, not at the bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a trade-off.  The promise was that government would 
never alter the terms and conditions of the pension plan 
unilaterally, as it is doing now by jacking up the premiums and 
taking out the surplus.  It is a promise broken.  It is an an 
agreement that has been torn up.  That might be where the hon. 
member got mixed up, if he was not listening carefully. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is amazing how the NDP uses 
information.  I am glad you understood what I was getting at when 
I could not find a word for “untrue” because that is not 
parliamentary language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, in the legislation, as the minister stated earlier 
in his remarks, 7.5% is the number and it is not changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I am curious if the hon. member believes that 
it is not important to get the best return for seniors, that it 
is not important to maximize their numbers.  All he cares about 
is ensuring that the money is invested on a very “good feel 
approach”, as compared to seniors' concerns.  Once they have 
worked and contributed to a pension plan, they want to be assured 
that it is there, and the government continues to assure them 
that that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the coin, we want to ensure that we have 
the best possible management to get the best rate of return, so 
that, in effect, the taxpayers of Canada will not have to invest 
as much and will still give the pensioners their guaranteed 
amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that the rate of return is not 
important to seniors and pensioners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly not.  The trustees 
of any pension plan have an obligation to bring the best rate of 
return possible.  That is their fiduciary responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying is that there are secondary objectives and that 
the beneficiaries should have some input into how that money is 
invested because some of the pensioners may not want to be making 
money by clearing out the last rain forest in the world, or in a 
sweat shop in Nicaragua that is using child labour, or any number 
of those things.  The seniors deserve to at least be able to say 
“Only invest in ethical investment funds”, which may or may not 
give a worse rate of return.  Frankly, the ethical investment 
funds are doing very well.

<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise on Bill C-78.  Let us be clear.  The 
government suggests that the main objective of this legislation 
is to improve the financial management of the three public sector 
pension and superannuation plans.  The government's intention is 
consistent with its intention since 1993 to further concentrate 
its power among a very few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a secular decline in the role of parliament in 
the decisions made that affect Canadians.  It began actually in 
the late 1960s.  This continues and in fact has been expedited by 
the government.  Bill C-78 is a further example of the effort by 
the government to concentrate power in the hands of a very few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased management by the government with this legislation is 
defined as increased control, increased power and increased 
domination.  It is a common characteristic of every initiative 
undertaken by members of the government.  The power that they 
want to increase for themselves comes at a direct cost to 
parliament and to parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that prior to this legislation any change in the 
contribution rate had to be approved by parliament.  After this 
legislation that power will rest with the treasury board 
president at a time when Canadians are saying they want more 
accountability, more input, and parliamentarians need to have 
more responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Mark Twain once said that a bad job is one with lots 
of responsibility but no authority.  Effectively that is what 
parliamentarians are being given these days.  We are given lots 
of responsibility in many ways but really no authority. This is 
one of the areas, the pension plans for public servants, where 
Canadians deserve better.  Canadians deserve due diligence and 
parliamentary participation to ensure that in the long term these 
pension plans survive and are there for the future, and that the 
interest of all Canadians are represented in this public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill effectively provides the mechanism for the government 
to withdraw the current $28 billion surplus from the federal 
pension plan over a period of 15 years, and any future surpluses 
can be withdrawn.  The legislation will permit treasury board 
ministers without parliament in the future to determine the use 
of these surpluses and to set contribution rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The projected surpluses starting in the year 2000 will be about 
$2 billion to $3 billion per year which is a large sum of money. 
To have that money again going directly into the government's 
discretionary spending or being put toward whatever pet projects 
the government wants to pursue at a particular time, particularly 
before an election, is exposing the Liberal government to a 
significant temptation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a temptation the Liberals welcome.  It is one they are 
actually preparing for with this legislation.  They will have 
access to more money to spend on purposes that are important to 
them, to spend on the next election and to spend getting ready by 
bribing Canadians with their own money.  It will not be spent on 
the types of policies that are important for Canadians in the 
future and that will provide for a better quality of life and 
greater competitiveness in the 21st century.  Instead it will be 
spent on the types of policies that will try to convince 
Canadians in the short term that the government has their best 
interest at heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is another example of government contempt and 
lack of appreciation for parliament.  As I mentioned earlier, 
under this legislation there is no provision for parliament to 
hold the government accountable for withdrawals and for changes 
in the contribution rates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is highly analogous to the situation with the EI fund and 
what has happened since 1993.  The government has taken $19 
billion from the EI fund and at the same time has used that money 
to pad its books to make its own fiscal numbers look better than 
they actually are.  It has maintained unnecessarily high EI 
premiums.  At the same time it has reduced benefits in a 
draconian and cruel way in many sectors and in many regions of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently in the EI fund, for instance, only 30% of those people 
who are paying into employment insurance actually qualify when 
they need to collect employment insurance.  The government is 
maintaining this unfair practice simply because it wants access 
to that steady pool of capital, that influx of capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an insatiable thirst for cold hard cash that 
it can spend on unrelated programs and policies.  The government 
has a very circuitous approach to bookkeeping and a number of 
times has offended the auditor general with its less than 
straightforward bookkeeping.  In fact one would need to be a 
forensic auditor to understand some of the provisions in the 
recent budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the government would use the EI fund to facilitate 
spending in other programs is clearly unethical and regressive. 
The amount of EI premiums paid by a Canadian making $39,000 will 
be the same as the amount of premiums being paid by a Canadian 
making $300,000.  It is an inordinately unfair tax on lower and 
middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is comfortable with its practice because it is a 
pool of capital.  It can try to hide behind the guise of having 
an employment insurance program with an EI premium which in fact 
is an EI tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am discussing government treatment of the EI 
program is that it is completely analogous with its proposed 
treatment through Bill C-78 of the superannuation funds.  As I 
mentioned, the government has an insatiable appetite for money. 
It has a questionable approach to financial and bookkeeping 
practices.  In this case we are not arguing with the government's 
legal ability to do this.   The Federal Superannuates National 
Association has actually sought legal advice and has agreed that 
the government has the legal ability to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is one of what is right, what is correct, from an 
ethical perspective.  Traditionally 40% of the contributions have 
been made by the employers and 60% by the employees.  If the 
government is proposing to take a withdrawal from this fund there 
should be a requirement that a commensurate reinvestment be made 
in improved benefits.  For instance, if the contribution rate 
were 60:40 and the government were to choose to withdraw $6 
billion from the surplus, there should be a requirement that $4 
billion be reinvested in better benefits for those people who 
have paid in, the members of these plans.  That is clearly fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government would not even engage in a dialogue on 
splitting the surplus with its partner, the employees who have 
paid into the program over the course of their careers, is 
actually appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some improved benefits.  The dental benefit has been 
improved in the programs, and we commend that.  We also see 
recognition of same sex survivor benefits.  This is one case 
where the government has acted pre-emptively to avoid court 
action. 
Numerous court precedents have been set recently in the 
interpretation of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms which 
demonstrate quite clearly that the government is not in a 
position to discriminate based on sexual orientation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in this case is moving, I guess one could say, 
one step ahead of the sheriff.  That is better than being one 
step behind the sheriff or being dragged kicking and screaming 
into the 21st century, as we have seen governments in Canada in 
recent months and years effectively waiting for the judiciary to 
force them to take these actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action is consistent with the realities of Canada in 1999. 
Governments have to lead on these issues, have to take positions 
such as this one and have to recognize same sex benefits as 
opposed to being dragged kicking and screaming by the court 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the proposed investment board is one that on the 
surface looks very positive.  We are pleased to see that the 
pension funds will be invested in external financial markets to 
maximize returns on behalf of superannuates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is laughable sometimes, though, when the government proposes 
an arm's length operation of these boards from the government.  I 
would suggest that with the government arm's length relationships 
have very short arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, for instance, has 12 
members, 6 of whom are major contributors to the Liberal Party of 
Canada.  If one works it out statistically, only 0.2% of 
Canadians are contributors to the Liberal Party of Canada. 
Perhaps it is even fewer for my party, but I am not bitter.  It 
is no coincidence that so many members of the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board are Liberal supporters and contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect when we see this investment board announced we will see 
a similar consistency in terms of Liberal political interference 
in the appointment process to these boards that will be making 
investment decisions for the future retirement funds of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is political interference in the decisions applying to 
the appointment of the boards in these cases, Canadians should be 
concerned about political interference in the decisions and the 
investments made by these boards.   That is a very significant 
concern to Canadians.  I hope we consider it very carefully in 
the House because it is a significant risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government purports to be trying to maximize the 
returns for superannuates through these changes, the fund will 
still be limited by the foreign content rule so that only 20% of 
the fund can be invested in foreign markets.  The fact is that 
the Canadian equities markets have grossly underperformed 
competitive equities markets in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Dow Jones industrial average has grown in value 
by 180%.  The S&P 500 has grown by 172%.  During the same period 
of time the Toronto Stock Exchange has grown in value by 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wealth is relative and if we deny Canadians an opportunity to 
achieve geographic diversification by investing as many global 
mutual funds do around the world to maximize the returns and to 
spread out their risks, we are denying Canadians the ability to 
build maximum wealth and retirement income in the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is one we have with government policy on RRSPs. 
We are increasingly saying to Canadians that they must plan 
ahead, that they must invest for their own retirements and that 
they must take responsibility.  At the same time we are not 
giving Canadians the means and freedom by which to make the best 
possible decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The superannuation fund will again be denied the opportunity to 
have a maximum level of growth and a reduction in the level of 
risk through geographic diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that the foreign content rule costs .2% of 
Canadian pension funds and mutual funds based in RRSP assets.  In 
the long term that means a 3% to 4% reduction in pension benefits 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have argued against eliminating or reducing the 
foreign content rule saying it would take money out of the 
Canadian equities market, the capital that we need in Canada. I 
would argue that with the Canada pension plan reform, the Canada 
pension plan investment fund and the superannuation investment 
fund, which will be invested privately, it is a perfect 
opportunity to invest capital from these huge, copious quantities 
of quid coming out of these programs into the domestic equities 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the perfect time for the government to take this step. 
It will help provide an ameliorative step to prevent any negative 
impact on the Canadian equities market.  There will be more 
capital available for both the Canadian equities market and the 
foreign equities market.  It can be phased in over a period of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about improving the quality of life and 
standard of living for Canadians, the government should not be 
forcing Canadians to invest the bulk of their retirement savings 
into Canadian markets, which represents 1.5% of the global 
equities markets.  It clearly defies the logic of good portfolio 
management.  I have some concerns about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation at hand will make available through a surplus 
about $2.5 billion per year starting April 1, 2000.   It will 
provide significantly more freedom in the future to a government 
to use this money for whatever purposes it wants.  These pension 
funds were developed to provide for the long term security in 
retirement for the superannuates.  They were not designed to 
provide slush funds for governing parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will say that this is a defined benefit and, 
since it is responsible for the payments of the pensions 
regardless, it has a right to do whatever it wants.  We are not 
arguing with its legal ability to do this.  We are arguing with 
the ethics of doing it.  When the members pay a contribution rate 
of 40%, there should at least be an acknowledgement that there 
should be a significant improvement in the benefits paid out 
prior to a significant reduction or withdrawal of the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I noted was that the CPP actuary will be making 
the recommendations relative to the setting of the premiums.  I 
remember a chap by the name of Bernard Dussault who was a CPP 
actuary.  If I remember correctly, the government fired him.  The 
smoking gun that the government had, indicated that he was fired 
because of his inability or lack of desire to hide the truth 
about the future of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing we need is a system that creates more potential 
for abuse of power, more Bernard Dussault situations where good 
civil servants are fired for telling the truth, and situations 
where there are reductions in the power of parliamentarians in 
designing the type of public policy Canadians need and a 
commensurate increase in the power of the government to do 
whatever it wants with money because of its insatiable appetite 
for spending in any area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
part way through the member's speech, I think he said that we, on 
the governing side, had a questionable approach to finances and 
bookkeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it odd that the member would talk about questionable 
bookkeeping.  This country was faced with a massive deficit of 
$42 billion in 1993 because of the mess left by this member's 
party.  For him to talk along those lines is outrageous at best 
and ridiculous at most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also listened with intent while he was talking about EI.  I 
noted that it was in 1986 when the then auditor general indicated 
that in fact that money was to be part of the consolidated 
revenue.  That, again, was during the tenure of the member's 
party.  I am not sure what point the member was trying to make, 
but he knows full well that the rules we operate under are the 
rules that have been set out by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to appointments to boards and commissions, there 
was no one in the history of this country who was better than his 
party leader, Mr. Mulroney, when it came to appointments and 
patronage.  I can tell members that Canadians still look fondly 
upon Mr. Mulroney as the king of patronage, bar none, when it 
comes to those kinds of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an excellent piece of legislation despite what the hon. 
member says about trying to stir up and upset seniors over 
whether or not their pensions are guaranteed.  The member knows 
full well that they are.  It is important for us to indicate to 
our pensioners and senior population that they are not going to 
get any more, but they are also not going to get any less.  We 
have that guarantee for them in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the member's comments on the foreign content 
rule.  Could he perhaps elaborate a little further on why he 
thinks there should not be at least some portion of investment 
here in Canada?  Does he think it should be wide open and go far 
beyond other jurisdictions?  I thought I heard him say that. What 
does he have against investments in Canada?  I would be 
interested in his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will start with the last 
question first, relative to the foreign content issue.  I guess 
the member did not hear what I was saying.  Canada's equities 
markets have grossly underperformed those of other countries, but 
Canadians are not to blame for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians, with the right type of leadership, could 
excel and create economic growth, jobs and so on but they need 
lower taxes.  That is one of the reasons why in Canada our TSE, 
the Toronto Stock Exchange, has grown in value by only 60% since 
1993 when this government got elected.  During the same period of 
time, the Dow Jones industrial average has grown by 180% in the 
U.S.  The Standard & Poor's 500 has grown by 172%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the same period of time, Americans growth and wealth, for 
those who participated in the market because of their mutual 
funds and pension funds, have become three times wealthier in 
terms of growth in economic wealth compared to Canadians.  Wealth 
is a relative thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite may be satisfied that Canadians are 
getting poorer while Americans are getting richer, but I and 
members of my party are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of his comments relating to dubious bookkeeping, my 
comments reflected those of the auditor general a number of times 
over the past few budgets of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in 1984 the Conservative government of Brian 
Mulroney inherited a $38 billion deficit, in 1984 dollars, from 
the previous government.  At that time, that represented 9% of 
GDP.  By the time the government left office in 1993, that had 
been reduced to around 5% of GDP, almost halved as a per cent of 
GDP.  During that time that government implemented free trade, 
the GST and deregulated financial services, transportation and 
energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what impact those policies had on this government's 
ability to eliminate the deficit.  It was summed up very well in 
an article in <I>The Economist</I> last January.  It said that the 
credit for deficit reduction in Canada belongs largely to the 
passage of time and economic structural reforms made by the 
previous government, including free trade, the GST, deregulation 
of financial services, transportation and energy, all those 
policies which were vociferously opposed by this member's party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard one of the members from the other side of the House 
earlier today accusing the opposition of fearmongering.  I see 
the hon. member has left the House he is so ashamed of his 
mistakes and his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the free trade debate, I remember Roy MacLaren, the 
current high commissioner in London and past Liberal member of 
this House, actually saying that the Liberals would blame the 
Conservative government for every sparrow that falls.  Well, it 
is because of those initiatives that a lot of sparrows have 
soared in Canada.  It is this government's high tax policies 
since 1993 that have basically caused a lot of fallen sparrows 
and a lot of falling incomes, personal disposable incomes and 
standards of living for Canadians.

back and has regained his composure.

leaving the Chamber at any particular time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the 
member knows, the debate today has to do with pension funds for 
civil servants.  The debate is all about who owns the money. 
There are people who say that it belongs to the taxpayers since 
all of the money comes from the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, we could quite rightly concede that 
all of our income and pension, those members who have a pension, 
comes from the taxpayers since that is where the money 
originates.  One could argue that we earned it, in which case it 
belongs to us, but it did originate with the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the debates raging in the country between the unions, the 
taxpayers and the government is about who gets the money.  Whose 
$30 million is it?  Even for you, Mr. Speaker, that would be more 
than just your average weekend spending money.  That is a lot of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly where does the member stand on who gets the money?  Is 
it fair for the government to claim that on behalf of taxpayers 
it is taking it?  Does it all belong to the unions?  Is there a 
split somewhere?  What is his view on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to look at the 
contribution rates and the fact that 40% of the contributions to 
this plan are made by the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe quite strongly, particularly with the investment 
policies promoted by and provided for in the new legislation, 
that the returns for this fund should actually improve over a 
period of time.  If the government were to withdraw 60% of the 
fund, 40% should go back into improved benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the government's arguments relative to defined 
benefits, that there is a guarantee the government has, but the 
government is grossly overestimating and exaggerating that 
argument to deny reasonable benefits. 
There was a small improvement in benefits in this legislation. 
But the fact is that the improvements sought by the Federal 
Superannuates National Association go a lot further in terms of 
survivor benefits for instance and in a number of areas create a 
much more comprehensively fair package of benefits for its 
members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, before the government delves into this plan for 
general spending purposes, that it should look more seriously at 
improving benefits within the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we should keep in mind as well, in response 
finally to the hon. member's question, is that over the period of 
time, particularly with investments in the equities markets, it 
is not a bad thing to have a reasonable surplus within the plan 
from a security perspective.  We should always be cautious about 
withdrawing that surplus and then in the future asking the 
taxpayer to kick back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The correct answer frankly is some combination of what he has 
suggested.  I do believe we need to call in some of the best 
pension experts and benefits experts in the country if not in the 
world to help design the most optimal combination.  It is not one 
that we should define in parliament solely on a debate type 
format without reasonable diligence and research.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
have before us Bill C-78, an act to amend the Public Service 
Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments touch the full range of pension 
operations:  benefits, contributions and plan administration. 
The underlying thrust of all of these proposed amendments is to 
ensure the long term sustainability of the Canadian public 
service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose to direct my remarks today to one particular aspect of 
these amendments, the proposed changes to employee contribution 
rates.  Before I discuss the proposed changes, I think it is 
important that I give a brief overview of the existing 
contribution rate provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of the existing legislative provisions will provide a 
rationale and context for the proposed amendments.  Under the 
existing legislative provisions, employee contributions to the 
Canada pension plan, CPP, and the public service pension plans 
are integrated.  But what does integrated mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing integration feature is such that the total 
contribution rate for an employee is 7.5% of pay composed of both 
the contributions to the CPP and the public service pension 
plans.  For an employee earning the average wage, the 
contribution to the public service pension plans would be 7.5% 
minus the CPP contribution rate, currently at 3.5% of pay, which 
equals 4% of pay. To the extent that the CPP contribution rates 
increase, there is an equivalent decline in the public service 
pension plan contribution rate to preserve the constraint that 
the maximum pension contribution equals 7.5% of pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, with periods of relative stability in contribution 
rates, this integrated approach has served the public service 
pension plans well.  However, under the integrated contribution 
rate structure, the increase in CPP contribution rates beginning 
in 1987 has distorted the distribution of employee contributions 
going to the CPP and the public service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the integrated structure, the impact of the increases in 
CPP rates has been such that for employees earning the average 
wage, contributions to the public service pension plans have 
declined from 5.7% of pay in 1986 to 4% of pay in 1999. To 
reiterate, over the past decade, individual employee contribution 
rates for the CPP have gone up, while those for the public 
service pension plans have declined. What are the implications of 
this shift in the distribution of employee contributions between 
the CPP and the public service pension plans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this point I have discussed only employee contribution rates. 
The other side of the coin of course is the employer 
contributions, that is the contribution of the federal government 
in its role as employer.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing legislation for the public service pension plans is 
such that the employer must ensure that the various accounts for 
the public service pension plans are credited with an amount 
equal to the total cost of entitlements accrued by employees in 
that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the federal government is responsible for the 
total costs of the plan in a given year, less the employee 
contributions.  As a consequence of the declining employee 
contribution rates, the federal government, and by extension 
taxpayers, has had to shoulder an ever increasing share of the 
cost of employee pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use the pension plan under the Public Service 
Superannuation Act as an example.  Over the last three decades 
the financing of that plan has averaged approximately 60% 
employer funding and 40% employee funding.  More recently that 
distribution has shifted rather dramatically. For 1999 the 
distribution is approximately 70% employer and 30% employee. Next 
year in the absence of any changes to the legislation it is 
projected that the distribution of the financing of the PSSA plan 
will shift to approximately 75%-25% and by 2003 it will be 
80%-20% in favour of the employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ongoing shift in the cost of the pension plan to the 
employer is not sustainable.  It clearly puts the viability of 
the existing plan at risk unless changes are made. It is our 
intention to introduce the necessary changes to the contribution 
rate structure in order to preserve the long term sustainability 
of the public service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the amendments proposed in Bill C-78, contribution rates 
for the public service plans and the Canada pension plan will no 
longer be integrated. In other words, the public service 
contribution rates will henceforth be set independently and there 
will be no overall maximum contribution rate.  In addition, there 
will be a two tier contribution rate structure to more directly 
match contribution rates with the different benefit accruals 
below and above the average wage as defined by the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government recognizes that there will be a financial impact 
on employees as a result of these changes.  In order to 
facilitate the movement to a long term sustainable pension plan 
environment, the government is proposing to freeze employee 
contribution rates to public service pension plans over the 
period 2000 to 2003 inclusive.  Over this period, employee 
contributions on earnings below the average wage as defined by 
the CPP will continue at the present 1999 rate of 4%. 
Contributions on earnings above that average will continue at the 
present rate of 7.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood however, that even though federal 
employees will thus be spared any increases in contribution rates 
for their public service pensions from 2000 through to 2003, they 
will nevertheless be subject to Canada pension plan rate 
increases scheduled for that period, the same CPP rate increases 
to which all working Canadians alike will be subject. Through 
integration of contributions, federal employees in effect have 
been sheltered from such increases in the past.  Now they will 
have to pay for them like the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the CPP rate is scheduled to stabilize in the year 
2004.  What of the public service rates then?  Will they rise in 
2004 after being frozen for four years?  Possibly, but not 
necessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the year 2004 and beyond, Treasury Board will set the 
contribution rate structure with the ability to return the cost 
sharing ratio gradually to the historical average of 
approximately 60%-40% between the employer and employees.  The 
employer would continue to assume the larger share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employee contribution rate increases may or may not be necessary 
from 2004 on, depending on a number of variables.  However, any 
necessary increases would be gradual.  For example, the members 
of the pension plan under the Public Service Superannuation Act 
can rest assured that no increase in their public service pension 
contribution rate will be greater than an additional .4%, not 4%, 
but .4% in any single year after 2003.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an increase proves necessary in 2004, the contribution rate 
will still not be more than 4.4% of salary up to the average wage 
and 7.9% of the employee's salary over that average, that is, the 
previous rate of 7.5% plus the maximum possible increase of .4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PSSA plan members can also rest assured under the amended 
legislation that their employee share of current service cost for 
their pension plan will never exceed 40%.  In other words, their 
contribution rates will not be increased beyond the point where 
they are paying their historical average cost of 40%.  The 
historical average therefore will also be a limit under the 
amended legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for members of the other two public service plans, that is 
those under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, the legislation will 
provide that their contribution rates will not exceed those of 
PSSA members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the contribution rate structure are one component 
of the package of changes required to ensure the long term 
sustainability of public service pension plans.  This bill 
provides as part of a comprehensive package of amendments the 
required changes in the contribution rate structure to ensure 
that the public service pension plans will be sustainable over 
the longer term.

Speaker, this morning, the head of the Saint-Jean Baptiste 
society, Guy Bouthillier, and a former active separatist, Denis 
Minière, proposed to the Premier of Quebec that he start a new 
round of constitutional negotiations with the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are looking for ways to get people to swallow the pill of 
Quebec's separation from the rest of Canada, an option twice 
rejected by a majority of Quebeckers.  The separatists have 
understood that Quebec's separation from the rest of Canada will 
not go down easily. And the year 2000 is approaching rapidly. 
They are getting restless. We wonder whether there is not a 
separatist agenda hidden away somewhere in the boxes of Parti 
Quebecois organizers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatist movement is a thing of the past.  It is a concept 
that will lead to division, scorn and the loss of real benefits 
for Quebec in economic, cultural and social terms.

the government got away with taking $25 billion from the

the country, senior citizens and retired pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government thinks seniors will sit idly by and let it 
take the $30 billion surplus from the public service pension 
plan, it would be well advised to remember what happened to Brian 
Mulroney when he tried to de-index the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dozens of seniors groups are on the Hill today to show their 
opposition to Bill C-78:  the Armed Forces Pensioners 
Association, the Association of Public Service Alliance Retirees, 
the Canadian Association of Union Retirees, the Ontario Coalition 
of Senior Citizens Organizations, the RCMP Veterans Association 
and many more representing millions of Canadian retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All pension surpluses are the sole property of the employee. 
They are deferred wages to be used for nothing else than 
improving benefits.  The message that these groups bring to 
Ottawa is simple, “Get your hands off our pension plan”.

in the workforce has increased, their job tenure is longer and 
their salaries have risen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason for this change is that women are becoming 
better educated.  More than ever, education is a prerequisite for 
success in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent statistics show that the gap between men and women is 
closing, even in the upper ranks of corporate Canada.  While the 
glass ceiling is still there, it is more permeable than ever.  It 
is not unusual to see women in executive roles.  Today, over 
700,000 businesses are owned by women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through education, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a change in 
society's attitude, women are aspiring to and achieving greater 
career heights.

Treiber, and her classmates from Bishop Strachan School, “I

of that same date to the Minister of National Defence which 
requested that the government brief the SCONDVA committee members 
several times a week on a regular basis with regard to the Kosovo 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appreciated that the Liberal government has decided to 
consult with parliamentarians about this ever-escalating war. We 
would have much preferred separate committee briefings because of 
the technical nature of the information, but any movement by the 
government is appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I would like to remind the government of the Somalia 
Commission of Inquiry report that called for a vigilant 
parliament.  The importance of parliamentary oversight of the 
department of defence is a vital aspect of Canadian democracy. It 
also gives committee members an insight into the military 
profession, and an opportunity to show our unwavering support for 
our Canadian forces in this time of conflict as NATO stands on 
the precipice of further action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Americans are now talking about committing more than $25 
billion to the war effort in Yugoslavia.  Our allies are planning 
and budgeting for an escalation of the war in Kosovo.  Yet the 
government does not seem to have a specific plan.  We want to 
make sure that our troops have the resources to be able to do 
their job over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Does the Prime Minister 
have an estimate of what the costs will be, or is he waiting for 
NATO to tell him how much to spend? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I indicated yesterday, the costs so 
far for the deployment into Aviano and for the other involvements 
of the Canadian forces have been a total of $32.4 million to 
date.  This started when the first six CF-18s were deployed into 
Aviano last June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the air campaign began the total cost for the Canadian 
forces has been $11.9 million.  We are in the throes of putting 
together the figures of other costs.  As soon as we have those 
costs and projections we will be happy to make them available. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it has been some weeks now since we have been asking this 
question and there is still nothing coming from the government 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is on the verge of going into a ground war.  Yet we still 
do not know how much it has cost just to involve ourselves in the 
air strikes.  The defence budget has been cut by $7.8 billion 
since 1993.  The current budget leaves no room for air strikes. 
It leaves no room for ground defence.  Our troops, and the Prime 
Minister will recall, were given axe handles to protect 
themselves in Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What assurances can the Prime Minister give our troops that they 
will have the right equipment to go to war? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

equipment and will have the right equipment to use in this air 
campaign and in any other involvement they have with respect to 
Yugoslavia, including our peacekeepers who are being prepared for 
a peacekeeping mission when that time should come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have indicated quite clearly what the costs are to this point 
in time.  I do not understand what part of $32 million or what 
part of $12 million the hon. member does not understand.  Those 
are our costs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are not talking about incremental costs.  We are talking about 
a total cost besides incremental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government budgeted $103 million for the procurement of 
smart bombs.  Our fighters have flown well over 100 sorties into 
that region.  Obviously supplies are getting rather thin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the defence minister inform the House as to what the 
supply situation is with regard to the smart weapons, what steps 
the government will take to replenish those supplies, and how 
much it will cost? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

to do the job.  I was just in Aviano.  I have seen our equipment 
and our planes there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian forces personnel are doing a terrific job.  They 
have the supplies that are necessary.  The government is 
providing the funds that are necessary to make sure we do the job 
that needs to be done to try to give the people of Kosovo back 
their homeland.

ground troops to Kosovo if our NATO allies all agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Prime Minister has already made this decision and 
announced it to our allies, what is the point of a debate in the 
House?  Why is the Prime Minister telling Canadians that he will 
listen to Washington, Bonn and Luxembourg but to hell with the 
elected representatives— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Please, my colleagues, be very judicious in 
your choice of words. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, those are the people who supported the government 10 
days ago.  They said we were doing the right thing 10 days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they believe we should let Milosevic rape and kill the 
people, do nothing and hope that some day the UN might have the 
troops?  We will keep doing what we are doing because it is the 
right thing to do for Canadians and all 19 countries in NATO.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, BBC World 
News reported that some British soldiers serving in the Balkans 
suffered a $10 a day pay cut and German troops are getting an 
extra $100 per day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of National Defence.  Will he 
assure the House that Canadian forces personnel are getting the 
pay they deserve for combat operations?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we just gave, as of April 1 of this year, 
the highest pay increases in decades to the Canadian forces.  We 
gave it to people primarily in the lower ranks.  We also 
increased the allowances for foreign duty.  We increased the 
allowances for the very people who are over there now in 
connection with our campaign in Kosovo. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
very interesting, but there is a little more the minister has to 
do.  Our Canadian forces personnel have been active in the skies 
over Yugoslavia for almost a month, but to date cabinet has not 
made them or their families eligible for veterans benefits 
through an order in council.  When is this government going to do 
the right thing and initiate an order in council that would 
support these brave men and women serving in the Balkans? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

done by the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs.  It came up with a report on how to improve the quality 
of life for our troops and for our veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Minister of Veterans Affairs and I just opened a new 
centre that will provide one reference point for veterans and for 
troops who are injured or troops who are looking for additional 
information on how they can improve the quality of life for 
themselves and their families.  We have some 89 recommendations 
that we are in the throes of implementing to improve the quality 
of life for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to wish the Prime Minister a very happy anniversary. 
Because the MP for York South—Weston expected his government to 
keep its campaign promise to scrap, kill and abolish the GST, 
three years ago today the Prime Minister kicked him out of the 
Liberal caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Prime Minister more proud of, the fact that he broke 
his promise to scrap the GST or the fact that he kicked out the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Canada in three years.  We had a deficit of $42 billion and it 
went to zero.  We have had a 1% inflation rate for the past three 
years.  We have created 1.6 million new jobs since we formed the 
government.  Never have Canadians felt so good about their 
government than they do today.  I know why the hon. member on the 
other side is so desperate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is that Liberal arrogance again.  I should remind the Prime 
Minister that he got 38% of the vote, which is hardly a huge 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the government not scrapped, killed and abolished 
the GST, it is now using it to wring even more money out of 
taxpayers' pockets.  The government now taxes $6 billion more a 
year through the GST than when it promised to scrap it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister deny that his broken GST promise is 
anything more than a Liberal tax grab?  I would like him to

With respect to defence, I have the Reform 1997 election 
platform, which calls for reduced spending for the Department of 
National Defence on page eight of a book called <I>A Fresh Start 
for Canadians</I>.

Mr. Speaker, as we know, the U.S. congress has been applying a

concerning the release of information and technology transfer. We 
have had serious negotiations going on over the last three or 
four months.  In fact we have had previous discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday it tabled some new regulations which applied the 
requirement for an export permit for which we have had exemptions

my question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has used the team metaphor to describe his 
understanding of NATO.  We understand that.  We also understand 
that teams have captains, water boys and everybody in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know from the Prime Minister what he is taking to the 
huddle.  We want to know that he is in the huddle.  When he is in 
the huddle will he be saying that he approves of the growing 
range of targets being bombed in Yugoslavia, homes, offices and 
whatnot?  These are not the selective military targets that were 
talked about at the beginning of this episode.

<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the position of the government is very clear.  We want 
Milosevic to make sure that his troops and his goons are no 
longer in Kosovo and that they will permit the return of the 
Kosovars to their homes. When Milosevic accepts these conditions, 
that will stop the bombing.  Our position is very clear. We have 
to be effective as well.  If we cannot use bombing it is better 
to stop.  We want to use bombs to make sure Milosevic understands 
that we cannot tolerate what is going on in Yugoslavia at this 
time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister seems unwilling to acknowledge that 
the bombing has gone far beyond the selective military targets 
that were talked about at the beginning of the air strike 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the team huddle that the Prime Minister is going 
to in Washington in a day or so, or perhaps even today, will it 
be the position of the Canadian government that the five points 
of NATO have to be adhered to?  Will the Canadian government be 
going into the huddle with the position that some flexibility has 
to be shown with respect to those five points?  What is the 
Canadian position? 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one element of the position is it is desirable that the 
peacekeepers not only be from NATO but from many other countries, 
including Russia.  I said that last week and I repeat it today. I 
believe the Russians are to be involved. They know my position. 
I will make the point again.  It is important to involve the 
Russians to make sure it is not only the NATO countries that are 
involved. We would like the other countries to help us make sure 
that the murdering, the raping and the killing by the Milosevic 
goons stop.  We have to do what is needed—

<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada 
has a long term nuclear waste disposal problem.  The material is 
currently stored at temporary sites at Canada's 22 nuclear 
reactor stations.  According to the Seaborn panel, Canadians 
still need to be convinced that the solution is to bury it deep 
in the Canadian shield.  Despite all of this, the government is 
looking at importing weapons grade plutonium from the U.S. and 
Russia to burn at Canadian reactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  Does the 
minister have any plans to ensure that this imported plutonium 
will not compound Canada's nuclear waste disposal problems? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I guess this is now the 19th time I have responded to 
the details of this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were to be a commercial MOX proposal, that would go 
forward.  In addition to a number of other conditions that would 
need to be satisfied, all relevant environmental, health and 
safety regulations in Canada, whether federal or provincial, 
would have to be fully satisfied. On a scientific basis the waste 
that would be created by this MOX product is less than the more 
conventional product. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we do 
not have to be asked to participate in the program.  The Prime 
Minister is practically writing letters to the President of the 
United States perhaps even demanding to participate in the MOX 
program.  For something that we do not have to be asked to 
participate in, the government is spending an awful lot of money 
on it. The feasibility study performed by the government 
indicated that the plan to burn Russian and American weapons 
grade plutonium would cost Canadian taxpayers $2.2 billion.  The 
study itself has already cost Canadians $1.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much does the government have to spend before getting the 
support of the Canadian parliament?  Is this really a spending 
priority of the Canadian people? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are now on to number 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the testing that may be undertaken later this 
year is fully within the regulatory authority and the regulatory 
licence afforded to AECL.  It is covered within the financial 
arrangements provided to AECL.  If there were to be a commercial 
program pursued after that, one of the conditions that I referred 
to generically in my first answer is that it would have to be on 
a commercial basis with no subsidization by the Government of 
Canada.

hopes a Liberal appointed majority in the Senate will rubber 
stamp her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime the U.S. has stripped Canada of most favoured 
nation status on defence contracts as the first shot across the 
bow in a potential trade war. Canadians are wondering why is the 
Minister for International Trade promoting the heritage

for 30 million Canadians and $177 billion of exports to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

standing up for all that amount in trade, it also believes in its 
Canadian culture.  That culture is also part of our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not correct to say that the discussions with our 
friends from the United States are going badly. We have completed 
seven meetings.  There is one next week.  If the truth be known, 
on both sides there is good faith and a good attempt to try to 
avoid what we believe are unnecessary trade slippery slope

increased the percentage of responses given those applying, and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are some 800,000 shipments each year of 
radioactive material in Canada.  It is not unusual for Transport 
Canada officials to liaise with local authorities and emergency 
response organizations to ensure that these shipments are carried 
out in accordance with the Dangerous Goods Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the planned meeting tomorrow it is obvious that 
some alarm had been raised.  As my colleague the Minister of 
Natural Resources has said, there has been no request to 
transport this particular material and there has been no route 
decided so such a meeting was premature.

awesome task.  He did so on his own.  He did research in the 
library.  He did a lot of the legwork.  His speeches remain a 
testament to his elegant speaking style and his Irish heritage of 
which he was so proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that he vigorously opposed capital punishment 
and worked for the repeal of provisions of the Criminal Code that 
allowed for corporal punishment and the use of the 
cat-o'-nine-tails, a practice like capital punishment, which he 
felt was based far too much on revenge.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank McGee was a grand nephew of Thomas D'Arcy McGee, a Father

Frank McGee knew all too well of the diversities and the 
challenges posed by public life.

the qualities of brotherhood, tolerance and understanding Frank 
McGee added public service and political participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, we 
express our sympathies to his family for his loss and we send our 
gratitude that Frank McGee was willing to continue the great 
tradition that was started by his family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today I pay tribute to a late colleague, the Hon. Frank 
McGee.  Through his distinguished career in public life Frank 
McGee helped guide Canada through the political and intellectual 
challenges of the late 1950s and 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank became involved in federal politics in 1957 when he was 
elected as the Conservative member of parliament for the riding 
of York—Scarborough.  At that time the riding was predominantly 
rural and was the third most populous riding in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank served as a member under the leadership of John 
Diefenbaker for seven years, being re-elected in 1958 and 1962. 
In 1963 he was made a minister without portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his political career Frank advocated reforms in a number 
of legislative areas, including those affecting the role of women 
in Canadian society and divorce law.  He was also an activist in 
the reform of our death penalty laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank McGee was a man whose abilities allowed him to serve in 
capacities going beyond those of a member of parliament.  Frank 
easily assumed roles of leadership in his local community, 
nationally, and in the media.  Although he would not be a member 
of parliament after 1963, Frank's ability to provide leadership 
on public interest issues continued to place him in public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After electoral defeat in 1963 Frank worked as a political 
reporter for the Toronto <I>Star</I>.  Although he no longer sat 
in the House, Frank was broadcast into Canadian living rooms as 
the host of the CBC television program <I>The Sixties</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unable to stay away from politics for long, Mr. McGee ran again 
for his party in the general election of 1965.  One of Frank's 
very valuable contributions to public life came in 1984 when he 
was appointed to the newly created Security Intelligence Review 
Committee which reviews the work of CSIS.  Through his five years 
as a member of this committee Frank was one of the initiators of 
guidelines and procedures put in place to monitor the sometimes 
delicate work of our domestic security agency at the end of the 
cold war era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After his term on SIRC, Frank continued to work in public life 
as a citizenship judge after being appointed in 1990.  It was 
during this period that Frank and I shared views on the evolving 
fields of national security and the citizenship portfolio.  I 
would also say that Frank looked pretty good in those citizenship 
judge robes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to this exceptional figure in Canadian political 
and public life.  As the member of parliament for the riding of 
York—Scarborough, Frank McGee had a grasp of the evolving 
Canadian urban landscape that enabled him to play a leadership 
role in the demographic development of the Toronto suburbs of 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his family and friends, my Liberal party colleagues and I 
extend our condolences in this loss.  In keeping with his 
contribution here, we thank Frank and them for what he brought to 
Canadians through his service to the House and beyond.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition to pay tribute to Frank McGee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am moved to have this opportunity to pay respects to Mr. Frank 
McGee and his family because Frank McGee played a role in my 
early years as a member of parliament.  In fact, Frank McGee 
played a very important and deciding role in the lives of a lot 
of Progressive Conservative MPs in the 1972 general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will elaborate.  On the evening of the 1972 general election 
Conservative Leader Robert Stanfield went to sleep confident he 
was the prime minister elect of Canada with a seat count of 109 
for the Tories and 107 for the Liberals.  By morning the seat 
count was 108 to 108.  The governor general could have asked Mr. 
Stanfield to form the government but was unable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judicial recount in Frank McGee's riding of York—Scarborough 
two weeks after the election determined that Mr. McGee had lost 
his seat by four votes.  Pierre Trudeau stayed on as prime 
minister in a minority government, supported by David Lewis and 
the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank McGee was born in Ottawa in 1926 and was destined for 
politics from birth.  Both his grandfathers were members of 
parliament, something very unique:  John McGee had been a member 
of Sir John A. Macdonald's government and his maternal 
grandfather, Charles McCool, was also an MP.  His great uncle was 
Thomas D'Arcy McGee, a Father of Confederation who was 
assassinated in Ottawa in 1868.  Talk about a political pedigree. 
It showed.  Frank McGee was a determined, enlightened and 
effective member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His political career started in 1957 after completing university 
at St. Patrick's College in Ottawa, signing up for the air force 
and then marrying Moira O'Leary in 1951 and moving to Toronto. He 
was elected in 1957 in York—Scarborough, then Canada's third 
largest riding.  Mr. McGee won in 1957 by 18,946 votes, a 
handsome victory to an individual widely acknowledged as a 
diligent and dedicated person who had been called to public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His majority was the largest ever recorded up to that time for a 
Conservative member of parliament.  He had to go back to the 
polls in 1958 and won that time by 35,877 votes in the huge 
riding of York—Scarborough.  In fact Frank's riding was bigger 
than the province of P.E.I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank McGee is remembered by many for his private member's Bill 
C-6 which he introduced in 1960, calling for the abolition of 
capital punishment.  This seminal work by Frank McGee resulted in 
changes to the Criminal Code of Canada that ended the death 
penalty for almost all crimes.  It was a statement of the 
tenacity of Frank McGee who faced much derision by his own 
colleagues that were opposed to abolition.  In fact, Frank 
McGee's family faced death threats during the debate of that 
bill.  He stood tall, devoted and constant in his belief during 
those very difficult times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1962 general election Frank won again.  It was a minority 
government and Frank was sworn in as a minister in recognition of 
his ability and contribution to parliament and to his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1963 Mr. Diefenbaker and his Tories were defeated and Frank 
lost his seat.  Frank moved to journalism and worked for the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> and hosted a CBC television series call <I>The 
Sixties</I>.  He ran again in 1965 but lost.  Frank went on in his 
contribution to public service by serving on the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee from 1984 to 1989 and in 1990 
became a citizenship court judge.  Frank McGee was a very 
accomplished man with a lifetime spent in the pursuit of public 
service in one form or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I referred to how Frank McGee touched the lives of 
many of us in the 1972 election and for that matter the role he 
played in the destiny of this nation.  In the course of political 
life four votes can change the course of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank McGee is spoken of with warmth in these precincts.  While 
determined, he was never dictatorial.  While enlightened, he was 
never egocentric.  While successful, he never lost his connection 
with his roots and with his values.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues following the 
passing of Frank McGee, a former member of parliament and 
federal Conservative minister who died on Sunday, April 4, at 
the age of 73. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McGee was born in Ottawa on March 3, 1926 and studied 
journalism at Carleton College, as the university was called in 
those days. He enlisted at the age of 17 and served during World 
War II from 1943 to 1945. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fifties Mr. McGee settled in Toronto. He worked for a 
while at Sears as a purchasing manager. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His political career began in 1957 when he was elected for the 
first time in the riding of York—Scarborough, which was 
essentially a rural constituency and the third largest riding in 
the country. Politics was probably in his blood because his 
grandfathers were both federal members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McGee was re-elected in 1958 with a majority of 35,377 votes, 
then the largest majority in a federal election. He represented 
the riding of York—Scarborough again in 1962, in a minority 
government, and was appointed minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McGee's greatest contribution as a parliamentarian was 
undoubtedly the private member's bill he tabled in 1960 to 
abolish the death penalty. 
Private member's bills rarely become law in Canada, but that 
bill led to amendments to the Criminal Code that abolished the 
death penalty for all but a few crimes. The only people still 
facing the death penalty were those guilty of homicide when the 
victim was either a police officer or a prison guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McGee later joined the <I>Toronto Star</I> as a reporter 
specializing in political issues, and he hosted a television 
series called <I>The Sixties</I> on the CBC network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, he worked in public relations. He was appointed to the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee on which he sat from 
1984 to 1989. Appointed judge at Toronto's citizenship court in 
1990, he held this position until 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues I wish to offer my 
most sincere condolences to his family, his relatives and his 
many friends. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on behalf of the NDP caucus I would like to join my 
colleagues in the House of Commons who have already spoken in 
paying tribute to Mr. Frank McGee and honouring his memory, the 
work he did in this place for his community and in other 
positions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly want to recognize the historic work that we know 
he did in respect of the abolition of capital punishment.  It was 
work which he began and others finished in the 1970s.  There was 
a movement to overturn this work in the late 1980s but it was not 
overturned.  We still have a country in which we do not have the 
spectacle of capital punishment.  That fact is a lasting tribute 
to the work of Mr. Frank McGee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize the historic work that he did with others in 
seeking to change the divorce laws of Canada which were quite 
archaic at the time he entered parliament.  We know that he 
collaborated with others at that time in exposing just how 
archaic they were and in bringing about changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much biographical detail has been put on the record by others. 
I do not see any point in repeating it.  On behalf of the NDP I 
join with other colleagues in extending our sincere condolences 
to the family of Mr. Frank McGee and our own appreciation for his 
life and work in this place and in his community.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTION PERIOD

<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I undertook a few minutes ago 
to verify the request made by an hon. member of the official 
opposition that a document from which the Prime Minister quoted 
during question period be tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carefully reviewed the relevant citation in Beauchesne's 
and the rule of Beauchesne is quite clear.  A public document, in 
other words a government document, that is quoted must be tabled. 
The document in question from which the Prime Minister quoted is 
not a public document.  In fact, it is an internal document, not 
a government document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members are interested, I can certainly indicate to them 
the sources from which the material came.  One is known as <I>A 
Fresh Start for Canadians</I>, at page 8.  I believe that document 
comes from the Reform Party.  Another is entitled <I>The 
Taxpayers' Budget</I>, of February 21, 1995, at page 43.  I am 
sure that is a Reform Party document, if people are interested. 
The third document about reducing the budget of the Department of 
National Defence, referred to in the zero in three budget 
proposal, comes from a document which was apparently published 
November 24, 1994 and the relevant section is found at page 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that will assist hon. members in finding the information 
about the proposed cuts to the Department of National Defence 
that the Reform Party wanted to inflict upon that particular 
government department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was present during the earlier exchanges when we 
requested that this document be tabled.  I think if we review the 
record of the proceedings from that time we will find that the 
government House leader offered to table that document, 
recognizing fully that it was a Liberal document.  We took that 
assurance for what it was worth.  Now we find ourselves in the 
position where the government House leader is suggesting that he 
does not want to table it, but is offering us other assurances. 
We would like that document to be tabled, as we were assured that 
it would be by the government House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, here is the difficulty the official opposition gets into 
in this House.  We have somebody quoting from a document that is, 
in essence, a party document from their side, telling the whole 
country that this is a document from the official opposition. 
The country buys it.  The government is deliberately misleading 
people.  It is no different than the statements that are made 
over there on other issues.  It either has to stop or we will 
start using the word that the Chair does not like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government has an obligation to table all documents. 
I want to see them.  We are not going to stop until we get them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I will take the 
matter under advisement until we have had a chance to look 
carefully at the blues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not mind seeking 
unanimous consent to table the document if the member thinks it 
is that important.  However, I want the record to indicate that 
it does not meet the criteria found under citation 495 of 
Beauchesne's.  However, if the House is willing to give me 
unanimous consent, I am willing to table the document.  It will 
not create a precedent because I will be doing so with unanimous 
consent.  This is not a document which satisfies the rule, but I 
am willing to do it nonetheless.

document was promised, in any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants unanimous consent, we will give unanimous consent 
for him to table it. However, I can assure the government House 
leader that this will be raised in a question of privilege, along 
with the other false statements that were made in the House today 
during question period relating to the Nisga'a, and he had better 
understand that very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. House leader

there unanimous consent to proceed as the House leader has 
requested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am requesting 
clarification on my point of order as to whether the original 
document will be tabled.  You said earlier that you 
would review the blues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  We did it anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  That is not the original document.  That

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK197">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-78, an 
act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to 
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, 
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, debating this piece of legislation reminds me of the 
question that we were just dealing with.  It reminds me of our 
questions during question period about the Nisga'a debate that is 
going on in the British Columbia legislature, that the government 
would just as soon not have going on in that province because it 
does not like that kind of scrutiny and it wants to control the 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is a piece of legislation that it would just as soon not 
see the light of day, and if it does not want much attention to 
be paid to it, then it minimizes the time it is in this 
parliament.  This bill fits that category.  The government wants 
to have this $30 billion fraudulent exercise, this tax grab, this 
attempt to take money from the workers' pockets buried as deeply 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever the government says it is taking a balanced approach to 
an issue we should hang on to our hats, hold on to our watches 
and grab our wallets because that is Liberal codespeak for taking 
measures that will either rob our pocketbooks, defer an issue 
until hopefully there is less attention being paid to it, or it 
signals other intentions of government that will take people 
where they really would rather not go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One recent example of Liberal-speak is the changes to the 
employment insurance program.  The so-called balanced approach 
taken by the Liberal government changed the eligibility criteria, 
which was promoted on the basis that more people, particularly 
part time workers, would be eligible for benefits.  In reality, 
eligibility was cut in half so that people who unavoidably lost 
their jobs had only a 35% chance of qualifying for benefits under 
the new rules, where previously the figure was closer to 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now going to have a surplus in the employment insurance 
program this year of $26 billion, money taken out of workers' and 
employers' pockets by government misrepresentation.  The 
government is still trying to justify the fact because it is 
trying to make its books appear better for the workers.  The cold 
hearts over there are trying to make themselves sound warm. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT59"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT59"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the example of the balanced Liberal approach to 
taxation.  That translates into the government creating so-called 
tax reductions which are more than offset by tax increases in 
previous budgets that suddenly kick in and are not announced this 
year because they were announced last year or the year before. 
We have things like bracket creep that occur insidiously with 
inflation.  All of this makes government revenues go up while the 
government claims that tax revenues are going down.  That is 
logically impossible, but Liberals continue to ignore the 
contradictory reality in their public utterances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of Bill C-78 is public sector pension funds.  The 
government mandates that private sector pension plans must be 
actuarially sound and must protect the contributions from being 
raided by the managers of the plans.  What it is planning to do 
with the public service pension plan would be fraudulent if done 
by others.  So now we are talking about the so-called Liberal 
balanced approach codespeak to public service pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paper value of the pension plan is $126 billion.  The 
current obligations are $96 billion.  The surpluses in the 
accounts are:  the public service plan, $14.9 billion; the RCMP 
plan, $2.4 billion; and the Canadian forces plan, $12.9 billion, 
for a total of $30.1 billion.  This surplus is not guaranteed 
into the future.  In fact this plan has been in a deficit 
situation before.  The people who are potentially on the hook in 
this whole exercise are the taxpayers.  This government wants to 
scoop the $30 billion to make its books look better.  It is 
Liberal optics.  The Liberals are putting the future taxpayer at 
risk as they have done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing wrong with a surplus, particularly when the 
surplus is there because of some recent circumstances and not 
through the good management of this government.  The government 
should leave the surplus where it is.  There is no guarantee and 
there are several indicators that this surplus will not remain a 
surplus over time, given such critical factors as interest rates 
and salary increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to seize the $30 billion surplus.  It wants 
to rob Peter to pay Paul.  The Minister of Finance is trying to 
make his government's books look better by raiding the federal 
public service pension plan.  The surplus belongs to and is meant 
to benefit current and future retirees.  The surplus can and 
should shield the taxpayer from having to contribute extra money 
to the fund should it go into a deficit position as it has in the 
past.  Taxpayers pumped $13 billion beyond their yearly 
contributions into the plan to cover shortfalls over the past 30 
years of the plan's existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some strong indicators that the pension plan will not 
necessarily be running an annual surplus in the future.  One 
reason the plan is in a surplus situation now is that the fund is 
currently benefiting from the higher interest rates of the 1980s 
on the 20 year government bonds in which the fund is invested. 
Those 1980 interest rates were much higher than 1990 rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plans to move from low risk, long term bonds to 
higher risk market funds.  That is a double-edged sword. 
That can lead to a very nice situation or it can lead to a very 
ugly situation, depending on what happens.  It is not a low risk 
enterprise like government bonds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we should not go into higher risk, higher 
potential benefit plans, but in order to do so, one must do it 
with a running surplus for protection on the downside.  The 
government is doing everything it can to increase the risk to 
taxpayers.  It is not doing this on an actuarially sound basis. 
This is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk more about the way the government is dealing with 
people.  We are talking about 300,000 retirees, plus 345,000 
members of the public service, including military personnel and 
the RCMP.  That is whom we are talking about.  We are talking 
about 645,000 Canadians, plus their dependants, who are affected 
by this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the government House leader on the Thursday question on 
House business earlier today say that the government would like 
to have this all done by Friday.  It is not going to have this 
all done by Friday if I have anything to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has refused to properly fund or even bargain in 
good faith with our public service.  I am talking about the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a 10% vacancy rate in the RCMP in British Columbia and 
it was planned by this government.  We have one-third of the 
country's RCMP officers in the British Columbia jurisdiction. The 
Regina training centre is basically out of commission because of 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at potentially a 50% plus turnover and attrition 
in the RCMP over the next several years because of the 
demographics of its workforce.  Already it is planning not to 
fill positions in British Columbia.  What on earth is the 
government trying to do to the RCMP?  This is going contrary to 
the wishes of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have statements from within Canadian policing organizations 
that organized crime is more entrenched in British Columbia than 
in any other jurisdiction in the country.  With a full slate of 
RCMP we did not have enough resources to address all of that and 
now we are going to run with a 10% vacancy rate in filling those 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but I have a great deal of problem in understanding 
why the government not only refuses to fund the RCMP properly, 
but now it wants to raid its pension plan as well.  Talk about a 
morale destroyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other sectors involved here is the armed forces.  We 
have had great debate about that today.  In order to do the 
minimum the government is requesting, we know that the military 
is overtasked and underfunded as it is.  We know that it needs a 
billion dollars a year to get up to speed.  That is not 
forthcoming.  We have not seen it. All we have seen are some 
quality of life changes.  We are happy to see quality of life 
changes for the military, but it needs to be equipped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military should not have to cannibalize the air force in 
order to equip the CF-18s to do the job they are doing today. 
Essentially that is what had to be done in order to do its job 
for the last 30 days in Kosovo.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operations in Kosovo should not be coming out of the 
national defence budget. It requires a separate budget.  We are 
trying to get the government to address that issue and it is 
fudging it over.  That is not appropriate in order to achieve 
what we need which is to ensure that we have a Department of 
National Defence that can function in Canada's best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the third sector, our public service just went through a 
government imposed settlement.  We had an all-night session in 
the House of Commons.  At 10 p.m. on the night of the all-night 
session there was a negotiated settlement.  We still went through 
that whole exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has become very clear is that the government refuses to go 
after final offer selection negotiations even at a time when the 
unions are agreeable.  Those kinds of negotiations have a track 
record of success.  The government mentality is to rely 
completely on back to work legislation in its labour 
negotiations. I call that bad faith negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government wants to add insult to injury by going after 
the pension surplus.  It has already nibbled at that pension 
surplus to the tune of $10 billion.  Now it wants the whole pie. 
Will this never end?  This is the Liberal agenda, or is it the 
Liberal leadership agenda?  Is this optics for the finance 
minister?  Do we want to get that out of the way well ahead of 
the next election?  I think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about that $10 billion, that nibbling around the 
edges. That is a pretty heavy nibble I understand, but there is 
$30 billion at risk here. The government first started dipping 
into the surplus in 1996. Since then the federal government has 
taken $10.1 billion by not making interest payments on the 
actuarial surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the auditor general has not accepted the 
questionable accounting practices of the government, I think in 
the last three budgets.  We also know there is an opinion out 
there.  I am not attributing it to the auditor general but there 
is an opinion shared by many that the actions taken on the $10.1 
billion are also a questionable accounting practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civil servants have a valid argument.  They are saying that 
a significant part of the surplus results from the fact that they 
were into a six year pay freeze.  In some cases that is more like 
an eight year pay freeze.  This freeze did several things, one of 
which meant that new retirees from that timeframe start out 
receiving little more than pensioners who had retired years 
earlier received.  That was not what was predicated by the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union is basically telling its membership they have had six 
plus years of wage freezes, they have had job cuts through direct 
layoffs or privatization and they have had delays on issues like 
pay equity. 
On top of all that, now their public service pension plan is 
under attack.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of sympathy with that point of view given 
what I see in this bill. There is an expectation by the 
government that we all have short memories, that this bill will 
go through, that the next election is two years away and in the 
meantime we will all have forgotten about this raid on the public 
service pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been balancing its books not by cutting 
spending but by raiding surpluses and taxing Canadians higher and 
higher year after year.  The taxpayer is the odd man out along 
with the public service for any future shortfalls and any future 
deficits in this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus in the plan should be left alone.  Plain and simple, 
the government should not be using it for any other purpose than 
to ensure that the plan remains solvent now and in the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-78 is 
a technical bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is the basis for another federal government attack 
on its employees.  It is, I would say, a new manifestation of 
its refusal to deal with its public service, in the broadest 
sense, since the Public Sector Pension Investment Board 
administers the pensions of several groups of Crown employees 
who are not, strictly speaking, public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government is showing that it does not want to 
negotiate, be involved in joint administration or create the 
partnership of which it has spoken in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be terrible if we had to admit that the government is 
not capable of considering a joint administration of pension 
funds, discussed and negotiated with, and agreed to by, the 
unions, as there is in Quebec for example.  That is my first 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second, and one I wish to stress, is that the federal 
government is taking advantage of a lack of clearness in the 
first act, in order to get its hands on all the surpluses. 
These are already beyond what is necessary, beyond what was 
recommended by actuaries to ensure that there will be enough 
money to pay pensions.  The federal government is not the only 
one to contribute, but it decides that it will be the one who 
can dispose of this surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, public servants have, on several occasions, had to 
face layoffs and offers of early retirement, and this has had an 
important part to play in the feelings of discouragement among 
those who were left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was on the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, we heard repeatedly from experts that, when the 
remaining staff see their colleagues offered early retirement, 
they wonder “When will it be my turn?”  This does a great deal 
to discourage them, and no doubt undermines to some extent their 
loyalty, a loyalty that is so essential if the state is to serve 
its people well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These employees are already working under extremely difficult 
conditions in a context of diminished resources and conflict. 
We need only think of the last settlement and the last special 
law, the knife at the throat for a major group of employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only recall this to realize that once again, with the 
wounds barely closed and not properly healed, the government is 
using its absolute power—it is not only the employer but the 
legislator—to decide it will use the surplus over and above what 
is needed to make sure pension funds are paid out well according 
to current regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the interpretation given this bill, and I have seen 
nothing that would lead me to say otherwise.  That means that 
this decision deprives those already retired of increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make an aside.  We are beginning to see the 
negative side of what appeared to be golden handshakes, the 
package offered those who agreed, under what seemed to be 
extraordinary conditions, to terminate their employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money given them in exchange for their giving up their job 
security looked to be significant.  However, we are beginning to 
see that a number of these employees, who were tempted to start 
up a small business or become self-employed have found themselves 
in difficult straits at an age where finding a job is infinitely 
harder. 
So they have added to the number of people in society looking 
for work and having a hard time finding it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other issues, and perhaps I will have time 
to address them, but I want to mention that the government wants 
nothing to do with treating its employees as managers who are 
involved in the security that must surround the management of 
pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, a joint committee was struck to try to make 
recommendations to guide the government, which, at that time, 
seemed to be of an excellent disposition.  It is interesting to 
see that the committee had proposed that a board of directors 
comprise six members representing the employers and six members 
representing the workers and one retiree without voting 
privilege.  This is what the advisory committee recommended in 
December 1996.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little while later, the President of the Treasury Board said 
in a release that the government had accepted a certain number 
of these recommendations.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report, the result of four years of conscientious work by 
union representatives, retired public servants, and public 
servants who are still working. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet none of the recommendations made by this committee—which the 
minister said did its work conscientiously—was followed up on in 
any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, that is possible. 
A long time ago, I was on a negotiating committee that agreed 
with the Government of Quebec that the public sector employees' 
pension fund—and this was the case in the various unions and 
departments—would be co-managed, that we would agree on investment 
rules.  In other words, unionized employees and workers would 
have a say in how their money was invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, the maximum rate of return is sought, but at other 
times the goal might be a vehicle that not only has an excellent 
a rate of return but that has a more social goal, that 
emphasizes job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a joint management committee for a pension fund puts the 
onus on both parties.  Quebec has operated this way for a long 
time.  During the public finance crisis, the parties jointly 
negotiated how surpluses would be used. 
It was not the government's first idea, but it finally realized 
that it was advisable to make it easier for those employees 
wishing to retire to do so under advantageous conditions.  The 
unions were involved, and were in fact the first to come up with 
the proposal. A comment could be made, but the point is that 
this was the result of joint negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it not possible federally to reach an agreement with 
employees, with pensioners represented, on how their retirement 
money is going to be managed, on improvements where possible, 
and on the sharing of risks?  The committee agreed on how the 
risks and the surpluses would be shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone through this bill, which creates a public sector 
pension investment board. There is the word board again. 
Not only is it not a body with equal representation, but a 
committee of eight members must first be appointed and then make 
recommendations to appoint a board of 12 directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do unions enjoy equal representation on that board? Are they 
fully represented? No, and this is very unfortunate. The 
government is creating a board, which it claims will be 
operating at arm's length from the minister. That is what it 
claims.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that the board is not an agent of Her 
Majesty and is therefore not accountable. In fact, that board is 
appointed if not directly, at least indirectly, by the minister. 
It will be the minister who will choose the committee members 
who, in turn, will select directors. This is particularly true 
in the case of the chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing, among others, that struck me is how the investing 
will be done. The board's objects are defined as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) to invest its assets with a view to achieving a maximum rate 
of return, without undue risk of loss, having regard to the 
funding, policies and requirements of the pension plans 
established under the Acts referred to in paragraph (<I>a</I>) and the 
ability of those plans to meet their financial obligations. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the bill provides that the governor in council may 
determine what percentage of funds is to be set aside to buy 
Government of Canada bonds, and what rules should be used to 
calculate that percentage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government using the surpluses already 
accumulated, which total approximately $30 billion and are 
beyond what is necessary to maintain the pension plans, but it 
will also use that $30 billion to pay its share of 
contributions. The government is giving itself 15 years. 
In addition, it decides on the rules governing the investment, 
in addition to giving a very specific mandate to the board to 
“invest its assets with a view to achieving a maximum rate of 
return, without undue risk of loss”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living in a period where workers and social organizations 
are becoming increasingly aware that investments can affect the 
economy we live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only mandate here is a maximum rate of return, “without 
undue risk of loss”.  What does “undue” mean?  If we take a big 
risk that could bring a significant return, is the risk undue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this current period, this provision bothers me quite a bit. 
I am sure many people in the unions will wonder why they have no 
say and why they too cannot make choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that looks a lot like this government's approach to managing 
transfer payments, where the government reduced its deficit by 
transferring it through significant cuts to health care, 
education and social welfare up to the latest budget.  In this 
budget, it is far from returning the situation in these fields 
to what it had been, even though it has guaranteed investments 
over five years of $11.5 billion.  We are a long way from where 
we were before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that made major cuts to unemployment 
insurance programs.  It reduced accessibility.  It reduced 
benefits and the length of their payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also the same government that is now equipping itself to 
take the surpluses in the pension funds. 
Instead of agreeing to share the administration with the unions, 
it makes decisions by equipping itself with mechanisms which 
appear to put it at a distance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone reading this with care will see that the government is 
accomplishing indirectly what it does not want to do directly. 
It is hobbling the board to such an extent that it has no 
leeway, moreover I would not want it to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be tempted to make use of a word that is 
unparliamentary.  It means to try to appear to be doing 
something other than what one is actually doing.  I trust that 
is clear.  Saying that one is doing one thing, while doing 
another. 
The government is not keeping its distance, but instead of 
managing jointly with employees, it creates a body to serve its 
interests, which is most regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a number of opportunities in this House to speak of 
the government's relationship with the public sector, and I 
would like in closing to make a comparison.  The federal 
government's inability to deal properly with public sector 
employees in something as natural as the pension funds, an area 
in which agreement should be reachable, reminds me of the way it 
treats the Quebec people.

congratulate the hon. member for Mercier, who has left her mark 
as a remarkable unionist. She speaks of workers with the voice

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about $30 billion in surpluses: $14.9 billion in 
the public service superannuation plan, $2.4 billion in the RCMP 
plan and $12.9 billion in the Canadian Forces plan. That is a 
lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we buy life insurance, we do not like it if, at some point, 
the company changes the rules. This is money taken from the 
pockets of these people. My colleague put it very well: the 
government is indirectly setting up—it is even sneakier in a 
way—some kind of committee that will not be independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money was taken from the employment insurance fund, and the 
minister opposite must have some regrets about that. 
He could at least make amends by putting some money back in the 
workers' pockets. In my riding of Matapédia—Matane, workers come 
to my office and say “What is going on? In the spring, we are 
three or four weeks short”.

with the EI fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I closed my speech with a

</I></B></P><P align=left>After a six-year salary freeze, massive job reductions through 
direct layoffs or privatization, and continual foot-dragging on 
pay equity rulings, the position adopted by the Treasury Board 
during the 1998 consultation on public service pension reform is 
of great concern. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were right to be concerned, because I think that the bill

at the time.

putting it into private hands rather than back into communities? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, actually, I believe we do 
not know what this money is going to be used for. What we know, 
though, is that it will not be used to improve the lot of 
present and future public service pensioners, even though the 
surplus is the result of their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing fights of this kind in the private sector. Private 
sector workers are extremely concerned by what is happening in 
the federal government. There is a close relationship between 
this federal policy and the policy non-unionized companies or 
companies where the unions are not strong enough will keep on 
following. I am talking about the private sector of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what concerns me because we know that people who had 
well paid jobs will have a relatively comfortable pension. But 
there are a lot of workers who are close to retirement and who 
will not have a very high income.

all their lives will have a very meagre income, which makes no

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague believe that the minister will some day do 
something to help older workers, whether this is POWA or 
something else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, the older workers' 
situation is often a dramatic one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people have a decent pension, they may still have problems, 
but what happens when the pension is a pittance, or nothing at 
all, when a person has not reached retirement age, and can no 
longer work?  This is what happens to women over the age of 50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all gone door to door campaigning. How many times were 
we told “At my age, I can no longer find work”?  There is also 
the plight of older workers who have been laid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, people will no longer have had job permanency. 
They will have had short term work, little McJobs.  The problem 
of older workers will be raised more and more, and will become 
acute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point there will certainly be a wide gap between those 
who can draw fairly decent pensions and those who will find 
themselves in dramatically reduced circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could end by referring to all those whose health has been 
affected by their work.  From my work in occupational health and 
safety, I know that there is no compensation for having been 
worn down by work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today in 
support of Bill C-78, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensions are a complicated business and this is a very 
complicated bill.  Much of it is about putting the pension plan 
for federal employees, the public service, Canadian forces and 
the RCMP on a solid financial footing.  We know how important 
pensions are to all Canadians, but we also know that how we 
provide pensions for these federal public sector employees has to 
be fair to all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other people will be talking in more detail about the financial 
arrangements that are being proposed in the bill.  I want to take 
some time today to talk about the Canada Post section of it and 
how the bill affects the corporation and its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill says is clear and fairly straightforward.  By 
October 1, 2000 Canada Post Corporation will establish a pension 
plan for its employees that are now covered by the Public Service 
Superannuation Act, the PSSA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan that Canada Post establishes has to meet the 
requirements of the Pension Benefits Standard Act and the Income 
Tax Act.  Once the plan is established the PSSA will cease to 
cover Canada Post employees.  On the day it is established the 
Canada Post plan has to provide the same benefits as the PSSA at 
the same cost to employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds now in the PSSA are there to provide the benefits that 
Canada Post employees have already earned and will be transferred 
to the new plan.  I am told and I understand that the transfer of 
funds will be about $6 billion.  The benefits for the past will 
be exactly what they would have been under the PSSA and they 
cannot be reduced in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year after the new plan is established on October 1, 2001 it 
will become subject to collective bargaining, except those parts 
of the plan that deal with the service and benefits coming from 
the PSSA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other features in the bill that are important to 
employees, opportunities to count past service and a life 
insurance plan that is a mirror of the one employees are leaving, 
and some that are important to the corporation such as the right 
to determine how any plan surplus will be used and the right to 
establish more than one plan.  These are the main features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this all being done?  For Canada Post this is a decision 
based on business because of a number of factors.  First, like 
all other corporations under the PSSA the employer costs for the 
pension plan will increase. 
For a corporation with a commercial mandate, the bottom line 
impact has to be looked at very seriously.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post operates under the Canada Labour Code.  Under the 
code all terms and conditions of employment are subject to 
collective bargaining.  As long as it was under the PSSA, though, 
it could not bargain pensions which are a significant part of 
total compensation.  There is a real opportunity here for Canada 
Post to assume total responsibility for all aspects of its 
operation and its management but, and this is very important, the 
legislation is good for employees too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it promises the same level of pension benefits as they 
would have under the PSSA.  The guarantees in the bill about the 
benefits employees have already earned are very strong.  Second, 
it makes pensions bargainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will wonder why Canada Post employees will be able 
to bargain pensions when public service employees cannot and why 
they should be able to affect the design and management of their 
pension plan when public servants under the PSSA cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the President of the Treasury Board outlined in his speech, a 
consultation process took place over a number of months last 
year.  That process was intended to lead to a joint management 
structure for the PSSA so that employees could have shared in all 
the decisions around their pension plans.  Those talks did not 
lead to a deal, but the government is still ready to talk to the 
unions about joint management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada Post and its employees, not being able to include 
pensions in bargaining is an unusual restriction for an 
organization that functions under the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may also be people who wonder why pensions are not subject 
to the labour code right away.  Some people will say this is an 
exceptional treatment under the labour code, and they are right. 
However this is an exceptional case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 50,000 employees are affected by the decision on the part 
of Canada Post to withdraw from the PSSA.  These employees are 
located all across the country.  The government is interested in 
the concerns of Canada Post and in helping the corporation to 
create a business environment where it can succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very interested in making sure employees can feel 
secure about their pensions.  Employees can know by this 
legislation what their new pension will look like, what kind of 
benefits it will provide and how much it will cost.  Employees 
need not have any uncertainty about these things.  They are very 
strong guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the bill affecting Canada Post Corporation and 
its employees do not look like a big part of the bill, some two 
or three pages, but they will help Canada Post move forward in 
its efforts to provide good service to all Canadians and will 
give it another piece of the framework for managing the people 
part of its business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These same provisions give employees guarantees about pensions, 
a very important part of compensation, and give them the 
opportunity to influence how their pensions will evolve in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking from my very limited experience when I negotiated 
contracts as chairman of the Peel board back in another life in 
another time, the actual salary compensation was oftentimes less 
important than everything else negotiated in the contract.  I 
found that people, particularly as the population of Canada is 
aging, were very concerned about their pensions and their pension 
rights.  They wanted to have a say in how the money was being 
distributed and how it would affect their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly agree with this legislation.  It is giving 
power to the people and responsibility to the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, Shipbuilding. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we have noticed that the Liberal government has been 
slowly liquidating the surplus over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about Bill C-78, we are talking about the 
government's intentions to take over or raid the surplus of this 
fund, which is about $31 billion.  That is how it has been able 
to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time we debated this issue in the House was when the 
government tried to put its hands on the surplus in employment 
insurance. 
It has not been balancing the budget by cutting spending or 
eliminating waste.  Year after year taxes are increasing to 
balance the budget, and now the Liberal government is trying to 
put its hands on various surpluses in various departments.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government think it has to put its hands on 
surpluses which belong to corporations or the public?  Why is the 
government trying to put its hands in the cookie jar? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think this is a 
very fundamental issue when we refer to the EI plan and the 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things all members of the opposition seem to forget 
is that during bad times the Government of Canada and Canadian 
taxpayers built up all the deficits in both the EI fund and the 
pension plan funds.  The government is at the point where it has 
invested the money wisely and the surpluses being generated now 
are in fact the property of the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to invest the money appropriately and to do what we 
can to keep this country healthy and a good global competitor. We 
cannot do that with deficits.  We cannot do that by artificially 
pouring money into areas where it does not belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with the member's question except to the point 
where the opposition always seem to start its questioning when we 
hit a surplus.  It never goes back in history to when the 
government was topping up the deficits. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have great respect for the hon. member.  In her speech 
she was talking about the pensions of Canada Post employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we be tampering with their pensions? In October and 
November 1997 we were in a contract dispute with Canada Post and 
the Liberal government legislated its employees back to work.  It 
has been almost two years since the employees were legislated 
back to work and there is still no settlement in sight.  I would 
like the hon. member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not want to 
comment on contract disputes with Canada Post.  We are here to 
deal with the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarks I made today very definitely indicate that the 
bargaining unit for Canada Post will be discussing pensions and 
upgrading pensions.  In the bargaining situation that will come 
up in the year 2001 those pensions will be looked at and 
readjusted according to the membership and according to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is empowering the unions to have a say in how 
they would like their pensions upgraded or altered as part of the 
bargaining unit.  I believe it is a very fair proposal, 
particularly for Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill C-78 proposes to 
establish an investment board.  The proposed investment board 
will not include any provisions for the auditor general to take 
an indepth look at the books of the proposed investment board. 
Nor will the board fall under the provisions of the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To whom will the board be accountable?  Who will ensure that the 
board will operate in a fair manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will have to go 
back on my own limited experience at functioning on boards.  Some 
boards have duly elected members from the public, such as the 
school board that I served on.  Some have appointed members who 
are well respected members of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever a board is appointed its position has to remain neutral 
and fair. It has to listen to labour, to management, to the 
government and to the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot more faith in publicly appointed boards than the 
member opposite seems to have.  I think they are very limited. As 
a matter of fact I know of no boards that have been held up as 
gangs that are there to lean one way or the other.  Publicly 
appointed boards serve publicly and have to account to the 
members they are serving.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I just wanted to make a comment on the member opposite's 
question of the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the problem he is alluding to with respect to the 
transparency and accountability of this investment board is 
really a matter for the Access to Information Act.  I think what 
we have to look at is not changing this legislation but making 
sure, when the time does come forward and when we have a chance 
to look at the Access to Information Act, it provides for 
accountability and certainly transparency for the type of arm's 
length board we have in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Madam Speaker, I always agree with 
my hon. colleague from Hamilton.  I will bow to his wisdom on 
this one and let his remarks stand. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would simply, in the spirit of my other questions, 
ask the parliamentary secretary if she is not bothered by the 
idea of taking pension funds belonging to those who contributed 
to it.  Finally, what will the money the government is going to 
recover be used for? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Madam Speaker, again I would like to 
reiterate my position.  Because the minister happens to be 
sitting here, I would like to draw in the EI plan as well as the 
pension plans.  We must remember in the bad times the government 
paid and paid and topped it up and built up a deficit and a debt 
which the whole country paid for.  When careful management has 
built these funds up, in the good times it is time these funds 
were paid back to all taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the pension payouts are fair we are not doing it at 
the expense of the recipients.  We are doing it because it is the 
proper and appropriate thing to do at this time in the economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I feel it 
is very important to speak to this debate because it is such a 
change in public policy and a change that is done unilaterally, 
without the support of the unions involved, the public or other 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in most legislation Bill C-78 has much that is good and much 
that is bad.  The bad far outweighs the good in this legislation 
which is part of a larger pattern of the government to take 
public money and transfer it into private hands.  Once that 
happens the public good is not at the top of priorities to turn 
that money around and serve our communities through building 
roads, hospitals or schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the good in the legislation first because, as I 
said, there is not that much of it.  The good is that there is a 
dental plan for beneficiaries.  Because we are thinking of people 
who are retired, this is a particularly important element.  It is 
important to have and would be a very important change.  The 
benefits will be calculated on the last five years rather than 
the last six, which would result in a slight increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recognizes benefits for same sex couples.  That section is a 
very dramatic change.  It is long awaited and is indeed 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would increase the supplementary death benefit. Initially 
this was being negotiated, but unfortunately it broke down over 
what to do with the $30 billion surplus, over representation on 
the new investment board and joint management of the fund or some 
input from labour and plan members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government then decided to proceed with the legislation 
rather than continue to pursue a negotiated settlement.  That is 
incredibly unfortunate because it means that it is not possible 
for the New Democrats to support the legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two really important points.  The investment board 
will be a 12 member board charged with the responsibility of 
investing funds on the open market.  We are speaking about $30 
billion, an unbelievable and incredible amount of money, that 
will be put on the open market.  These members would be appointed 
by the minister through a nominating committee of other members 
who might be retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be concerned that appointments to the investment 
board might be for purely patronage reasons.  Who benefits from 
these changes?  It will not be the pensioners because their 
actual pensions will not increase.  They will not get any more, 
but they will not get any less.  The employees will be paying 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to question the rationale of these changes when the very 
essence of a pension plan is to deduct money from the employees 
and save it for them so it will be there when they retire. 
However, they will not benefit from the changes in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a benefit for those who will be investing it and for 
those who will be receiving it.  The flipping of capital will 
cost millions in brokerage fees.  Bay Street will enjoy a 
windfall when shares and stocks are bought and sold but the 
employees and the pensioners will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour has always argued that pension surpluses are the 
exclusive property of the employees and retired plan members and 
should be used for nothing other than their benefit.  This is a 
key issue.  It is paramount and must reinforced.  As this surplus 
is all from deferred wages and part of the pay package, it should 
be returned to the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other change is that any surplus above $9 billion will 
trigger either the cessation of employer-employee contributions 
for a period of time, a premium holiday, or government could 
simply take the surplus and use it for whatever it wants without 
any consultation with the employees or pensioners.  This means it 
could be a very important source of revenue for the government 
when in fact it is the property of the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there is no provision to increase benefits other than 
by an act of parliament.  It is a defined benefit plan that has 
an obligation to pay each recipient a fixed amount regardless of 
the condition of the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard over and over today that the government takes all the 
risk so it should be able to do whatever it wants with the money 
when there is a surplus.  It feels that because it has to assume 
the risk of providing a defined benefit, even if the plan was in 
a deficit, it deserves to keep the surplus when the plan is 
healthy.  This is convoluted logic that we cannot accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension is part of the wage package.  Proof of this is that 
the government uses the fact that there is a pension plan to 
justify relatively low wages.  Even though the pension is not 
negotiated at the bargaining table, both parties refer to it and 
acknowledge it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional proof that employees own the pension moneys lies in 
the fact that in a company under federal jurisdiction, workers 
have to vote by a two-third majority to let the employer take out 
any of the surplus.  This law recognizes the surplus is the 
property of the employees who must vote on whether to release it. 
Obviously that is not happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is acting unilaterally.  It does not even want to 
share in the decisions.  No agreement has been reached with the 
union, nor does the government have any plans to include the 
union on a joint union-management board.  Instead, the government 
intends to appoint directors to the board.  These actions 
reinforce the misleading view of who bears the risks and rewards 
of pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers have typically justified their grab on pension 
surpluses on the grounds that they take the risks so they should 
get the rewards.  However, pension plan management makes it more 
likely that surpluses will accrue, so there are very few risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to think of it in those terms, let us imagine an 
individual who has saved money throughout his or her life in 
preparation for retirement, and a bank says “I want that money to 
pay my debts.  You have kept it in my bank all these years and I 
have had the risk of storing it.  It is my money and I will use 
it however I want.  You have no say in it”.  What we are facing 
is our government telling us “What is yours is mine and what is 
mine is my own business, so you can just take a hike.  We will do 
what we think is best ”.  I have never seen democracy work like 
that. 
What we are facing is a raid or just plain piracy of a pension 
plan.  That $30 billion is an incredible amount of money, and the 
decisions made about it belong with the people who pay into it 
and the pensioners who will be receiving it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to a debate earlier on the Liberal side where a 
member said that the New Democratic Party should not be agitating 
and getting the seniors and elders all upset over this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found this incredibly patronizing because the seniors and 
elders I know can certainly read, write, think and analyse, and 
they do lobby and vote.  They have come here and lobbied. They 
have made decisions and have analysed that this is not a good way 
to deal with pensions.  They are not even doing this for 
themselves because their pensions will not change.  They will not 
get any more out of this.  However, they have the wisdom and 
strength to know that these changes will have an effect on those 
who come after them.  I always believed it was our job as members 
of parliament to be thinking of those who come after us, not of 
our own smaller interests but the greater interests of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that bothered me was when a Liberal member stood 
up and said that we had these crazy ideas about wanting to invest 
pension money in maybe ethical stocks or bonds, or that it should 
even be a consideration of what is done with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a heck of a lot of people who do not want one cent of 
their money being invested in nuclear arms, in small arms, in 
factories where children are forced into labour and women are 
locked in for 14 to 16 hours a day to produce cheap goods, or in 
situations where the money they are saving for their retirement 
could be used to undermine their own jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration should be given to using the money saved in this 
country to build our own roads, hospitals, schools and 
universities and to do it at a good rate of return so that we can 
educate our children.  Maybe we could help those in the far 
corners of the country who normally would not have any access to 
schools, roads or hospitals.  That is a very good use of money 
and should always be a consideration when pooled money within a 
country is being distributed for whatever reason.  We should be 
looking after our own people first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in the pension plan will disproportionately affect 
women.  The average pension will be $9,600 per year which is not 
a lot to live on.  However, women have borne the brunt of a lot 
of changes that have happened through the Liberal government. 
They have borne the cost of our health cuts and the sexual abuse 
in our military.  The government has denied them pay equity and, 
in many cases, they are denied unemployment insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it for?  It is not for the common good of our country. 
It is not for the betterment of living conditions anywhere. These 
changes are indeed changes that would please the corporate titans 
of the country to move money away from those who need it and put 
it into the hands of those who do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though there are good changes proposed in Bill C-78, the 
bad far outweigh anything that the legislation would bring 
forward.  It is very disappointing not to be able to support 
pension plan changes just because they will not benefit those who 
need them most. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great attention to the member's comments 
and I would like to make a couple of observations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key points she made was that the surplus, to use her 
own words, was the exclusive property of the employees who 
contributed to the pension plan.  I have to give her my 
perspective on this because I come from a riding where there are 
very few unions. 
I do not think there are unions of any size in my riding. In my 
riding it is mostly small entrepreneurs, farmers, people who are 
self-employed.  They will have contributed to this surplus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the government has been paying 70% toward 
this pension plan and the employees 30%. When the government pays 
money to anything, it comes from taxpayers.  Every person in my 
riding who has been paying taxes and who does not belong to a 
union has been contributing to that 70% that has been going to 
this pension plan.  In other words, the people in my riding would 
feel that they do have a stake and as a matter of fact they might 
even claim ownership of the $30 billion of which we are speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that the benefits in this whole $30 billion 
is part of the wage packet of the employees.  I point out she 
also said that the payout of benefits is determined by an act of 
parliament.  We have a situation where the benefits are already 
determined and we have a surplus that is exceeding by far the 
amount of benefits that can be obtained by the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it would appear to me, using that logic, that indeed 
that $30 billion actually belongs to the ordinary citizens of 
Canada and not to the union, as long as the union is guaranteed 
that it does indeed receive the benefits that are part of the 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those who are involved in 
private pensions get to have a say.  Over three-quarters of them 
would have to vote to have a say on what that surplus is used 
for.  The changes that are being made would not give the 
taxpayers that the hon. member mentioned any say in where the 
surplus is going. In fact, the federal government is using it 
however it pleases without the consent of either the taxpayers or 
the people paying directly into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the surplus may be or however or wherever it is 
invested should not be done just in terms of what the greatest 
return on that money would be. I think it is important that the 
money is spent first in Canada to benefit Canadians rather than 
outside the country in very risky endeavours.  We have already 
seen what the market can do, what unregulated, totally 
catastrophic situations can arise with unbridled use of capital.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-78 amends various acts, essentially replacing words such 
as spouse, wife, wives, widow, et cetera with survivor or 
survivors. In this 200 page bill which has about 231 clauses, the 
word survivor is mentioned 249 times.  Of course it is defined in 
clauses 53 and 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's backgrounder on Bill C-78 states: “To ensure 
that the government's pension package for its employees is in 
keeping with the opinion of the courts, survivors benefits will 
be amended to extend survivors benefits to same sex partners”. 
However, in 1995 the supreme court ruled in the Egan case that an 
opposite sex definition of spouse in the Old Age Security Act 
relating to spousal benefits was reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hon. member's opinion, why is the government ignoring 
this supreme court decision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to 
determining who the beneficiary for a pension should be, I think 
it is important to allow every individual to determine who their 
beneficiaries are, whether they are their children, their 
parents, their partner, their wife, their husband, their son or 
their daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal motives for, as the hon. member says, ignoring a

the Liberal member who spoke before me, I come from a riding 90% 
of which is unionized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What gets to me in this bill is the make-up of the advisory

always be joint.  Who will represent the unions on this 
committee?  Where are the workers?  Where are the former 
workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one person will represent the pensioners.  If that means 
jointly with the workers, they should look again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to explain her viewpoint and give her 
opinion on this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the whole appointment 
process is particularly troubling.  When I was first elected I 
sat on the aboriginal affairs committee and we had a paper 
whisked in front of us telling us who the interim commissioner 
would be for Nunavut.  To leave the appointment of a board to one 
person, our minister, with the input of a nominating committee of 
eight is quite wrong.  Representation should be built in for the 
employees and the pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of appointments and how we deal with them in our 
parliament is worthy of a debate.  We could talk about how our 
senators are appointed and how judges to the supreme court are 
appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process continues the very exclusive nature of allowing 
power to be focused at the very top of the pyramid, rather than 
giving any say or power to, or investing any responsibility with, 
the people who were elected.  The government has the most seats 
and it will make its decisions as it sees fit.  The whole 
appointment process needs a lot of scrutiny and I do not agree 
with the process which is being put forward.  I do not think it 
will benefit us in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think the member 
for Yukon quite understood my earlier question.  It is my fault I 
am sure for not explaining it very well.  I will try again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of difficulty, coming from a riding in which 
there are a few unions, understanding the logic that the union is 
claiming ownership of this $30 billion of alleged surplus, even 
though it cannot increase its benefits because its benefits are 
fixed and even though this $30 billion surplus has actually come 
from the taxpayers.  It has come from the ordinary small people, 
the barbers and the grocery clerks and these small people in my 
riding who do not have the protection of a union and do not have 
a circumstance where they can put in $30 and get $70 from the 
government.  However, that money from the government is coming 
from those grocery clerks and those small people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money could be invested more wisely and get a better 
return.  We see the same kind of conflict we had with the Quebec 
pension plan which invested wisely and aggressively and is a much 
healthier plan than the Canadian pension plan which invested only 
in safe instruments.  Is it not better for the small people, the 
ordinary taxpayers, that we try to use this money in a way that 
actually reduces taxes for ordinary Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously I do not agree 
with the member opposite.  What I understand him to be saying is 
that the Canadian forces, the RCMP and the public service should 
not have any say in the changes proposed in this bill, and I do 
not agree with that at all.  Sure, everyone else should have a 
say as well, but this does not give them that say.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to take a few minutes to talk about the RCMP.  As you 
know, I have a very strong interest in policing matters.  I was a 
former chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police.  I think we need 
to ensure that all things are done in every way for our police 
services across Canada, wherever they may be, and I think it is 
important to highlight this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by pointing out that the government is aware 
that some members of the RCMP have expressed concern over the 
lack of RCMP input into the pension amendment package.  It is 
true that the same degree of consultation did not take place with 
RCMP representatives as it was the case with public service 
employee representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that the government would have 
preferred to consult more widely with the RCMP on its future 
pension arrangements.  I think that is clear.  Most of the 
proposed changes, however, will address pressing financial issues 
facing all of the public sector pension plans, including the RCMP 
plan.  I think we need to note that the superannuation plan in 
that sense will be fully taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, because of the way the RCMPSA is harmonized with 
the Canada Pension Plan, RCMP members have been protected from 
CPP contribution increases since 1987, while the government's 
costs have been increasing.  The urgency of addressing these 
financial pressures was a major reason for the government's 
decision to proceed as quickly as possible with the pension 
changes, including benefit improvements included in Bill C-71, 
the budget implementation act.  The change to base the pension 
calculation on a five year instead of a six year average is an 
important change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes the fact that the RCMP is a unique 
organization and that consultation with members around plan 
changes is highly desirable.  For these reasons, Bill C-78 
contains a number of areas in which consultation can take place 
in the future.  It should be noted that the solicitor general has 
ensured that the proposed amendments to the RCMPSA contain 
flexibility to adjust the pension plan to meet the future needs 
of the RCMP.  The areas where change will be possible are 
vesting, portability of pension credits, both in and out of the 
RCMPSA, expanded elective service provisions and plan provisions 
for members working part time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Present vesting periods are set at 10 years for regular members 
and 5 years for civilian members.  The bill will allow these 
periods to be shortened by regulations if, after extensive study 
and consultation, such changes are indeed desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current provisions of the RCMPSA, members wishing to 
increase their pensionable service can only do so if they have 
prior public service, or service in the Canadian forces, or 
service as a member of a provincial or municipal police force 
absorbed by the RCMP.  The bill provides for greater pension 
portability for members joining or leaving the RCMP.  The bill 
will make it possible to transfer pension credits from a previous 
employer, which is an important provision for police personnel. 
It is one that we should note and indicate that we are prepared 
to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members leaving the RCMP in the future, a new option will be 
available to improve pension portability under conditions to be 
determined in new regulations.  Members will be able to transfer 
the actuarially calculated value of their pension benefits to 
locked-in financial vehicles or to another employer's pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, there are a number of RCMP members who are working on 
a part time basis.  This bill will make it possible to 
accommodate such members through the making of new regulations. 
Again that is an important provision and one that is important to 
police personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area in which future consultation between the solicitor 
general and the RCMP will take place is on the member 
contribution rates which will be in effect beginning in the year 
2004.  For the period beginning January 1, 2004, the Treasury 
Board will set the member contribution rates on the joint 
recommendation of the solicitor general and the President of the 
Treasury Board.  Although the bill specifically states that 
RCMPSA member contribution increases cannot be greater than those 
of the public service, because of the unique nature of the force 
the contribution increases could in fact be less.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the solicitor general will be given increased powers 
under the new bill for the financing and funding of the RCMP 
superannuation plan.  In addition, the solicitor general's 
pension advisory committee created under the RCMPSA is being 
given a strengthened mandate in Bill C-78.  That is an important 
implementation provision and one that all members of the House 
should be prepared to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strengthened mandate will ensure that members and 
pensioners will be able to use their pension advisory committee 
for the purposes of making recommendations to the solicitor 
general on the administration, design and funding of the pension 
plan.  That too is an important area in which personnel will have 
valued input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general will rely on his pension advisory 
committee to assist him in carrying out his increased 
responsibilities.  In addition, a stronger pension advisory 
committee will lead to greater opportunities for meaningful 
consultation with RCMP plan members in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are important areas that need to have the 
legislative background which will ensure that our police services 
and the RCMP in particular have the kind of provisions that are 
necessary.  Bill C-78 does that.  Therefore, I would urge all 
members of the House to support it because it is an important 
initiative and one that benefits RCMP, wherever they may be in 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two short questions for the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, there is no provision concerning the surplus of over 
$30 billion in the funds' current accounts. With this bill, is 
the government trying to do exactly what it did with the 
surpluses accumulated in the employment insurance fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government want to repeat what it did and use the 
surplus in the public service pension plan for the same 
purposes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the hon. member opposite on this and I may 
then have other questions for him. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member 
opposite for her question.  Of course there is no real analogy to 
the EI fund as it exists.  As members know, it was a decision of 
the auditor general back in 1986 to have that fund put into the 
consolidated revenue fund of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to note that Bill C-78 is a strengthened 
bill that will enable us to move forward as a government in a 
very positive and meaningful way.  It will ensure that pensioners 
and people looking forward to that income will be able to enjoy 
it in a way that is in their best interests and those of their 
families.  I think it is important to note that they will not 
have to pay any more, nor will they have to pay any less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we proceed with Bill C-78.  It is an 
important piece of legislation which will ensure that Canadians 
on pensions will find the resources necessary to carry on with 
the quality of life necessary for their circumstances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the hon. member comes from a riding where there 
are many union members, but I want to ask him how he feels about 
the membership of that committee, on which unions members would 
not truly be represented, and on which pensioners would not be 
represented by a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that the membership of that committee is tantamount to 
the minister telling people “I will do as I have always done. I 
will strike committees and appoint people who are on my side

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it is important to 
keep in mind and keep in perspective that the pension advisory 
committee and board, as the hon. member refers to it, will in 
fact be a much strengthened committee.  It will underscore the 
commitment of the government to ensure that men and women from 
across Canada are placed in that position, to listen to all sides 
and make recommendations which are important to people who need 
that kind of advice and who are looking forward to that ability 
to give it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member that as usual, we on the government 
side will ensure that qualified people will be sitting on that 
committee and will offer the kind of assistance that is necessary 
for Canadians wherever they may live to ensure that their voices 
are heard and that the right thing at the end of the day is done 
on behalf of those people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>   Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-78, what an incredible piece of legislation brought 
forward by the Liberal government.  I could not believe it when I 
first saw it.  It seemed more like a page out of <I>MAD</I> 
magazine rather than serious legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will allow the tax and spend Liberal government to 
seize the money for more government spending which is currently 
held by public sector pension plans both now and in the future. A 
new government appointed—not necessarily qualified, just 
appointed—pension board with no employee representation will get 
to manage the funds. The board will operate without the scrutiny 
of the auditor general or parliament and will be exempt from 
access to information laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to seizing the surpluses in the employee pension 
plans, this bill will also see the government increasing the 
employee contributions.  If these pension plans have a shortfall 
in the future when the surplus has been spent or when the funds 
have been mismanaged, the good old Canadian taxpayer gets to make 
up the shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is crazy enough, but there is more.  In order to 
appease the justifiably upset pension plan members, the 
government's bill states that “survivor benefits are extended to 
an expanded class of beneficiaries”. It looks good from a 
distance, Madam Speaker, but before you trade in your old 
reliable car on the new improved model, take a closer look.  Look 
past the flashy paint job and you will find that on the new model 
the tires are flat, the engine will not even idle and it is full 
of electrical shorts.  The new improved model does not even run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 proposes to extend pension survivor benefits not only 
to married couples but also to include couples who cohabit in a 
relationship of a conjugal nature.  The words survivor or 
survivors replace all 249 references to spouse, wives, widow in 
the current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-78, pension benefits of the contributor will be paid 
to the survivor.  The definition of a survivor depends on the 
term “a relationship of a conjugal nature”, that is, the 
survivor must be in a relationship of a conjugal nature with the 
contributor to qualify as a survivor.  This is where it starts to 
get strange.  Nowhere is this critical term “a relationship of a 
conjugal nature” defined in the bill.  Yet other than married, 
survivor eligibility depends on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without defining this term, Bill C-78 survivor benefit 
provisions will be subject to claims from individuals in all 
manner of relationships which they deem to be of a conjugal 
nature.  If any two roommates regardless of gender who have lived 
together for at least a year qualify for survivor benefits, the 
cost of the plan could greatly increase and the good old Canadian 
taxpayer will be picking up the tab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does conjugal mean?  I looked it up.  The <I>Canadian Law 
Dictionary</I>, third edition states that conjugal rights are 
“the rights of married persons, which include the intimacies of 
domestic relations”. 
The <I>Concise Oxford Dictionary</I>, ninth edition, states that 
conjugate means to unite sexually.  To the extent that conjugal 
means having sexual relations, one wonders how the government 
intends to verify that the relationship is indeed conjugal in 
nature.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The profound irony here is that the party of Pierre Trudeau who 
was famous for stating that the government had no business in the 
bedrooms of the nation would now put forward a bill that seems to 
call for the establishment of some sort of government conjugality 
or sexual activity test or inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is proposing that some report be filed or a sign-off 
by both people.  Maybe it could just be added to the Statistics 
Canada questions.  Lord knows, they ask for every other kind of 
personal information.  No doubt, someone would get the bright 
idea not only to report frequency but maybe quality. We could 
compare ourselves with the Swedes.  We could boost Viagra sales. 
The mind boggles at the possibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, we do not have this problem with married couples, 
because there is a legal recognition of their life commitment. No 
conjugality assessment is required.  This is probably a good 
thing, particularly for MPs with the hours we keep and the time 
away from home.  I do not know about all of the other members, 
but I am sure this lifestyle does not necessarily have a positive 
effect on the conjugality component of our marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do these other relationships gain recognition as conjugal? 
Is it just because they say so?  How many roommates will claim 
conjugality in order to get survivor benefits?  What will the 
cost be?  If taxpayers are backstopping the entire plan, should 
they not be informed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be nothing stopping one from being in a 
conjugal relationship with more than one person.  If a person 
cohabits with more than one person and they are “conjugal” with 
them all, it appears they would qualify for survivor benefits 
under Bill C-78.  They all would. Conversely two roommates, the 
same sex or otherwise, who are close and maybe share expenses, 
but do not have intimate physical relations, do they qualify for 
survivor benefits?  If not, why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are people included or excluded based on private physical 
intimacy?  Is this the new policy of the party that said the 
government has no place in the bedrooms of the nation?  The more 
one thinks about it, the goofier it gets to tie survivor pension 
eligibility for relationships outside of marriage on the 
conjugality of the relationship. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would appreciate it if the hon. member addressed the bill. Right 
now he is all over the map. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> In my opinion this is not 
a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B> Madam Speaker, certainly this is Bill C-78 and I am 
quoting directly from the bill.  I do not understand the hon. 
member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more one thinks about this as I said, the goofier it gets. 
To tie survivor pension eligibility for relationships outside of 
marriage to the conjugality of the relationship without defining 
what that means or how conjugality will be assessed, who is 
included or excluded and on what basis, makes the whole terms and 
the whole test meaningless.  Essentially anything goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one little ray of light.  Somebody was thinking and 
there is one thing they did pick up on.  The only thing they seem 
to have limited for survivor benefits is when the survivor is 
found to be criminally responsible for the death of the 
contributor.  No survivor benefits will be paid in that 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen some strange things done in the land of the Ottawa 
sun, but this bill is a blatant grab for unaccountable control of 
the surplus of the public sector pension fund.  It is increasing 
employee contributions and extending survivor benefits using 
inappropriate and undefined terms and then placing all this mess 
on the back of the Canadian taxpayer to bankroll. 
The eventual screw-ups will be a wonder to behold.

respect in other circumstances, will dutifully vote in support of 
such an outrageous blank cheque on the taxpayers' account.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
liked the beginning of my reform colleague's speech. He said we 
had to ensure the long term viability of the system and that it 
could be done while respecting the thousands of Canadian and 
Quebec workers who paid into the plan. I agree. He also said he 
found it suspicious that this act will not be audited by the 
Auditor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to elaborate on that. 
I would also ask him if he could draw a parallel between the 
treatment of the EI fund by the federal government and what it 
intends to do with the public service pension plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly I did say in 
my speech that we do not know if this board that is intended to 
be appointed is qualified for managing funds.  They are just 
appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be required to have an auditor but that auditor is in no 
way connected to the auditor general.  These funds that now have 
the scrutiny of the auditor general, that have public reporting 
on how they are managed, will be hidden from public view and the 
view of the pensioners perhaps.  This is tragic. This is similar 
to the EI scenario we saw this government use earlier to remove 
accountability from the public arena.  It is wrong and it is part 
of the lunacy of this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, if we dress up a thief in a three-piece suit and tie and 
put him behind a desk and elect him to office and give him a 
fancy title, is he still not a thief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the unemployment insurance fund being raided by 
government.  It should be an insurance fund, but the government 
has turned it into another tax to go into its general revenues. 
The surplus in that EI fund is supposed to be $20 billion but 
there is no fund.  The money is not in the fund.  It has been 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now with Bill C-78 we have the government looking to raid the 
public service pensions, take the money in the fund and use it 
just like all other tax revenues.  This is robbery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because the Liberal government ministers are confiscating 
the money, taking the money that has been collected from civil 
servants and using it like any other tax money collected by 
government does not change the fact that it is theft.  And we 
know what someone who commits a theft is called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I cannot agree more with 
the intent of the question.  Absolutely correct.  This bill as I 
said in my opening comments was more like a page out of <I>MAD</I> 
magazine than a serious piece of legislation.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ISSUE OF CEREMONIAL STATEMENTS OF SERVICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Timmins—James Bay, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-453, an act to regulate the issue of ceremonial statements of 
service and recognition of duty, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, first I would like to thank the member 
for London—Fanshawe for seconding my bill and for believing in 
what I am about to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes that a certificate of service and duty be 
issued to all war veterans who, for one reason or another, do 
not carry tangible evidence of their service in war time for 
their country. This is a bit of an aberration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am saying this is that for the 20 years I have been 
actively involved in federal politics, I have, on many 
occasions, encountered veterans who were frustrated to see that 
those who fought on the front or took a direct part in a 
conflict  are carrying a health card that they cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason they do is because they have something tangible that 
they can show, that they can leave to their descendants, proving 
that they risked their life so that we, their juniors, would 
always have our freedom and all our democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this certificate, which would take the form of a 
laminated card, like a credit card, would simply be to 
acknowledge that the bearer participated in a conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would be eligible?  First of all, veterans who went to the 
front, obviously; then, members of civilian groups that 
supported the Canadian armed forces, such as the Red Cross. 
Also eligible would be members of the merchant marine, who were 
recognized last year for their military participation during 
World War II.  Other candidates would include members of UN 
peacekeeping missions and any other civilians who participated 
directly in a war or armed conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced this bill for the specific purpose of letting our 
veterans know that we greatly appreciate what they did during 
these extremely difficult times.  Just like those with health 
cards, these persons were thirsty, afraid, hungry, cold, and 
just as courageous as those who were wounded, except that they 
were not fortunate enough, as it were, to earn that distinction 
and be able to carry this small card. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-partisan and apolitical private member's bill.  I 
appeal to the common sense of all members of the House to pass 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my discussions with them, I made it clear that there was no 
question of any compensation.  This was a concern for the great 
majority of them.  There is no compensation involved; this is 
simply a certificate recognizing participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the policy of the federal government, the Department 
of Veteran Affairs or the Department of National Defence to give 
compensation to those who were not injured during these 
conflicts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people are we talking about? All in all, we are talking 
about approximately 600,000 people who had some form of 
involvement in these conflicts, including 450,000 veterans, 
between 120,000 and 130,000 peacekeepers who served with units 
dispatched to maintain peace in various countries, and about 
5,000 others, including nurses and Red Cross staff, who would be 
eligible for this card. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would issue these certificates? The Department of Veteran 
Affairs, obviously. It would approve the application made by the 
person who took part in the conflict or by a descendant in cases 
where the person is deceased. 
That is how the certificates would be issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill C-453 is relatively simple, non-partisan and 
apolitical. I am proud to introduce this bill in the House today 
so that I can promote it and ensure that all those who took part 
in a conflict on behalf of Canada are recognized, and not just a 
chosen few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such recognition is long overdue, and I sincerely hope the 
opposition parties will support this bill at second reading 
stage.

<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to contribute to this debate and commend the 
hon. member for Timmins—James Bay for bringing this issue to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-votable matter, illustrating yet once again how it 
may be preferable that all business in the House be votable.  The 
reason that all House business should be votable is that many 
important legislative initiatives come from individual members 
rather than from the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from recent media commentary on House business that well 
thought out legislative initiatives may be procedurally scuttled 
by the government of the day based simply on the fact that it is 
the private member rather than the government or its ministers 
who is credited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the efforts of individual members are non-votable, what 
transpires in the House is more of a discussion than a debate 
with the advantage that there is no need for position 
entrenchment.  We are able despite our differences in political 
outlook to arrive at a consensus as to a direction that is 
generally positive and of benefit to Canadians.  We may also air 
our differences without the rancour and partisanship that often 
accompany political posturing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end the <I>Hansard</I> record acts as a permanent 
reference to a moment in Canadian history when a particular issue 
of merit was debated by members.  It is up to us to make 
Canadians aware of the importance of what goes on in this place. 
Much is discussed that becomes fertile ground for historians 20 
and 50 years hence but goes largely unnoticed by the contemporary 
Canadian populace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues before us today go to the heart of respect for our 
history, the need to acknowledge service to Canada and the need 
to counter historical revisionism which denies that war is an 
imperative to historical progress.  I wish we had a vote on 
today's issue although I would have to oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Timmins—James Bay be votable?  It is because it raises the issue 
of ceremonial recognition of veteran and civilian contributions 
to Canada's war efforts.  I would argue that any such recognition 
should not be generally given but rather limited to those who 
actually served in war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of recent developments in the House concerning our 
merchant navy, even those who served in war had to wait some 50 
years before being accorded ceremonial recognition simply because 
they were not enlisted members of Canada's armed forces during 
World War II.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be said that during the two world wars some Canadians who 
contributed to Canada's war effort were not ceremonially 
recognized.  In terms of subsequent conflicts it may be said that 
many Canadians have contributed to our peacekeeping efforts and 
that not all are ceremonially recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing this legislation last November, the member for 
Timmins—James Bay described his motivation as having to do with the 
fact that over the years he had met veterans on numerous 
occasions who had nothing to show for their participation in 
world conflicts.  They may have been awarded service medals but 
one does not carry medals on a day to day basis.  They may have 
been given lapel pins but some regard such pins as ostentatious regalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, what the hon. member proposes is a 
certificate comparable to a wallet size health card that wounded 
veterans are now able to show to interested persons, much like a 
wallet snapshot.  In the case of the health card, it becomes a 
snapshot of past life of valour.  For those who were not wounded 
in conflict there is no comparable snapshot to show someone and 
say “I was a veteran of this conflict and stand before you today 
as someone who has personally contributed to the defence of 
Canada's interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill however is flawed.  First it is out of date.  If the 
member would take a look at subsection 2(c) he would notice that 
it refers to the merchant navy under the old legislation.  With 
the passing of Bill C-61 they will now be full status war 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of giving ceremonial recognition to those who 
contributed to Canada's war efforts is a noble one and worth 
exploring, but we must not be in too much of a hurry.  The bill 
as it currently stands is too broad and will diminish the 
contribution of those who gave the most while elevating those who 
played a less important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this moment the war in Kosovo is expanding in what many would 
regard as disturbing directions.  Some have argued that Kosovo 
should more properly provide NATO with an opportunity to reassess 
its purposes and objectives.  Yet a few short years ago our 
soldiers were addressing peacekeeping issues in Bosnia, Rwanda 
and Somalia.  Many of these soldiers are no longer in active 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only in the last parliament that the creation of a medal 
for service in Somalia was accepted by the House based on a 
private member's initiative, that of Mr. Jack Frazer, the former 
hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands and the predecessor to 
current veterans affairs critic of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not enhance our sense of history and military service 
to Canada and the world if all such persons were able to carry a 
wallet size certificate acknowledging their service?  In this 
regard I am pleased to report to the House that subsequent to 
inquiries by my office of the War Amputations Canada, Mr. 
Clifford Chadderton, chief executive officer, communicated to me 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal to issue a ceremonial statement recognizing 
individual contributions to Canada's war effort should have far- 
reaching effect.  Traditionally, veterans have been reluctant to 
speak about their military service.  The issuance of a ceremonial 
statement of service may well serve as encouragement, so that 
future generations will know what veterans and other members of 
the military have done to preserve our freedom.  However, as has 
been noted, the legislation is inclusive, rather than exclusive, 
through also permitting the ceremonial recognition of civilian 
contributions to Canada's war and peacekeeping efforts.  I feel 
this is too broad a stroke to make. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Chadderton supports recognizing veterans and members of the 
military, but the bill has much more in mind. In section 3 it 
would allow any person who believes he or she helped Canada in a 
significant way in a war or armed conflict in which Canada took 
part or a veteran received recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does an armed conflict mean journalists covering the Oka crisis 
can get a statement of service?  Under this piece of legislation 
it indicates that.  All it would require is the individuals' 
belief and they would get the recognition.  They do not even have 
to be on the conflict side of the ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would members of the House who stood to speak about the Kosovo 
crisis believe they are worthy of official recognition for their 
contributions to peacekeeping?

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine how insignificant its true meaning would be.  Under 
clause 3(2) any spouse or descendant can apply for a deceased 
person.  Technically somebody could get certificates for their 
great-grandparents with respect to the war of 1812. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can easily see there are some flaws.  I have some serious 
questions as an individual.  This has helped to formulate my 
opinion on this.  I am sure we could think of other examples that 
are worth asking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last analogy which came to mind on reviewing this bill is my 
own family.  My elderly father who just passed away operated a 
factory in Toronto which supplied war materials during World War 
II.  Was that a contribution to the war effort?  Should he 
receive a certificate on my mother making application?  Is this 
the same certificate that somebody would have who was actually 
engaged in the fighting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, I have to decline my support.  I realize and 
respect the initiative.  I believe this would be a much more 
commendable and worthwhile initiative if it focused on Canada's 
military. I want to thank the member for his initiative, but 
unfortunately I have to decline my support. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is also a 
pleasure for me to take part in this debate and I hope that the 
few comments I will make will be a positive contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very good idea to propose to reward or even only to 
recognize the service of certain persons during an armed 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I agree with the hon. member from the Reform Party 
that this would not make a big difference for our veterans, 
whose service is already recognized under the act, which, 
incidentally, now gives merchant sailors the same privileges as 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, many other persons distinguished themselves by their battle 
exploits or simple acts of courage or voluntary work. These are 
recognized with medals like the governor general medals, but for 
various reasons, there are other anonymous persons who would not 
qualify for such medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think for example of a person who, during a war, would have 
taken a group of soldiers in for a few days to hide them from 
the enemy, protect them, feed them or treat their wounds. We 
know that many people did that during world wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not necessarily Canadians. They could be foreigners. In 
World War II, for example, Canadian soldiers on campaign in 
Normandy were taken in by French men and women who fed them and 
tended to their wounds. We should recognize not only Canadians, 
but extend that recognition to other persons as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important in life than being recognized by one's 
peers? Those who work as volunteers never do it for money or 
other financial considerations, but rather for the love of the 
cause they believe in or for the sake of those they love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, these people do not ask for recognition, but when they 
do get it, they are both pleased and honoured. It is a bit like 
an honorary degree. When a university or a school decides to 
recognize, on the basis of merit, the action, experience, 
know-how, dedication or expertise of a person who is not one of 
its graduates, it awards this person an honorary degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people would deserve the same kind of recognition for their 
service at war or in humanitarian causes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are not asking for any kind of compensation, and the bill 
says so. Those who would receive a ceremonial statement could 
not expect any compensation, benefit, or financial 
consideration. The only purpose of the statement would be simply 
to recognize people for their effort, work, dedication, 
volunteer work or outstanding feats during a conflict in which 
Canada was taking part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not entail any financial commitment. We not need pass 
any financial motion and the finance minister does not have to 
figure out how much it would cost. 
My understanding is that the bill introduced by the hon. member 
for Timmins—Baie-James is simply intended to provide some official 
recognition to those who deserve it because they served their 
country and their fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to support this bill. Although it is not votable, I 
hope that the comments and thoughts shared during the debate 
will bring the government to reflect on this and come back later 
with a votable bill this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the concerns of the hon. member of the Reform Party 
about the bill being too broad, not addressing such and such 
point, or about the form this recognition would take, we can see 
that the bill grants the minister enough discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like any other good bill, this bill could be followed by 
regulations established by the minister. These regulations could 
define more precisely in what circumstances and according to 
what criteria the government could recognize that the actions of 
a citizen entitle this person to a ceremonial certificate of 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This certificate should not be a mere piece of paper. It should 
not be the kind that anyone can get. Otherwise, it would not 
mean anything. This certificate would be proof that the actions 
of a veteran were really extraordinary and special. It should be 
a document that is not easily obtainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specifics could be covered in regulations. I do not believe 
it is necessary to put everything in the bill. The more you put 
in a bill, the higher the risks of making a mistake and leaving 
out certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deserves support in order to show these people who are 
still living quiet lives, unnoticed, that Canada, the country to 
which they have made a great contribution, Canadians, Quebeckers, 
are all grateful to them and acknowledge their contribution and 
their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like the world to know about it. We would like to see 
an official gesture showing that these persons have earned 
recognition of their fellow citizens, not just a few lines in a 
weekend newspaper or a little thank you when we happen to meet 
them.  We would like to say that they deserve our gratitude and 
that we are pleased to set this recognition out in an official 
document called a ceremonial statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I congratulate the Hon member for Timmins—James Bay 
for preparing a bill like this.  I trust that it will receive 
the greatest possible support in the days and weeks to come.

to thank the hon. member for Timmins—James Bay for bringing this 
bill to the House for debate.  Any time we talk about veterans it 
is very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in support of this bill which would provide ceremonial 
statements of recognition to those who have helped Canada in a 
significant way in a war or armed conflict in which Canada took 
part. There are many veterans and civilians who have contributed 
much to this country through their efforts during wartime who are 
owed a debt of gratitude from all Canadians.  It would provide 
one opportunity to show our respect to so many Canadians, many of 
whom still fight for the recognition they deserve from this 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of those who served with the Mackenzie—Papineau 
Battalion fighting fascism in Spain.  Those brave Canadians have 
fought long and hard to get the recognition they deserve from a 
Liberal government that would rather act as though they did not 
even exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognition should also be given to the many who served with the 
segregated No. 2 Construction Battalion in World War I. There are 
also many aboriginal veterans who have been terribly mistreated 
by the Canadian government who deserve recognition for their 
efforts in the two world wars and in the Korean war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that my New Democratic colleague, the hon. member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle, is working to right this historical 
wrong.  I do wish there was capacity in this bill to right a 
couple of terrible misdeeds of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill speaks of issuing ceremonial statements, it is 
sometimes essential to go beyond statements of recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has turned its back on the Canadian 
veterans condemned by the Gestapo in the Buchenwald Nazi 
concentration camp.  The issue at hand is the seeking of 
reparations by Canadian veterans who are members of the 
Koncentration-Lager-Buchenwald Club.  Out of 15 countries with 
veterans condemned to Nazi concentration camps instead of POW 
camps, Canada sits alone in not having reached a proper 
resolution.  We on this side of the House believe that is 
absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of presenting their case for compensation to deaf 
ears in Ottawa, these veterans were presented cheques of barely 
over $1,000 each.  This compensation is nothing short of a 
disgrace. One of the veterans, Mr. Bill Gibson, wrote “refused” 
across the cheque and sent it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wish there were some way in this bill to force the 
government to do the right thing and provide just compensation 
for these veterans and successfully complete negotiations with 
the German government to ensure a proper resolution is reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I wish this legislation could redress the enormous 
injustice done to Canada's merchant mariners.  On November 24, 
1998 in the House of Commons my hon. colleague from Halifax West 
asked the Minister of Veterans Affairs to finally commit to a 
just settlement with Canada's merchant marine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has seen fit to provide an ex gratia payment to 
Hong Kong veterans who were Japanese prisoners of war of $23,940 
each.  This payment was promised just last December and strikes 
me as at least an effort to achieve a just settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply a disgrace that the government has betrayed 
Canada's merchant mariners by refusing to compensate them for the 
discrimination the merchant mariners faced upon their return home 
from serving in Canada's war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a great many Canadians who have done so much for our 
country and who have not had the recognition they deserve.  I 
trust the government will support the bill, allowing for all of 
them some of the recognition that is due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may also say on a more personal note, on behalf of my 
mother and father and my oldest brother Arnold who were rescued 
and liberated by the Canadian veterans, who are here with us 
today, and the many others who have already passed on, thank you. 
To all the veterans of that time, to all the current military 
personnel who are fighting for freedom of our country and for 
liberation of free people around the world, my entire family will 
forever honour the statement, lest we forget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is with great pleasure that I speak on Private Member's Bill 
C-453, entitled an act to regulate the issue of ceremonial 
statements of service and recognition of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes of Canada's past 
wars. The member should be applauded for bringing this bill 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to enable the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs to issue a ceremonial certificate of service to any 
veteran or person who in the opinion of the minister helped 
Canada in a significant way in a war or armed conflict in which 
Canada took part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the Government of Canada to say thank you to 
Canadians.  In our hearts we honour you for your service to this 
country and your fellow Canadians at a time of peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to see that the merchant navy war veterans 
were included.  My colleagues, the hon. member for Saint John and 
Senator J. Michael Forrestall and Senator Jack Marshall, have 
worked long and hard to help these brave Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, during the second world war 80 merchant ships were lost. 
There were 1,509 merchant mariners killed and 198 captured.  The 
merchant navy suffered a higher rate of casualty than any other 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada on May 19, 1941 by order in council 
P.C. 14/3550 stated: “The merchant marine on which our seaborne 
commerce depends, is, under present conditions, virtually an arm 
of our fighting services, and the provision of merchant seamen, 
their training, care and protection is essential to the proper 
conduct of the war, and vitally necessary to keeping open of the 
sea lanes on which the successful outcome of the present conflict 
so largely depends”.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After November 1942 merchant seamen were officially called the 
Canadian Merchant Navy.  Merchant mariners were treated as 
prisoners of war by the multinational agreement after 1942. 
Merchant mariners were subject to military law under admiralty 
orders and discipline by the navy JAG.  Merchant seamen were 
subject to the “sail or jail” order by order in council P.C. 
4751, the merchant seaman order of 1941, and P.C. 4312, the 
merchant seamen foreign jurisdiction order of 1944. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are an estimated 2,400 merchant navy veterans left and 
that number is rapidly declining.  They must be recognized for 
their war service.  My party and I are hoping for compensation 
for these men and their families after years of neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the government will move forward immediately with 
compensation.  The recognition of their services and other 
services to Canada in time of war has been limited.  This bill 
would give further recognition to war veterans who have been 
marginalized and forgotten.  I think it is important recognition 
for all of our veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that the government has made another good move 
just recently.  I had the pleasure of attending a ceremony two 
weeks ago for the John McCrae Medal, a medal brought out this 
year for veterans of the first world war, recognizing that it has 
been 80 years since that war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is a gentleman who is 102 years old who 
received this medal.  He fought in both the first world war and 
the second world war.  Also on hand for the ceremony was the 
Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec who read a letter from the Queen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognition like this is important, not just for the veterans 
themselves, but for all of their families who attend these 
ceremonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this is a very simple bill.  Thus, on behalf of my 
party, I support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
always pleased to have an opportunity to speak about the 
contributions that are made by the men and women of this country, 
who since Confederation have answered the call to service 
whenever their nation has asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for Veterans Week or perhaps during debate on a bill, we 
do not often get the opportunity to speak to the sacrifices made 
by our forefathers and mothers in time of need and in time of 
war.  Therefore, I thank the hon. member for presenting us with 
such an opportunity today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill suggests ceremonial certificates for those who 
contributed significantly to Canada in a time of war or armed 
conflict.  Although the bill presents several logistical and 
other concerns, it seems to me that its intent is all about 
remembrance and acknowledgement of sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We who live in Ottawa and work on Parliament Hill are reminded 
of that sacrifice every day as we walk past the magnificent war 
memorial on the way to work.  On May 21 this year it will be the 
60th anniversary of its unveiling by His Majesty King George VI. 
One hundred thousand people showed up on that day, six decades 
ago, to witness the dedication.  His opening words were “The 
memorial speaks to her world of Canada's heart”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that is what this nation has done in two world wars, in 
Korea and in peacekeeping missions around the world.  We spoke 
with our hearts and said no to tyranny and enslavement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We who live in Ottawa and work on Parliament Hill are fortunate 
to be able to visit the memorial chamber in the Peace Tower to 
see the magnificent books of remembrance, books that contain the 
names of Canadians who fought in wars and died either during or 
after them.  They commemorate the lives of the 114,710 Canadians 
who died since Confederation because of service to their country 
in battle outside Canada.  They remain testaments to our past, 
for by their very title the books remind us never to forget the 
foundations of courage on which Canada is built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, through the wonders of technology, Canadians can log on to 
the Internet to see for themselves the same pages which members 
of the House have the privilege of accessing in person.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We who live in Ottawa and work on Parliament Hill are reminded 
that it was not just the soldier, the sailor, or the pilot who 
risked their lives and shed blood; we are also reminded every 
time we walk by the nursing sisters' memorial located in the Hall 
of Honour in the Centre Block on Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It tells the story of unyielding women who braved all the 
hardships of war to do their duty and serve their patients, and 
of those who nursed the casualties left in the wake of war. Every 
soldier who fell wounded by bullet or bayonet would often wake 
and the first person he would see would be the face of a nursing 
sister who bound up his wounds and soothed his fears. They truly 
were angels of mercy that no veteran would ever forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, people do not have to live and work in Ottawa or on 
Parliament Hill to see memorials and reminders of sacrifice.  In 
towns and cities across the nation are statues and monuments 
raised in praise and remembrance of those who paid with their 
very lives to uphold the values we hold so very dear in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, not all monuments are of steel and stone.  We have a 
wonderful tradition in the provinces to name many of our 
mountains, rivers and lakes in honour of individuals who made the 
ultimate sacrifice.  So in the natural beauty of this nation 
their names and our history are memorialized in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are also well recognized overseas.  Unlike our 
American cousins, we have a tradition, like many of our 
Commonwealth neighbours, of burying our war dead near where they 
fell.  To follow the contributions of Canada's veterans we need 
only to visit the cemeteries that are filled with simple 
headstones, laid out row on row across the landscape of Europe 
and the Far East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only to see the great monuments at Vimy or Beaumont 
Hamel, at Cassino in Italy, Sai Wan Bay in Hong Kong, or Naechon 
in Korea to appreciate that our war dead are not forgotten.  We 
need only to talk to the people and to the children and the 
grandchildren of those nations we helped liberate to understand 
that these Canadians will never be forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who have been fortunate enough to travel with 
veterans overseas on a pilgrimage have only to watch the 
expression in the eyes of a veteran when a child approaches.  A 
flower, a kiss on the cheek and a thank you from a little one 
brings a tear to the eye and a true understanding of the notion 
of gratitude to anyone who witnesses such a scene, and the 
knowledge that these Canadians live on in the hearts and minds of 
generations of grateful citizens the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the dedication of the war memorial 60 years ago, His Majesty 
concluded with the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This memorial, however, does more than commemorate a great event 
in the past.  It has a message for all generations and for all 
countries—the message which called for Canada's response.  Not 
by chance both the crowning figures of peace and freedom appear 
side by side.  Peace and freedom cannot be long separated.  It is 
well that we have, in one of the world capitals, a visible 
reminder of so great a truth.  Without freedom there can be no 
enduring peace, and without peace no enduring freedom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will always remember those who have gone on before, and as we 
pray today for the safety of our service men and women in 
Yugoslavia and for freedom for those who have none, we would do 
well to remember those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, Bill C-453 is all about remembrance and I 
applaud the member for Timmins—James Bay for his efforts on 
behalf of Canada's veterans. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Timmins—James Bay, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to say that I have accomplished a lot here 
today in the sense that four parties out of five recognize that 
indeed this is a very good initiative.  There have been comments 
both positive and negative. I recognize also that in some 
instances the bill may be too vague and too open to 
interpretation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing says that in the future I will not bring it back.  I 
repeat that this is a non-partisan bill.  It is apolitical.  Next 
time around I will ensure that individual members of parliament 
are given a second chance to reflect upon the value of the bill 
in order to recognize once and for all those from near or far who 
participated in world armed conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be a votable item.  As all the members have mentioned 
one after another, it is not often enough that in this country we 
recognize the merits of those who went overseas to participate in 
war on our behalf, to preserve our liberties and our democracy, 
and not those who participated in a support manner and, as the 
parliamentary secretary has said, in many different ways.  These 
people feel extremely important.  They are proud of what they 
have done for this country and somehow they need to be 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this sense that some time in the future, maybe next 
parliament if there is a prorogation, I will bring the bill back. 
I am deeply convinced that good sense will prevail and that 
individual members of parliament will recognize its merits and 
will vote for it.

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on March 11 of this year, I asked the secretary of 
state responsible for agriculture a question regarding 
shipbuilding, but I got an answer from the Minister of Industry 
instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that the Secretary of State for Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and Fisheries and Oceans is also the member for 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet and that his riding is next 
to mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there were 3,000 workers at the Lévis shipyard, 500 of them 
came from his riding. A lot of people from his riding have 
individually or collectively reminded him of that. I honestly 
think that the secretary of state responsible for agriculture, 
who is also a cabinet member, has tried to convince his cabinet 
colleagues to adopt a new shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed that other members in the House have tried to do 
certain things too, including the Minister of Labour who, 
recently, commissioned a study on the status of shipyards in 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, I have seen a certain openness on the part of these 
two people. Being a member of the industry committee, I have 
also noticed recently a certain openness on the part of the 
Liberal majority, which accepted to include shipbuilding in a 
productivity study, and I am very happy about that. 
I obviously would have liked something more specific, broader, 
but it is an opening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of Industry failed to be as open.  Yet 
recently, he said “If the member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière 
has something to propose, other than grants, I will agree to 
examine it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what I did on April 15 when I introduced, like 
my colleague opposite did a while ago, a private member's bill, 
which may come up for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are mobilizing all over, and support has come from the 
Liberal Premier of New Brunswick, Camille Thériault, who has 
asked to meet the Prime Minister of Canada. 
This follows on the fact that his predecessor, Mr. McKenna, had 
put the same issue on the agenda of a first ministers' 
conference two years ago.  Even activists in the Liberal Party 
of Canada, people from the Atlantic, managed to have a similar 
position approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, once again, will there be real policy on shipbuilding with 
additional measures that will make Canadian shipyards more 
competitive? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the hon. 
member from Lévis has given me the opportunity once again to 
speak to the subject of shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government acknowledges the important contribution 
the marine industry makes to our national economy.  The hon. 
member is well aware of the generous package of measures the 
federal government provides, which in conjunction with provincial 
policies and sound industrial practices benefits shipbuilders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This package includes an accelerated capital cost allowance 
which many industries would like to have, a duty on ship imports, 
a domestic procurement for all government shipbuilding and ship 
repair needs, Export Development Corporation financing, and a 
very favourable research and development tax credit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this support the industry continues to face considerable 
challenges in international markets.  For instance, at the 
December 1997 OECD workshop on shipbuilding policies it was 
reported that a substantial overcapacity exists.  In fact the 
estimate for 2005 is 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian shipbuilding sector went through a voluntary 
industry led rationalization process in which the government 
participated by contributing nearly $200 million.  Through the 
reorganization and streamlining of its operations over the past 
decade, the Canadian industry has been able to improve its 
productivity levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning shipbuilding in Quebec, the federal government 
invested almost $1.6 billion in Davey Industries during the 
period of 1983 to 1996 in the form of contracts, contributions 
and loan guarantees.  Moreover, commercial arrangements by the 
Export Development Corporation are currently moving forward to 
provide additional support to this company through a loan 
guarantee on the <I>Spirit of Columbus</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, substantial support has been provided to the 
shipbuilding industry in the past and we continue to support it 
through a variety of initiatives.  If provinces wish to 
supplement our initiatives, as has been done by Quebec and Nova 
Scotia, they are free to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
