<B>Monday, January 17, 1994 </B>
<P>
The House met at 11 a.m.
<P>
FIRST SESSION-35TH PARLIAMENT</CENTER>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 34th Parliament having been dissolved by proclamation on Wednesday, September 8, 1993, and writs having been issued and 
returned, a new Parliament was summoned to meet for the dispatch of business on Monday, January 17, 1994, and did accordingly 
meet on that day.
<P>
	Monday, January 17, 1994
<P>
	This being the day on which Parliament was convoked by proclamation of His Excellency the Governor General of Canada for the 
dispatch of business, and the members of the House being assembled:
<P>
	Robert Marleau, Esquire, Clerk of the House of Commons, read to the House a letter from the Deputy Secretary to the Governor 
General informing him that the Right Honourable Antonio Lamer, in his capacity as Deputy Governor General, would proceed to the 
Senate chamber to open the first session of the 35th Parliament of Canada on Monday, January 17, 1994, at Ottawa.
<P>
	A message was delivered by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod as follows:
<P>
Members of the House of Commons:
<P>
It is the desire of the Honourable the Deputy to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada that this honourable House attend him immediately in the chamber 
of the honourable the Senate.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House went up to the Senate chamber, where the Speaker of the Senate said:
<P>
Honourable Members of the Senate, Members of the House of Commons:
<P>
I have it in command to let you know that His Excellency the Governor General does not see fit to declare the causes of his summoning the present Parliament of 
Canada until a Speaker of the House of Commons shall have been chosen, according to law; but tomorrow, Tuesday, January 18, 1994 at three o'clock in the afternoon, 
His Excellency will declare the causes of his calling Parliament.
<P>
<LI>(1125) 
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the House being returned to the Commons Chamber:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Clerk of the House:</B> Pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 3, I invite Mr. Hopkins, member for the electoral district of 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, to take the chair as the member presiding.

<CENTER><B>ELECTION OF SPEAKER</B></CENTER>
<P>
	<B>The Presiding Officer (Mr. Hopkins):</B> Before we begin our actual order of the day, I would like to thank representatives from all 
parties in the House who have worked with us in preparation for this election today. I want to thank the Clerk and the staff of the 
House for their attention to the many details. I want to express my appreciation to the Sergeant-at-Arms, his staff and the constables 
of this House of Commons who serve this place so well.
<P>
	I want to welcome all of the new members to Canada's 35th Parliament and welcome back former members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Thank you very much, and good luck and good voting.
<P>
	Pursuant to the provisions of the Standing Orders, the House will now proceed to elect a Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The candidates whose names will appear on the first ballot are as follows:

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to give you my undertaking that I will not heckle you during your tenure in the chair. 
Second, I would ask that my name be removed from the list as it was inadvertently left on.
<P>
	<B>The Presiding Officer (Mr. Hopkins):</B> I want to thank the hon. member for his comments. However, the deadline for the Clerk to 
accept a request by a member to withdraw as a candidate was 6 p.m. yesterday evening. Although it is now too late to amend the list 
before the first ballot, the House has heard and will no doubt take good note of the member's request.
<P>
<LI>(1130 ) 
<P>
	In accordance with the standing orders, the list of members who have withdrawn or who are ineligible as candidates has been 
placed on each member's desk and is also available at the table.
<P>
	The list of those members who are eligible as candidates has also been placed on each member's desk. It is available at the 
table as well and is being placed in each polling station.
<P>
	After the Clerk has unsealed the ballots, I will suggest a method of proceeding which will help to accelerate the voting process.
<P>
	As we are now prepared to begin the voting procedure, may I remind all hon. members to print the first and last name of their 
candidate on the ballot paper. I will suggest that members leave their desks, exit through the curtains and come to the table using the 
doors on my left and on my right of the chair on their respective sides of the House. A clerk will issue to each member a ballot paper. 
After casting their ballot hon. members are asked to leave the voting area so that there will be no congestion and those voting will 
have privacy.
<P>
	After casting their ballot hon. members are asked to leave the voting area immediately.
<P>
	The polling booths are now open to vote.
<P>
	(Members were issued ballots and marked their ballots in secret at voting stations.)

<P>
	I thank you for the confidence that you have shown in me. I do accept this honour with great joy and, I must admit, a bit of 
trepidation. On your behalf I want to thank our colleagues who chose to let their names stand and who took part in the process 
established by this House for the election of our Speaker. I want especially to salute my dear friend and colleague of 16 years, a great 
member of Parliament, Jean-Robert Gauthier.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the House to join in the expression of a very special note of thanks to the retiring Speaker, the hon. John 
Fraser, who has served this House with distinction and dignity.
<P>
	The last passage in Disraeli's diary before he left home to take his seat in the House of Commons reads:
<P>
I am now as one leaving a secure haven for an unknown sea. What will the next 12 months produce?
<P>
	These words are pretty close to my feelings at this moment, but I take great comfort in the comments which have been made in the 
last few weeks about the necessity to restore dignity and respect in the House.
<P>
	The hon. Audrey McLaughlin has referred to the fact, and I am quoting, that ``the reputation of Parliament has suffered from 
unacceptable behaviour in the past''.
<P>
	The hon. Jean Charest has said: ``We are going to remain open to any new ideas of doing things differently''.
<P>
	Mr. Manning has expressed strong belief in the necessity to stop ``the circus-like atmosphere which sometimes has prevailed in 
the House''.
<P>
	The hon. Herb Gray has stressed that ``parliamentary reform is an important part of the government's plan''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. Lucien Bouchard emphasized the word ``civility'' to describe the quality of the proceedings in the House. All in all, it 
does seem that despite differences in wording, all participants in the debates of the House put a spirit of co-operation and respect 
among their highest aspirations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In this House of Commons one event affects another and what we anticipate really seldom occurs, but what we least expect 
generally happens. My colleagues, this is bound to take place in an environment which contains many contradictions.
<P>
	Out of courtesy we refer to each other, and rightly so, as hon. members. Yet perhaps never in our history have we enjoyed a less 
favourable opinion on the part of our fellow Canadians.
<P>
<LI>(1805 ) 
<P>
	We sit in this House of Commons, yet it is our wish not to be common but to rise to the heights required of us by circumstance and 
history. My colleagues, I hope that in all of our conduct and speeches in the House of Commons we may remember that we are not 
here because of some merit on our part but because free men and free women have faith in us, have faith in the principles which we 
put forward in election campaigns and, yes, have faith in our parliamentary way of life.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When Madam Speaker Jeanne SauvÃ© first addressed this House as Speaker, she stated the following and I quote: ``It is through you 
that the country as a whole expresses itself, and it is Parliament which most completely reflects the aspirations of the whole nation.''
<P>
	I humbly accept this heavy responsibility, mindful of my limitations. I will endeavor to be equal to the task which you have 
bestowed upon me so that this assembly may work for the greater good of all of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the clerks. I thank all House of Commons staff on whom we are going to be depending for this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I am told that a riding can expect to have a Speaker of the House of Commons represent it every millennium so this is an historic 
day for my constituents of Welland-St. Catharines-Thorold who have seen fit to return me to this place.
<P>
	I might say, with my wife in the House and my children watching, it is a very proud day indeed for me and for my family and I do 
thank you all most respectfully.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me begin by congratulating you on your election.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was quite a day for all of us, for all politicians. Now we know that every vote is very important.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier and the other candidates for this office. Indeed, it is because of the 
quality of the candidates in the running that it took us an entire afternoon to elect a Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a good omen for you, Mr. Speaker, because you have earned it. You sweated a lot all afternoon, but I can tell you that my party 
and I will support you. It is the desire of all members of the House to make sure that this Parliament will bring a new mood to this 
House, and you will play a very big role.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If we want to win the trust of all Canadians, it is extremely important that we show this country's institutions, especially the 
House of Commons, the respect they deserve. Your task, Mr. Speaker, will be to help us make this House what it rightly should be, 
namely the living room of the nation, the place where all ideas are discussed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has to be a place where everyone can speak freely, express the wishes and the views of himself and his electorate, but at the end 
of the day it will be the nation that will win.
<P>
<LI>(1810 ) 
<P>
	I wish you the best of luck. You can count on our support and friendship. Good luck.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking on behalf of the Official Opposition and of all my 
colleagues, it is a pleasure and indeed an honour to offer you my sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election to the 
important position of Speaker of the House of Commons. It was an arduous undertaking.
<P>
	I also wish to take this opportunity to thank all the members who expressed an interest in this position and who campaigned with 
the courtesy and generosity appropriate to the circumstances.
<P>
	I may say that the members of this House have acknowledged your great experience and also your personal qualities which will be 
particularly useful in the context in which we will be working and where we all hope to maintain the standards of a democratic 
debate, a debate which may be heated, as controversial ideas are  raised, but which should never descend to the level of personal 
attacks, something which we must avoid.
<P>
	We understand the significance of your duties, which include defending the rights of members and especially the rights and 
integrity of Parliament and the parliamentary system, so that we can engage in a thorough analysis of the major issues facing us 
today in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Finally, I can assure you that throughout, you will have the full co-operation of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to say in English that we also pledge full and total co-operation in the fulfilment of your so important task.
<P>
	We also thank very much those candidates, our colleagues, who showed enough interest in the function to submit their names as 
candidates in this very important election we had today. It was a courageous thing to do. They will retain our full confidence in their 
work as members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want to extend on behalf of hon. members our congratulations 
and best wishes to you. I also want to extend our gratitude to your wife and family for the sacrifices which they make to enable you to 
be the servant of this place.
<P>
	As the presiding officer of this Parliament we anticipate that you will play a key role in the reform of our procedures and 
activities. As a presiding member of the Board of Internal Economy we anticipate that you will play a key role in the reform of the 
financing of this institution. As you discharge your duties in all of these areas we pledge to you our full support and co-operation.
<P>
	Again, congratulations and best wishes, Mr. Speaker, on your term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the free spirits in this corner I want to join with the others in pledging our 
support in the months ahead and wishing you well, particularly with the difficult decisions you will be asked to make from time to 
time.
<P>
	Our congratulations go out to our colleagues who let their names stand in this surprisingly lengthy election procedure. We 
recognize that today is a new era in Canadian politics. This is exemplified by your election, Mr. Speaker, by the new government, a 
new House of Commons, and 205 new members. This is a great opportunity to change the way this House has done business.
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues, as I say the free spirits, we pledge our support to you and this House to make this place work 
as positively as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This House is always in need of free spirits.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, in congratulating you and wishing you well, may I seek your assurance that you 
will do your utmost in introducing electronic voting in this House so as to bring this House up to speed with modern times and 
technology.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will know that I got here by not promising anything.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> Mr. Speaker, everybody has heard enough from me so far today but I 
would like to congratulate you first of all and wish you well.
<P>
	To all of the candidates go our very best wishes and our sincere thanks for the seriousness which they showed toward this great 
institution of our country. I want to thank each one of them for their deep interest.
<P>
	I particularly want to thank the members of this House for their conduct throughout the day and for the friendliness that was 
shown here today. I sensed a very good rapport within this House and I hope that will continue as we debate the issues in good spirit. 
I wish all the new members all the best in their careers and good wishes to those who have returned.
<P>
	In you, Mr. Speaker, the integrity of this House rests to a large degree but it also rests with each and every one of us on the floor of 
this House. The Speaker cannot do it all by himself. We need the co-operation of all members to do it so we have to conduct 
ourselves in a decent fashion in this place.
<P>
	If we do that there is no question in my mind, Mr. Speaker, but that you will carry the rest of the load.
<P>

<P>
	The Speaker read a communication from the Secretary to the Governor General announcing that His Excellency the Governor 
General of Canada would proceed to the Senate chamber for the purpose of opening the first session of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Well, this has been some day.
<P>
	My colleagues, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 3 p.m. at which time the House will proceed to the Senate where His 
Excellency will open the first session of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.18 p.m.)
