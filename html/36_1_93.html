<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NEGOTIATION OF TERMS OF SEPARATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-237, an act to provide for a national referendum to 
authorize the Government of Canada to negotiate terms of 
separation with a province that has voted for separation from 
Canada, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, today I am pleased to speak in support 
of my private member's Bill C-237 which provides for a national 
referendum authorizing the government to negotiate terms of 
separation with a province that has voted to leave Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the bill applies to any province voting to separate from 
Canada, today I want to speak about both Quebec and my home 
province of British Columbia.  I believe that Senator Pat Carney 
was not wrong.  There is a growing resentment in B.C. against the 
way central Canada runs this country, primarily to the benefit of 
central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic times are tougher now in B.C. than they have been in 
recent memory.  One of the biggest contributors to these tough 
economic times is not the so-called Asian flu but Ottawa itself, 
a fact I will discuss this morning.  However, regardless of which 
province might want to separate from Canada, certain conditions 
must apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My private member's Bill C-237 would set conditions which must 
be met before the federal government can negotiate with any 
province voting to separate.  Because Canada is a democracy, 
which means ruled by the people, the first condition must be to 
ensure that separation really is the will of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill requires parliament to determine several conditions, 
including whether advance advertising for a provincial separation 
referendum as well as the ballots themselves state in both 
official languages that a yes vote means becoming a foreign 
state, losing representation in parliament, losing Canadian 
citizenship and passport and losing the unrestricted right to 
enter, travel and work in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill challenges separatists to follow some rules.  If they 
do, my bill requires Canada to hold a national binding referendum 
authorizing Canada to negotiate.  It does not spell out what 
would have to be negotiated, but I presume it would include such 
things as that province's share of the federal debt, rights of 
way for highways, power lines, pipelines, cables, payment of 
future pensions, cost of transferring permanent buildings and 
return of portable assets like military equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would establish a framework in which both the people 
of a province voting to separate and all Canadians could have a 
say in the future of our country.  It would also provide a basis 
in law by which everybody would know what is expected, including 
separatists, federalists and the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation deals with one of the most difficult aspects of 
separation, namely, what must be done about people in the province 
who do not wish to leave Canada.  This government has stated in 
the past that Indian bands that vote to remain in Canada would 
have their wishes respected.  Why would the same rights not be 
extended to other areas where people vote to remain in Canada? 
After all, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. 
If Canada can be broken into pieces so can a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, my bill proposes that a referendum on separating from 
Canada should be decided according to provincial and electoral 
district.  It requires that only those districts with a majority 
of votes to separate would be allowed to leave Canada.  Some 
people will say that this is ridiculous, but I find it no more 
ridiculous to suggest, for example, that the Montreal region of 
Quebec might want to stay in Canada while the Saguenay region 
voted to leave or to say that the Victoria and Vancouver areas of 
B.C. might want to stay in Canada while the interior and northern 
regions voted to leave than it is to say that we can rip Canada 
apart, allowing Quebec to leave while Newfoundland and Labrador 
and the Northwest Territories remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this be easy?  No, of course not.  Separating parts of 
Canada or parts of a province to become a foreign country will be 
extremely difficult.  People who talk about separating have to 
know that in advance.  I repeat that if the popular will can 
break up a country then the popular will can break up a province. 
After all, Quebec separatists claim to be a nation.  They claim 
to be a country, so how can breaking up Quebec be any different 
than breaking up Canada?  I want to emphasize that as a 
grassroots party Reform is well aware that only a small 
percentage of Canadians, whether inside or outside Quebec, want 
to see Quebec separate from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a statement concerning Quebec in the 1991 Reform Party 
green book which includes the following comment:  “Our desire is 
to have a New Quebec as an equal and fully participating province 
in a New Canada”.  At that time Reformers were trying to change 
the Quebec question from:  “Do you want to leave Old Canada?” 
to:  “Do you want to be a unique, equal and fully participating 
province in a New Canada?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement concluded: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers believe that the more the people of Quebec and the 
people of the rest of Canada are involved in defining the New 
Quebec and the New Canada, the higher will be the probability 
that the two visions can be reconciled.  This is because ordinary 
people everywhere want more or less the same things for 
themselves and their children—a safe environment, good jobs with 
good incomes, high-quality education and health services, respect 
for their personal values and cultural heritage, and the freedom 
to live their lives in peace and dignity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally believe that most people in Quebec as well as those 
in the rest of Canada want those same things today, but 
politicians and governments which do not listen to the people 
keep getting in the people's way.  One of the most outrageous 
topics on which politicians do not listen to everyday Canadians 
is the question of unsettled native land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today for the people of British Columbia, especially people in 
rural ridings like my riding of Okanagan—Shuswap, we see natural 
resource jobs grinding to a halt.  For example, B.C. has half the 
mining jobs it had 10 years ago.  Mining investment in British 
Columbia is too low to replace existing reserves.  According to a 
letter from a group of mine managers, one of the biggest reasons 
for this sharp decline in mining jobs in B.C. is uncertain land 
title and uncertain mineral tenure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody is going to invest millions of dollars in a mining 
investment without a certain answer to one basic question: 
Exactly who is the landlord? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same question hurts the forest industry.  The same question 
hurts the aquaculture industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Constitution, land falls under provincial 
jurisdiction.  Nevertheless, federal policies require that 
questions about aboriginal title to land be settled by the 
supreme court.  Many in B.C. say it is time for B.C. to demand 
that the highest provincial court must be the court to decide 
questions of land rather than the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government seems totally oblivious to the enormous 
impact which the Delgamuukw decision of December 1997 has had on 
B.C., where 110% of its land mass is claimed by conflicting 
Indian bands, but the entire population lives on about 5% of the 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the entire provincial economy is based on natural 
resource jobs which are being choked off by unsettled land claims 
combined with increased expectations raised by Ottawa politicians 
and the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When B.C. joined Confederation, one condition laid down was that 
it must set aside land for Indians in the form of Indian 
reserves.  Setting aside those Indian reserves fulfilled all of 
B.C.'s responsibility to the Indians living there according to 
the terms of union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Ottawa expects the people of B.C. to bear enormous 
additional costs in settling native land claims.  Currently on 
the table are 50 treaties, with the Nisga'a treaty widely seen as 
the prototype for the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa is now expecting the people of B.C. to supply 20% of the 
cash costs and 100% of land treaty settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of summers ago my wife and I had the opportunity to 
visit with the Nisga'a and to talk with them firsthand.  We saw 
the land surrounding the Nass River inland from Prince Rupert, 
which will form the land settlement of 1,930 square kilometres, 
plus $190 million in cash, $59 million for interest or inflation, 
another $122 million for their new highway, $100 million to 
compensate commercial interests like forestry, fishermen and big 
game guides for loss of their tenures, $21 million for the 
Nisga'a commercial fishery and unspecified millions to underwrite 
the cost of Nisga'a self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, other forest companies in B.C. pay substantial 
amounts to the forest renewal fund from which the Nisga'a already 
receive about $2 million a year to reforest their lands.  Funding 
will continue after the treaty but the Nisga'a will not have to 
contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the taxpayers of B.C. and Canada get in return for 
this extremely generous settlement?   No extinguishment of 
aboriginal title and a statement that the treaty is not final. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this government, and this Prime Minister in particular, have 
said that the costs of about $2 billion to compensate all victims 
of hepatitis C from tainted blood are so huge that they threaten 
the very future of medicare.  Fifty unsettled B.C. native land 
claims times $2 billion apiece is 50 times as great an amount as 
that for those additional hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government figures that the land claims are okay while the 
law-abiding citizens who get sick after receiving tainted blood 
must go to court to try to get some help.  Why the double 
standard?  Does anybody remember that there are as many 
additional B.C. treaties from bands which have not started the 
long process of negotiation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a westerner like myself it is crystal clear.  Central Canada, 
namely the two provinces of Ontario and Quebec, exercise 
absolute power and control over this country because of their 
population numbers and the total ineffectiveness of today's 
unelected and unaccountable Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me provide a short list of other major offences Ottawa has 
delivered to B.C.  For example, the softwood lumber deal was a 
poor substitute in accepting quotas and tariffs for lumber going 
to the U.S. despite the NAFTA.  The first big hole is now obvious 
in new tariffs and quotas being imposed on us by the U.S. on 
pre-drilled softwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is that Bill C-68 has been forced upon us 
regardless of the important role of rifles and shotguns in the 
rural western lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Endangered species legislation was put forward and no doubt will 
come again soon.  It makes little or no effort to compensate 
farmers and ranchers, the forest and mining industries for the 
cost of protecting species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Forces base Chilliwack was closed.  It was the only 
land force base in the most earthquake prone region in Canada 
with a significant population, including millions of 
international tourists each year. 
An official language policy that ignores freedom of speech has 
forced a great cost in British Columbia where the most common 
language after English is Chinese although in my riding it is 
German.

imports literally thousands of criminals into British Columbia 
who prey upon law abiding citizens while our own MPs hear 
accusations of bribery interfering with legitimate immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has disbanded the ports police throwing costs 
into Vancouver area municipalities and making it easier than ever 
for illegal drugs and weapons to enter B.C.  Taxes to support the 
so-called have not provinces have helped drive businesses out of 
B.C. including high taxes on gasoline.  As for fishery policy one 
could easily devote more than one speech to the federal idiocy of 
a race based aboriginal fishery with no help to the salmon 
negotiations with the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the short list of reasons why I think it is possible my 
own home province of British Columbia may start talking seriously 
as Quebec has done about separating from the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until now B.C. has not played the separatist game of trying 
to get special favours or it will leave.  On the contrary western 
Canada voted for the Reform Party to make changes inside the 
system.  However many people are becoming fed up with how little 
the government respects its commitments to get out of provincial 
jurisdiction and to rebalance the federation so there would be no 
need for any province to separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we need new rules in place to govern how separatism 
could take place so that everyone understands them.  This is a

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak in opposition to Bill C-237. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 Speech from the Throne the Government of Canada 
committed itself to modernizing our federation and to ensuring 
that as long as the prospect of another Quebec referendum on 
secession exists debate is conducted with all of the facts on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has acted accordingly since then.  This 
approach will allow all Canadians to face together the challenges 
of the 21st century.  With this objective in sight the Canadian 
government needs a responsible government to ensure there is a 
clear understanding of what is at stake in the type of unilateral 
secession that has been advocated by the current Government of 
Quebec.  Such a unilateral declaration would be a deeply 
irresponsible and impractical act.  It would pose serious risk of 
economic and social disorder particularly within Quebec and would 
have serious consequences for the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any democratic society clarity surrounding the key issues of 
the day is vital.  The very core of democracy is the respect of 
the rule of law and within that the ability of citizens to make 
informed decisions about their future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much confusion surrounds the legal status of a possible 
unilateral declaration of independence. In order to clarify the 
legal aspects involved, the Government of Canada referred three 
questions to the Supreme Court of Canada, and we are committed 
to respect the court's opinion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the reference was an appropriate and responsible course of 
action by the Government of Canada.  It is appropriate and 
responsible for members of the House not to deliberate about the 
appropriate process for secession until the supreme court has 
rendered its opinion on the question before it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for sovereignty has dropped; this drop was probably 
brought about in part to the efforts made by the Government of 
Canada to clarify what is really at stake with the secessionist 
option. As the premier of Quebec once said “The conditions 
required to win a referendum have vanished”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, a poll conducted for the Council for Canadian Unity 
showed that 61% of Quebeckers would voted no to the referendum 
question in the 1995 referendum and 38% of those who voted yes 
would have voted differently if an economic union could not have 
been concluded with the rest of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, an Ekos Research Associates Inc. poll conducted in 
March shows that only 11% of Quebeckers are in favour of 
outright independence. A SOM poll released in March shows that 
more than 62% of Quebeckers are opposed to Premier Bouchard 
holding another referendum. Finally, the poll sponsored by the 
Council on Canadian Unity shows that 50% of Quebeckers agree, 
while 36% disagree, that a region should be allowed to remain a 
part of Canada if that were the wish of a large percentage of 
its population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these figures go to show that Quebeckers want to remain 
Canadians and do not want to have to choose between their two 
identities. This is why the sovereignist leaders have no choice 
but to foster confusion and ambiguity. 
And they were quite successful at it, since polls consistently 
show that more than a third of Quebeckers still believe that, 
should sovereignty be achieved in Quebec, they would continue to 
be represented by members of Parliament in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this government has decided to counter the 
sovereignists' propaganda with clarity and use every means at 
its disposal to ensure that Quebeckers and Canadians in general 
are well aware of the irreparable consequences of secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our primary duty and our responsibility as a government is to 
ensure that our federation keeps responding better and better to 
the needs of all Canadians. Our government has established 
mechanisms to strengthen our economic and social union. This 
union is based on our bonds of solidarity, compassion and 
openness, which, beyond our linguistic and cultural differences, 
unite us from coast to coast. 
This is the very basis of our federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Government of 
Canada has undertaken initiatives to make the federation work 
better for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a few examples of the numerous steps we have taken 
in this respect.  Thanks to the Constitution Act, 1982, we were 
able to effect two constitutional amendments bilaterally to 
modernize Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador's education 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been inclusion of public sector procurement, excluding 
health and social services, under the agreement of international 
trade.  The federal government has now signed job training 
agreements with nine provinces and two territories. 
Intergovernmental negotiations are under way to develop a more 
concerted and co-operative approach to social policy reform. 
There is also the harmonization of existing federal legislation 
with Quebec civil law and the development of the national child 
benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the sorts of initiatives that demonstrate to all 
Canadians, including Quebeckers, that the federation can and does 
evolve to meet changing needs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our efforts have been productive. The deficit has been beaten, 
and we can afford to make some choices and to invest in the 
future.  Quebec is also overcoming its own deficit, which is 
something to rejoice about. Last week, the New York credit 
agency Standard & Poor's raised Quebec's credit rating.  It 
pointed out that the decreased popularity of sovereignty had 
something to do with this adjustment, since it had reduced 
political and economic uncertainty. One hopes the Government of 
Quebec takes careful note of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has much to offer.  Its economic foundations are solid 
and it is an exceptional place to live, invest and do business. 
Canada is a success from all points of view, and we are the envy 
of the entire world. 
We must make an effort to continue the progress that has begun 
and to make this country an even more remarkable place in which 
to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was not created by magic; it is the result of a joint 
desire to live together.  Our country has been built by 
generation after generation of Canadians, and it deserves to 
remain united so that future generations may continue to benefit 
from the efforts and visions of the builders of this country.

it.  The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs recently told 
students at the faculty of law at the University of Ottawa: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not a perpetual constitutional dispute; it is a 
principle of caring, one of the greatest that humanity has 
invented—.We must remain together and improve further 
this—generous federation that is our common achievement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we stated in the Speech from the Throne, the single most 
important commitment of the government is to keep Canada united. 
It is what we are committed to accomplishing through our 
initiatives to clarify what would be at stake in the unilateral 
secession and to modernize our federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons I cannot support Bill C-237. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is quite 
clear that no member of the Bloc Quebecois can support a bill 
such as the one introduced by the Reform Party.  Even though the 
government says it will not support this bill, that is in fact 
exactly what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks will be directed in equal measure at both parties and 
I will return to a few of the points made by the parliamentary 
secretary in his speech.  I am surprised, moreover, that the 
minister, who is always right, is not here himself to speak on 
this topic so dear to his heart.  He has been strangely silent 
for some weeks now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with what the member for Okanagan—Shuswap said were 
his bill's objectives. 
He said that he wanted to describe the conditions that had to be 
met before a province could become sovereign, even pointing out 
that there was growing support for such a move in his own 
province, British Columbia.  We all know perfectly well that 
there is a sort of race on between the Liberals and Reformers to 
see who can adopt the toughest policy towards Quebec and thus 
boost their political ratings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having seen the Liberals come out with a very hard-line Plan B, a 
reference to the Supreme Court, and flirt with partition, and 
not wanting to be left behind, the Reformers, with this bill, 
are now very clearly supporting all the partitionist actions in 
Quebec.  Never has a political party gone so far.  Liberal 
members must surely be amused to see their colleagues taking 
matters a little further than they have, although ultimately 
they are echoing the same sentiments.  They have encouraged this 
discourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that their primary objective is to ascertain the real 
will of the public. They want to make certain that this will is 
clearly understood, clearly identified and clearly gauged, as 
though Quebeckers were incapable of making their own decisions 
about their future, of determining if a given approach is clear 
and understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people claim that we are incapable of understanding what 
happened in the 1995 referendum because, if we had, so many of 
us would not have voted yes.  This is the assumption behind 
everything they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are saying that they are going to look for a new 
way, and use the Supreme Court as an authority in deciding 
whether Quebeckers exercised their judgement properly.  The 
Reformers are saying that another way has to be found.  Today, 
they have come up with two new approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the House of Commons that will determine in legislation 
whether the process was clear, whether it was acceptable, and 
whether people were properly informed. However, such 
determination will not be made only by the House of Commons, but 
also by another institution. Indeed, our dear senators will also 
determine whether the process was clear and understandable to 
all Quebeckers. The first problem with this is that the 
government would have to first find and then repatriate the 
senators, so they could be in the Senate to review the issue. 
This alone would imply some rather extensive delays. Who knows, 
if a referendum were held during the winter, perhaps senators 
would hold their meetings in Mexico. This issue will have to be 
taken into consideration. As I said earlier, it is all a matter 
of finding out who is prepared to go the furthest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill includes some positive elements, and I will 
mention them immediately, because there are very few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a thought process currently taking place in Canada, 
particularly outside the Liberal Party and the Reform Party. 
That process concerns the possibilities of a partnership between 
Quebec and Canada. What kind of relationship will it be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Reformers' proposed legislation shows that a thought 
process is taking place on possible and eventual ties between 
Quebec and Canada. For the first time, Reformers do not question 
the fact that Quebec could use the Canadian dollar, otherwise 
they would obviously have mentioned it.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was talk of the possibility of using some other Canadian 
instruments, but there is no longer any mention of the Canadian 
dollar, thus recognizing that sovereignists were right all 
along, as we already knew, along with most of the credible 
people who expressed their opinion on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, while the bill recognizes the democratic rule of 50% of 
the ballots plus one vote, its interpretation is very distorted, 
since it is based on electoral districts and not on the whole 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, according to the logic of Reformers, I should 
no longer be here. Indeed, since my riding voted yes in the last 
referendum, it should be part of a sovereign Quebec made up of 
all the ridings that voted yes. 
Let me say in passing that this would be true for many regions 
in Quebec, including the riding of Sherbrooke and including the 
Prime Minister's riding.  There would be a serious problem.  The 
Prime Minister would no longer be in his present riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That would be fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> That might just be fine, but there would be a 
serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the bill was a step in the right direction, but 
there is a contradiction between its title and the bill itself. 
It is entitled “an act to provide for a national referendum to 
authorize the Government of Canada to negotiate terms of 
separation with a province that has voted for separation from 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refers to a province and not various regions, parts of 
territories, and so on. 
However, further on in the bill, the approach changes and 
becomes much more radical, like that of Guy Bertrand and other 
excited Quebeckers who are in a lather over this issue, incited 
by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  Now the Reform 
Party is giving it its full support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very negative aspect of this bill is that a federal party is 
not just flirting with those who favour partition for Quebec, 
but sleeping with them too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the start of my remarks, what bothers me the most 
is all the baggage.  The bill states the following at page 3: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) If a province holds a separation referendum and the Question 
is answered in the affirmative, the Senate and House of Commons 
shall determine whether 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the question that was put was a simple and direct question— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are even going to decide whether a majority of people voted 
affirmatively in the riding.  Do they know there is a chief 
electoral officer in Quebec?  Do they know that elections and 
democratic exercises are governed by Quebec laws?  Do my Reform 
colleagues know that?  Where do they live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They do not know anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Our own laws deal with this. The quality of 
democratic exercises even serves as a standard around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they know that we also have, on political party funding, 
something that will not be found here in this House?  Do they 
know that the provisions of referendum legislation permit the 
yes and the no camps to spend about the same amount?  Do they 
know that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they know that, normally, people should not intervene in 
these referenda with money from Ottawa, which comes and meddles 
in a process where Quebeckers are deciding their future? No. 
According to their rules, Quebec's future will be decided here 
in Ottawa, either by the supreme court, or the Liberals, the 
Reform members, Senate friends appointed by the Prime Minister. 
And we should say to Quebeckers: “Don't worry, some wise people 
in Ottawa will take care of properly defining our future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bit too much, and we have had enough of all these 
approaches, of this race against the clock to determine who will 
play the hardest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs arrived with a series of highly 
partisan polls. Did members notice that several of them were 
conducted on behalf of the Council for Canadian Unity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one here knows what the Council for Canadian Unity is 
about, but perhaps not all our viewers do. This council's 
purpose  is to ensure that Quebec will never be sovereign, to 
keep Canada as it is, in a permanent, unchangeable status quo. 
It is becoming a federal propaganda tool. They took a few 
elements of a poll and threw them in our face this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us take a closer look at reality. Let us take a somewhat 
historical perspective. In the 1960s, I was not yet born, but 
from what I heard, there were a few sovereignists in Quebec. 
There was the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale. There 
were a few groups, and no one talked about a movement of over 10% 
of Quebeckers. During the 1970s, a political party was born. At 
first, it was the Mouvement souveraineté-association, and then it 
became the Parti Quebecois. Support began to increase, and soon 
reached 25 or 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first referendum, the first time where intentions were 
measured in a referendum was in 1980: 40% of the people said 
they were in favour of sovereignty, or in favour of giving the 
government a mandate to negotiate sovereignty and then come back 
before the people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later, in the 1980s, after this referendum was defeated, we were 
told there would be no more talk about sovereignty, it was over, 
archaic, and so on. Fifteen years later, we had another 
referendum and 49.5% of people voted yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at it from a historical perspective, not according to 
some poll conducted yesterday or the day before yesterday, we 
see that Quebeckers' willingness to take their destiny into 
their own hands is on the rise. Their number is increasing day 
after day, year after year. It is an irreversible trend, which 
explains why Reform MPs and Liberals alike are so panicky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have only 30 seconds left, I want to say this to members 
of the government party and Reform MPs: our desire to choose et 
decide our own future is not negotiable. Whether they like it or 
not, Quebeckers are going to choose their own future. They said 
it very clearly. Our specialist on polls should look at those 
conducted in February, during the reference to the supreme 
court; they show that over 80% of people think it is for them to 
decide, not the court, not the Reform Party, not the Liberal 
Party, and certainly not the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member from Okanagan—Shuswap. I 
have had a chance to look over the bill.  It seems what we have 
wrapped up in the bill and in the member's comments is a unique 
combination of all the various complaints the member and his 
party have about Confederation and about the nature of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are positions in the bill reflecting the Reform Party's 
position on the Senate and on free votes.  In the member's speech 
we heard about land claims and about B.C. separatism.  The member 
has made it very difficult for people to support elements of what 
he said and elements of the bill because it carries so much 
baggage with respect to a whole lot of other matters.  Clearly it 
carries a lot of political baggage in terms of what the member 
had to say when he was speaking in defence of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure, having read things over, whether this is to be a 
referendum before the government negotiates terms of separation 
or whether what the government negotiates would be put to a 
national referendum.  It appears to have elements of both. It is 
not clear exactly where this referendum would take place.  This 
is one of the problems with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not want to speak in principle against the notion that 
any significant constitutional change might in certain 
circumstances be put to a referendum.  Certainly after the 
experience of the Charlottetown accord where Canadians had their 
first experience in voting in a referendum on constitutional 
change it would be very hard not to have significant 
constitutional change in the future without Canadians 
participating in that way.  Whether one thought that was 
advisable or a tradition that should have developed, this is a 
tradition that has developed.  It would be very difficult for the 
government to do otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure the bill is the mechanism by which that might be 
achieved.  It is not a votable bill.  If it were it would go to 
committee and there would be an opportunity to do some work on 
this sort of thing.  Clearly the member seems to be saying, and I 
think a lot of people would agree, there is work to be done on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sense a contradiction between what the member is saying now 
and what I understood his party to be saying in an earlier debate 
in the House.  They were uncritically supportive of the view that 
the supreme court is going to figure all these things out. The 
government is being more consistent, not necessarily right, in 
opposing the member's bill. The member to some extent speaks for 
his party.  However, this is Private Members' Business so I 
cannot assume that.  Maybe he is only speaking for himself in 
this respect.  But he supported his party's position and seems to 
be saying this is a matter for the courts in so far as support 
for the supreme court reference. 
On the other hand he is saying we should have legislation to 
deal with this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure where the referendum comes in but I find it hard 
to imagine a situation in which a government, having negotiated 
reasonable terms of separation with a separating province, would 
have to go to a national referendum, knowing what I know about 
politics.   Even if a very good arrangement had been negotiated, 
it would be very difficult to put such an arrangement to a 
referendum because there would always be someone or some group of 
persons who might be able to point to something in the negotiated 
settlement that would threaten to scuttle it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that sense that I ask the member a question. In a 
theoretical way is he, in creating a process whereby secession or 
separation as he is suggesting in this bill, not guaranteeing 
that a separating province would eventually be driven to a 
unilateral declaration of independence?  Would this bill not set 
up a process that would make it almost impossible for any 
agreement, not to be reached, but to be approved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it very disturbing that the member would talk about 
the spectre of separatism in British Columbia.  It is well and 
good to talk about alienation, anger and legitimate grievances. 
Many of the things the member spoke about I can certainly 
understand and share his feelings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case needs to be made, and many people are making it, that 
this country needs more attention paid to what is going on in 
western Canada, particularly in B.C.  Our media has central 
Canadian glasses on.  This has been aggravated by the regionalism 
of this parliament.  The fact that the government is almost 
entirely from central Canada does not help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is something all the political parties have to 
address.  To the extent that as political parties we try to build 
our political fortunes on regional alienation, we contribute to 
the problem.  There is a bit of a conundrum.  On the one hand we 
want to give voice to the anger in our regions but we do not want 
to represent it in such a way as to contribute to the 
fragmentation of the country.  It is part of the art of politics 
and something that has to be done as well as can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the parliamentary secretary talked about Canada being a 
generous federation.  I agree that if Canada were a generous 
federation it would be more worthy of being kept unified.  I also 
agree that Canada has been a generous federation.  However, I 
would argue that one of the things that threatens this country 
now as much as any determination on the part of my Bloc Quebecois 
colleagues or the PQ government in Quebec or anything like that 
is the breakdown of the social democratic consensus that existed 
in this country from the 1940s through to the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The breakdown of that by a variety of forces, circumstances and 
policies adopted by this government and previous governments is 
every bit as much a threat to Confederation as anything being put 
forward by separatists, although obviously they are much more 
clearly a threat at the political and symbolic level. 
I am saying that at the social and economic level there is this 
other threat to Canadians' sense of themselves as being part of a 
caring community that they feel is worth defending and that many 
Quebeckers might feel is worth continuing to be a part of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the cutbacks the federal government has been 
responsible for in terms of federal transfer payments to the 
provinces. The federal government is now only paying something 
like 15% or 20% on medicare and perhaps it is as low as 10% 
depending on the figures that we believe.  When it comes to the 
cost of health care I do not know how any member on the other 
side has the nerve to talk about this being a generous 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see what this government has done in terms of unilateral 
secession. We talk about unilateral secession.  There is 
unilateral federal withdrawal from cost shared programs, from 
programs which in some senses were initially imposed on the 
provinces and certainly were initiated by the federal government. 
It is something which we supported and still do.  But if we are 
going to continue to have those programs then we have to restore 
much fuller federal participation in those programs. Government 
members cannot get up day after day— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid I must 
interrupt the hon. member.  Time has run out. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
going to speak briefly to Bill C-237 introduced by the Reform 
Party member.  Having listened to him, I think that the member 
is experiencing major frustration.  I urge him to carry out a 
rapid consultation and do something positive for the country, 
not something negative, as he is with Bill C-237. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is surprising in this bill—once again we see the dichotomy 
of the Reform Party—is that there is recognition for a referendum 
in Quebec or in the other provinces while, in February, 
indignant Reformers said that they did not recognize the right 
of the people of Quebec to decide their own future.  In Bill 
C-237, they say that now they have the right. 
Once again, we see that the Reform Party is inconsistent and 
never on the same wavelength as the rest of the country.  We 
will see this in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is surprising about Bill C-237 is that it is a negative 
bill.  It sets out on paper the Reform Party's position on how 
to legally split up the country.  It is the same with the 
Liberal government opposite.  They want to establish standards 
on how to carve up the country, taking matters to such an 
extreme that there is now a criterion involving gauging results 
riding by riding.  This is unprecedented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that Quebec, British Columbia, or any other province, 
has the right to consult its population as to whether it wishes 
to remain in the country, but the bill goes further than that. 
It does not say that the province has to be the one consulting. 
It says “a referendum or question put to the electors”, meaning 
that a riding dissatisfied with its lot in the country can 
decide to change country. 
That is what is idiotic about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no sense.  They are saying that it is possible to 
divide Canada, tear it apart, divide provinces, and they are no 
longer necessarily limiting this partition to a country or a 
province, but are now talking about regions.  This is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill, if the aboriginal peoples decide to change 
country, no province or parliament can stand in their way.  All 
that can be done is to hold a national referendum to set the 
rules.  If the James Bay Cree decide to join the United States, 
they will be able to do so easily with this bill.  No 
legislation or supreme court reference can prevent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill does is to give the country's regions, rather 
than its provinces, the right to fight with each other and to 
split off.  This goes so far that it makes no sense.  What we 
have here is a pizza parliament. 
Given the frustration of the Reform member and of other parties 
in the country, if such a bill were to be passed, we could be 
looking at a “puzzle Canada”, with discontinuous stretches of 
country here and there. 
That is what Bill C-237 is about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutional stupidity goes that far.  It is totally crazy.  I 
can understand the Reform Party, though.  They will never be in 
government in this country, united as it is today, so they say: 
“We are going to collect bits of ridings here and there across 
the country and make ourselves a little republic of our own”. 
That is what Bill C-237 is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member had anything else in mind, he should have 
consulted the other parties, taken a look at what has been 
happening in Parliament in recent years and been more positive 
in his approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of ridings goes far beyond that.  If we support a 
national referendum, we must apply the same rule to ridings. 
What would happen if Quebec or, say, Prince Edward Island 
decided to separate?  A national referendum would be held to put 
the terms of the separation to the people of Canada.  What would 
happen if Quebec ridings voted no? It does not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we not talk positively about the country and stop trying to 
sour relations?   I want to say something, with much respect for 
my Bloc friends.  They are my Quebec colleagues.  There are, 
however, two separatist parties in this House.  One is French 
speaking, the other, English speaking.  That is the reality of 
this Parliament.  We are going to have to give priority to the 
things that count, like putting bread and butter on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member is right about one thing.  There are indeed 
problems in certain parts of the country. 
I agree with him.  However, why waste our time introducing 
twisted legislation and telling the Supreme Court and the whole 
world that regions can separate?  There is no support for the 
big bad separatists in Quebec. But there is also a secessionist 
movement in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about the country is negative.  The most negative thing 
about this country is that there are people who cannot make ends 
meet.  Some people are poor and dying of hunger.  All the Reform 
Party wants is to introduce bills to blow the country apart. 
This is the way to resolve a lot of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we say is that there should be a more positive approach in 
this Parliament.  Members should stop trying to dragoon people 
into their movement and introducing bills proposing ways to 
break up the country.  That is bunk.  A country is not a 
marriage.  The difference between a constitution and a marriage 
contract is that the marriage contract sets out the conditions 
for divorce. 
A constitution makes no such mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the idea is to include in a constitution the rules that 
would apply in case of a divorce. But a constitution is not a 
marriage contract. The bill goes too far. We favour a 
constructive approach. If they wanted, Reformers could do the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone close to the Reform Party listed 10 reasons why 
Quebeckers should vote yes in a future referendum. His approach 
was somewhat sarcastic. Reformers are constantly adding fuel to 
the fire. The Liberal Party has failed to try to put out the 
fire. But again today, the Reform Party is trying to add fuel to 
the fire. This must stop. The best way to destroy a country is 
to introduce legislation such as Bill C-237. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in this bill is the will to maintain a united country? 
There is no such will. This is the Reform Party's approach. The 
Liberal Party does not fare much better. There are other 
problems. 
Again, Parliament will have to start discussing positive things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the government does not introduce a lot of 
bills. It hides from the public a surplus of $6 or $7 billion in 
this year's budget, because Liberal ministers want to spend this 
money, and I can understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But why not talk about positive things to promote the common 
good of Canadians and Quebeckers, instead of telling people in 
some regions of Quebec, such as Montreal Island “If you vote no 
in a referendum, you will remain with us”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the democratic nature of the vote is 
recognized. The Reform Party was in favour of the recall. The 
whole democratic issue is important. We must have an elected 
Senate, we must do this and that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers want to ensure the constitutional issue is recognized 
in Quebec. They want to ensure Canada is divided. They talk 
about partition in Canada. They do not recognize the Quebec 
province as a whole any more. They take what they need and let 
go of the rest. This is what Bill C-237 is about, this is what 
the Reform Party is about. It is a separatist party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to have the opportunity to change their label, they 
should introduce far more positive bills: hold a hand out to 
British Columbians, to Quebeckers. They know that from history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should come and visit Quebec. I invite them to do so. There 
are also regional frustrations in that province. 
In my riding, there are regional frustrations, but one thing is 
clear: we want to work positively to improve this country and 
Quebec. People should stop saying it is always Ottawa's fault. 
We must take our future into our own hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There remains a credible alternative to this government and to 
the constitutional issue, and it is here in this corner of the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, to summarize, we have heard a bit about this bill, but 
more on partisan politics from a number of parties in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind members, especially the separatists, that 
when they talk about sovereignty they play the politically 
correct game. They tone it down to try to confuse the people in 
this country. Let us understand that what they actually mean is 
separation, not sovereignty association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also address the Conservative Party in the House. We got into 
this mess because of two parties basically.  We are here today 
because of the Liberal government and the Conservative 
government.  I remind the Conservative members exactly where Mr. 
Bouchard came from.  He came right out of their ranks, straight 
from the Conservative Party.  They should remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get fed up with the political correctness some people say we 
have to operate under, that we should not bring these types of 
bills before the House and to leave it up to the Senate to make 
the decision.  I have great concerns about that.  This is 
supposed to be the highest political office in the land.  When we 
do not have the intestinal fortitude to take these problems face 
on and come up with answers to these questions, then we are in a 
sorry state in this country, when we back down from problems like 
this instead of facing them and trying to use them for other 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat what Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow 
said the other day.  He warned the federal government last week 
at the annual meeting of the Council for Canadian Unity that it 
needs to take provincial demands much more seriously than it now 
seems to be doing.  It must continue to rebalance the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the unity conference the results of a CROP poll conducted 
earlier in April were announced.  It stresses my point.  In 
Quebec 75% described themselves as being very attached or 
somewhat attached to Canada.  The poll showed that many 
Quebeckers remain confused about what separation from Canada 
would mean.  Thirty-seven per cent of those polled in Quebec said 
that Quebec sovereignty and an economic partnership with Canada 
would not mean that Quebec would leave Canada and become an 
independent country. This is in Quebec.  Twenty-nine per cent 
said Quebec would still elect MPs to go to Ottawa; 39% said 
Quebeckers would keep Canadian citizenship; and 36% said Quebec 
would still be a Canadian province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that this place put the rules in place of exactly 
what we are talking about when provinces and people want to talk 
about separation.  Let us come here and do the job we were 
elected to do. Let us clear this confusion up and get this 
settled instead of it costing us millions and millions of dollars 
every year on the same issue.  Let us put some rules in place for 
a change.  Let us do our job.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK12">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 24 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-32, an act respecting pollution prevention and the 
protection of the environment and human health in order to 
contribute to sustainable development, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam Speaker, there have been 
discussions among the parties and I think you would find 
unanimous consent to allow the ministers to speak in this debate 
later today for the normal time of 20 minutes for speeches and 10 
minutes for questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, thank 
you for giving me the opportunity to speak to Bill C-32, the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has always supported the concept that all 
Canadians deserve to live in a clean and healthy environment. The 
key to protecting our environment is to ensure a co-operative 
attitude.  Without co-operation no piece of legislation will 
achieve its purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for environmental goals and targets to be met it is 
essential that an open dialogue representing social, scientific, 
technical and economic considerations be held.  The successful 
development of any project requires consideration for all these 
aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we never lose sight of the role played by 
public consultation and participation.  With the recent signing 
of the environmental harmonization accord the time has come for 
all levels of government to work with each other to ensure that 
environmental issues receive top consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 when the original Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
came into force, now simply referred to as CEPA, the goal of the 
legislation was to protect the environment and in turn protect 
human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CEPA intended to fill regulatory gaps where they existed in the 
legislative framework with particular attention being paid to the 
issue of toxic substances, when and if to ban them and how 
harmful they can be to our health and our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CEPA has also played an international role.  Canada has always 
tried to play an important role in the international arena and 
whenever international environmental treaties are signed, 
international obligations ensue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation touches and affects several acts, 
including the environmental contaminants act, the oceans dumping 
control act and the clean air act.  The legislative review that 
began last parliament was part of a mandatory review of the 
administration of this act.  The review resulted in the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development's holding 
hearings which resulted in a report of recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old bill, Bill C-74, died on the order paper and never made 
it through the House, the reasons for which I will delve into 
briefly.  Now a revamped version has been tabled under Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This rather extensive piece of legislation, 230 pages in all, 
provides measures for the protection of environment and human 
health as well as pollution prevention.  Other sections deal with 
the management of toxic substances, the virtual elimination of 
releases of substances determined to be the most dangerous, and 
the partnerships needed to achieve the highest level of 
environmental quality.  This last section is particularly 
important because without strong co-operation between varying 
levels of government, science, industry and environmental sectors 
no amount of legislation will safeguard our land, keep it in good 
health and preserve it for our children and their children to 
enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the changes made to CEPA, Bill C-32 includes the provision 
to implement pollution prevention, new procedures for the 
investigation and assessment of substances and new requirements 
for toxicity assessments, new provisions respecting fuels, 
international air and water pollution, motor emissions, federal 
and aboriginal land protection, the proper disposal of wastes and 
other matters at sea and the safer export and import of waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should Bill C-32 be enacted it will provide for the gathering of 
information for research and the creation of inventories of data, 
the publishing of objectives, guidelines and codes of practice, 
new powers for inspectors, investigators and laboratory analysis, 
many environmental protection alternative measures as well as 
civil suit action guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The differences between the old bill and Bill C-32 are not 
overwhelming.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 contains minor amendments that appear to work in 
favour of the bill.  That is not to say the bill has no 
shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these concerns can and must be addressed by the 
Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development.  One area of concern lies with the issue of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking to the Constitution for help in this matter is 
fruitless.  Environmental jurisdiction is not definite in the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years now much duplication and overlap between different 
levels of government have left us with the relatively ineffective 
system in dire need of fine tuned co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1980s environmental protection has been expanded at 
the federal and provincial levels.  The result has been a great 
deal of tension between the provinces and the federal government 
that has been taken to the highest courts in this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Ottawa 
has a right to enact legislation to protect the environment. 
However, the supreme court also made special note that the 
federal government was not to take this as a carte blanche to run 
all over the existing provincially run areas of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This holds true with an important aspect of Reform principles. 
Very often some government affairs are best carried out at a 
closer level to the people of this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true that environmental issues transcend man made 
boundaries, if the provinces are properly carrying out their 
environmental duties, there is no reason for the federal 
government to interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal-provincial co-operation is essential to ensuring that 
environmental policies are carried through.  If the recent 
signing of the harmonization accord between the federal and 
provincial environment ministers is any indication, perhaps we 
are well on our way to ensuring a partnership rather than an 
adversarial approach to environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resources required to adequately protect our environment and 
consequently our health are vast.  Clearly such a huge task 
should be shared by all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize and take this opportunity to mention 
municipal involvement.  Municipal levels of government are 
closest to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deal with their local city councils on almost a daily 
basis and we should encourage grassroots participation in 
safeguarding our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the problems between federal and provincial 
jurisdictions over the environment, a clear understanding must be 
achieved in order to avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform blue book policy clearly supports the establishment of 
clear federal-provincial jurisdiction over environmental matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to keep in mind that every dollar saved in the 
administration of the environment would be better spent toward 
such areas as pollution prevention, viable alternative energy 
systems and waste management, to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 contains some amendments requiring co-operation 
between the federal and provincial governments in an attempt to 
show support for the harmonization accord signed in St. John's, 
Newfoundland earlier this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CEPA's preamble sets out a shared responsibility for the 
environment.  Here is an important step toward true 
harmonization and cost effective environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This alone, however, hardly is enough.  It is imperative that 
CEPA spell out that the government will discharge its 
responsibilities by working co-operatively under the 
federal-provincial-territorial Canadian-wide accord and 
subagreements on environmental harmonization as agreed to in 
principle by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safeguards are in place to ensure that no one province steers 
the direction of the federal government vis-à-vis any 
international treaties. The federal government must be cognizant 
that many international treaties will require provincial 
implementation and that provinces should be able to take part in 
any implementation strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 empowers the minister with the control of the movement 
of non-hazardous solid waste to or from the United States. 
Usually waste management falls under provincial jurisdiction and 
this is one area that could cause tensions between federal and 
provincial levels of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one section that may need to be reworked.  In the area 
of accountability, it is interesting to note that CEPA allows for 
the creation of a national advisory committee.  Unfortunately the 
committee structure compromises its accountability to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the national advisory committee are appointed by 
the minister without any provincial involvement, and this is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of accountability may cause this committee to act as a 
political vehicle to promote the minister's agenda rather than a 
national vehicle to ensure provinces and territories are fairly 
represented in the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me back to my first point, the importance of a fair 
and open consultation process for the public, especially in the 
development of regulations and additions of new substances. 
Reform has always supported the principle of grassroots 
participation.  We are dedicated to public consultation and 
policy development, especially when we are dealing with an issue 
that knows no boundaries such as the environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually we all eat from the same earth, drink from the same 
water and breathe the same air.  In short, we are all in this 
together, so the best way is a co-operative way because we are 
all affected by the environment in one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not impressed with the lack of formal consultation 
processes in CEPA.  During the last parliamentary session over 
100 concerns were raised regarding CEPA and there are still areas 
of concern that need to be addressed especially in the area of 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Bill C-32 needs to ensure that all draft 
regulations and guidelines are released for public comment 60 
days before the minister formally releases the assessment.  It is 
unfortunate that too much is left to the minister's discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of this is the environmental registry.  Access 
to the registry should be open and the form should be clearly 
announced.  Bill C-32 leaves all this at the minister's 
discretion.  This secrecy is not justifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another questionable issue is the lack of requirement to print 
the final text of all agreements in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>.  I 
am unclear as to why this is not a required practice.  I ask that 
the minister allow all final texts be published in full and 
easily accessed through the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more area of concern is the lack of adequate time given to 
the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development to review proposed administrative and equivalency 
agreements.  As a member of this committee I have twice witnessed 
the fast track approach taken by the environment minister, once 
to push through the harmonization accord and second to pull 
together a very last minute and rather hasty position on Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now more than ever Canadians are fed up with the old way of 
doing business.  Canadians are demanding accountability from 
their government. I remind the environment minister that this 
means no more dealings behind closed doors. Canadians want 
transparency when it comes to conducting business dealings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more area required for sound policy decision making is 
reliance on sound scientific principles.  It is imperative that 
legislation reflect the right choices to protect our environment 
and not for political gain, as has been the case.  CEPA and many 
decisions made under this legislation need to be supported by 
sound scientific study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area where the old bill has serious problems rests with the 
minister's ability to bypass section 65 and overlook the 
requirements set out in the risk assessment determination on 
toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite certain Canadians would not be impressed to find out 
this bill gives the environment minister unlimited powers to 
bypass science in her decision making.  This is one of the 
critical reasons Reform, environmentalists, industry and many 
Canadians cannot support this bill.  Perhaps this was one of the 
reasons for its demise in the last parliament. Further study will 
be required to assess whether the unlimited powers section has 
been properly addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is odd that the word toxic is not defined in Bill C-32's 
preamble considering there is an entire section devoted to 
controlling toxic substances.  This section may allow substances 
to be defined as toxic without the necessary scientific evidence 
needed to prove toxicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather frightening to think this may be yet another 
section giving the minister or parliament authority the ability 
to arbitrarily ban substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is the provisions to provide for toxic 
assessment consultation fail to require that qualified experts 
from government, academia and industry are full partners in the 
assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another controversial section of the bill is the national ban on 
substances banned in other provinces or industrialized countries. 
Such a policy could abandon risk assessment as a basis for 
priorization and chemical control when it is the standard 
accepted internationally and by the science community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy could also undermine the necessity of requiring a 
science basis for decisions.  It is critical that the role of 
science be clarified so that science forms the basis of decisions 
made under CEPA.  This needs to be spelled out clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key issue is enforcement which is critical to 
environment policy.  The Reform Party has many clear positions on 
enforcement.  Reform blue book policy clearly supports the 
principle that the polluter should pay for its pollution controls 
and that this be stringently enforced in an unbiased manner and 
that penalties be severe enough so polluters will not consider 
them a licence fee to pollute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform also supports fines and jail sentences for officers and 
executives of companies violating environmental laws.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest problem with CEPA is its lack of enforcement.  When 
CEPA was proclaimed 10 years ago the Conservative government 
bragged that it introduced the toughest environmental law in the 
western hemisphere.  Yet this has proven to be quite the 
exaggeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the principal concerns regarding this act is inadequate 
funding for enforcement.  The department simply does not have the 
resources to ensure that the requirements of the act are 
fulfilled.  The environment department has had almost two-thirds 
of its budget slashed since the Liberals came to power.  No 
matter how tough the minister makes the act it will make no 
difference unless the department has the resources to enforce the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be emphasized more than enforcement is the operative 
word compliance.  It is always better to follow the carrot over 
the stick approach.  A law must have the capacity to enforce its 
regulations.  Yet it will be more effective if it can deter 
individuals from breaking the law or, better yet, if it can 
encourage individuals to follow the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other areas of enforcement contained in Bill C-32 also need to 
be examined and possibly amended for improvement.  For example, 
the right to sue provisions contained within the bill may be 
improved if amended so that the government is made a mandatory 
party to any suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whistleblower protection contained in the legislation may also 
require expansion to include whistleblower protection for workers 
who report breaches of the law and bad environmental practice not 
just to inspectors but to the public and through the media. 
Pollution is a public issue and workers should have the right to 
publicize it without fear of sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the many needed areas of improvement, some of the other 
improvements to Bill C-74, which is now Bill C-32, include 
improved time lines for adding new substances that have been 
assessed and added to the domestic substance list.  Pollution 
prevention planning guidelines have been further developed in the 
new bill.  Recognition of voluntary instruments has also been 
added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 51 has been amended to ensure that pollution prevention 
virtual elimination and environmental emergency plans can only be 
required by the minister for substances that are on the list of 
toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater flexibility has been provided in the preparation of 
pollution prevention plans to keep with the policy objective that 
the plan does not become akin to excessive regulatory burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many changes have been made to Bill C-32, formerly Bill C-74, to 
make it more acceptable to the public.  There are still areas of 
concern that need to be worked out.  Canadians have waited a long 
time for the government to pass meaningful realistic 
environmental legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Especially after the fiasco with Kyoto, I am hoping to see our 
government get away from its empty rhetoric and destructive 
political agendas and move toward something more realistic and 
acceptable to Canadians that will truly benefit our environment. 
I hope we never again have to witness such an embarrassment as 
the lack of formal consultation and the lack of an implementation 
strategy prior to set targets like we did with Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more positive note it appears that there has been 
sufficient progress with Bill C-32 to make it a plausible 
alternative to the existing legislation.  Depending on further 
analysis of the bill, as long as the progress made on the bill is 
not lost in committee and some revisions are made to tighten it 
up there is a good chance the official opposition may support the 
bill.

congratulate the member for Lethbridge on his thorough review of 
Bill C-32 and for his commitment to the pollution pay principle 
as well for the way he stressed the importance of enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of his speech the hon. member for Lethbridge 
made reference to one specific section, which I was not able to 
take note of quickly enough, that in his words needs to be 
reworked.  I wonder whether he could perhaps amplify on that part 
of his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the hon. member for Lethbridge spoke about the importance 
of sound science and the desirability of spelling out the role of 
science.  I would be interested in knowing how he would propose 
to spell it out within the context of the proposed Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the

and to pose some questions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about science we have to be sure that we 
consult with the scientific and academic communities on all 
issues to get a good cross-section of existing science.  We did 
this somewhat with Kotow at the environment committee, as the 
member knows.  The best people from across Canada came to explain 
what they felt was the situation.  There were people speaking for 
and against the position the government was taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make sure that grassroot Canadians, the scientific 
community and industry all have an opportunity for input to 
assess and debate the science the government is using to base its 
positions on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should open up the debate to make sure we are looking at all 
angles, to make sure it is an open-minded discussion and not a 
preconceived look at science by the government.  Indeed all areas 
of concern should be brought before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we saw in the past on the environment 
committee when we dealt with Kotow was that some people told us 
global warming was not happening, although the majority said it 
was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take all that information and put it together in a 
position that would force the government to have a better look at 
it and maybe come at it from a couple of different angles to 
ensure that what gets put into legislation is indeed the science 
that community is putting forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary 
question for the member for Lethbridge.  In his speech he made 
reference to the discretionary powers given to the minister, 
indicating that he found these powers to be too wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member for Lethbridge in a position to indicate in which 
way he would propose to reduce the scope of the discretionary 
powers of the minister in Bill C-32? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the areas in the 
bill where we would like to see some change made is the proposal 
to put in place an advisory committee.  Members from the 
provinces, the aboriginal communities and the departments of the 
environment and health will sit on it.  However, from what we can 
read in the bill the minister will appoint these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to ensure membership of the advisory committee and 
possibly others who will be reporting to the minister is to allow 
the provinces to appoint the members who will be sitting on the 
committee reporting to the Minister of the Environment. If we do 
that we would somewhat get away from the fact that the minister 
could appoint some members to the committee who are favourable to 
the government position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a little more accountability so that the provinces would 
be interested in taking part and being able to put forward their 
best person instead of the minister appointing the entire 
advisory committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was appointed minister of the environment in June 1997, I 
chose to concentrate my efforts on four priority areas that would 
bring Canadians a cleaner and healthier environment in the next 
century.  The priorities are clean air, clean water, conservation 
of nature and meeting our Kyoto commitments on climate change. 
These are not just my priorities.  I believe they represent the 
wishes of each and every member of the House and the Canadians we 
all serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and Canadians need tools to reach our goals.  We need faster 
action to reduce the threat from toxic substances.  Canadians 
want more information and a voice in environmental protection. 
Business wants a predictable framework in which to operate as 
green industries that prosper economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewed and strengthened Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act responds to those needs and demonstrates leadership by 
providing Canadians with the tools they want and need for 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current CEPA has supported significant achievements.  Under 
the current act Canadians have achieved concrete environmental 
improvements including the reduction of specific toxins such as 
dioxins, furans and PCBs.  We have taken action on known 
carcinogens such as benzene in gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well in recent weeks I have announced a series of initiatives 
that would better protect human health, give Canadians cleaner 
air and water, protect nature and meet our climate change 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among them are, first, an intergovernmental agreement last 
Friday in Toronto to implement early action and to develop a 
national implementation strategy to ensure that Canada meets its 
climate change goal; second, improvements to the air we breathe 
through the reduction of up to 85% of emissions of particulate 
matter and toxic metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and 
mercury from heavy oil and coal fired plants by 2003; and, third, 
by presenting Canadians with options to reduce sulphur in 
gasoline which causes respiratory ailments in our children and 
the elderly.  The government will announce this fall the new 
sulphur level for gasoline which will bring about cleaner air. 
Fourth, Canada was the first country to ratify the 1997 
amendments to the Montreal protocol which shows our dedication to 
reducing methyl bromide, one more substance which depletes the 
earth's protective ozone layer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been able to take these actions by using the current 
legislation but more needs to be done.  Our environmental 
problems are becoming more complicated.  We need new modernized 
legislation to deal with emerging issues and to integrate new 
solutions.  Pollution prevention and the ecosystem approaches to 
sustainable development must be incorporated into legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed act before the House of Commons reflects the 
greater understanding, giving us new tools to protect our health 
and the environment.  It tackles toxic substances and puts the 
most dangerous ones on the path to virtual elimination. 
Strengthened legislation for toxics is crucial to clean our air 
and our water and to protect our health. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the renewed legislation, pollution prevention will become 
a national objective. When the original act was enacted, most of 
the environmental protection efforts focused on pollution 
management through last-resort solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must, however, prevent pollution and not worry about it once 
there has been a leak, a spill or harmful emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toxic substances affect the health of Canadians. PCBs and other 
harmful substances have been found in the breast milk of mothers 
in the Arctic. 
Urban smog makes our children sick, the number of children 
hospitalized for asthma having increased by 27% for boys and 18% 
for girls. According to Health Canada, one person dies every day

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewed legislation will control air pollution, including 
urban smog, more effectively.  Among other things it will allow 
for regulations requiring cleaner fuels and tougher emissions 
standards for new motor vehicles.  In addition, for the first 
time, the federal government will be able to set emissions 
standards for other types of engines such as those used in lawn 
mowers and off road vehicles.  Getting toxics out of the 
environment will mean cleaner air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clean water is also an objective of the legislation.  Canada 
borders on three of the world's oceans.  We are also stewards of 
9% of the world's available freshwater.  These are enormous 
responsibilities, ones which I do not take lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canadian Environmental Protection Act will provide a 
means to help fulfil our stewardship responsibility and to meet 
our goal of cleaner water for Canadians.  It puts in place a 
process for quicker assessment of toxic substances to identify 
those that need to be eliminated or controlled, together with 
strict deadlines for action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that pollution does not respect borders.  Whether toxics 
reach our waters in effluent or are transported by air, getting 
them out of our environment will mean cleaner water.  New 
provisions in the act will provide a framework to take action on 
Canadian sources of water pollution that affect both our country 
and other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know our wildlife is being poisoned by toxic substances in 
our air, land and water.  Last summer I saw for myself the effect 
mercury poisoning is having on loons in Nova Scotia.  I want an 
environment safe for loons and all other species, including human 
beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewed Canadian Environmental Protection Act will put in 
place an ecosystem approach that recognizes the fact that all 
components of the environment are interdependent.  It means we 
have to look at the whole picture and make the link between our 
actions and their effects on nature and us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only a brief description of how the renewed Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act will help to make our air and water 
clean and preserve nature.  In all cases the new act will focus 
on preventing pollution before it is created.  It will shift the 
focus from cleaning up toxics to stopping them from getting into 
the environment in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is a shared legacy.  It is beyond the ability of 
any person, industry or government to solve environmental 
problems on their own.  We not only need to continue co-operative 
international efforts but we need to build and continue domestic 
partnerships in order to achieve success. This includes 
partnership with the provinces, territories and municipalities 
and of equal importance, partnership with business and industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business and industry are the ones with the tools and the know 
how to stop pollution and toxics from entering our environment. 
In addition to protecting the environment, pollution prevention 
is good for the bottom line.  Ford Canada knows this.  Its St. 
Thomas, Ontario assembly plant now uses 27 million fewer gallons 
of water and has reduced paint sludge by 500,000 pounds each year 
saving the company $275,000 annually. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good regulations promote innovation. Canadians and Canadian 
businesses just proved it. The new Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act will further stimulate innovation, helping our 
businesses to maintain their status as world leaders in the 
development of environmental protection techniques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These businesses have been able to meet the challenge because 
they viewed it as an opportunity not only to make profits but 
also to become good corporate citizens who are aware of their 
social responsibilities within the community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business leaders want a clean environment just as much as we do. 
Some are members of ARET, the accelerated reduction and 
elimination of toxics program.  These members reported recently 
that in 1996 emissions of a number of toxic substances such as 
zinc, benzene, lead and copper were reduced by over 5,000 tonnes, 
a decrease of 27% from 1995 emission levels.

changes and other measures to reduce these toxic substances 
voluntarily.  They recognize that voluntary action can work with 
a regulatory regime such as provided by the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses have told us that they want predictable regulations 
which protect the environment yet still allow for growth and 
prosperity. That is exactly what they are getting. In addition 
the renewed act provides many opportunities for consultations as 
measures are developed.  When businesses clearly understand what 
the law demands of them, they can plan more effectively. This 
ensures a higher rate of compliance. Together we will put to rest 
the myth that good environmentalism precludes economic growth. 
The two are in fact mutually supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For businesses that will not live up to their end of the 
partnership, the renewed act has strengthened the enforcement arm 
of the new legislation.  We have expanded the powers of officials 
who are charged with enforcing the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials will have the ability to issue on the spot orders to 
stop illegal activity or to require action to correct a violation 
to protect the environment and public safety.  They will be able 
to use environmental protection alternative measures to provide 
corrective action and penalties without the need to proceed with 
a lengthy court case.  There will be a new sentencing criteria to 
guide the courts to take into account such things as remediation 
costs for damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that environmental problems respect no boundaries, 
provincial or federal.  Their causes and solutions are rarely 
found within the borders of one jurisdiction.  Tackling these 
issues requires action at local, regional, national and global 
levels. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Positive results will best be achieved by governments working 
together.  This way, we can plug any holes in environmental 
protection and more effectively meet the challenges that the 
environment poses to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned from past collaborative efforts with the 
provinces that, on environmental issues, the best results are 
achieved through intergovernmental co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through partnerships between governments, significant 
improvements were made in areas such as acid rain and ozone 
depletion. This renewed legislation is based on this reality and 
provides a framework for co-operation between the federal and 
provincial governments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is not, as some have said, a federal retreat 
from environmental protection.  It is consistent with the 
harmonization accord I signed with the provinces last January.  I 
remind members that harmonization is about working together to 
achieve the highest national standards.  The federal government 
has not given up its authority to act. The renewed Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act is proof of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we come to the reason we are protecting the environment 
in the first place, the Canadian public.  Canadians are telling 
me they are worried about the effects of pollution on their 
health and the health of their children.  Nine out of 10 
Canadians are worried about the effects that environmental 
problems are having on their children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater public participation is key to protecting the 
environment. Canadians want to be part of the solution.  They 
want more power to influence environmental decisions and stronger 
measures to ensure a legacy of clean air and clean water.  The 
renewed act responds to their demands.  It provides Canadians 
with more information giving them the tools to act in their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways that we will do this is through the 
environmental registry.  The registry will provide comprehensive 
information on regulations and decisions made under the 
legislation.  In addition, the national pollutant release 
inventory, an accounting of the releases of 176 pollutants from 
all significant sources, will continue to provide Canadians with 
information about the toxics in their communities. 
Under a new Canadian Environmental Protection Act this program 
would become a legal commitment for the government in an effort 
to provide Canadians with as much information as possible.

expands this protection to cover all violations and protects 
federally regulated employees from discipline, dismissal or 
harassment for reporting violations in the workplace. In 
addition, to ensure the government does its job, Canadians will 
be given the right to sue if the government does not enforce the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act where significant harm to 
the environment has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand firmly behind the renewed Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act not only because we committed to it in the red 
book, not only because I believe it is what Canadians want, but 
most importantly because it will protect the environment and the 
health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day when my grandchildren ask me what I did, I want to tell 
them that I worked to ensure that the environment I left them was 
clean or cleaner than the one my grandparents left to me.  I want 
them to be able to tell their grandchildren that the Canadian 
government and I had their health and their legacy in mind when 
we passed this renewed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation and this portfolio is particularly timely for 
me.  As I look forward to the birth of a new grandchild I want to 
be proud of the environmental legacy I pass on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the minister for her presentation and for being 
here today and for giving me the opportunity to bring up one of 
the points I made, which is the national advisory council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read the legislation, and perhaps she can define it for me, 
it indicates she will be appointing all the members to the 
council.  Would the minister allow the provinces to appoint them 
so that we could truly get a national scope to that council? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, is there going to be more responsibility for the municipal 
governments in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned stewardship and the fact that Canadians 
are good stewards of the environment. Will the minister be 
putting the concerns or the value of stewardship of the land in 
the upcoming legislation on endangered species?  We know that we 
have stewards of the land across Canada who take very good care 
of it. Hopefully the value of proper stewardship will be 
reflected in that legislation as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with regard to the 
national advisory council, this is federal legislation and 
therefore the federal government appoints. The legislation will 
be going to committee. Certainly I am interested in listening to 
comments committee members will make in terms of how those 
appointments might be made for recommendation to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hoping that we can have a wide and diverse representation 
in that committee.  In that way it will as much as possible 
reflect the broad cross sector of Canadian interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the involvement of municipalities, municipalities 
are really within the provincial jurisdiction of responsibility. 
My personal view is the municipalities represent a grassroots 
level of government where we can most effectively produce some 
results on the environment.  I am hoping I will be able, with the 
assistance of the provinces, to work very closely with the 
municipalities to achieve the results we need on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked a question about stewardship and the 
environment. Stewardship crosses over all environmental issues. 
It is my belief which is affirmed through polling information 
that Canadians in all sectors of our economy truly are concerned 
about the environment. 
They want tools from the federal government to help them, to 
assist them in making sure the environment is protected, whether 
it is water or air or our natural ecosystem.

instruments with which I can work collaboratively with all levels

environment and to make sure we have the authorities there as 
well that when we see problems or abuses we are able to take

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
must express my amusement with the speech by the Minister of the 
Environment in which she refers to her environmental concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She tells us that she wants to act before there are any 
ecological catastrophes and before our environment deteriorates. 
I might begin by reminding her of her government's terrible 
record as far as greenhouse gas reduction is concerned. I believe 
that this government's failure to meet the objectives of Rio is 
an obvious sign of its lack of desire to take these environmental 
concerns into consideration.  That was my first comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the minister had very little to say about the 
negotiations surrounding the harmonization process.  I would 
remind her that, in principle, it was intended to eliminate 
potential conflicts between the provinces and the federal 
government. It was also intended to eliminate duplication and 
overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind her as well that Quebec refused to sign that 
agreement, for two basic reasons. First, it wanted recognition 
of Quebec's exclusive and overriding areas of jurisdiction 
within its constitutional rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also wanted changes to the legislation, such as those in Bill 
C-32, to take the concerns I have referred to into account. 
I take pride in speaking out against this bill, simply because 
it does not address the concerns defended by the Quebec Minister 
of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Minister of the Environment is a very simple 
one.  When I look at the bill and the spirit of that bill I see 
that it calls for interventions at the national level, for 
instance those in clauses 139 and 140 on national fuels marks 
and clauses 152 and 150 on national emissions marks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not agree that her bill represents a direct 
attack on the provinces and an obligation for them to adopt 
provincial regulations, as otherwise the federal government will 
end up directly interfering with what Quebec can do in 
environmental matters? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer to the 
last question is not at all.  The federal government is here 
representing the interests of all Canadians. I articulated this 
very clearly in this legislation, in carrying out a mandate to 
protect all Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to air, water and our natural environment, we work 
in consultation and in collaboration with other levels of 
government, including provincial, and I believe that is the way 
we can most effectively protect the environment.  This government 
is committed to continuing to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also criticized as a representative of the government with 
regard to our efforts on climate change and the reduction of 
greenhouse gases.  As late as last Friday I had a very successful 
meeting with provincial and territorial counterparts from across 
the country. We discussed the very serious issue of climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agreed we would support early action to reduce greenhouse 
gases but also that we would together develop a national 
implementation strategy so that together we can find the way to 
reduce greenhouse gases, to meet our target which is to achieve a 
reduction of gases to 6% below 1990 levels.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to reduce greenhouse gases to that level in the most 
cost effective way which means that we all must work together to 
find out where there is the greatest economic advantage to our 
achieving the reductions, recognizing this is an issue that will 
not only preserve, conserve and improve our environment but will 
represent very significant economic advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the accord on harmonization I signed at the end 
of January with provinces and territories across Canada, with the 
exception of Quebec, I am still hopeful that there will come a 
day when Quebec will see that it is to its advantage as well to 
sign in with the federal government and all the other provinces 
and territories to understand that is the best way to protect our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the principles and guidelines we signed into under that 
accord recognize the jurisdictions of all levels of government. 
It does not mean devolution of authority on the part of any level 
of government.  However, the Quebec government was requesting not 
only in its words the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec in 
environmental matters, which we know is inadequate, but for the 
federal government to devolve its authorities to the province, 
and that we will not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to work in harmony with provinces and territories to 
protect our environment to the highest level but we each want to 
maintain our significant authorities to protect that environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-32. This is an 
important issue, because Quebeckers must ask themselves whether 
the federal government is trying to apply an old formula to a 
new area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important issue for Quebeckers, because they went 
through this before, in many areas. When the federal government 
gets involved in an area of provincial jurisdiction, it slowly 
changes the province's way of doing things, through the 
regulatory process. 
In doing so, it is supported by the Supreme Court, as I will 
show a little further on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers have the right and the duty to ask themselves whether 
this bill will ultimately allow Quebec to assume its 
responsibilities, and whether it will allow for the harmonious 
development of its territory and its environment. But such is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had two options regarding this 
legislation. The first one would have been to establish a 
harmonized environmental approach with the provinces. The 
harmonization agreement mentioned earlier might have given the 
impression that the government was headed in that direction. 
Unfortunately, it is now tabling the bill while invoking the 
fact that there is a harmonization agreement. However, it 
conveniently forgets to say that Quebec is not part of that 
agreement, and it forgets to say why our province is not part of 
it. 
So, the federal government decided to go ahead with its 
legislation, even though it was not able to reach an agreement 
with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know what motivated such a decision by the federal 
government in this area, and in other areas in the past. We do 
not know if it is because of the undue influence of senior 
federal officials who want to ensure they have a future in the 
public service, or if it is elected people, who say in good 
faith, as does the Minister of the Environment, that the federal 
government must regulate in this area and get involved, because 
there are all sorts of problems and issues at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is a major issue, but getting involved in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction is not the right way for the federal 
government to fulfil its role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of the greenhouse gases is very telling. 
We cannot ask the federal government to get involved in all 
sorts of areas, if it does not properly fulfil its 
responsibilities at the international level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the minister might have said earlier, I did not 
get the impression that the working session with the ministers 
last week was a success.  What the media reported was that 
Canada would have a hard time meeting its commitment and that 
some provinces had no chance of doing so at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information was not reported by journalists.  It came out 
in many of the statements by the ministers, including the 
minister from Alberta.  The leadership the government was 
wanting to assume in this sector has amounted to lip service 
only up to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They saved face in setting international standards and now, back 
home, they are wondering how they will go about it. 
As things were not solid to start with and the position of the 
Government of Canada was taken at the last minute, there is no 
consensus on this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cannot claim that the bill being debated 
at second reading has a strong foundation and that all 
governments in Canada support it, because Quebec, among others, 
has not signed the harmonization agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should understand the roles assigned by this bill.  It refers 
to a national advisory committee comprising representatives of 
both Environment Canada and Health Canada and of each province 
and to the negotiation of agreements where consensus is not 
reached.  Reference is made to two thirds in a number of 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, when they talk of two thirds, it means that 
Quebec, which has not signed the harmonization agreement and 
which may have other claims in certain sectors, may frequently 
find itself in the minority.  It has, however, had significant 
environmental successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the objectives Canada may promote 
internationally, particularly with respect to greenhouse gases, 
much is due to the fact that Quebec, through its energy choices 
and its advantages due to hydroelectricity, is helping to make 
it possible to attain these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, on the one hand, we make a positive contribution and, on the 
other, we lack the influence to act as we should with respect to 
our environment, it is obvious that Bloc members cannot approve 
this policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider it just as important to criticize the so-called 
double safety net. 
The federal government is arguing that, with two levels of 
government involved in environmental matters, the level of 
protection would be higher than if only one government was 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this old recipe has never worked anywhere. What people 
want is to know who is responsible for environmental problems, 
so that they do not have to deal with two levels of government 
and two sets of regulations allowing polluters to slip through 
the net yet again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle put forward by the federal government is not 
valid. It would have been much better to carry through to the 
end of the harmonization process in order to clarify roles. 
Before introducing this bill, the government should have made 
sure the accountability system was clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people have to assess the actions of various governments 
with regard to the environment, they need to ascertain whether 
the government acted properly and protected the environment 
adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If not, they need to determine why the protection was not 
adequate and what legislative changes are necessary, instead of 
getting entangled in the web of legal and regulatory fights 
which will be the direct result of the principle put forward by 
the federal government, namely the double safety net and the 
sharing of environmental responsibilities by both levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 29, 1998, Quebec refused to sign the harmonization 
accord. The accord is one thing, reality is another. 
It includes several cases of overlap which will lead to 
intergovernmental conflicts. This is one of the main reasons why 
Quebec did not sign the accord.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the proposed accord, there was a willingness to recognize the 
various levels of responsibility, but Quebec was denied the 
place it deserves in this area. Obviously, at the time of 
Confederation, not much thought was given to the environment, 
which has become such an important issue today. It must be 
understood that Quebeckers want to have adequate control over 
this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is present everywhere around us. It would be 
irresponsible on the part of the Quebec government to allow 
decisions to be made at another level, especially since there 
would be overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the federal government should have shown some good 
faith and goodwill before introducing this bill. Several pieces 
of legislation are slated for introduction and consideration in 
the near future, such as those dealing with endangered species, 
fisheries and environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the way the federal government has assumed its 
responsibilities in the past in the area of fisheries and in 
view of the present situation both on the Atlantic coast and on 
the Pacific coast, people may be reluctant to give the federal 
government too much power with regard to the environment, 
because a parallel can certainly be drawn between those two 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of co-ordination in managing fishery resources has 
yielded terrible results that have threatened the survival of 
entire communities. 
Fishing had been their livelihood for several decades. 
Mismanagement of our fish stocks has forced the government to 
close down certain fisheries, which is an important blemish on 
Canada's record both nationally and internationally. This 
example leads us to say that, before introducing a bill such as 
Bill C-32, before amending the Environmental Protection Act, the 
government should deal with other problems such as endangered 
species and the fisheries. These are important areas where the 
federal government has not necessarily shown its effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other irritants in this bill. Bill C-14 on water 
management is a perfect example of the contradiction that 
exists. In the harmonization agreement, the federal government 
says it will respect everyone's jurisdiction. 
This bill has been received negatively by all environmental 
stakeholders in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been meetings about this. It is quite obvious that 
drinking water is under Quebec or provincial jurisdiction. The 
introduction of Bill C-32 has confirmed our apprehension that the 
federal government will be able to justify through this another 
intrusion into several areas where there are environmental 
impacts and that are, at this time, under Quebec's jurisdiction, 
because the Quebec government can claim this jurisdiction, or 
can demonstrate that it has taken relevant steps, that this 
matter is being debated in Quebec and that people want a made in 
Quebec decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this more comprehensive piece of legislation, Quebec's 
responsibilities will be further eroded and reduced. 
We will end up with repeated regulatory and legal squabbles over 
which government is right or wrong. On this point, I think 
Quebec's concerns are justified, and we have to speak on behalf 
of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the pulp and paper industry, the Quebec government introduced 
the industrial emissions reduction program. The federal 
government may well feel the urge to take action in the same 
area. In the past, we have had to make representations. There is 
a paper mill in my riding. After my election, the first request 
made by the mill was this: Is there any possibility of 
eliminating duplication in forms to be filled out? 
Is there any possibility of avoiding having the two levels of 
government asking us the same thing?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Pulp and paper mills are affected by how rivers are managed. 
This is an issue that is linked to the environment, an area 
usually dealt with by the provincial governments in the past. 
Federal involvement in this area is not desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when we say that Quebeckers are of the opinion that 
Bill C-32 intrudes in some of Quebec's areas of jurisdiction, we 
are reporting not only the views of the ordinary citizens, but 
the views of the business community. 
If we want to ensure that Quebec will be able to react 
appropriately in the future in terms of being competitive, we 
cannot allow unacceptable environmental criteria to be set. We 
have to ensure, for example, that jurisdictional issues are 
settled and that our businesses do not have to abide by two sets 
of regulations, which is why we find the bill before the House 
very dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Rosemont said earlier that the bill provides, 
among other things, for the possible creation of national 
emissions marks for fuels. This is in direct conflict with what 
Quebec or any other province can do in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental issues are very complex issues. Since this is the 
appropriate season, let me use as an example the migration of 
snow geese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Migratory birds are covered under international law, which means 
that the federal government, in an area where it entitled to act 
on international agreements, passed an act to protect snow 
geese. Nowadays, the population has grown and has a huge impact 
on agriculture, such an impact that a compensation package had 
to be developed for farmers who suffer losses when the geese eat 
the seeds they have sown in their fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this package however, farmers are not fully compensated. 
The federal government, which is responsible for the migratory 
birds legislation, has not yet found the means whereby, through 
the Canadian Wildlife Service, we could ensure the controlled 
management of geese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It developed a model because it wanted to ensure the snow goose 
population to increase. It succeeded in this regard, but now 
seems to have lost control over the population. It seems to be 
going in a direction where there is a never ending increase of 
that population, to the detriment of our agricultural heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be important, in such an area, to harmonize action 
plans, but only after assessing the situation as a whole, and 
not through specific ad hoc actions that deal with the crisis on 
a yearly basis, but do not deal with the fundamental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example where, before giving the federal government 
the controls provided for in Bill C-21, we would want to know how 
it would manage the snow geese, which I give as an example, 
because we have some concerns about what passage of Bill C-32 
could lead to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I believe it is important point out that the 
political consequences of the passage of this bill are clear. 
If, for example, the Government of Quebec wanted to implement an 
environmental policy that would be positive and provide 
incentives, through tax credits, and the federal government were 
to adopt a punitive approach based on the Criminal Code, the 
Government of Quebec would have no choice but to comply with 
such a federal law because the supreme court, in one of its 
rulings—which was a very close one, five to four—has given a 
very wide interpretation and has given a very important national 
scope to the regulatory weight of the federal government on 
environmental issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a blatant example clearly showing that, like the leaning 
tower of Pisa, the supreme court always leans on the same side. 
In this case, a court appointed by the federal government 
arrived at a ruling by a very narrow margin, but however narrow 
the margin, this ruling gives the federal government almost 
total discretion and allows it to act as if it were the national 
government of Canada instead of the federal government. This is 
an important distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, we have a federal government and provincial 
governments. But no one should lay claim to having a mandate as 
the national government, especially not in areas that are not 
under its jurisdiction. 
If the approach taken by a province, Quebec for instance, is 
very different from the course of action chosen by the federal 
government, we could end up with a serious lack of harmony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ruling allows the federal government to prohibit pollution 
and to regulate all pollution issues. The supreme court ruling 
is clear: in case of disagreement between the federal government 
and the provinces, the federal government will always win. That 
is why it is important that we, in this House, be logical and 
use common sense to prevent passage of this bill. It should go 
back to committee, or the minister should withdraw it, so that 
the harmonization agreement can really become a reality and that 
Quebec can make its arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an area like this one, which is the way of the future, this 
ruling shows once again how centralizing the Supreme Court of 
Canada and the federal government are. It seems important to me 
that we send a clear message saying that jurisdictions must be 
respected and that henceforth Quebec should have control over 
its own environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Lac-Saint-Louis. I 
am pleased to address the House on this very important piece of 
environmental legislation, Bill C-32, a bill to renew the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, commonly known as CEPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CEPA is a comprehensive environmental protection and pollution 
prevention statute.  Since 1988 it has been the cornerstone of 
federal environmental and health protection legislation.  One of 
the most crucial components of the act allows for the control of 
toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many toxic substances do not stay put once they are released 
into the environment.  Toxic substances such as mercury and PCBs 
have been found in the blood of aboriginal people in communities 
in the high Arctic located far from industrial developments. 
These substances are transported to remote and otherwise pristine 
environments by air currents and they can have long term adverse 
health effects on the people and the wildlife that breathe air, 
drink water or consume food that contain these substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very concerned about the risks toxic substances 
pose to their health, their children's health and the long term 
sustainability of their environment.  Certainly the residents of 
my riding of Waterloo—Wellington are concerned about these 
issues and I know that is true for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 helps to reduce or eliminate this threat. It is 
important to know exactly what that is.  The good work already 
under way to identify and manage toxic substances will continue 
and the bill introduces innovations to allow more efficient and 
effective government action in carrying out these activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also incorporates in the legislation key features of the 
federal toxic substances management policy which sets out 
precautionary proactive and accountable rules for dealing with 
toxic substances.  Bill C-32 will ensure that decisions are based 
on sound science and will provide a management framework for 
dealing with toxic substances that is preventive and 
precautionary. Our aim is to take all reasonable precautions to 
reduce or eliminate the exposure of Canadians to these toxic 
substances. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 will impose new deadlines for the development of 
preventative or control actions.  It will require that the 
ministers of the environment and health propose concrete actions 
to prevent or control the release of substances within two years 
of declaring a substance to be toxic.  These preventative or 
control actions must be finalized within the following 18 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of virtual elimination is new to CEPA.  The Government 
of Canada recognized in its 1995 toxic substances management 
policy that our traditional approach of managing the release of 
toxic substances into the environment throughout their life cycle 
is not sufficient for certain toxic substances.  These substances 
that require stricter management actions result primarily from 
human activity.  They persist in the environment for long periods 
of time and they bioaccumulate, that is, the toxins are stored in 
the tissues of living creatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every minute quantity of these substances may build up over time 
to levels that cause serious long term adverse effects to the 
environment or to human health.  Once in the environment these 
substances will continue to damage our health and the health of 
our ecosystem over many generations, often through subtle effects 
on the endocrine, immune, reproductive and other sensitive 
biological systems.  Virtual elimination is necessary to protect 
our health and that of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 allows for creative approaches in controlling toxic 
substances.  This will achieve results faster and will provide 
greater flexibility.  A reactive and control management approach 
is often costly and time consuming.  In some circumstances 
traditional regulations remain the best solution.  However, they 
are only one of several tools which Bill C-32 places at our 
disposal.  These tools include pollution prevention plans, 
voluntary initiatives and economic instruments such as tradable 
permits to control toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new tools focus on environmental results rather than on 
the means by which the results are achieved.  They give operators 
the flexibility to incorporate cost effective measures that suit 
their needs without the direct intervention of government, as 
long as the required environmental protection objectives are met. 
The result is oftentimes a greater reduction in toxic emissions 
than would otherwise be achieved through traditional regulatory 
approaches.  Examples of such programs include the accelerated 
reduction and elimination of toxics challenge program that was 
launched in 1994 and a number of voluntary initiatives such as 
the Canadian automotive manufacturing pollution prevention 
project.  The recent ARET report noted that in 1996 reductions in 
releases amounted to 5,064 tonnes, a decrease of 27% from 1995 
emission levels.  Participants have reduced their emissions by 
almost 21,500 tonnes, a 61% overall reduction from base year 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can learn from the actions of other countries.  Bill C-32 
requires the federal government to review decisions and control 
actions on toxic substances taken by other countries to determine 
if they are relevant and applicable to the Canadian situation. 
The government will regularly review decisions taken by provinces 
in Canada or by member countries of the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development to ban, schedule for elimination or 
severely restrict toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to the concerns of Canadians about toxic 
substances.  This environmental legislation addresses these 
concerns.  A strengthened CEPA along with other relevant federal 
legislation and our international environmental commitments 
provide the Government of Canada with the tools and measures 
needed to protect the Canadian environment and the health of 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will continue to look after the interests 
of all Canadians. It will lead us into the next millennium with 
vision and foresight. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this House to support this legislation and to give it 
speedy passage in order to usher Canada into the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member said that there are provisions in this bill to allow for 
creative measures to improve the environment. 
I would ask him to expand on some of those creative measures.  I 
would also ask him where in this bill and what are the provisions 
for educating Canadians on environmental protection and how much 
emphasis his government has placed on education.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a municipality and a riding where in fact we take 
the environment very seriously, as do all Canadians.  I was 
thinking about how important it is for the municipalities to have 
a role, for a watershed, often a conservation authority, to have 
a role, for the provinces to have a role and for the federal 
government to have a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in terms of education that is a key component.  We 
as legislators need to ensure that people are aware, especially 
our young people, of the importance of the environment and what 
we as Canadians can do to secure it and ensure that we pass on to 
the next generation the kind of environment they should have, and 
rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage whatever efforts we can make to ensure that all 
Canadians, especially our young people, know precisely the kinds 
of efforts we need to make to ensure that our environment remains 
the best in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just 
heard the final remark by my colleague across the way, who 
wishes to pass on to the next generation a country with a clean 
environment.  But, once again, I remind him that the federal 
government wants to play a leadership role when it comes to the 
environment and says it is doing its job.  The problem is that 
the results are very different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike Quebec, the federal government has not even managed to 
attain the goals it set in Rio.  There is a problem somewhere. 
It is therefore not true that objectives are reached more easily 
with a central, federal and paternalistic government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to give the law more teeth. 
That is what the minister and public servants are telling us. 
Existing enforcement of the legislation is lagging in this 
regard.  I think that there is difficulty enforcing and 
implementing this legislation, and that there is a desire to 
give the federal government more ammunition.  I think there is a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the example of transborder movement of hazardous waste. 
Although there is legislation, it has not been possible to 
enforce it, with the result that Montreal has now become the 
black market centre for hazardous waste in Canada and even in 
North America.  So there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for my colleague opposite is as follows.  The issue 
is not the level of government, but which level of government is 
in the best position to respond to requirements and to resolve 
the actual problems.  Is that not the real issue?  The issue is 
not whether it should be the federal or the provincial 
government, but which is in the best position to address 
environmental problems. 
In many instances, the provinces are in the best position to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that the provinces are forced to meet 
their environmental commitments in addition to shouldering 
responsibilities that have been transferred from the federal 
government to the provinces.  Will my colleague opposite not 
admit that the provinces are in the best position to address 
environmental problems? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listen in amazement to 
members of the Bloc speak to jurisdictional issues.  It seems to 
me that the environment is of such grave concern and of such 
great importance to all Canadians that there is a role for all of 
us to play.  There is a role for provincial people, there is a 
role for municipal people, there is a role for conservation 
authorities and there is a role for the federal government, and 
that is a very important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard earlier the hon. member opposite talk about a lack of 
good faith, when in reality the federal government, in good 
faith, is doing the kinds of things that are required for the 
betterment of our environment and is doing so in a way that 
benefits he and I and all Canadians, no matter where they live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
the privilege of working with the committee that revised the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act in 1994.  We spent 
something like 18 months listening to witnesses from all 
segments of society and all parts of Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We travelled from one end of Canada to the other, including the 
Arctic regions.  If today we are proposing certain underlying 
principles in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, this is 
precisely because of what we heard from many Canadians across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those underlying principles are as follows: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is pollution prevention, the idea that instead of 
curing we have to prevent; that if we can stop toxic waste which 
is the biggest assault on the environment before it happens then 
all of us are healthier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the precautionary principle that we should always act 
as careful, prudent citizens, managers of the common weal.  In 
that case I refer to one of my colleagues from the Reform Party 
who talked a lot about sound science.  Let us wait until science 
is proven before we act.  I would remind him that when Rachel 
Carson wrote her famous book, <I>Silent Spring</I>, DDT was being 
used all over the place.  She did not wait for sound science to 
send warning signals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When lead was being used in our gasoline, more recently, we 
acted to ban MMT because of the threat of manganese to the 
environment and to human health.  In other words, we have to be 
precautionary.  We cannot wait for proven science to act.  We 
cannot wait until it is too late.  That is why the thrust of our 
report has been to reverse the onus of proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of us having to prove that a toxic substance is harmful 
to human health and the environment, it would be for the user of 
that toxic waste to prove that it was not harmful to the 
environment and human health.  This is why we believe in the 
principle that the polluter must always pay, must always bear the 
burden.  This is why we have also enshrined the principle of 
virtual elimination of the most hazardous toxic substances 
released into the environment so that there will be a burden on 
the polluter, on the user of toxic substances, to avoid using 
them if there is any notion at all that they could be harmful to 
health and the environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the Quebec Minister of the Environment when the first 
Environmental Protection Act was passed in 1988.  I can state 
without fear of being contradicted that my repeated 
interventions to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment are responsible for the inclusion of an equivalency 
clause in the act at that time, and I strongly believe in this 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equivalency clause means the following: if a province has an 
equivalent regulation or act dealing with any issue covered by 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, and if that province 
also has a complaint investigation system similar to that 
provided in the CEPA, the provincial regulation applies rather 
than the Canadian legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause completely demolishes the argument of my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues that this act was completely exclusive.  It 
is up to the provinces to establish regulations and a similar 
complaint investigation system. Then their act would apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important role for the federal government in the 
entire environmental area.  Today the Bloc Quebecois spoke as if 
the Constitution prevented the federal government from dealing 
with environmental matters.  Yet all the Constitution says about 
the environment is that all levels of government have a role to 
play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government, the legal entity that represents us at the 
international level, the federal government has a predominant 
role to play in the environment.  Moreover, this is what the 
Supreme Court stated in a ruling on the CEPA.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I think we should look at the present myth that there 
is no place for federal authority in environmental protection, 
that the federal authority should be lessened and reduced, or 
that the federal government should hide, should not be a leader, 
should not take leadership along with the provinces, 
municipalities and all other Canadians.  We need a system whereby 
all of us are involved.  The record shows that no one 
jurisdiction is strong enough to take care of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to many environmentalists in Quebec, in Ontario, 
in Alberta and elsewhere who have signified to me that they need 
that safety net and that they need as many jurisdictions as 
possible to be involved in the environment because at the moment 
the environment has never been looked after as sadly as today. 
Everybody is devolving.  Everybody is cutting back staff. 
Certainly the provinces are the major culprits in that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a case for instance in 1996 in Ontario, our largest 
province, our largest industrial base, when the minister invited 
industry to let her know what environmental regulations it would 
want to see in place so that they could do better business, more 
progressive business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a deluge of answers from the mining industry that 
wanted to be absolved from regulations on toxicity and effluence. 
There was an instant answer from the chemical industry that said 
it wanted to be absolved of regulations concerning illegal 
dumping of hazardous waste.  There were answers from this 
industry and that industry that said to get rid of regulations, 
that they would look after themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There brings me to the second myth, that regulations are bad for 
us, that they are a hindrance to progress and advancement, and 
that suddenly we should get rid of them.  Regulations have not 
been a hindrance to society's progress.  They have been one of 
the major catalysts for creativity, for inventions and for 
progress in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples are around us in multiple form:  the seatbelts that 
we use in our cars, the catalytic converters that we use in our 
cars, airline safety, registration of medical drugs, registration 
of pesticides and the control of toxic wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where would we be without these regulations?  Where would we be 
without a regulation that says we stop at a red light?  There 
would be chaos on our streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have the myth that regulation is bad for us, that we 
should get rid of it and look after our own territory.  This 
would be a way to chaotic non-enforcement of what really means 
the goodwill, the public trust and the common weal which 
government is supposed to look after.  Its mission is the value 
system of looking after human health, protection of the 
environment and protection of basic values in society.  The 
government is the trustee and guardian of this system.  It can 
only do so if it has a background of laws and regulations which 
enforce in fairness and with reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a strong CEPA, an active and dynamic CEPA, and a 
steadily and ceaselessly enforced CEPA.  We need a commitment 
that is there because Canadians need it and want it very badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the issues facing us as we go into the next century, the 
environmental protection case has to be the most cogent.  The 
environment is the defining issue of the next millennium.  We 
need water.  We need fresh air.  We need a safe environment so 
that human health can thrive, so that our society can live in 
peace, harmony and knowing that tomorrow will be a better day. 
How can we ensure that if chemicals and toxic wastes are being 
released into our environment without protection and without 
regulation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's dissertation by and large was 
motherhood.  He is saying that we have to keep the world clean 
and protect our environment.  I do not think anyone questions 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a little problem, though, with his philosophy that it is 
only a benevolent and all powerful federal government that can 
look after the interest of the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely in this day and age with the examples we have seen over 
the last 50 or 60 years in the world, or in Canada just within 
the last decade, of the results of federal benevolence we should 
go slowly in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that is not the main point I picked up as a point of 
dispute.  I really have a problem with people in certain branches 
of the environmental movement who use the argument that we can 
never be certain about anything before we take action, that we 
have to take a preventive stance even if we do not know what we 
are doing, just in case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me to some extent of what might have happened in a 
medieval society where after a period of ongoing crop failures 
the finger was pointed at some poor old lady in a village and 
they said she did it, that it was her fault, that she cast an 
evil spell. They were not sure.  They could not prove it so they 
played safe.  The safest thing they could do was to burn her and 
not worry about logic.  They did not worry about debate or, in 
the case of the hon. member's presentation, they did not worry 
about science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What on earth do we have highly paid experts for?  Why do we 
have universities?  Why do we have research institutes if we are 
not to take seriously both the negatives and the positives of 
their work?  Why must we get side tracked and say “It might be 
toxic.  It might be dangerous.  Therefore let's be sure. Let's 
get rid of it and do the science later?”  That is a backward way 
of operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is what is called 
an absurd argument.  I never made the case that without any 
signals or without any presumptions we should ban this and that. 
I never said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that the precautionary principle puts an onus on us to 
act when there is a very strong presumption.  Of course we do not 
act when there is no presumption at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the case of endocrine disrupters in the environment. 
Many eminent scientists in the world are finding out that because 
of the toxic effluent being released in lakes and so forth fish 
life is being changed.  There is a sort of sexual impact of great 
magnitude on populations of living species, including the human 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists in Scotland, Denmark, Canada and the United States 
have come to the same conclusion.  Do we wait until the final 
proof has been given by all the scientists of the world, by all 
the scientific bodies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the argument about global climate change.  The Leader 
of the Opposition still believes in the flat earth society. 
Although 2,500 scientists have told him there is climate change, 
he does not want to believe it.  They will wait until it is too 
late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are talking about.  We are talking about 
effective presumption and when there is presumption that we move 
and act before it is too late.

bell that man has continued along an unsustainable path.  The 
book describes the losses we may face as a society if poor 
environmental practices, pollution discharges and ecological 
degradation were to continue unchecked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague stated environmental protection is a 
requirement.  Environmental protection is not an option.  The 
original 1998 CEPA evolved because Canadians recognized something 
was wrong with the environment.  There was growing concern about 
the presence of toxic substances in the environment and the 
adverse impact on the environment from a variety of pollution 
sources and industry contributing to environmental degradation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleagues that these concerns continue today.  As 
mentioned by colleagues last week, the majority of Canadians 
believe more needs to be done to protect the environment. Science 
and technology have evolved to the point where environmental 
stewardship does not compromise profitability or contribute to 
job losses.  As my colleagues stated and I shall repeat, going 
green does not cost jobs or decrease productivity, a principle 
that the New Democratic Party has stated time and time again in 
the House and across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we embark upon the review and the restructuring of CEPA we 
should remember that recent events demonstrate there are 
environmental protection problems across Canada.  As stated last 
week Canadians are fully aware of the Plastimets in Swan Hills, 
the abandoned contaminated sites that dot the landscape from 
coast to coast to coast and the spills and accidents, some of 
which could have been prevented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the north there are contaminants in mother's milk.  What is 
wrong with this picture when entire food chains are contaminated 
and where thousand of square kilometres contaminated by man can 
be accepted as the way things are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuing to promote environment degradation through 
inaction and further studies.  We have placed economics before 
the environment.  Sustainable development is a theory, not an 
accepted and practised principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague made specific reference to the only comprehensive 
review to date on CEPA, the report tabled in 1995 by the House 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. It 
was entitled <I>It's About our Health—Towards Pollution 
Prevention</I>.  This massive report contains 141 recommendations 
to improve then Bill C-74, the predecessor to Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals refused the majority of the recommendations in the 
400 responses received by the government during the public 
review.  They ignored a consensus that more effort was needed to 
ensure the highest standards of environmental protection for all 
Canadians as a favoured response from the Liberal benches.  This 
statement does not only relate to fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent environment committee meetings demonstrate that there is 
something wrong with basic environmental standards, never mind 
the highest environmental standards.  The problem is not the lack 
of standards.  It is the reality that standards on paper or in 
bills are not being followed, implemented or enforced.  The New 
Democratic Party does not support a sole command and control 
regulatory framework as a sole parameter or measure for 
environmental protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operative measures, including sharing responsibilities 
between provincial and territorial governments, indeed all 
government levels and local governments, to ensure environmental 
protection at the highest standards can be achieved. However, 
this government appears to fully embrace the devolution of 
environmental protection and the abandonment of environmental 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been fed a line by industry and provincial 
authorities that overlap and duplication are serious problems. 
There are limited examples that this is true.  This was 
demonstrated by recent committee hearings which describe 
non-enforcement and the lack of resources by any level of 
government to enforce entire sections of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This pattern of federation devolution and no responsibility 
continues with Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians it is our duty to ensure that Canadians 
receive the environmental standards they expect, deserve and call 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, the Liberal government has demonstrated time and 
time again that the environment is not important “Let the 
provinces handle the problem; we will wash our hands clean of 
this responsibility”.  The New Democratic Party cannot support 
legislation that allows and condones further decreases in 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administrative duties section contains an alarm bell that we 
must recognize as dangerous.  Clause 2(1) makes specific 
reference to “act in a manner of intergovernmental agreements 
and arrangements entered into for the purpose of achieving the 
highest degree of environmental equality throughout Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this is a direct reference to the harmonization 
accord which was signed in January by the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments, with the exception of Quebec. This 
accord operates on a consensus basis where any province that 
protests against or declines participation with the environmental 
measures can effectively stop, delay or defer cautionary, 
preventative or proactive environmental efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province that relies on a specific industry or economic 
sector decides to not implement environmental standards for 
specific toxics or limit an industry's discharge of greenhouse 
gas emissions for example, CEPA in essence can become null and 
void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we ignore the calls by business and different levels of 
government for a level playing field when one province can decide 
that a lower level of specific standards is okay while a 
neighbouring province decides higher standards are necessary to 
protect the health and safety of its citizens and voters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to limit job raiding and promote interprovincial 
co-operation.  Why place this opportunity for squabbles on the 
table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be embarking on a climate change program, we hope, and 
the country may be held hostage by one, two or three provinces, a 
grave environmental issue that will affect all Canadians, future 
generations and the entire planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concerns are shared by environmental organizations across 
this country.  I expect we will be presented with numerous 
scenarios as the legislation passes through committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The non-protection course the Liberal government appears content 
to follow is included in various sections of the new act, as was 
the case in C-74, where specific outs and escape clauses are 
identified to provide the devolution authority this government 
cherishes. The equivalent provisions in section 10(3) states: 
“The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
environment minister, make an order declaring that the provisions 
of the regulations do not apply in any area under the 
jurisdiction of the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of Parliament and Canadians have been shocked by the 
reality that these agreements represent.  Environment departments 
across Canada have been cut as a result of deficit battles and 
transfer reductions.  The ability and capacity for environmental 
protection enforcement and monitoring has reached a critical 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government signs equivalency agreements with the 
provinces.  The provinces do not have the resources to monitor, 
inspect and enforce and environmental standards continue to 
plummet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of fisheries for example is still scrambling to 
provide water monitoring resources in Ontario after the province 
opted out of its partnering and harmonization agreement with that 
department.  The fisheries minister has waived inspection 
responsibilities in several provinces and has not provided 
reports on enforcement although this is a regulatory 
responsibility.  The provinces are not keeping DFO up to date. 
The impacts on ecosystems, such as those affected by aquaculture, 
are ignored by the federal government.  Even though there is a 
memorandum of understanding, the federal government decides not 
to enforce fisheries regulations. 
These are a few of the many examples of the highest standards 
possible, the Liberal definition.

few days after the ink is dry, it is reported that companies are 
being let off the hook.  Over 20 offences were not being acted 
upon.  We are paying that province to do our job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have mentioned improvements contained in the new 
Bill C-32.  One colleague emphasized enhanced sharing of 
responsibilities for environmental protection.  He obviously has 
not followed the committee's proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these committees, in the news, from corporate and 
provincial representation, Canadians have been fed a story of 
duplication and overlap, restrictive regulations, too much red 
tape, provincial responsibilities and jurisdictions, unfair 
representation as stated by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence presented over the past several months as Bill C-32 
drew near is a direct contradiction. There are improvements in 
the proposed legislation, legislation which this government is 
more than happy to ignore and sign off. Regulations are not being 
enforced. Pollutants are being released.  There are overworked 
staff and insufficient resources.  These are the facts. Canadians 
should not be fooled by what the paper promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, we need to proceed carefully.  We must embark 
upon this further path of devolution and harmonization.  We have 
the opportunity to create positive and constructive improvements 
in a new CEPA.  We have the opportunity to stop the devolution 
and weaker environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that the loopholes for federalist escapes are 
closed.  We must ensure that the checks and balance approach, the 
precautionary approach is maintained and not lost.  We must 
revisit the outstanding issues and committee recommendations the 
Liberal government chose to ignore in 1995.  We must consider the 
expansion of whistleblower protection to beyond the public sector 
and who we are trying to protect otherwise.  We must acknowledge 
the need for improved toxic substance identification and 
phase-out, not limited by the Liberal example and points on 
paper, but by action.  We must recall the promises made from the 
fanfare the previous environment minister made in reference to 
toxic substances, fast track one and two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bureaucracy needs five years to study less than three dozen 
carcinogens.  This record must be improved to protect the 
environment and all Canadians. Sunsets must be included to stop 
these toxic substances. We must improve the capacity for 
identification and really fast track the carcinogens issues and 
toxicity of thousands of chemicals we face in today's 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must expand the environmental registry to include real time 
access for community right to know, to avoid the Plastimets and 
the Swan Hills.  We must ensure that the readily available 
information on pesticide use on Canadian lawns and in agriculture 
is provided and is not only industry based.  We must revisit the 
ability for the environment minister to act swiftly and 
conservatively when confronted by environmental hazards, not to 
tie the minister's hands as presented in the new CEPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that the recognition and inclusion of aboriginal 
participation in the proposed advisory committee includes 
opportunities for results, not just lip service.  We must 
seriously consider an environmental bill of rights for all 
Canadians to provide equal footing for the polluters.  We must 
debate the inclusion of such rights in the charter of rights and 
freedoms.  This was the dream of author Rachel Carson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original CEPA followed a command and control regulatory 
framework.  We acknowledge that this can be improved and should 
include voluntary measures but not as a mandate to pollute. 
Studies identified that compliance occurs when there is a strong 
regulatory process and the political will to enforce the said 
legislation.  We must not follow the voluntary path.  We must 
strike a balance between regulatory efforts, enforced efforts and 
voluntary measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are differences between the original 1988 CEPA and the 
1998 CEPA. The different sciences, technologies, chemicals and 
dangers must also be acknowledged.  At the same time effective 
environmental protection and a truly sustainable path are 
possible today. 
In many instances, such as industrial discharges, corrective 
measures and controls were not readily available previously.

reason for our action.  All species suffered, the wildlife, the 
flora and the fauna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original CEPA provided an ability to act to protect the 
environment, to levy fines, to expose the polluters and support 
sustainable development beyond this generation. Bill C-32 has 
strayed from the original principles to protect and to provide 
recourse.  As parliamentarians we must ensure we return to the 
path which protects the environment first and foremost, a path 
which includes socioeconomic factors, but not at the expense of 
our future.

would like to congratulate the hon. member for Churchill River

House the new and expanded measure which refers to citizens 
actions in this bill.  This was actively advocated and advanced 
by the committee a few years ago, by the member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis. It seems to me that it is a feature in this bill 
which deserves to be highlighted.  I wonder if he would like to 
give us some of his views on that particular aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the new 
CEPA has highlighted the citizen's right to know. In terms of 
opening up the dialogue and making the communities, the workers 
and the many industries involved aware is sometimes lacking.  The 
report the hon. member has mentioned is a help.  This was a major 
recommendation which was echoed by many respondents and in many 
submissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must refer tot he whistleblower legislation as well. The new 
CEPA limits itself to federal agencies and federal employees.  It 
should be open to public input as well, the union members, dock 
members and industry members, the workers. It should raise 
awareness of the environmental impacts these industries or 
employers are practising.  This is part of the citizen's right to 
know.  This is not in the new CEPA and we should enhance that to 
protect our workers.

up the issue of human rights in Cuba.  In fact he said “I am not

failed to mention human rights even once.  It appears that he 
would like to have that little chat behind closed doors where

any discussions the Prime Minister may have had were a pure

</I></B></P><P align=left>Human rights was not the only thing the Prime Minister was 
silent on yesterday.  He just stood there as Fidel Castro 
compared the peaceful economic sanctions of Cuba to the

must not be allowed to stand.

Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that we have been engaged

Cubans on a variety of human rights matters.  We have actually 
seen some progress made.  I know that members of the Reform Party 
would not be aware of it because they do not attend to human 
rights matters.

of international standards on human rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the fact of the matter is that the economic peaceful sanctions

they are not the Holocaust, they are not genocide and they are 
not the use of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, as Fidel 
Castro said they were.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that nobody is endorsing

remarks.

effective bridges into the western hemisphere so that the kind of 
transition and changes going on in Cuba can be reinforced.

Last Thursday during the debate on his motion the hon. member for

compensation to people who are injured when there is no fault. No

Mr. Speaker, lots of consultation, lots of talk, no action.  In 
its annual report on the international drug trade the United

for drug related crime and money laundering”.  It lists Canada 
alongside Columbia as a great place to hide illegal cash.

was his eloquence that you hosted that dinner, which was a great 
success despite your early reluctance, if I may say so, to do so 
because of cost reasons.  No one could say no for long to our 
departed colleague and his many, many good causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his characteristics, which all colleagues who were here 
with him cherished, was his constant cheeriness in the face of 
adversity.  No matter how much pain he was in he always had time 
for a friendly word and laugh with every one of us or anybody who 
might work in these halls.  Only mutual respect and friendliness 
came from Father Bob. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A subject he and I never discussed was Mother Teresa, but I am 
certain she was a role model for him in his work in Brazil and 
elsewhere.  She and Robert both did much that was, to use her

shortly after the 1984 election that he was given something in 
the nature of six months to live.  Bob, even when he was health 
critic for the NDP, used to say that he was not all that fond of 
doctors.  After the diagnosis he used to say that he was going 
to try to live as long as he could to prove them wrong.  I must 
say that he proved them wrong time and time again by living until 
April 1, 1998, with all the illnesses that beset him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the biographical material on Father Bob has already been 
covered by the secretary of state, but I just want to note a 
couple of things.  He left this House not because he was 
defeated, but because he was obedient.  At that time the Pope 
made a ruling, to use speakership language rather than 
ecclesiastical language, that priests could no longer run for or 
seek elected office.  I think at the time the Pope was trying to 
deal, for better or for worse, with priests who were running for 
office in the United States and throughout Latin America, but Bob 
was caught in that net, if you like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was never any doubt in his mind as to what he would do. He 
was a priest first and if he was ordered by the Pope not to run 
again then that was his first obligation, given his vows, and he 
did not seek re-election in 1984, something which a great many of 
us regretted.  We felt at that time that the House of Commons 
lost a great member of parliament and a great servant of the 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Bob never looked back.  He went on to try to deal with the 
issues that were of concern to him in another way.  It has 
already been mentioned that he had a passion for trying to 
develop the Canadian media in a way that made them more sensitive 
to developmental problems in the third world.  He went to an 
awful lot of effort to try to set up a series of sitcoms that 
would reflect the problems people experienced in the developing 
world.  He undertook a number of other endeavours in that 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw Bob, of course, not just as a fellow New Democrat, but 
also as a fellow Christian who was influenced by liberation 
theology and by the effect that the global economy and global 
capitalism was having on the poor in the third world.  Bob was 
inspired by that and by his experience in Brazil where he saw 
what was actually happening to people.  He came back here to 
embrace a political tradition that he thought was the most 
faithful to what he had learned there and what he had learned as 
a Roman Catholic priest.  He applied that without fear or favour, 
even when it came to the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not say this, and I think Bob would 
want me to say it, even though it might not make some people 
happy.  Throughout his life he considered himself to be pro-life. 
He considered himself to be a foe of the enemies of life wherever 
he found them, whether he found them in Brazil, whether he found 
them in global capitalism, whether he found them in nuclear 
weapons or whether he found them in the phenomenon of abortion. 
He would often get up in this House and say that he was in favour 
of life and that caused him to take a view which he saw as 
consistently pro-life, being against nuclear weapons, being 
against an economic system that ground the faces of the poor, to 
use a biblical expression, and being against capital punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We lost a great member of parliament in 1984 and we lost an even 
greater Canadian this spring when Father Bob finally succumbed to 
his illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues I would like to extend our sympathy 
to his family and in particular to his sister, Mary Lou, whom I 
knew and who was a great support to him over the years.  He will 
be greatly missed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to pay tribute to Reverend Bob Joseph Ogle 
who served as the NDP member of parliament for Saskatoon East 
from 1979 to 1984.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned, he died on April 1 after a long battle with cancer. 
As a former MLA for the Rosetown—Elrose constituency, I had the 
privilege of meeting Bob Ogle on a number of occasions.  He was 
born in Rosetown.  I am told in visiting there it was a very 
proud day for the town of Rosetown when he was ordained priest in 
the town of his birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although he is best known in his native province, this great 
humanitarian's dedicated approach to human life and human justice 
gained him international recognition.  His philosophy for which 
he was so respected can best be summed up by what he said on the 
day of his nomination, September 17, 1977: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all human rights are all of a piece; ignore one 
right and you jeopardize all the others.  That is why a single 
issue approach to rights will not work.  If we are really 
pro-life we have to protect human life, from conception through 
to death. This requires an active, lifelong concern for a just 
social system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues in the official opposition, and I 
well recognize all the members of this House, I pay my respect to 
a missionary, to a world traveller, to an author and a renowned 
Canadian politician.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to join with all of the parties in this House to pay tribute to 
Bob.  I arrived here in 1984, and he left in 1984, so I did not 
have the opportunity to sit with him, but I have often heard 
reference made to the spirit of social commitment he brought to 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He sat here until 1984. A priest, he had to leave because the 
Vatican decided that priests should no longer be members of any 
parliament. Out of obedience to the Pope he gave up his 
political career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His career was in fact four careers. First of all, he was an 
influential priest. 
He was also an extremely devoted missionary, a highly 
conscientious politician, and later a committed writer. He 
served in Brazil, Africa and Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember his years in politics mainly for his committed 
defence of the right to life.  He spoke often on euthanasia, 
capital punishment and abortion.  He constantly fought for the 
right to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also had a great belief in the media and felt they had a 
vital role to play in raising public awareness of social 
injustice. After his departure from politics, even during his 
serious illness, he continued to speak his mind regularly in the 
press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was the recipient of numerous honours in recognition of his 
abilities and commitment. These included honourary degrees, the 
Order of Canada and the Order of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He inspired numerous religious leaders in his home province and 
throughout Canada. 
The premier of his province said of him “He devoted his life to 
helping others, and acquired an international reputation as a 
man with a social conscience, committed to peace, justice and 
the fight against poverty”, while church authorities in Rome 
commented that no one could better incarnate the vision and 
spirit of the Vatican II ecumenical council than Father Ogle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I offer my most sincere 
condolences to all his family, his friends and his party.

members of the Progressive Conservative caucus join in expressing 
our sympathy to the family of Father Bob Ogle, both his immediate 
family as well as his religious and spiritual family. 
Reverend Bob Joseph Ogle died on April 1 in Saskatoon after a 
courageous and hard fought 15 year battle with cancer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The 69 year old priest was also a well known missionary, 
politician and author.  In 1979 he became the first Saskatchewan 
priest to be elected as member of parliament representing the New 
Democratic Party in Saskatoon East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Father Ogle is reported to have taken as his personal message a 
verse from Isaiah: “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew 
their strength.  They shall mount up with wings as eagles”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His conscientious work as a priest and as a member of the House 
gives ample witness to his dedication to his beliefs and to the 
people he represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We give thanks for his service in the House.  He did indeed fly 
like an eagle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our sympathies to the family of Reverend Bob Joseph Ogle. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, from time to time I 
permit myself an intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served with Bob Ogle for a number of years.  Every so often he 
would pop in when he was in Ottawa just to say hello.  Perhaps 
I might tell you two little stories about him to highlight the 
kind of man he was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became Speaker he wrote me a note asking if I would host 
a dinner, as mentioned by the hon. minister earlier.  I was not 
too keen on hosting the dinner.  I do not know if members know 
the term being cadged, but it is similar to being conned. He used 
to con me regularly.  He was in my outer office and my secretary 
came in and said there was a person to see me, a Reverend Bob 
Ogle.  I asked what he wanted.  She said “I think he wants you 
to host a dinner”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He came in and he looked awfully healthy standing there. 
“Bob”, I said, “how are you doing?”  He said “I am dying”. 
I said “You have been dying for the past 10 years.  What is it 
you want?”  He said “Seeing as it could be my last supper, will 
you host that dinner?”  So I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another story about him.  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona mentioned that he was first and foremost a 
priest.  When he was thinking of leaving we were over in the 
Confederation Building.  I was not part of this conversation. It 
was reported to me.  One member said to him “You know, Bob, you 
have been so successful here; you have been successful in 
everything you have been doing.  How can you just leave?  How can 
you just walk out like that?”  He is reported to have said “I 
was not called to be successful; I was called to be faithful”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob Ogle was faithful to his principles.  In my view he was a 
good priest.  He was a good Canadian.  More important I guess 
than all of those things, he was a good man and we as Canadians 
can always do with good men.  We are going to miss him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will now go to tributes for another member who shared with us, 
Mr. Carlo Rossi, a member of the Liberal Party.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE CARLO ROSSI 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the Easter break, we 
learned the sad news that our former colleague, Carlo Rossi, had 
passed away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of knowing Carlo. Almost everyone was on a 
first-name basis with him. To all his colleagues in this House 
and the community at large, he was an affable man and a friend 
to all. Carlo was always there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was privileged to know him before being elected myself to this 
place. As a police detective, he was a distinguished member of 
the Montreal Italian community. 
Carlo Rossi's name was already known in this House before he was 
first elected to this place in 1979 to represent the riding of 
Bourassa, which encompasses Montréal-Nord in the greater Montreal 
area. He represented this riding until 1988.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first set foot here as a new member in 1984, Carlo had 
just been appointed deputy whip. Like everyone who comes to 
Ottawa for the first time, I was a little lost. Carlo was there 
to advise us, to help us find our way and play our role as 
members of parliament. He did so with patience and eloquence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me the most during my first few months here, in 
Ottawa, was the fact that, as busy as he was as deputy whip—having 
been a whip myself for a number of years, I am familiar 
with the difficulties and time demands of such a position here on 
Parliament Hill—Carlo never forgot his riding. Not only did 
Carlo spend weekends in his riding, as most of us do, trying to 
be everywhere at once, but he managed to attend six or seven 
events between Saturday night and Sunday. He was everywhere. Even 
during the week, when he was asked to by an organization in his 
riding, he would take the train to Montreal, but the next morning 
he was back here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he was a truly remarkable member of Parliament, a 
member who not only took part in every debate in this House and 
fulfilled his responsibilities as deputy opposition whip, but 
also represented his riding well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know Carlo had a tremendous voice.  We all know how this 
House can be noisy, especially during question period. Despite 
all the noise, the voice of Carlo would just come out. Everybody, 
whether on the opposition benches or the government benches, 
would hear Carlo.  Every Wednesday an hon. member leads in the 
singing of our national anthem to open the House.  If Carlo were 
among us, he would lead that singing of O Canada. He was a good 
Canadian.  He loved his family.  He loved his community.  He was 
very well respected.  He loved this place and I am sure we will 
all miss him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of meeting with him once in a while. 
Although he was no longer an elected MP, when he attended social 
and civic functions people and organizations would call on him 
for help. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will miss Carlo. On behalf of the Prime Minister, my Liberal 
colleagues and I think all members of this House, I would like 
to extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Raymonde, his 
children, Chantal and Roberto, his grandchildren and all the 
other members of his family. We will all miss Carlo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the official 
opposition is honoured to pay tribute to Carlo Rossi, who passed 
away April 11, 1998.  Carlo came to the House of Commons in 1979. 
He sat as the member for Bourassa for nearly 10 years.  In his 
previous life he was a dedicated police officer with a career 
distinguished by fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His word was his bond in police work.  I was fascinated to hear 
the story of how he would negotiate with hostages.  If he had 
given his word to a criminal who had taken a hostage, that word 
was good.  If he made a promise he stood by that promise. He 
brought the same basic rules of fairness to his work here in 
parliament.  Members have told me that when he made a deal 
it was in fact a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a decorated police officer he brought a fresh perspective to 
parliament, a perspective that showed how closely he had dealt 
with both criminals and victims alike. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Rossi was an ideal politician, with his experience as a 
police officer and his life experience, without the restrictions 
imposed by political parties. On behalf of my party I would 
like to extend our condolences to his family. This is a great 
loss to Montreal and to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had the 
honour and the pleasure of sitting with Mr. Rossi from 1984 to 
1988. When I arrived here as a Conservative member in 1984 
there were many of us, and I found myself sitting on this side 
of the House with the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Rossi would rise to speak with his powerful voice, I 
must admit that he did not look like an easy person to approach. 
I saw him for a few weeks, without getting to know him any 
better. Then one day I met him in an elevator and discovered a 
totally different person. Here was a charming and very polite, 
distinguished and friendly man, interested in getting to know 
his fellow members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that encounter I shared many meals in the cafeteria 
with him and also with his colleague, Mr. Malépart, who has 
unfortunately left us too. Mr. Rossi had been in the military 
and he also had a distinguished career as a police officer. He 
was feared and respected as a criminal investigator, and he was 
instrumental in capturing some very well known and astute 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also discovered that he was a man of culture. He sat on the 
culture and communications committee. His comments were very 
much to the point and all members, regardless of their political 
stripes, would listen carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also very involved at the social level, perhaps as a 
result of the influence of his colleague, Mr. Malépart. I 
remember the fight that he led, along with his friend, Mr. 
Malépart, following the first Conservative budget regarding, 
among other issues, the indexation of old age pensions. 
When these two took the floor the House shook not because 
there were shouts, but because of the heartfelt arguments that 
were put forward, arguments that had been conveyed to them by 
the public in the numerous meetings and functions that they 
attended in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>War veterans chose Mr. Rossi as their spokesperson. At the time 
veterans had many demands about health care and other issues 
and they would always go to him because he was a former police 
officer. They recognized him as an honest and just man, as a man 
capable of standing up for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Rossi was also very comfortable with new Canadians. He was 
well known among Montreal's allophone population. He could speak 
several languages fluently, which is not the case of many of us 
here. 
He was very comfortable with all minorities from the Montreal 
region, and he had warm and frequent contacts with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On my behalf, and on behalf of my party and my colleagues, I 
wish to offer to his wife and two children my most sincere 
condolences. I also offer my sympathies to the constituents of 
Bourassa whom he served so well and to his party which he 
served so well.

I too would like to pay tribute to Carlo Rossi on behalf of my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served in the House with Mr. Rossi from 1979 to 1988 and I 
remember him well.  I remember the voice and I remember the 
lively heckling of which he was capable from time to time between 
himself and particularly other Quebec MPs of different political 
persuasions.  We all know how lively that can be.  Carlo Rossi 
was particularly good at it.  He always had a sort of mischievous 
twinkling smile on his face whenever he was engaged in that kind 
of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not someone whom I knew well but he is certainly someone 
whom I served with in the House.  I pay tribute to his work as a 
member of parliament, to his work before he came here as a police 
officer, to his skill as a negotiator, and to his reputation as 
someone who was honest and fair and could be relied on in his 
work with everyone he dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make special mention of the fact that as a police officer it 
was significant in 1987 when he changed his mind with respect to 
capital punishment. 
I remember that debate very well.  It was a difficult but 
exciting time for the House of Commons.  There was a free vote 
coming.  It was a significant decision that the House was to 
make.  People were under a lot of pressure one way or another, 
depending on which position they were already holding and 
depending on who expected them to do what.

punishment to someone who opposed it.  I pay tribute to him for 
that as well.

examples to all of us.  His community was always a priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I guess it is a sign of my age but I 
served with both of the gentlemen who were mentioned earlier 
today. I served with Carlo Rossi.  It was mentioned that he was a 
man of his word.  Something that was not mentioned was that he 
was the chief negotiator for hostage takings in Montreal. 
Whenever there were hostage takings they would call on Carlo 
Rossi and he would go in and negotiate with the people.  He was a 
man of great courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1972 members may recall the Olympics in Munich, Germany, when 
hostages were taken, citizens of Israel, and were shot almost 
summarily by terrorists.  It was not known to me until one night 
when we were talking that Carlo Rossi was in charge of the 
security at the Olympics of 1976 in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. minister of public works mentioned Carlo's voice. Yes, 
it was a voice that carried.  I recall one time, when we used to 
work out in the Confederation Building, that I heard someone 
singing Christmas carols.  I went in to get changed and there was 
only one person there.  It was Carlo and he was getting dressed. 
I said “Carlo, who was the fellow who was singing in here?” He 
said  “It was me”.  I said “Come on, you can't sing like 
that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About two weeks later I heard him sing Ave Maria at the 
Christmas party.  I know many of you were not here at the time. 
It was such a beautiful rich voice from a beautiful and in many 
ways very rich man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad I had a chance to serve with him.  You would have 
enjoyed him.  He was a good member of parliament.  He will be 
missed.

<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-394, an act respecting the 
commercialization of VIA Rail Canada Inc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say this is a very timely 
bill but I would be incorrect if I said that.  In actual fact it 
should have been introduced a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>VIA Rail loses hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  The 
target it introduced in its latest annual statement indicated 
that it would be able to bring it down to about $200 million a 
year.  That is about as far down as VIA can get it.  That is over 
half a million dollars a day.  It is time we put an end to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is timely in one sense.  It seems ironic that I am 
introducing a bill that will seek to stop the erosion of 
taxpayers' money by over half a million dollars a day on the eve 
of the day that we are to vote on compensation for hepatitis C 
victims.  The government is saying it does not have sufficient 
money.  This might be a good way to take it toward that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has another effect, that is to prevent something that is very 
serious, a predator move by VIA Rail in the past against the 
private sector at a time when we are looking at public-private 
partnerships as a way out of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not tremendous detail in the bill other than to provide 
a directive toward its disposal.  I leave it to the House and to 
the committee when it reaches the committee stage to add the 
details necessary for the betterment of all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for the very 
succinct intervention.  I meant timely.  I am glad he did not go 
into detail.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK199">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-32, an 
act respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the 
environment and human health in order to contribute to 
sustainable development, be read the second time and referred to 
committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
speak this afternoon to Bill C-32, a bill that aims to prevent 
pollution and protect the environment and human health in order 
to contribute to sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, on December 15, 1995, the Liberal 
government proposed revising the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.  The proposal by the Minister of the Environment 
at the time was the government's response to the fifth report of 
the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development entitled “It's About our Health—Towards Pollution 
Prevention”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report set out the broad lines of a proposal to renew the 
federal government's main legislative measure on environmental 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's position on this report was as follows: most of the 
recommendations supported the centralizing tendency of the 
federal government in environmental protection matters.  I quote 
what the Bloc said at the time: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois refutes the theory of the double safety net 
and contends that the environment would be better served if 
responsibility for its protection were given to one level of 
government only. 
The Bloc Quebecois firmly believes that the provinces, including 
Quebec, have greater knowledge of the specifics of their natural 
environment and are in a position to arouse the interest and 
encourage the participation of local residents, are more open to 
the claims of environmental groups, are able to conclude 
significant agreements with national and international partners 
and have indicated their desire to find solutions to 
environmental challenges and to contribute actively to 
sustainable development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 was introduced at first reading on March 12, 1998. It 
is designed to renew the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
This bill, formerly Bill C-74, which died on the Order Paper in 
the last Parliament, provides for a five year review, and time 
has already expired. I also remind the House that this is a 
promise contained in the Liberal red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, pollution prevention becomes a national 
objective. This bill replaces the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. 
Among other changes are provisions to implement pollution 
prevention, new procedures for the investigation and assessment 
of substances and new requirements with respect to substances 
that the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health 
have determined to be toxic. The list of these substances is 
very extensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides new powers for investigators and new 
mechanisms for the resolution of a contravention. It also 
specifies criteria for courts to consider for sentencing. In 
addition, like the provinces and territories, aboriginal 
governments are provided the right of representation on the 
national advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While, in theory, Bill C-32 recognizes the environment as a 
shared responsibility between the federal government and the 
provinces, in reality, this bill does not delegate any power to 
any province, including Quebec, which, of course, is contrary to 
what true environmental harmonization between the various levels 
of government should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is designed to reinforce the federal government's 
supremacy with regard to environmental protection. Therefore, 
this bill opens the door to a duplication of federal and 
provincial powers. On this subject, the government even dares to 
hide behind the last ruling concerning the environment made by 
Ottawa's very own leaning tower of Pisa, namely the Supreme 
Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leaning tower of Pisa considered a case 
involving Hydro-Quebec. 
I remind the House that this case has always been challenged by 
Quebec and that all the various courts who heard the case, 
including the Quebec Court of Appeal, concluded that the federal 
order was not valid. Only the Supreme Court of Canada, this 
leaning tower of Pisa, in its vision of unity, overruled the 
rulings made by Quebec courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 contains a number of new items. For example, it 
replaces the federal-provincial committee provided for in the 
current legislation with a new national advisory committee. This 
committee is made up of a representative from Environment 
Canada, one from Health Canada, one from each province and 
territory and up to six native representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will advise both federal ministers on the development of 
regulations, the management of toxic substances and other issues 
of mutual interest. 
The provinces will advise the federal minister through this 
national advisory committee. In fact, the bill provides for 
co-operation agreements on such activities as inspections, 
investigations and the gathering of information for monitoring 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes provisions for native governments, which will 
enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as the provincial and 
territorial governments, including the right to sign 
administrative work-sharing agreements and equivalency agreements 
with the federal government. Native governments will also have 
to be consulted over environmental issues affecting their 
territory. Up to six representatives will sit on the national 
advisory committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides for better public participation and 
better protection for those who report violations of the law. 
These individuals will be able to take part in the decision 
making process by submitting to the environment minister 
comments or notices of objection following some decisions and to 
ask the minister to investigate alleged violations of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals can ask that their names not be disclosed. The 
legislation will protect employees who report violations of the 
federal legislation. Under the bill, individuals will be able to 
bring action for damage to the environment when the federal 
government is not enforcing the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to public information, the law will no longer be 
limited to data published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. The law will 
create a new public registry containing all the environmental 
information published under the act such as rulings and 
regulations. This registry will supplement the National 
Pollutant Release Inventory set up in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for prevention of pollution, it will become a national goal. 
The bill creates the authority to request pollution prevention 
plans in respect of substances listed as toxic under the act. 
Courts will be able to request pollution prevention plans or 
emergency environmental plans and research on the 
environmentally friendly use and elimination of the substances 
involved in the alleged offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act also creates a national pollution prevention 
information clearing house, which will enable the industry to 
share its expertise and technical know-how with respect to 
pollution prevention activities. 
Moreover, the new act provides for the setting up of a reward 
program recognizing the industry's voluntary efforts to prevent 
pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to biotechnological products, the bill creates a 
federal safety net and the authority to regulate the safe and 
efficient use of biotechnology for environmental purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding clean water, the bill seeks to protect the marine 
environment from land-based or airborne sources of pollution. It 
is also aimed at limiting what can be disposed of at sea by 
listing harmless materials; people wishing to carry out 
disposals at sea will have to prove it is the best solution 
possible and that what is to be disposed of in such a manner 
cannot be reused or recycled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government feels that the bill will allow 
co-operation with the United States and other countries in order 
to prevent or limit transborder marine pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 will also increase the power of the government to 
regulate fuels and fuel additives.  Imported fuels and fuels 
crossing provincial and territorial boundaries will have to meet 
certain requirements.  The bill will give the government the 
authority to establish national fuels marks, thereby identifying 
those that meet the environmental criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as international air pollution is concerned, the 
government wants to treat other countries the way Canada itself 
is treated. 
Should a country not give Canada rights similar to those granted 
to that country by Canada, the federal minister may intervene in 
the event of international air pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To protect the atmosphere, Bill C-32 provides for the 
establishment of national marks for emissions meeting the 
standards.  It contains provisions to limit emissions from motor 
vehicles in general, including pleasure craft, construction 
equipment, farm machinery, snow blowers and lawn mowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the bill gives the federal government more control over 
the transborder movement of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, 
including household garbage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to deal with this bill in regard to the 
environmental harmonization agreement, which is a crucial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of certain facts. On January 
29, 1998, Quebec refused to sign the environmental harmonization 
agreement proposed by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment. During the meeting of the council, Quebec 
environment minister Paul Bégin refused to sign the agreement 
until the federal government agreed to meet the conditions set 
by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those conditions include recognition of Quebec's exclusive or at 
least primary jurisdiction in the areas assigned to the 
provinces by the Constitution, the firm commitment by the 
federal government to pass the legislative amendments required, 
and of course the adoption by Quebec and the federal government 
of a bilateral agreement on environmental assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the January 29, 1998 press release by 
the Quebec Minister of the Environment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Bégin also stressed that the declared intentions of the 
federal government as to the review of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, which review would lead to a 
significant increase in federal powers, contravene the spirit 
and objectives of the environmental harmonization negotiation 
process, particularly that of preventing duplication and 
intergovernmental disputes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position of Minister Bégin reinforced the position taken by 
the Bloc Quebecois in its dissenting report of December 1997. 
I will remind the House that, in its dissenting report, the Bloc 
Quebecois opposed the report of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development regarding environmental 
harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that on November 20, 1996, the Canadian 
Council of Ministers of the Environment agreed in principle with 
the Canada-wide environmental harmonization agreement and with 
two subsidiary agreements on inspections and standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subsidiary agreement on environmental assessments was 
negotiated during the winter of 1997. This agreement was to 
enhance environmental protection in a sustainable development 
context, while respecting each government's jurisdiction, in a 
more effective way. 
It was to have contained the general principles to be 
implemented more specifically through subsidiary agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always supported harmonization between 
the federal and provincial governments when it would serve to 
eliminate administrative and legislative overlap and duplication 
between two levels of government.  We therefore supported 
environmental harmonization so long as it did not serve to 
screen the federal government's continued meddling in provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harmonization must recognize the provinces' exclusive or at 
least primary jurisdiction in areas accorded them under the 
Constitution.  The spirit of harmonization should be felt on the 
amendments the government will make to existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also made a number of recommendations.  I will 
refer to a number of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee first recommended that ratification of the 
agreement and the three subsidiary agreements be postponed, 
first until all documents—the agreement and the 10 subsidiary 
agreements proposed—were available so the public would have a 
real opportunity to contribute and, second, until the 
committee's concerns and recommendations had been fully 
considered.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, there is already a little problem there. As for 
Recommendation No. 5, the committee recommended that the 
consensus requirement in the agreement and subsidiary agreements 
be replaced with a two-thirds majority vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to these two recommendations, the Bloc Quebecois 
said it believed it was premature for the federal government and 
the provinces to endorse the harmonization agreement and 
subsidiary agreements and for the committee to report to the 
House of Commons because we had not had the opportunity to 
observe any real desire on the part of the Liberal government to 
harmonize with the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois expressed the opinion that it might be better 
to wait until the endangered species bill, the fisheries bill 
and the Canadian environmental protection legislation had been 
introduced. The Bloc Quebecois added that we would be able to 
fully assess the harmonization agreement when considering these 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before considering any new subsidiary agreements, the Bloc 
Quebecois indicated it might be best for the federal government 
and the provinces to deal first with the three existing 
agreements on environmental assessment, inspection and 
standards. In addition, we proposed that the agreements be 
ratified by a unanimous vote instead of a two-thirds majority 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to touch on Recommendation No. 9. The 
committee recommended that a provision be included in the 
environmental assessment agreement stating that it will not 
require any changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act. 
The subsidiary agreement should also specify that the objectives 
and requirements of the environmental assessment should meet the 
strictest standards and should meet or exceed the prescribed 
objectives and requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recommendation was contrary to the principles of the 
general agreement, which states that governments may change 
their respective legislation as required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Bloc Quebecois believed that only the Quebec 
environmental assessment process should be applied in Quebec. 
The federal government's willingness to achieve harmonization 
was supposed to be reflected in the legislation, and we 
considered that Bill C-14, an act respecting the safety and 
effectiveness of materials that come into contact with or are 
used to treat water destined for human consumption, did not 
reflect this spirit of legislative harmonization between the 
federal government and the provinces. On the contrary, we 
thought it was another intrusion by the federal government in an 
area under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois was of the opinion that several 
recommendations in the Liberal majority report were contrary to 
Quebec's historic positions in the area of federal-provincial 
harmonization and that recent interference by the federal 
government did not respect the spirit of the accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois deplores is that the federal government 
refuses to transpose in the legislation its good intentions with 
regard to environmental harmonization and chooses instead to 
hide behind the centralizing screen of our own leaning tower of 
Pisa, namely the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois, although very concerned with 
environmental issues, cannot support this bill.

provinces.  He made this point several times in several ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hamilton is near my riding.  Some months past there was a 
disastrous fire at a company called Plastimet. Thousands of 
tonnes of recycled plastic in bales went up in flames, right in 
downtown Hamilton, spilling into the atmosphere dioxins, furans, 
all kinds of toxic smoke.  The fire went on for more than 24 
hours.  Some people were made sick by the fire.  The water table 
was contaminated and so on.  It was a disastrous fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the probe into this fire goes on, it becomes clear that the 
Ontario government failed in its responsibilities to ensure that 
the recycling firm was obeying proper standards of protection to 
make sure such a fire did not occur.  Perhaps not in Quebec but 
certainly in Ontario the Ontario government is withdrawing in 
every direction from environmental protection.  It is getting out 
of the field entirely.  It is cutting money from environmental 
protection.  It is laying off staff and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the member for Portneuf, whom I respect 
greatly indeed, had the Plastimet fire occurred in Ottawa or in 
some community next to the Ottawa River, and that smoke had 
spilled over into Quebec and if those dioxins and that 
contamination had gone into the Ottawa River, that fire would 
have affected and poisoned regions in Quebec as well as regions 
in Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that, I wonder how the member can possibly feel that 
provincial jurisdiction exclusively held in matters of the 
environment would be a protection to Quebec when Ontario is 
abandoning its responsibilities.  Does he not agree that a strong 
national law is precisely what all Canadians need in the event 
that any province does not fulfil its responsibilities to the 
environment as is the case in Ontario just now? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, I can well 
understand the concerns of my hon. colleague. His concerns are 
healthy and justified.  If we use such reasoning, however, are 
we to conclude that, because acid rain from the United States 
will affect Quebec's lakes, trees and farms, the Canadian 
legislation should also look to seeing that the United States 
does its duty properly?  But no, we understand very well that 
some states will not take their responsibilities seriously 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then steps will have to be taken to encourage them to do so, as 
Quebec and Canada have done with our American neighbours, in 
order to raise their awareness of such things as their acid gas 
emissions which are carried onto Quebec territory by a 
combination of winds, clouds and rain.  Like it or not, the 
prevailing winds carry acid rain to Quebec.  Our maple syrup 
producers have had problems, as their trees were affected. Our 
lakes have suffered, and lime has had to be added to allow fish 
to live in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec and Canada have made representations to the Americans, 
who have seen to it that corrective measures have been put in 
place. There is much still to be done, mind you, but at least 
they have finally taken their duty as a government to heart. 
I am sure that a province like Ontario, rich and responsible as 
it is, is in a position to shoulder responsibility, provided it 
knows that no one else is going to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will note that Quebec does not necessarily want exclusive 
control over environmental issues on its territory.  It wants 
greater power, a priority.  It does, however, admit that pooled 
efforts, a partnership with the rest of Canada, since we must 
call a spade a spade, would be highly desirable. 
As a matter of fact, such partnership should eventually apply to 
every NAFTA country in order to have uniform environmental 
standards so that all industries and businesses are equally 
respectful of the environment, and provide for environmental 
impacts in their production costs, thus enabling them to sell 
their products at competitive prices while respecting the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short what we are talking about here is bringing 
environmental responsibilities closer to the decision making 
centres that are in the best position to assume them. Ottawa 
will not be able to tell Mexico how to deal with its 
environmental problems. Mexicans will be able to do it 
themselves. 
We must talk, in a respectful manner, and, in this regard, 
Quebec with its environment ministry and the necessary 
infrastructure to protect the environment is in a very good 
position to play an important role. Essentially, this is what 
Mr. Bégin, the Quebec minister said, and this is what I have 
ever so humbly repeated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I simply wish 
to make a short comment following the question put by the hon. 
member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about provincial governments being irresponsible and 
offloading their responsibilities. I want him to look at the 
results of his own government in the environmental sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have been telling us all day long that their 
government is always concerned about environmental issues. 
However, they said very little about the objectives that were 
not reached in Kyoto, after being agreed to in Rio. Not only 
that, they also remained silent on the cuts made in recent years 
in the Department of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member opposite aware that the budget of the Department 
of the Environment was reduced by 40%? These cuts were imposed 
by his own Minister of Finance and his government. Is the 
government aware that claiming to be concerned with the 
environment is not enough, and that such a claim must be 
supported by concrete measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example. In Quebec alone, 60% of the 1997-98 
budget of $1,329,000 for inspection and investigation activities 
was used to implement the act and avoid environmental disasters. 
The other 40% of that $1.3 million was wasted on all sorts of 
administrative procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government opposite not at all concerned with 
the environment since it reduces its budget, it also shows that 
the department is poorly managed and that it is far from meeting 
Quebeckers' environmental needs and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague's comment is 
quite relevant. We can pass all the legislation we want. That is 
quite easy. We can discuss bills, pass them, and say they should 
be enforced. But if officials are deprived of the financial and 
material resources and the infrastructure they need, they will 
not be able to enforce the legislation adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the environment has not been a priority for 
this government, despite all it can say. We have to admit Kyoto 
has not been the resounding success Canada could have shared in 
as a full partner. It got involved at the last minute and played 
a lacklustre role, which comes as no surprise, since we do not 
meet our environmental goals, particularly concerning greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
We are well behind our stated objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we will someday stop dragging our feet. Quebec wants 
to go ahead and does not want to be restricted by a federal 
bureaucracy that has not served its interests too well, 
generally. Quebec has already all it takes to assume full 
responsibility in this area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take this opportunity today to 
speak to Bill C-32 to replace the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill, as my colleague, the Minister of the 
Environment, pointed out, because it changes the approach to 
environmental protection in Canada from one of reacting to one of 
preventing pollution and damage to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the overall evolution of the environment, it 
becomes obvious that we must change our way of looking at things 
and start with pollution prevention rather than waiting for 
damage to occur and then reacting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1960s and 1970s, Canadians throughout the country began 
demonstrating a growing interest in the environment. 
They began to become worried about the present, as well as the 
potential or future, effects of pollution on their environment 
and their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, governments adopted relatively effective and 
rational strategies for the time, generally in the form of 
regulations to control pollutants after they had been created, 
but before they were released into the environment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, businesses improved their operating methods, based 
on the technologies then available.  Basically, our philosophy 
of environmental management consisted in allowing pollutants to 
be created and trying to control them as best we could 
thereafter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, from a historical perspective pollution control has 
been the main approach to environmental protection.  It is true 
that by limiting the release of pollutants into the environment 
we have made a significant contribution to environmental 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of the Environment told us in her speech, we 
have acted on some of the most dangerous toxins:  PCBs, benzine, 
dioxins and furans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that more needs to be done.  We are now much more 
aware of the impacts on human health and on the environment 
caused by every small amounts of substances that are toxic, that 
accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and persist in 
the environment for very long periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons we have to shift our approach from pollution 
control to pollution prevention.  The Liberal Party's first red 
book summarized the challenge facing Canada in precise terms.  It 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, environmental policy has focused on managing and 
controlling the release of pollutants entering the environment. 
This approach has had only limited success.  Canada needs a new 
approach that focuses on preventing pollution at source— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will use the upcoming five-year review of 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to make pollution 
prevention a national goal— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 does exactly this and incorporates pollution 
prevention as one of its guiding principles. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, so that all stakeholders are aware of the rules of 
the game, we must provide a clear and accurate definition of 
pollution prevention.  The bill gives the following definition 
of prevention, arrived at after a variety of stakeholders were 
consulted.  The proposed definition is as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of processes, practices, materials, products or energy 
that avoid or minimize the creation of pollutants and waste and 
reduce the overall risk to the environment or human health. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could not be clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, pollution prevention requires a totally different 
approach from environmental protection. It implies on-site reuse 
and recycling of materials, changes to existing equipment and 
employee training. It calls for a complete overhaul of our way 
of designing and operating our manufacturing plants, our oil 
refineries, our mines, our farms, our parks, everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Planning is at the heart of the pollution prevention approach. 
Under Bill C-32, a person can be required to prepare a pollution 
prevention plan concerning toxic substances. Pollution 
prevention on a voluntary basis in many other areas is also 
encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they are preparing these prevention plans, managers can 
determine ways to avoid creating pollutants and waste or to 
reduce them to a minimum. 
They can also find ways to save energy and water and to use raw 
materials more efficiently. The preparation of pollution 
prevention plans provides the businesses with the flexibility 
they need to develop pollution prevention approaches based both 
on their needs and on environmental goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 supports pollution prevention planning by providing to 
establish a national pollution prevention information clearing 
house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the government has already moved to establish 
the Internet based Canadian pollution prevention information 
clearing house to showcase environmental success stories and to 
demonstrate the economic benefit that can be achieved through the 
adoption of pollution prevention. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to increasingly encourage Canadian companies to take the 
initiative. Bill C-32 creates awards to celebrate achievements 
toward pollution prevention.

throughout the years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To attract progress on the success of pollution prevention 
initiatives this bill includes information gathering powers that 
require industry to report on pollution prevention activities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill, because it will help all of Canada to 
implement a pollution prevention plan that will be good for our 
environment, as well as for our international endeavours and our 
international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Albert Einstein used to say, an intelligent man solves 
problems, a wise man avoids them. I think that, based on 
pollution prevention principles, our future Environmental 
Protection Act, as renewed and revised in this bill, will rank 
among our wiser pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are: the hon. member 
for Winnipeg North Centre—Hepatitis C. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I very much appreciate the member's remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier on in an intervention I mentioned that in Hamilton, 
which is near my riding, there was a disastrous fire in a 
recycling plant which spilled tonnes upon tonnes of toxic smoke 
into the air.  It caused a great deal of damage to the soil and 
the neighbouring area.  Indeed, there is great contention between 
the various levels of the government, the municipality and the 
province, about who is responsible and who should take the blame 
for this disastrous fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member his opinion on a situation like 
this.  Is this not really an example where a national government, 
for the benefit of all Canadians, should take matters of the 
environment as a matter of first priority?  In fact, is the 
protection of the environment not a national issue which should 
be backed up by very strong legislation and by adequate penalties 
that override any provincial jurisdiction that fails to fulfil 
its mandate to look after the environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not as a national government get tough with those 
organizations that deliberately take advantage of lax provincial 
laws and put the environment at risk?  Should we not get after 
these people? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have had the privilege of sitting on the House 
Standing Committee on Environment, and have had an opportunity 
to see some worrisome issues crop up in recent months relating 
to events in a number of regions of Canada, including the region 
of Ontario to which my colleague has referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that there must be more focus on environmental 
protection in the years to come. In my opinion, this is a battle 
that must be fought every day of every year.  There must be a 
constant monitoring of needs, for they are ever-present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the means available to us, the position of the 
federal, and most of the provincial, governments on 
environmental problems and the need to protect or to repair the 
environment, the means available are definitely unequal to the 
needs we are faced with, in this situation as well as others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our role, both as members of the environment committee, 
and here in public debate. Very soon, the committee will need to 
devote a great deal of time to determining needs and rallying 
public opinion, as well as the support of all of our colleagues 
in the various parties, in order to come up with the best 
approaches to be equal to our responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those approaches encompass funding, personnel availability and 
training.  They also include legislation and regulation.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, our legislation includes a practical provision 
for re-examination every five years.  This commitment has already 
been made by the Liberal Party. It is what we are doing at the 
present time, and we shall have the opportunity to re-examine all 
the issues and to enhance our understanding of ones such as my 
colleague has raised. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks which were very 
helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not a situation that follows on from what was said by 
members opposite in the Bloc Quebecois?  Is the environment not a 
situation where we do great disservice and put Canadians at risk 
if we leave it to the municipalities and the provinces to pass 
the appropriate legislation and provide the appropriate scrutiny 
to avoid disastrous fires like the one that occurred at Plastimet 
in Hamilton?  Is this not a situation where the national 
government has to bring in strong legislation with strong 
penalties to make sure that this kind of abuse of the environment 
does not occur, as was the case with the Plastimet fire in 
Hamilton? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Madam Speaker, I think future generations 
would not forgive those of us who are involved in national 
politics if we failed to deal with situations such as those that 
arose or with issues of jurisdiction or if we quibbled over 
matters of precedence at this or that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work has to be done to define environmental responsibilities at 
the municipal level—because there are responsibilities 
there—and at the provincial level and come up with measures to 
protect our environment and our resources for future generations 
regardless of where fault may lie.  If the municipal governments 
fail to assume their responsibilities, the provincial governments 
should be there as watch dogs.  If the provincial governments 
also fail, then there should be measures that enable us to 
intervene in very specific cases. That is what we are working 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A harmonization agreement has been proposed.  I support it. 
Work has barely begun.  Three chapters of ten have been written, 
but the work should continue and should lead us to better define 
our responsibilities, level by level, but not for the purpose of 
quibbling over final responsibility for our environment  in the 
coming years and for future generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I certainly welcome the 
opportunity to speak today in support of Bill S-9, the depository 
bills and notes act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically this is technical legislation.  It is 
non-controversial in that it updates federal legislation to 
provide a legal framework for well-established market practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the proposed legislation supports the secure and 
efficient processing of trades in financial instruments.  It does 
this by allowing instruments to be held in central depositories. 
The legislation also allows for the transfer of ownership of 
these financial instruments on the books of the depositories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing Bill S-9 let me first describe some of the 
changes taking place in the Canadian financial industry in 
general and the environment in which this legislation will 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, Canada's financial sector in the past 
few years has dramatically changed the way it does business. 
International competition which itself is fuelled by ongoing 
technological changes has been a major contributing factor.  In 
actual fact, few parts of business life in Canada have been more 
affected by evolving information technology than the financial 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sector is one of Canada's most important industries.  It 
contributes 5% to gross domestic product.  It creates almost 
500,000 jobs and generates $5 billion annually in export 
revenues. In addition it delivers essential services and products 
in today's modern economy, services such as financial 
intermediation, protection against risks and the provision of 
financial security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization, new technologies and deregulation are key forces 
of change that have been at work making our financial industry 
more modern and more efficient. The government has also responded 
to the changing environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International trade and investment for example have required 
wholesale financial services to be available on a global basis. 
Canadian financial firms, whose presence outside Canada is 
significant I might add, are strong participants in this global 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New technologies are also propelling change.  An institution 
that does not or cannot adapt to technological changes is not 
likely to fair well in today's economy.  Internationally the 
removal of regulatory barriers is fostering greater competition 
among different types of financial institutions and among 
institutions around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently we are awaiting the report of the task force on the 
future of the Canadian financial services sector which will be 
reporting in September and which will certainly trigger further 
debate and change.  In the meantime other changes are under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All major banks, as hon. members know, now have individual 
ombudsmen.  We also have the Canadian banking ombudsman who deals 
with retail and commercial disputes as well as complaints 
regarding securities and insurance subsidiaries of banks. Members 
of this House and in particular the Standing Committee on 
Industry have played a critical role in establishing this new 
Canadian banking ombudsman.  As the financial sector continues to 
change, some have indicated that it might be useful to conduct a 
review on the effectiveness of this important office within the 
financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also expecting draft legislation on foreign bank entry 
later on this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have Bill C-82 which gives the government the authority 
to make regulations in the area of privacy and also amends the 
Bank Act to prohibit coercive tied selling. Tied selling has 
become an important consumer issue and one that is presently 
being examined by the Standing Committee on Finance. The outcome 
of this review will guide the government's decision on whether or 
not to proclaim into law C-82 provisions that deal with tied 
selling activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of change is the successful conclusion of the 
World Trade Organization financial services negotiations under 
the general agreement on trade in services. 
The end result of these successful negotiations will mean greater 
international opportunities for our financial companies, new jobs 
for Canadians and benefits for consumers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some of the changes that have been taking place 
to ensure the competitiveness and currency of Canada's financial 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are debating today, the depository bills and notes 
act, represents yet another measure designed by the government to 
help in the modernization of our financial sector. The depository 
bills and notes act updates and modernizes federal legislation 
regarding the transfer of ownership of certain types of 
negotiable financial instruments, primarily bankers' acceptance 
and commercial papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of value and volume, bankers' acceptances and 
commercial paper are second only to federal bonds and treasury 
bills in the Canadian securities market.  For example in November 
1996 there was a total of $36.8 billion in bankers' acceptances 
and $33.7 billion in commercial paper in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Depository for Securities, in January 
1996 the average daily gross settlements of bankers' acceptances 
and commercial paper were $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion 
respectively, comprising approximately 400 daily trades in each 
security. As I just said, these two instruments rank second only 
to federal bonds and treasury bills in value and volume in our 
domestic securities market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are probably aware, federal government 
securities are held in the Canadian Depository for Securities 
debt clearing system. Today banks and other players are 
increasingly holding financial instruments like bonds, treasury 
bills and other negotiable instruments in a depository 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For financial instruments held in a depository when ownership of 
the instrument changes, instead of physically exchanging the 
security, the name of the new owner is simply entered into the 
records of the depository and it is called a book entry transfer. 
These practices are more efficient and more secure than settling 
individual trades by moving financial instruments across town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While book entry transfers are now an established part of the 
clearing and settlement system, Canadian financial legislation 
unfortunately does not fully recognize the practice for all types 
of financial instruments. Specifically the Bills of Exchange Act 
still does not acknowledge the use of depositories nor the 
holding and book entry delivery of financial instruments that 
fall under its rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bills of Exchange Act still refers to being in physical 
possession of negotiable instruments like bankers' acceptances 
and commercial paper when describing the rights of the parties 
involved in the transaction. For financial instruments held in a 
depository, these rules are clearly impractical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current Bills of Exchange Act for example the term 
“bearer” means the person in possession of a bill or note that 
is payable to the bearer. This means that the rights as described 
in the Bills of Exchange Act are impossible to interpret in the 
context of a negotiable instrument that is held in a depository 
and the transfer of ownership is done by the book entry because 
the instrument itself remains in the depository. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The depository bills and notes act makes the rights and 
responsibilities of buyers, sellers and holders of negotiable 
instruments compatible with the use of depositories and book 
entry transfer of ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-9 does this by creating two new financial instruments for 
classes of securities:  depository bills and depository notes. 
Both will be eligible to be held in a securities depository. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone buying a depository bill or note will generally have the 
same legal rights as someone buying a bill or note under the 
Bills of Exchange Act without actually taking delivery of the 
instrument.  Because the depository notes and bills are intended 
for relatively wide circulation in trading, the rights and 
responsibilities will be defined with specific reference to the 
function of the clearing house and book entry transfer. In 
addition, to distinguish these new instruments from similar 
securities, they will be marked with wording that indicates they 
are depository bills and notes subject to the depository bills 
and notes act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way will these new financial instruments preclude 
individuals or institutions from buying and holding other 
negotiable bills and notes which will still be governed by the 
Bills of Exchange Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of this debate, this is certainly 
very technical in nature and sometimes dry.  But there is one 
other part of this bill that deserves to be mentioned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-9 also amends section 70 of the Financial Administration 
Act to provide added certainty that transfers of Government of 
Canada securities from one person to another are legally sound 
under a book based system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to note that the bill is supported by all elements 
of Canada's financial community.  The Depository Bills and Notes 
Act is also consistent with the recommendations made by the 
private sector group concerned with the workings of the 
international financial system commonly known as the G-30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-30 has been calling for widespread introduction of 
securities depository systems and book entry transactions 
recordings as they will improve the efficiency of money markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Canadian Depository for Securities has been pushing 
to be able to hold negotiable money market instruments in its 
depository and to be able to make book entry ownership transfers 
as soon as possible, a far more efficient process, it believes, 
than having to take physical possession of the instrument.  Bill 
S-9 will allow it to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the federal government is not alone in 
providing a statutory basis for these activities.  The Ontario 
business corporations act, the Quebec securities act and other 
provincial legislation govern the holding and book entry delivery 
of government bonds and corporate securities that are not subject 
to the Bills of Exchange Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many other changes in the financial sector, Bill S-9 is 
simply keeping up with the times.  Its passage will allow trades 
in securities like bankers' acceptances and commercial paper to 
be processed in a more secure and efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially what Bill C-9 does is put into law an already 
established and accepted practice and therefore deserves speedy 
passage.  I urge all my hon. colleagues to support the 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
noted the request for urgent passage and support of the bill. 
Perhaps we could do a trade-off.  If we are to support the bill, 
perhaps they could support our motion on hepatitis C.  It is a 
wonderful opportunity for the government to do the right thing. 
Then it would have speedy passage of Bill S-9 which, by its very 
title, originated in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, we have talked long and loud about the affront 
to the House of the fact that we are receiving legislation here 
after it has been cleared in the Senate.  We are quite incensed 
that we who represent the public at large, we who have been 
democratically elected, we who stood on platforms and said “This 
is what we will deliver to you if you vote for us”, have to play 
second fiddle to the Senate which sent us a bill that it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder when the government will listen to the wishes of the 
people, to the demands made by the Reform Party that it is time 
we realize that anachronistic organization at the other end of 
the hall needs to be replaced by something more modern, which 
means more representative of Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-9, as my hon. colleague mentioned, is a technical bill 
and largely will not affect many people.  It has to do with more 
of the efficient workings of our financial systems than our 
financial industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted that the member mentioned bankers' acceptances and notes 
were second only to federal bonds in value and in volume.  That 
in itself spoke volumes.  While industry needs to raise funds for 
investment, for the creation of jobs, for new plants, new 
factories, and research and development, I have often wondered 
why the federal government has borrowed all this money and poured 
it down the drain— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We have one Liberal.  I request a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Very well.  We will

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  Just before the quorum call there was a reference to 
the presence or absence of members in the House.  I wonder if the 
Chair might remind members that is not allowed under the rules of 
the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member is 
certainly right.  I remind members not to forget this rule again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would never want to 
forget that very important rule.  As the Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Finance pointed out, we are dealing with a 
technical bill.  Perhaps they nodded off and did not pay much 
attention on the government side as to what was going on in the 
House because of the technicalities of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I was interrupted I was pointing out that the bill deals 
with bankers' acceptances and notes.  They are second only in 
value to the value and volume of federal government instruments, 
bonds and so on which are dealt with by the financial industry. I 
pointed out how important raising money is for the vitality of 
our economy to create new jobs, to build new factories, to 
finance inventory and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act does not hold true for the federal government which just 
borrowed the money, spent it, poured it down the drain for little 
or no value whatsoever.  Now we have high taxes.  Our economy is 
being dragged down.  We are less competitive than we otherwise 
would be around the world because the government never learned 
how to manage its books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect organizations and companies that are borrowing money 
through bankers' acceptances and so on are able to manage their 
books properly.  They do not have the concept of taxpayers 
standing behind them.  They have only profits standing behind 
their capacity to pay the interest and repay the principal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last many years governments including this government 
have borrowed many billions of dollars.  Since the government 
came to office in 1993 it has borrowed approximately $100 
billion, to be precise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an affront to all Canadians.  We are the ones who end up 
paying the interest on the federal government debt whereas it is 
investors who earn the interest and corporations that pay the 
interest on the bankers' acceptances through the profits they 
have generated through extra economic activity they have been 
able to create, extra jobs they have been able to create, extra 
sales they have been able to create, and extra efficiencies, 
productivity and plants they have been able to build.  That is 
how our financial industry works as a service to the industrial 
world to raise the money it needs in order for us to maintain a 
healthy economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary referred to the fact that rather 
than the instrument itself having to change hands, as is required 
under a bill of exchange, they just need a bookkeeping entry 
signed by both sides in the books of the depository to make the 
transaction legal.  It is a bit of an indictment of the legal 
industry that has evolved over the past number of generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the old definition of a bill of exchange, which I 
learned by heart as a young fellow when I studied banking in my 
native Scotland.  The definition was brought to my attention 
again by the Library of Parliament.  It jogged my mind about the 
definition of a bill of exchange which is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An unconditional order in writing addressed by one person to 
another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to 
whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or a 
determinable future time a sum certain in money to order or to 
bearer. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that because I had to learn it many years ago.  The bill 
of exchange was a simple piece of paper, one sheet saying that 
one was owed an amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the instruments of debt are pages thick, sometimes books 
in length.  Sometimes they refer to all the rest of the 
conditions posted in the head office of the organization. 
Therefore it becomes a physical impossibility to keep these books 
moving around.  The legal industry has said to the financial 
industry that it will have to cover off this liability or that 
liability and ensure the section is covered and that it can 
collect the money under these circumstances.  They keep getting 
bigger and bigger.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have to move these books around, so we are going to put 
them in a depository.  They are going to sit there in a 
depository.  We are back to one piece of paper referring to the 
books in depository.  We are now going to pass this piece of 
paper around for the financial industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When originally they passed the piece of paper around they did 
not need a depository.  Now they do.  In a few more generations I 
wonder where we will be putting this piece of paper which has now 
grown into a book. We will put that into a depository also.  We 
will start off with another sheet of paper that refers to the 
bookkeeping entry which refers to the underlying agreement, and 
it goes and on.  It is wonderful how the paper war does develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that the financial industry does need to have some 
modernization.  It does need to have this capacity to be able to 
work more efficiently, especially now that we are now in the 
computer age.  Lots of these entries are now made by computer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember too that today is April 27, 1998.   We are less 
than two years away from the big bash, big blast of the 
millennium.  On January 1, 2000, we are going to find out whose 
computer works and whose does not.  Is the government going to be 
able to work, not efficiently on January 1, 2000, but at all on 
January 1, 2000?  Or are all these computers going to grind to a 
stop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to this depository we are talking about under 
Bill S-9, all handled by computers.  As the parliamentary 
secretary said, there are billions of dollars flowing through 
this each day.  What is going to happen on January 1, 2000 if the 
computer that handles the depository gives up the ghost, the 
federal government's computers give up the ghost and industry's 
computers give up the ghost?  A half hour ago two people in my 
office were telling us that there is going to be a major economic 
catastrophe on January 1, 2000, predictable right to the very 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not be the end of the growth period of the economic 
cycle that will end in a downturn.  It is that the computers are 
going to grind to a stop on that day.  Those people with accounts 
receivable will not be able to collect their money.  Those people 
who have bills to pay will not be able to write the cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public accounts committee asked the Treasury Board 
secretariat last fall, Mr. Rummell, the chief information officer 
for the Government of Canada, and the assistant deputy minister 
in charge of information technology, what was the back-up if the 
computers fail in the year 2000. They said we will have to write 
the cheques by hand. Imagine such an admission by the Government 
of Canada. In this day and age when we are totally and absolutely 
reliant on computers to do virtually everything, the assistant 
deputy minister says they will have to write the cheques by hand. 
That is how unprepared the federal government and industry are in 
meeting this challenge which is right around the corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading an article in the <I>Financial Post</I> this 
morning which said that this was one date that we could not play 
around with.  We cannot postpone it.  It will be here on January 
1, 2000.  When everyone is waking up from the hangover of the 
great celebration on the eve of the millennium, it is going to be 
a big bust the next day when the computer is turned on.  That is 
the end of it.  It dies.  The economy could die too according the 
people in my office. There are going to be severe ramifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking on Bill S-9, and while we are talking about 
helping the financial industry improve its effectiveness and its 
efficiency, let us also send out a clear warning and strongly 
urge industry and everyone who has a computer to realize that 
January 2000 is not going to be postponed. 
If they want their business to survive and to continue making 
money in the new millennium they had better do a little 
housekeeping of their own as well as Bill S-9 to ensure their 
business continues in business on January 1, 2000. The importance 
of this issue cannot be underestimated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall when the auditor general tabled his report he said the 
total cost for the federal government on fixing its computers 
could be as high as $1 billion.  I was reading an article in the 
paper the other day that said one contract that the federal 
government has given to a group of computer consultants alone 
could go as high as $1.4 billion, not to mention all the other 
hardware acquisitions, software acquisitions and all the 
thousands of other programmers working diligently for the federal 
government at this point. The cost of $1 billion has escalated 
dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That cost is also going to apply to industry.  It will have to 
address the same issues as the federal government.  The federal 
government has left it far too late.  It is still in a situation 
of denial.  It is still running around the problem and it has not 
come clean with how bad it is.  Yet we also know industry is too 
complacent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time will come when there will not be enough programmers 
around and therefore what is going to happen to their business? 
What is going to happen to the shareholders?  What is going to 
happen to the bankers' acceptances that are now covered off by 
Bill S-9? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that as the government continues to help industry through 
Bill S-9, through the efficiencies it is allowing by the creation 
of this new type of investment instrument, it also recognizes 
that it has an obligation to tell industry that the year 2000 is 
serious, it cannot be delayed.  If shareholders are to maintain 
their investments the companies have to be able to function.  If 
the computers do not function we know that industry will not 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate. We do not like the fact that this bill is 
coming to us via the Senate.  We think that bankers' acceptances 
are good.  But he pointed out and seemed to be quite proud of the 
fact that federal government debt instruments were the largest 
kind of debt instruments in the country.  I took issue with that. 
We do not like it.  We feel that industry has to wake up and 
realize that the year 2000 is just upon us and we are glad to 
help it as far as the bankers' acceptances and so on are 
concerned to improve its efficiency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
very important to recognize that when we are discussing an 
extremely dry piece of legislation many people in this House are 
possibly not particularly interested in delving into the 
intricacies or the details of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important or interesting areas relative to this 
legislation is that it originated in the Senate.  Recently in his 
speech, ostensibly on Nunavut, the Leader of the Opposition 
focused his speech on the need for Senate reform.  He engaged in 
an extended series of character assassinations of many people in 
the other place, many of the Senators, and engaged in what many 
senators and also many members of this House found to be 
offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing to recognize is that while we do have a 
Senate and that while we do have an upper chamber, that Senate is 
to be and should be utilized to provide service and expertise on 
this type of technical legislation to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members have outlined the purpose of this bill and it is 
effectively to facilitate the settlement of securities for which 
the investor does not actually take physical possession.  I will 
not go into great detail about the substance of the legislation. 
That has been covered quite thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Department officials have said that the Depository Bills and 
Notes Act is a technical piece of legislation needed to support 
improvements in the efficiency of capital markets in Canada.  I 
would agree with the Reform member speaking earlier relative to 
the risk given the millennium or the year 2000 factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I was reading Edward Yardeni, a leading economist 
from New York.  He suggested the year 2000 problem is far more 
serious than governments like to admit, partially because 
governments fear the eventual law suits that could emanate from 
the year 2000 problem. This legislation has the potential to 
increase the exposure of Canada's financial marketplace to the 
year 2000 problem and this government has yet to make a serious 
credible commitment to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the bill was introduced in the Senate should give some of 
our colleagues in the Reform Party some evidence of the 
importance, necessity and value of the contribution made by our 
upper chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate had meaningful committee meetings on this piece of 
legislation, as we will hear.  It even introduced and passed an 
amendment to clarify the bill. Frankly, on this type of 
legislation, on financial services, economics or regulatory 
issues, the Senate is a bountiful supply of knowledge and 
expertise.  The Senate is a valuable resource we should utilize 
in this House to benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the chagrin of the Leader of the Opposition even his own 
caucus members have suggested we use the Senate more.  In a 
recent finance committee meeting, the chair announced he was 
asked recently in writing by the member from Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley to strike a joint committee between the 
House of Commons and the Senate finance committee to study the 
bank merger issue more thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member from Prince George—Bulkley Valley, a 
Reform MP, for recognizing the institutional knowledge and 
expertise we have in the Senate of Canada.  Taxpayers are already 
footing the bill for a bicameral government.  Why deny Canadian 
taxpayers the full benefit of their investment in this system? 
Why does the Reform Party not suggest utilizing the Senate more 
at this juncture instead of less?  Let us make sure Canadian 
taxpayers are getting their money's worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has introduced some very meaningful legislation 
recently, including Senator Kenny's tobacco legislation and Bill 
S-3, which I have already commented on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will even argue that while the Senate may not be 
elected it has offered a more effective opposition to the 
government in the past five years than the official opposition 
parties in this House.  The Senate has also held important and 
useful debates on electoral boundary redistribution, the Divorce 
Act, the Newfoundland school issue and assistance for 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, some of the opposition parties have voiced strong 
concern over this practice of introducing legislation in the 
Senate.  In fact when I consider the amount of time the Reform 
Party has taken recently to pontificate on the role of the Senate 
in a parliamentary democracy I tend to think that we have lost a 
lot of good opportunities for meaningful debates about the real 
issues in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same Senate that the Leader of the Opposition's father 
sat in for a number of years.  It seems strange to me that 
someone would go to such lengths to attack a Canadian institution 
that one's father was actually a member of.  I noticed a 
particularly interesting statement in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> 
made by the Leader of the Opposition's father in defence of the 
Senate in 1981.  In that statement he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We constitute more than a chamber of sober second thought.  We 
have been appointed to represent our respective provinces in this 
House.  We have been selected to provide the necessary checks and 
balances on a parliamentary structure where representation by 
population results in imbalances that invite the kind of abuse of 
parliamentary majority power that we are witnessing today. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition contradicts his father's remarks 
when he speaks as he did last week and said that members of the 
Senate do not represent provincial or regional interests.  I feel 
it is very important to recognize that our Senate can, should and 
will, if utilized, provide the necessary leadership, judgment and 
expertise we need, especially with this type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking about the Nunavut 
legislation he engaged in a number of character assassinations. 
It was unfortunate to hear some of the inaccuracies and the 
really incredible allegations that he made.  After he would 
attack a member of the Upper Chamber at great length, he would 
then engage in a bit of a disclaimer and say “Far be it for me 
to judge that particular member”, when he knew that his words 
were nothing but character assassinations in vitriol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity recently to visit the official website of 
the Reform Party where I read inflammatory and factually 
incorrect statements about members of the Senate.  I could only 
surmise that the Reform Party has compromised its own position in 
terms of hate literature on the Internet when in fact it is using 
the Internet to spread factually incorrect, inflammatory and what 
I consider to be dangerous character assassinations via the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that more members of this House do not 
recognize the contribution that the Senate has made and can 
continue to make to this type of legislation.  Our party believes 
and has laid out certain ideas that can be implemented sooner 
rather than later, including the provinces putting forward lists 
of names for the Prime Minister to choose from when he is making 
the Senate appointments and limiting the term of a senator to 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it was our party and the Conservative government under 
the leadership of Brian Mulroney that appointed the late Stan 
Waters to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interim, until we have Senate reform, all members of this 
House should continue to work on behalf of the Canadian taxpayers 
to ensure that we are maximizing the level of expertise that we 
have in the Upper Chamber to provide the maximum level of benefit 
to the Canadian taxpayer by providing the types of legislation 
that will benefit the Canadian taxpayer as we enter the 21st 
century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to elaborate on 
the question that I posed in this Chamber on March 30 pertaining 
to compensation for all those who have suffered from the results 
of contaminated blood, in particular those who are suffering from 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a timely opportunity to have a further debate on this 
issue.  It allows all members of this House to think through 
their positions very carefully before the vote in this House 
tomorrow evening, a critical vote for all Canadians and in 
particular the thousands of blood injured Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 30 I posed a question flowing from Justice Krever's 
report which all members will know resulted from a very long, 
thorough and in depth review of the tainted blood scandal.  In 
that report Justice Krever said “ The compassion of a society 
can be judged by the measures it takes to reduce the impact of 
tragedy on its members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members of this Chamber of those words on this 
critical evening, on the eve of a very important vote in this 
Chamber.  I appeal to everyone, in particular the members of the 
Liberal Party who are in a very difficult position this evening 
as they think through this issue and make a final determination 
on how they will vote tomorrow. I appeal to those members to 
listen to their hearts, to listen to their consciences, to act on 
the basis of principle, the principle if not of their own party, 
then of the kind of society we believe this country is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members not to listen to arguments that have no basis 
in fact.  I urge all members not to listen to the speaking notes 
being circulated to members of the government side which are 
nothing more than a partisan rag.  I urge all members to listen 
to the voices of those who deal with this disease day in and day 
out, who have felt they have received no satisfactory response 
from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me very quickly outline the arguments that have been posed 
by this government which have to be refuted one by one and then 
let me conclude by referencing a number of constituents of mine 
and people from across this country who have spoken out so 
clearly and so passionately to try to move this government to put 
in place full compensation for all blood injured Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put aside the arguments around the period of 1986 to 
1990, being the period for which this government is legally 
liable. Let us not forget that the test to determine hepatitis C 
in the blood supply was available long before 1986 and was in 
fact recognized by our scientific community as a meaningful test 
to determine hepatitis C in the blood supply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us remember that what we are talking about is not 
something that is precedent setting but is in fact dealing with 
regulatory failure and is not to be confused with medical 
misadventure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Liberals.  If they take that line of 
argument how can they in fact acknowledge the compensation for 
thalidomide victims and for HIV victims?  Surely it is time to 
put our hearts and our heads together and agree with the voices 
of so many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by indicating that many Canadians are worried and 
concerned.  I have received just in the last day 500 names of 
constituents in the city of Winnipeg expressing their concern and 
urging the government to employ compassion— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to reply to the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by saying that the federal government, along with 
the provincial and territorial governments, offered $1.1 billion 
to compensate the patients for whom the disease could have been 
avoided from 1986 to 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a decision arrived at by all provincial governments 
including the two NDP governments of British Columbia and 
Saskatchewan.  It is not a package that was given without careful 
and thoughtful consideration for the victims of hepatitis C for 
whom the disease could have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we extend the package to those in the absence of fault, we 
ought to extend the compensation as well for all kinds of 
diseases as a consequence of injury from blood, not only 
hepatitis C but even allergies or even shock from blood 
transfusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who raised the question has not told the House 
that she has approached the NDP premiers of Saskatchewan and 
British Columbia.  Neither has she told the House that she has 
approached the health ministers of British Columbia and 
Saskatchewan, her own NDP counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal NDP member has a commitment to change the package 
announced by the government, why has she not informed the House 
that she has already spoken to those NDP premiers and NDP 
governments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP minister of health in Saskatchewan has said that those 
who use this issue for the point alone as indicated by the NDP 
member are using political opportunism. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 5.28 p.m.)
