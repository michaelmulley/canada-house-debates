	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Before we proceed to the orders of the day 
I am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised by the 
hon. member for York South-Weston on Wednesday, February 19, 
1997 concerning the availability of budget documents prior to the 
budget presentation made by the Minister of Finance on Tuesday, 
February 18, 1997.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, the hon. member forSt. Albert, the hon. member for Kootenay East, and the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance for their 
comments in this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his submission, the hon. member for York South-Weston 
argued that many of the provisions of the budget had been 
announced by the government prior to the speech of the Minister of 
Finance and that budget documents were available approximately 
15 minutes before the minister rose to make his budget 
presentation. He contended that these two actions were in marked 
contrast to previous practice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The member also maintained that the privileges of members of 
the House are impinged upon when information is released 
prematurely. Finally, he asked the Chair to review the whole matter 
of the budget lock-up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since the beginning of this Parliament, hon. members have 
witnessed an important change in the budget process. On February 
7, 1994 the House adopted amendments to its standing orders 
which included the insertion of new Standing Order 83.1 to provide 
for so-called ``prebudget consultations'' by authorizing the 
Standing Committee on Finance to consider and make  reports on 
proposals regarding the budgetary policy of the government.
<P>
	Accordingly, the Standing Committee on Finance has engaged 
on three occasions in a process of public consultation, during which 
its members were authorized to travel and to listen to the concerns 
of Canadians. Pursuant to Standing Order 83.1, the committee 
tabled three reports: the first on December 8, 1994, the second on 
December 12, 1995 and the third and most recent on December 5, 
1996.
<P>
	On the issue of budget secrecy, perhaps it would be helpful to 
remind all members of what Speaker Sauvé pointed out in a 
decision she gave to the House on April 19, 1983 at page 24649 of 
the <I>Debates</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-budget secrecy is a political convention. So also is the practice whereby the 
minister presents his budget in the House before declaring it in any other public 
forum.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I agree with Speaker Sauvé. It would not be proper for the Chair 
to get involved in the interpretation of budget secrecy, nor the 
matter of the lock-up.
<P>
	As for the issue of privilege with respect to the matter raised, let 
me quote again Speaker Sauvé. In a decision which can be found in 
the <I>Debates</I> of November 18, 1981 at page 12898 she stated that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-a breach of budget secrecy cannot be dealt with as a matter of privilege. It might 
constitute a very important grievance for members. Such action might have a very 
negative impact on business or on the stock market. It might cause some people to 
receive revenues which they would not otherwise have been able to obtain. All of 
these are possible consequences of breaches of budget secrecy, but they have no 
impact on the privileges of the member. They might do harm-irrevocable in some 
case-to persons or institutions, but this has nothing to do with privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Speaker Fraser was also asked to rule on budget secrecy. On June 
18, 1987, at page 7315 of the <I>Debates</I> he mentioned:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Budgetary secrecy is a matter of parliamentary convention. Its purpose is to 
prevent anybody from gaining a private advantage by reason of obtaining advance 
budgetary information-The limits of parliamentary privilege are very narrow and it 
is not a responsibility of the Chair to rule as to whether or not a parliamentary 
convention is justified or whether or not the matter complained of is a breach of that 
convention. That is a matter of political debate and not one in which the Chair would 
wish to become involved.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8694"> 8694 </A></B>
<P>
	I concur with both Speakers in that a breach of budget secrecy 
has nothing to do with parliamentary privilege. Therefore, in the 
case presently before us, the Chair cannot determine that the hon. 
member has been in any way hindered in the performance of his 
parliamentary duties.
<P>
	Consequently, it is my decision that there is no prima facie case 
of privilege.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for York South-Weston for raising his 
matter.

being denounced by these constituents and they point out there 
ought to be absolute certainty that this does not occur.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PORNOGRAPHY">PORNOGRAPHY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition is similar commentary with respect to pornography 
and its negative effects on society. It is not only denounced, it is in 
fact suggested that this should not be happening because it is 
extremely dysfunctional and degrading to women, children and 
others.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
third petition wants to ensure that there are no increases in taxes on 
gasoline. The petitioners feel that it is already too high.
<P>
	The fourth petition is with respect to reading materials. These 
petitions want no GST on reading materials, something that I have 
advocated for some time. They also suggest that reading and 
learning materials could be zero rated.

<P>
Canadian Council of Railway Operating Unions. This petition is 
signed by communities all the way from Windsor, Ontario to 
Revelstoke, British Columbia.
<P>
	What the petitioners are pointing out is that the viability of the 
CCROU as an effective bargaining unit for the members has been 
undermined as a result of the government's interference in the 
collective process via the maintenance of the Railway Operation 
Act, 1995.
<P>
	What they are asking for is that Parliament and the government 
restore meaningful collective bargaining to the process. They call 
on Parliament to recognize the importance of free and unfettered 
collective bargaining by enacting a bill which would restore the 
union's right to strike and with it the company's right to lock out.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the pleasure of introducing another petition signed 
by petitioners mainly from Fort Qu'Appelle and the Balcarres 
district.
<P>
	These petitioners point out that there are still over 30,000 
nuclear weapons on the earth. They point out as well that the 
continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to the 
health and survival of human civilization and to the global 
environment.
<P>
	They call on Parliament to support the initiation and conclusion 
by the year 2000 of an international convention which will set out a 
binding timetable for the abolition of all nuclear weapons.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
three petitions today. The first petition comes from Regina, 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that our police officers and firefighters place their lives at risk on a 
daily basis as they serve the emergency needs of all Canadians. 
They also state that in many cases their families are often left 
without sufficient financial means to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and 
bequests for the benefit of families of police officers and 
firefighters who are killed in the line of duty.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Calgary, Alberta. The petitioners draw 
to the attention of the House that managing the family home and 
caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which 
has not been recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to assist families that choose to provide care in the home 
for preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ALCOHOLCONSUMPTION">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
final petition is from Dingwall, Nova Scotia. The petitioners draw 
to the attention of the House that the consumption of alcoholic 
beverages may cause problems or impair one's ability, and 
specifically that fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol related 
birth defects are 100 per cent preventable by avoiding alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	The petitioners pray and call on Parliament to enact legislation 
to require health warning labels to be placed on the containers of all 
alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers and others of the 
risks associated with alcohol consumption.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALHIGHWAYSYSTEM">NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have three petitions to present.
<P>
	Two of the petitions have to do with the national highway 
system, the first of which notes that 38 per cent of our national 
highway system is substandard. Therefore the petitioners call on 
Parliament to urge the federal government to join with the 
provincial governments to make the national highway system 
upgrading possible.
<P>
	The second petition, which is also on the subject of highways, 
notes that 52 per cent of the price of gasoline is composed of taxes, 
while only 5 per cent of the revenue is reinvested in the highways. 
Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to not increase the 
federal excise tax on gasoline and allocate its current revenues to 
rehabilitating our crumbling highways.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the third petition concerns reading and literacy. The petitioners 
note that the 7 per cent GST now applied to reading material is 
unjust. The petitioners ask Parliament to zero rate books, 
magazines and newspapers under the GST.
<P>
	I support their petition.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOBACCOACT">TOBACCO ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-71, an act to regulate the manufacture, sale, labelling and 
promotion of tobacco products, to make consequential 
amendments to another act and to repeal certain acts, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to rise and speak 
to Bill C-71. There are many in the House today who have 
experienced much debate on the issue of tobacco regulation. 
Several of us who sit here today were here in 1988 for debate on 
what was then Bill C-51, the Tobacco Products Control Act.
<P>
	I would like to thank my previous colleague, the former minister 
of health, the Hon. Jake Epp, who brought forward Bill C-51, for 
his commitment to tobacco regulation and for his efforts in 
legislating in this area.
<P>
	Almost seven years ago Minister Epp rose in the House to speak 
on Bill C-51 at third reading. I quote from that speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of the bill is to provide a legislative response to a national public 
health problem of substantial and present concern. It is intended to protect the health 
of Canadians in light of conclusive evidence implicating tobacco use and the 
incidents of numerous debilitating and fatal diseases.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Although we on this side of the House have on several occasions 
found cause to differ with the party of the Hon. Jake Epp, Bill C-51 
had the support of my party.
<P>
	We did have concerns about the legislation at that time. We 
wanted to make certain that the bill went as far as possible to 
restrict the access and exposure of tobacco products.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague, the minister of heritage, spoke to those 
concerns throughout the debates on Bill C-51. While we wanted to 
ensure the legislation was effective, we never wavered in our 
support for the principles of the bill. Today we have before us a bill 
which speaks to the  commitment of my party and of the 
government to the health of Canadians.
<P>
	Tobacco is a preventable source of much health damage to 
Canadians. Behind the glossy advertising and the carefree lifestyles 
that sponsorships feed off is a record of suffering and of lives ended 
far too soon. Who in the House has not been touched by the 
devastating toll of tobacco use? We have all had relatives, friends 
or acquaintances who have been sick or who have died because of 
tobacco related illnesses.
<P>
	As debate on Bill C-71 has already revealed, smoking has 
complex and diverse impacts and as the research mounts all around 
the world we are learning much more about the effects of that use. 
We are coming to understand more of the factors that influence the 
decision to smoke and yes, the decision to continue to smoke.
<P>
	Let me underline one tragic fact. The decision to smoke is being 
made overwhelmingly by teenagers. Some 85 per cent of all 
smokers started before the age of 16. Those who suggest that this 
issue is about adult choices should keep that in mind.
<P>
	What faces these young smokers? A lifetime of weakened health 
for one thing, because we know that tobacco kills. We know that 
research shows a death toll of about 40,000 lives of Canadians cut 
short each and every year. We know that tobacco is associated with 
about 30 per cent of all cancer in this country.
<P>
	If that were all the price we paid because young people fall prey 
to the lure of tobacco use, it would be too much. But there is more. 
Tobacco has economic and social costs as well. One of the most 
obvious economic impacts is the cost of health care for people who 
suffer from the effects of tobacco use. We face those costs from a 
number of sources, the most basic of course is the cost to our 
medicare system.
<P>
	I think all political parties in the House understand Canadians 
believe very strongly in our medicare system and I believe all 
political parties in the House know we need to improve the way we 
use that system. That means reducing unnecessary drains on the 
system.
<P>
	Tobacco must be the best example of a preventable cost to 
medicare. But we estimate that tobacco use costs our society 
approximately $15 billion each and every year, about $3.5 billion 
resulting from the kinds of direct health care costs I have been 
talking about.
<P>
	I could talk about how those costs are incurred, about hospital 
days spent, visits to doctors and prescription costs, about time 
spent in long term health care facilities. We could spend 
considerable time talking about the illness that doctors link to 
tobacco consumption. It could be cancer, heart disease or a lung 
disease such as emphysema.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8697"> 8697 </A></B>
<P>
	We must remember and take to heart that the smokers who are 
addicted and who are perhaps sick today because of their habit 
probably started to smoke when they were very young, probably 
when they were teenagers.
<P>
	As we debate the bill today yet another generation of Canadian 
youth is being exposed to the lure of tobacco products. The new 
tobacco customers are young Canadians. As we sit in our places 
today let us try to remember the feeling of young people. Young 
people feel themselves to be immortal. They want to be adults and 
do things that seem adult like.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	Being a teenager is a time to assert one's independence. It is a 
time when the opinions of friends and peers can weigh more 
heavily on a decision than the advice of teachers, parents or even 
physicians. The most common reason cited for starting to smoke is 
the influence of friends, better known as peer pressure. A 13-year 
old or a 14-year old cannot easily conceptualize the possibility of 
getting heart disease or cancer in 30 or 40 years.
<P>
	Let us think of our own youth whether we grew up in Quebec, 
Ontario or the maritimes and how immune as young people we 
thought we were to diseases such as heart disease, cancer and 
others. If the young get hooked the addictive power of nicotine will 
do the rest. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	We know that one in three young Canadians smoke and that half 
of them will ultimately die prematurely of a tobacco related 
disease. We know that youth are the most tragic casualties of 
tobacco use and addiction. We know that youth are the most 
vulnerable to tobacco promotion.
<P>
	I wish to present to the House some facts that ought to be 
examined both in light of their substance and in terms of the 
devastating effects they can have on young people: 29 cent of 15 to 
19 year olds and 14 per cent of 10 to 14 year olds are currently 
smoking. Let us imagine a 10-year old daughter or a 13-year old 
son smoking. Do they visualize the possibility of cancer, heart 
disease, emphysema and other lung diseases? No. Smoking among 
teens aged 15 to 19 has increased by as much as 25 per cent since 
1991.
<P>
	According to the 1994 youth smoking survey, 260,000 children 
in Canada between the ages of 10 and 19 began smoking in that 
year. Figures like these which are being replicated in other 
countries have prompted their governments to legislate in the area 
of tobacco control. The World Health Organization has classified 
youth smoking as a global pediatric epidemic. That is why the 
government's priorities in developing the legislation and our 
overall tobacco strategy have been focused on young people.
<P>
	The tobacco industry claims it does not advertise to encourage 
youth to take up smoking. That is what the industry says. It claims
<P>
it is only encouraging the switching of brands among older 
established smokers. The focus of advertizing, says the industry, is 
an audience of entirely adult tobacco consumers.
<P>
	If we walk the streets we see the billboards and the paraphernalia 
in terms of caps, jackets and T-shirts. We can check billboards in 
close proximity to schools and other institutions for young people. 
These billboards and paraphernalia are certainly not a campaign 
directed toward the senior citizens. The campaign is for young 
people.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> I know the hon. member opposite hates to hear 
the facts, but let me share something with him. I know he will enter 
the debate. Then we will have an opportunity to hear his wisdom 
and intellectual fervour. Perhaps he will listen to one of his own 
who said on this issue that the tobacco industry said it did not 
advertise to encourage youth to take up smoking.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Vincent Fischer, president of Symbiose, can qualify as being the 
guru of sponsorship in Quebec. As he notes, the studies are based 
on common sense. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If tobacco manufacturers invest $60 million, they are not doing so for the good of 
their health. They are doing so because they are getting a return on their investment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is not me. That is an advertising executive in the province 
of Quebec.
<P>
	As I said, the focus of advertising, says the industry, is an 
audience of an entirely adult tobacco consumers. The information 
all around us suggests and proves that it is not so.
<P>
	I again refer hon. members to the article in <I>La Presse</I> of 
yesterday.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> I know the hon. member opposite does not like to 
hear what I am saying. He wishes to avail himself of the 
opportunity to heckle. I would encourage him to participate so that 
we can have an intelligent debate of the subject.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are asking for too much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Perhaps I have gone too far in suggesting the hon. 
member might be able to engage in debate of the subject matter in 
an intelligent way. I will reflect upon my earlier assertion and 
perhaps at the end of the debate I will have a few words to say to 
my friends opposite.
<P>
	Young people are sophisticated enough to understand the 
purposes of tobacco company marketing tools. Health Canada's 
1994 youth smoking survey found that 85 per cent of young 
smokers and 83 per cent of non-smokers  agreed that 
advertisements for events 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8698"> 8698 </A></B>
<P>
sponsored by tobacco companies were a means to directly advertise 
cigarette brands.
<P>
	I recognize many of my colleagues opposite have expressed 
concern about the link between sponsorship and youth smoking. I 
would like to take a few moments to discuss that issue.
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute of Canada has issued a report 
entitled ``Tobacco Marketing and Youth: Examination of Youth 
Attitudes and Behaviour on Tobacco Industry Advertising and 
Sponsorship''. This is Canada's premier cancer research 
organization. It concluded an exhaustive review of the available 
science not only in Canada but indeed beyond our borders.
<P>
	The institute found there was substantial evidence that young 
people are aware of and respond to cigarette advertising. 
Advertisements present images that appeal to youth and are seen 
and remembered by them.
<P>
	The United States will be implementing a full ban on 
sponsorship promotion in August 1998. I would like to share the 
following points from the federal registry of August 28, 1996.
<P>
	The FDA has found that image based advertising is particularly 
effective with young people and that the information conveyed by 
imagery is likely to be more significant to young people than 
information conveyed by other means in advertisement.
<P>
	The FDA also pointed to studies showing that children are 
exposed to substantial and unavoidable advertising, that exposure 
to tobacco advertising leads to favourable beliefs about tobacco's 
use, that advertising plays a role in leading young people to 
overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and that these factors 
are related to young people's tobacco initiation and use.
<P>
	In essence it is a way in which to present an image and an 
environment that smoking is okay, that smoking some how is sexy, 
and that smokers should not worry about getting some form of 
disease in the future. It is a very well carved and focused strategy 
by the advertisers but in particular the tobacco companies.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The FDA also looked at sponsored events and found that the 
effect of sponsored events on young people who attend such events 
was enormous. Advertising affects young people's opinion of 
tobacco products, first, by creating attractive and existing images 
that can serve as a badge of identification; second, by utilizing 
multiple and prolonged exposure in a variety of media; and, third, 
by associating the product with varied positive events and images.
<P>
	The World Health Organization also recognized the link between 
tobacco sponsorship and consumption. It has found that the tobacco 
industry uses the sponsoring of sports and entertainment to 
complement and/or  replace other marketing activities to reach 
large audiences and to associate their products with positive 
images.
<P>
	I am not standing here today to tell adults how to live their lives. 
I am not telling them to quit smoking although I would hope they 
would. I am not banning tobacco in this country.
<P>
	Some have suggested that only a ban on tobacco would really 
address this public health challenge. There are seven million 
addicted smokers in Canada. If we were to ban this product, can we 
imagine the chaos and smuggling that would take place? They are 
addicted to a substance which according to scientific reports is 
more addictive than heroin. They are addicted to a product that 
would be prohibited if introduced on the market today. It is a 
product that kills when used as directed.
<P>
	It is not a new product. It is a product with generations of use and 
an insidious hold. To be reasonable and to be responsible we have 
to make every effort to prevent youth from beginning to smoke. 
Experts on tobacco generally agree it is far more productive to 
discourage young people from experimenting with smoking than 
trying to place several legal restrictions on adult smokers. Our 
strategy must be to reduce and ultimately eliminate tobacco use.
<P>
	We introduced a blueprint in December 1995 whereby numerous 
consultations took place. We consulted widely with provincial and 
territorial governments, the health community, tobacco 
manufacturers, collateral industries, sports and cultural groups, and 
concerned Canadians. There were over 2,700 submissions in 
response to the blueprint. Now, 15 months later, I stand before the 
House at third reading of Bill C-71. The bill contains reasonable 
measures that will restrict advertising and sponsorship promotion.
<P>
	Let me make it perfectly clear that we are not banning 
advertising. We are not banning sponsorship promotion. Instead the 
bill will place restrictions on these promotional activities which 
will reduce the exposure of cigarettes in Canadian society.
<P>
	The government has taken into consideration the concerns of the 
arts and sports events that rely on tobacco company sponsorship. 
We have set an implementation period for the sponsorship 
restriction provisions. We will bring them into force in October 
1998. This is effectively a two-season adjustment period.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the completion of the 
implementation period equates to a banning of sponsorship or 
sponsorship promotion. I challenge some of the national media 
outlets and their spokespersons to stop acting in a grossly negligent 
manner in pursuing a track of misinformation about the bill and 
about the effects of the bill. It is just not so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8699"> 8699 </A></B>
<P>
	The coming into force of section 24 in October 1998 will mean 
the implementation of restrictions on the extent to which 
sponsorship activities can be promoted.
<P>
	I have seen the various legal opinions that the tobacco industry 
has circulated about Bill C-71. One interpretation asserted that the 
bill would prohibit persons under 18 years of age from being hired 
at retail locations where tobacco products are sold. The bill creates 
no such prohibition and does not deal with criteria for vendors and 
employees in any way. The bill focuses on the ages of the 
purchasers. It focuses on sales to minors. Other interpretations 
have alleged that maximum fines and imprisonment will 
automatically ensue for any contravention of the act on the day 
following its coming into force.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	In reality, such interpretation ignores the establishment of an 
enforcement policy in my own department. This policy deems 
prosecution as a last resort to achieve compliance. It includes 
warning letters and consultations prior to any consideration of legal 
action. If members opposite are asking me to do the exact opposite, 
I will reflect on that.
<P>
	I could probably stand here all day and talk about the various 
legal opinions tobacco lobbyists have circulated. We know they are 
the heart and soul of members of the Bloc Quebec, the lobbyist. I 
find that the unholy alliance of the Bloc Quebecois and the tobacco 
lobbyists is rather insidious. For every 15 minutes that this debate 
continues, one more Canadian will join the role of those who died 
sooner than they would have otherwise, all because of tobacco use.
<P>
	Let me add one comment regarding those legal opinions. I have 
publicly offered a voluntary preclearance mechanism. What I have 
proposed is that when individuals or groups are apprehensive about 
possible prosecution under this legislation, when they want to 
ensure that their advertising or their sponsorship promotion fits 
within restrictions, they can come to my department and discuss it 
with our officials.
<P>
	Before event organizers start making unfounded allegations 
about what they can do and cannot do, I encourage them to review 
the restrictions with my department.
<P>
	It is important not to lose sight of the strong support for Bill 
C-71 which comes from every region of the country. The Canadian 
Medical Association supports the legislation: ``We are looking for 
expedient passage of Bill C-71 because we know that the future 
generation of Canadians must be protected from the number one 
cause of preventable death and disease in the country''.
<P>
	The president of the Canadian Cancer Society also wrote: ``I am 
writing to express my support for Bill C-71 and to urge you and 
your ministry to do everything  possible within legal frameworks to 
help end the tragedy of death by tobacco''.
<P>
	I have also received the endorsement of the Coalition québécoise 
pour le controle du tabac. It represents over 561 organizations 
across the province of Quebec. The number includes 238 towns and 
municipalities across the province of Quebec. It includes the 
Association of Cardiologists of Quebec, the Quebec Dental 
Association, the Quebec Association of Family Physicians, the 
Pathologists Association of Quebec, the Quebec Paediatrics 
Association, the Quebec Medical Association, the Quebec Public 
Health Association, the Quebec Lung Association and the Quebec 
division of the Canadian Cancer Society.
<P>
	My friends opposite on one hand supported Bill C-71 and the 
principles at second reading and have now done a major flip-flop, 
the hypocrisy of the Bloc Quebecois. They must be accountable for 
this flip-flop. They must be accountable to those 561 organizations 
that support the provisions of Bill C-71.
<P>
	To the hon. members opposite, their day of reckoning is coming 
and it is coming fairly soon. They will pay the price for their 
opposition to the health of the Quebec people, particularly the 
young people of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	It falls to my colleagues opposite with the same force that it falls 
to me as the Minister of Health. We cannot, as members of 
Parliament, overlook the unavoidable toll of tobacco.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	In Quebec alone, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, in their 
unholy alliance with the tobacco companies and the lobbyists, are 
saying to 76,000 young people who will begin smoking this year 
they do not care about the health of les enfants des quebecois. That 
is what they are saying by their opposition to Bill C-71. This is 30 
per cent of the beginning smokers in the country as a whole. 
Smoking is more common in the province of Quebec than in other 
parts of Canada and the hon. members know it. They reject outright 
the efforts of the hon. minister of health in the province of Quebec, 
one of their own, Jean Rochon.
<P>
	It is a flip-flop today. Why? It is to get the media headlines each 
and every day in order to save their political skins in the next 
federal election.
<P>
	Thirty-eight per cent of Quebecers are smokers. In the rest of 
Canada the rate is 31 per cent. They are both unacceptably high. As 
many as three million people alive today in Canada will die from 
tobacco related diseases, and one million of those are in the 
province of Quebec. That is far too many. These are reasons 
enough to do all we can to reduce tobacco consumption in this 
country.
<P>
	I know a number of my colleagues are waiting to speak to this 
bill. They share my concerns about reducing  tobacco consumption 
in Canadian youth. However, let me take a few moments to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8700"> 8700 </A></B>
<P>
acknowledge the efforts of some of the people who have helped get 
us this legislation here today.
<P>
	I refer of course to my parliamentary secretary. The member for 
Eglinton-Lawrence certainly deserves a lot of praise and a lot of 
recognition. He has brought his experience and judgment to this 
bill and I wish to thank him for it. I also want to thank the hon. 
member for Burin-St. George's who chairs the Standing 
Committee on Health. I want to thank all members of that 
committee regardless of their political affiliations.
<P>
	I would be remiss in my remarks if I did not single out one 
member. In this House we have differed on many issues and I 
would suspect that we will continue to differ on many other issues. 
However, I must give credit where credit is due, to the 
non-partisanship demonstrated by the hon. member for Macleod. 
He has stood in his place time and time again and attacked me on a 
variety of different issues, but when it comes to this issue of 
smoking, tobacco and the control of tobacco use in this country, he 
has not stood with the Minister of Health; he has stood with the 
young people and I think he is deserving of praise from all of us in 
this Chamber.
<P>
	I want to thank the members of the Bloc Quebecois, in particular 
the member for Lévis. I know they have concerns with the bill but I 
am confident that at the end of the day they will put the health of 
Canadians and, yes, the health of Quebecers first and foremost.
<P>
	I say to members of the Bloc I know that many of them who are 
over there are very uncomfortable with the decisions that have been 
made by the leadership of the Bloc Quebecois. I know that. I say to 
my hon. friends opposite that it is never too late to change one's 
mind and do the right thing. I am sure that the children in the 
province of Quebec will be forever indebted to members of the 
Bloc Quebecois if they were to exert the kind of leadership that 
others in the province of Quebec have exerted in terms of 
supporting children and supporting the health of those children in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, I wish to say a few words about the other place. 
Hopefully later this day this bill will receive third reading. It will 
leave this Chamber and go to another chamber. I would suspect, 
having the respect that I have for the other chamber and its 
members, they will examine this bill in an expeditious way, but in a 
comprehensive way, and that they too will see the purposes of what 
this bill is about. It is about the health of Canadians. It is about the 
health of children. It is about the health of children in the future.
<P>
	I want to thank all members of the House who have participated 
in this debate. I know at times it has been acrimonious, but I want 
to say to all members that we can  be a part of something which is 
very important to the country. I enjoin all members to join with me 
in that act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Health asked us to reconsider our decision to vote against the bill at 
third reading.
<P>
	Before he leaves us, I would urge him to be as intelligent as he 
would like us to be and make his bill more flexible. It would then 
be possible to achieve the objectives we in the Bloc Quebecois 
supported at second reading, because the objectives of this bill are 
admirable, except in the case of devices like taking away 
sponsorships. Sports and cultural events so dear to the hearts of 
Quebecers are being deprived of these sponsorships, including the 
Montreal Grand Prix and all the international festivals such as the 
Just for Laughs festival and the jazz festival.
<P>
	Vancouver also has a jazz festival. Fireworks attract thousands 
of people from Canada and Quebec. As you know, international 
events attract many tourists as well. These events give Quebec and 
Canada international visibility.
<P>
	The Montreal Grand Prix is the third biggest sports event 
broadcast throughout the world, after the Olympic Games that are 
held once every four years and the World Cup. The Formula I 
Grand Prix comes right after these two. This country is lucky to 
have a Grand Prix event, to be seen throughout the world and to say 
to the people of the world: ``Welcome to our country''.
<P>
	This country is supposed to be renowned for its quality of life, 
although, unfortunately, Canada's child poverty rate is one of the 
highest among Western countries, among the G-7 countries. That is 
not something to be proud of.
<P>
	When the minister explained his objectives, we agreed with him, 
as you know. That is why we voted for the bill at second reading. 
The minister is an experienced parliamentarian, as you are, Mr. 
Speaker, and knows that at second reading the debate is on 
principles and objectives. That is why we supported the bill at 
second reading.
<P>
	However, the minister should take the time to read the only 
speech by the only opposition member authorized to speak in the 
House at second reading. The hon. member for Portneuf also 
wanted to speak at second reading, but the hon. member for 
Macleod, after only a few minutes, a few seconds, called the 
previous question.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This caused some confusion in the House and, as a result, there 
was only one speaker for each party at second reading. The 
minister, after hesitating for months and months, as his predecessor 
had done, tabled this bill before Christmas. The debate at second 
reading was on December 5.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8701"> 8701 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a venerable parliamentary strategy. A government that 
wants to pass controversial bills will table them at the end of a 
session, either in December or in June. They know that, at 
Christmas time, people are busy with their Christmas shopping. 
The minister purposely tabled his bill at that time because he did 
not want this bill to give rise to debate.
<P>
	The Reform Party also did not want a debate, to the point that, 
when the minister announced that the bill would be tabled on 
December 5 at his news conference of December 1, the 
spokesperson for the Reform Party, who had not read the text, as no 
one had a copy at that point, immediately agreed in principle to 
ensure that the bill was passed as quickly as possible. That takes the 
cake. An opposition party that gives its approval before even 
reading the bill and its clauses.
<P>
	When the Minister of Health uses a member of the third party 
who takes such positions, I think he is putting his credibility on the 
line. It makes no sense. How can you support a bill if you have not 
read it? In any case, we in the official opposition do not make a 
practice of doing so and we are not going to start now. We take the 
time to read the bills.
<P>
	We supported the minister's objectives, but had reservations 
about sponsorship. I said so in my speech as the official opposition 
critic on tobacco. This week the Prime Minister quoted my 
remarks, noting that I had said we supported the minister's 
objectives.
<P>
	That is true, but the Prime Minister should have finished reading 
and mentioned that we had reservations about the restrictions 
imposed on the sponsorship of sporting and cultural events and 
that, if none of the changes proposed were accepted by the Minister 
of Health or the government, and I said it even then, we would 
oppose the bill at third reading. We did not reverse our position, as 
the minister suggests, we did not do an about-face under the 
influence of the tobacco lobby.
<P>
	I suggest the Minister of Health look to see who gives the most 
to the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is funded by the tobacco 
companies, and is not bothered by the fact-rather interesting 
behaviour. On one hand, it is acceptable for the Liberal Party to 
receive contributions from tobacco companies and, on the other 
hand, we are being accused of being the tobacco companies' 
accomplices. We are nobody's accomplices.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports cultural and sports events. To this 
extent, we are their allies because their very survival is at stake. 
This is what we support. The government side is implying all sorts 
of things. No matter how calm the minister sounds in appealing for 
common sense on this health issue, we will not let him pull the 
wool over our eyes.
<P>
	Who is the most opportunistic, the minister or us? Who, as he 
said, is being hypocritical, when the Liberal  government while 
waging a war against tobacco products does not dare put them on 
the list of dangerous and illegal substances? And why not? Because 
the federal government alone stands to make $2.6 billion from 
taxes on tobacco products, as the budget reveals. The other 
jurisdictions in Canada will reap another $2 billion, for a grand 
total of $4.6 billion.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	They will not recognize tobacco as a dangerous and illegal 
product; that would be the logical thing to do but no, they want the 
revenues from that dangerous but nonetheless legal product.
<P>
	We can very well hold a debate on the risks associated with 
smoking. At the second reading stage, during the speech I made as 
the official opposition critic in this area, I did admit that tobacco 
was a dangerous product, as demonstrated by scientific studies. 
The most serious study on the subject was conducted by scientists 
at the University of Texas and the Beckman Institute in California. 
They found a direct link between lung cancer, some other forms of 
cancer, and smoking.
<P>
	That study refers to a carcinogenic substance and to the P-53 
gene, which weakens the body's immune system, its resistance to 
illnesses that may cause cancer in the long term. We do recognize 
that. Statistics show that, every year, 42,000 people in Canada, 
including 12,000 in Quebec, die of cancer or lung diseases related 
to smoking. We do admit there is a problem.
<P>
	But should we proceed within a legal framework on this issue? 
Yes, we could establish a legal framework for a government 
initiative, program or policy. But then again, that legislation would 
have to be enforceable, balanced, well designed, sensible. It would 
have to provide for a well structured implementation over time so it 
can be enforced. Because a law people do not comply with is 
unenforceable as it would require much more than the 40 
inspectors we now have to make sure it is implemented. At present, 
in all of Canada, only 40 federal inspectors supervise the 
enforcement of the existing legislation. There already is a 
legislation providing for the monitoring of convenience stores to 
ensure they do not sell tobacco products to young people under 18. 
This legislation is not new; it already exists. We are adding a few 
details like the identity card, but the law already exists.
<P>
	Yet, a serious study shows that, in Canada in general, it is not 
being enforced in 25 per cent of cases, while in Quebec the rate is 
almost 50 per cent, apparently because federal inspectors do not go 
there much. Why should we pass a new law when we know that the 
existing one is neither enforced nor enforceable? Why?
<P>
	Why is this legislation unbalanced? I will give you an example. 
The government does not appeal enough to the accountability of 
citizens, young people and parents. For instance, for corner stores 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8702"> 8702 </A></B>
<P>
and other retailers who sell  tobacco products, this legislation 
provides for significant fines that I find excessive, while the 
offender himself would not be fined.
<P>
	Let us take the example of the legislation on alcohol. How does 
it work? Of course, fines are imposed on those who serve alcohol to 
minors but, at the same time, minors are also penalized: they are 
arrested and must go to court. You will tell me that it is a youth 
court, but they still have to appear before the judge. And parents 
who do not abide by the legislation on alcohol, at least in Quebec, 
are also questioned.
<P>
	But that is not the case here. Yet, according to the health minister 
and the parliamentary secretary and many others, tobacco is more 
dangerous than alcohol. However, we know that drinking and 
driving may create problems; many accidents are caused by 
alcohol. Why this inconsistency?
<P>
	Here is another inconsistency. In the health committee, of which 
I am a member, we see there is some responsiveness. I am not 
taking a final stand on this, because it has not been discussed in our 
caucus yet. For example, there are some who think that marijuana 
and hashish, which are soft drugs, should be legalized. Why? 
Because, these people are saying: ``If they were legal, they would 
be better controlled. The government could better ensure the 
quality of the products and they would be less dangerous for young 
people''.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Does making drugs illegal reduce the use of so-called soft drugs 
and even harder drugs? On the contrary, make them illegal and use 
increases. Is legislation effective enough in itself to prevent 
increased use of tobacco, alcohol or any other substance?
<P>
	We could go back in time and look at what happened when 
alcohol was made illegal. In the United States, in the 1930s, they 
had something called prohibition. Being my senior, Mr. Speaker, 
you will recall the incredible impact banning alcoholic drinks had, 
the resulting increase in contraband and crime for instance. I am a 
baby boomer, but my parents often told me stories about those 
days.
<P>
	Without getting into Al Capone in Chicago and all that, we all 
remember stories about that era; there were even movies made 
about it. A purely legal or legislative approach is not enough to 
fight something that may be bad in itself.
<P>
	Before sitting on the health committee, I was the official 
opposition's critic for youth and training. That is the line that 
should be developed, that should have been developed. It was 
suggested earlier that the Bloc Quebecois had somewhat 
ambiguous, hypocritical and paradoxical positions. I have a figure 
here showing that, when he announced he was imposing a special 
surtax on tobacco two years ago, the Minister of Finance told us it 
would bring in $180 million in additional revenue, which  would be 
used to fund this great prevention campaign and ensure better 
control. How was this $180 million used? In fact, $40 million was 
spent.
<P>
	I am looking over the figures for this year. But, this year, what is 
the government doing? It is legislating. With this legislation, given 
how concerned the minister, his parliamentary secretary and the 
Liberal members are about public health, we would have thought 
the government would have used at least that $180 million. Yet, 
only $10 million was spent on prevention and another $18 million 
on control and inspection, for a grand total of $28 million. That is 
far from $180 million. What did they do with the rest of the 
money? Where have these millions gone?
<P>
	I will tell you what happened to these millions. There were 
spent, among other things, to promote Canadian unity, to the tune 
of $23 million for flags, sweaters and all kinds of gadgets. I can tell 
you about it, because a provincial final is currently being held in 
my riding, as part of the Quebec Games. I try to attend this 
extraordinary event as often as possible, and I urge people to the 
same and go to my riding of Lévis, because it is the first time these 
games are organized by a RCM, a group of municipalities getting 
together to put up a major event.
<P>
	What did the federal government do? The heritage minister came 
barging in and, pretty well at the last minute, announced a 
$100,000 subsidy, but with one condition: the Canadian flag would 
have to be up there and the athletes would have to wear sweaters 
that promote the flag and Canadian unity. We are talking about the 
provincial finals of the Quebec Games. Can you believe it? The 
heritage minister has some nerve.
<P>
	With the $63 million that it is spending, hers is the only 
department that got a budget increase this year, when the 
government was cutting elsewhere, including in transfer payments 
to the provinces for health, the notorious Canada social transfer, 
which now also includes post-secondary education and social 
assistance. The government is indeed making deep cuts in these 
areas.
<P>
	On the other hand, it spends on things like that. Oddly enough, 
this $63 million is roughly the same amount that sports and cultural 
events will lose, those $60 million in sponsorships, if the bill is 
passed this evening and if the Senate then gives it approval.
<P>
	Given that difference of only $3 million, the heritage minister, 
who is just as convinced as her colleagues are, that is the health 
minister and the parliamentary secretary, should have taken that 
$63 million to compensate organizers of sports and cultural events, 
since the amounts are basically the same.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	But no, they put Canadian unity ahead of health in this case. 
When Bloc Quebecois members talk about the survival of cultural 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8703"> 8703 </A></B>
<P>
and sports events, we are told that we  are putting culture and the 
promotion of sports ahead of national health objectives.
<P>
	The government, however, promotes its flags, handing them out 
for free, and we in the Bloc Quebecois are expected to say nothing. 
Do not count on it, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps not you personally, you 
have an objective, non-partisan role, but through you, those 
members who make appeals to us, the minister who speaks from 
the heart, who says to the Minister of Canadian Heritage: ``Listen, 
if you are as concerned about the health objective as I am, take part 
of the $63 million, if not all of it, and apply it to that''.
<P>
	First of all, the health minister should be consistent. Let him take 
the $180 million set aside for prevention, promotion and education. 
Let him so something constructive. Then we would take him 
seriously when he talks about our judgment, our humanity and the 
health objectives. Then we would take him seriously.
<P>
	The minister should himself get serious and spend the money 
accordingly on sports and cultural events, and at the same time, in 
addition-because he is apparently sure of his objectives 
concerning young people-he would then take an important 
dimension seriously.
<P>
	A number of studies show that, in 80 per cent of cases, young 
people decide whether or not to take up smoking around the age of 
15 or 16. The main reason young people smoke is not because they 
have seen a logo for tobacco products on a car racing at speeds of 
200 kilometres an hour and up; that is not the reason at all. It is not 
because of a logo seen at the site of a sports or cultural event, for 
these events draw more adults than young people. This is not why 
they smoke. The primary reason, in over 50 per cent of cases, is 
because their friends smoke. They want to copy what their friends 
are doing. They want to be one of the gang, so they start smoking. 
That is the main reason they start.
<P>
	If the minister were serious, he ought to accept our 
recommendations. During the clause by clause examination, we 
said ``If it is peer pressure that gets young people to start smoking, 
why not make use of this real social fact and provide funding for 
youth centres and other youth organizations that are so much in 
need of funding?'' These organizations have had their funding cut, 
federal funding in particular. There could be programs focussed on 
prevention, young people speaking to others in the schools, telling 
them not to smoke, for young people are very much aware of the 
issue.
<P>
	I have had experience with youth-related issues. Before I was an 
MP, I always worked in youth organizations, and I have a fairly 
good idea how young people think about certain things. I am not 
worried, not pessimistic. I think our young people are becoming 
increasingly aware about certain things; we could even learn a 
thing or two from them.
<P>
	Who has more influence on today's young people than other 
young people? Sometimes I revert to an old habit, and throw out a 
piece of paper. How do young people react to this most of the time? 
They say: ``No, no, not there. It goes for recycling''. Our children 
make themselves responsible for recycling at home, but they also 
talk about it at school, and they talk to us about the environment. 
The environment is important to our young people, and smoke is an 
environmental contaminant.
<P>
	Since the minister is no longer here, I shall now address the 
parliamentary secretary. Why does he not encourage his minister, if 
he is serious about this, to put the planned $180 million, at least 
that much, into programs for young people?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Why not give more money to anti-tobacco groups? I have 
personally met representatives of all groups and all lobbies, 
whatever you want to call them. The Bloc Quebecois, unlike the 
minister, took the time to listen to everyone. Not just one group but 
everyone, including representatives of anti-tobacco groups. There 
are intelligent people in those groups, people with sincere 
convictions.
<P>
	Far be it from for me to insult people who have done a wonderful 
job telling young people about the dangers of tobacco use. 
Unfortunately, although the minister tried to avoid this debate by 
putting the matter before Parliament at a time when the public's 
attention was elsewhere, it happened just the same. The debate was 
there during our Christmas parties. The subject was discussed at 
family gatherings. And after the holidays, people started to realize 
what was at stake and that they might lose the Montreal Grand Prix 
and other major cultural and sports events that were very popular, 
and they started to demonstrate their opposition, as we saw in 
Montreal this week.
<P>
	If there had been a healthy debate, properly set up, and if there 
had been consultations conducted properly, well planned and 
unbiased, not this steamroller approach so Quebecers and 
Canadians would not realize what hit them. If instead of this 
inappropriate approach to lawmaking, the government had shown a 
spirit of transparency and openness and respect for different 
opinions.
<P>
	Those who support tobacco company sponsorships of cultural 
and sports events could have talked to the public. People I spoke to 
personally, in private, said they were appalled at what was 
happening to cultural and sports events. They are appalled. They 
have nothing against those who promote culture. Of course, when 
they defend a position, opinions tend to crystallize, and finally no 
reconciliation seems possible. But what do you expect? The 
minister talks to only one side, he hears only one side of the story 
and will not allow any consultation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8704"> 8704 </A></B>
<P>
	When you want to draft a bill, you organize forums, you have 
consultations and meetings in the provinces, you ask the provinces 
whether they agree, to get their co-operation, because the subject 
we are talking about today is our health. Incidentally, I may 
remind you, and I am sure you know, but it seems we often forget 
what it says in the Constitution about health. Perhaps the Minister 
of Heritage should have the Constitution printed in pamphlet form 
so Canadians across the country will know what is in the 
Constitution. Those who read them would see that health is a 
provincial matter. Where does the word ``province'' appear in the 
bill?
<P>
	With my colleague from Drummond, in committee, when the 
bill was being studied clause by clause and on many occasions, I 
tried to say: ``Include at least `in co-operation with the provinces'''. 
But no, the Minister of Health wanted to be the defender of health 
and take his place in history as the man who had an extraordinary 
anti smoking bill passed. He wanted credit for it, so much so that, 
seeing the consternation it caused in his own caucus and in cabinet, 
the minister said, in public, before anti smoking lobbies, that, if 
this bill were not passed before the elections, he would put his 
liberal beliefs, his convictions and his membership in the Liberal 
Party on the line. He even suggested to people that they vote 
against the Liberal Party in the next elections.
<P>
	In doing so, he put pressure on the other members of cabinet. 
There are people on the other side, members from Quebec, 
including the member for Outremont, the Secretary of State 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development in 
Quebec, who said suddenly: ``Hang on, I am powerful, influential, I 
will get the minister to change his position. You will see''. He 
listened to the representatives of sporting and cultural events, 
because, several months later, he discovered the economic 
importance of it all: $200 million in economic benefits for the 
Montreal region, 2,000 jobs.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	A few months later, after the holiday season, he discovered that 
it could adversely affect him in his own riding. He had not thought 
of it before, but he must have been told so in some Christmas 
parties. So the Secretary of State responsible for the Federal Office 
of Regional Development in Quebec finally realized that.
<P>
	The president of the Liberal caucus in Quebec realized that, but 
as he could feel the heat, he suggested that an election be held. 
Now, another president of the Liberal caucus is making promises. 
The extension was one year, he asked for it to be 18 months, and he 
won. After that, he thought he might just as well ask for a five-year 
period, but he was turned down. The Minister of Health told him it 
was enough.
<P>
	Of course, even if he is from Quebec, from the riding of 
Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister himself then had to support the 
decisions of his Minister of Health. He was compelled to state that 
the most important thing for him  was Canadians' health. Come on. 
We know him well. We saw him in action during the referendum 
campaign. He said he would make changes and he did try a little, 
but as soon as the provincial premiers did not agree, that was the 
end of his efforts. A little motion was moved in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Oh yes, we know him. He is the one who, when he was Minister 
of Justice and acting on behalf of former Prime Minister Trudeau, 
imposed patriation of the Constitution from London and the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Today, he tells us that 
Canadians and Quebecers' health is what counts the most as far as 
he is concerned and that he will make this issue a plank in his 
electoral platform.
<P>
	The Minister of Health reminded us of that when the Liberal 
Party agreed to delay application of some restrictions for 18 
months. He will hear about it during the electoral campaign. The 
voters will talk about it, the official opposition too.
<P>
	The bill is so imprecise and deliberately confused that it leaves 
room for all kinds of interpretation and speculation. Everybody is 
confused. For example, the organizers of the Grand Prix de 
Montréal claim that, according to this bill, if passed, people could 
not even watch the Australian Grand Prix this weekend on 
television.
<P>
	Sponsorship of events such as the Grand Prix is a package deal. I 
have no respect for tobacco companies who use blackmail but, 
because of this bill and because of the anxiety caused by its 
adoption, Quebecers may not be able this weekend to watch 
Jacques Villeneuve race in the Australian Grand Prix. He is the son 
of Gilles Villeneuve, and the potential world champion driver this 
year.
<P>
	This morning, the plane I took from Quebec City was delayed 
due to a terrible storm. People recognized me and told me they 
were hoping I would rise and speak about this, because they want to 
see Jacques Villeneuve compete in the Australian Grand Prix over 
the weekend. They absolutely want to see him.
<P>
	It is not a totally sure thing. This is a very particular event, very 
current, and it just goes to prove that the 18-month extension 
proposed by the president of the caucus applies only to clause 24. 
The parliamentary secretary knows quite well that it applies only to 
clause 24 and not to clause 31.
<P>
	What is in clause 31? It deals to retransmission. The 18-month 
adjustment period does not apply to that clause. I am sure that some 
Liberal members are not aware of that. Therre are not many of 
them, but maybe they are listening.
<P>
	I urge them to do as the member for Outremont did, even if it is a 
bit late; I urge them to read clause 31 of Bill C-71 which they will 
pass tonight. It deals with retransmission. They will see that the 
18-month  adjustment period does not apply to clause 31. Clause 31 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8705"> 8705 </A></B>
<P>
is really special, it means a tobacco company's logo cannot appear 
on a car.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	If this is allowed, if a tobacco company's logo or name appears 
on the car, TV networks will have to distort the image. It would be 
somewhat similar to what is done in a news report when witnesses 
want to remain anonymous for whatever reason. Their image is 
then distorted to ensure they are not recognized.
<P>
	Imagine the next formula 1 race with TV cameras trying to 
distort only the cigarette company's name appearing on the car so 
that it cannot be recognized. Imagine that Gilles Villeneuve is 
sponsored by a tobacco company, we will not be able to see him. If 
he comes first, I imagine they will go to the runner-up, but since 
most racers are sponsored by tobacco companies, the only one they 
might be allowed to show will be the one who came in last. This 
does not make sense. Usually people are interested in the driver 
who comes in first not last. This is rather odd.
<P>
	But it is the truth. The member who is grinning should look at 
clause 31 and ask a lawyer to review it. If he is of the opinion that 
what I am saying is wrong, the member should have his health 
minister make a solemn statement to that effect in this House 
before we adjourn, as he did the other day, with good reason.
<P>
	The job of the opposition is to criticize, but sometimes we have 
to recognize that the minister does set the record straight. For 
example, some people in Quebec, and perhaps elsewhere, are 
saying that it would prohibit persons under 18 years of age from 
being hired at convenience stores. Indeed, it was not clear.
<P>
	We wondered, we asked questions and so did Reform members. 
In a solemn declaration, the minister said: ``It is not in the bill. It is 
not in, but I commit myself to not prohibiting it by way of 
regulations''. He said it would not make any sense. He took that 
solemn pledge. We are asking him to do the same for the 
broadcasting of Grand Prix auto races. We want him to say: 
``Section 31 is so convoluted that you could read into it one thing 
and its opposite''.
<P>
	That is saying quite a lot. If I had more time, I would prove to 
you that this bill has been put together in such a way that some 
sections are totally incomprehensible. Nobody can understand 
them.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not even the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> The minister wants to go to the Supreme Court with 
that. We are in this situation because parts of previous legislation 
dealing with sponsorship was struck down by the Supreme Court. 
From my office in the Confederation Building, I can see the 
Supreme Court. Maybe I am prejudiced, but it seems to me that it is 
always leaning to the west. But I may be over-reacting.
<P>
	First, the Supreme Court is in Ontario and most of the judges 
come from Ontario. Most of the time, when there are decisions 
involving Quebec, we are in the House. We have become rather 
suspicious when it comes to relying on the Supreme Court to 
interpret a piece of legislation. It is not that we are suspicious by 
nature, it is because we have facts. There is a lot of evidence which 
prove that Bill 101 was badly tampered with by the Supreme Court. 
But that is not what we are dealing with this morning.
<P>
	For a minister to be this tentative on each and every aspect of a 
bill is unusual indeed. I asked my colleague, the hon. member for 
Chambly about this, since he sits on the committee that deals with 
the scrutiny of regulations and the administration of legislation. He 
told me that they have rarely seen an act worded the way this one is, 
where the minister is so afraid his act will be thrown out of court 
that he reserves the right to regulate each and every aspect of the 
issue, instead of mentioning his power to make regulations only 
once, as usually is the case. The word ``may'' is used over and over 
again, all over the place, regarding sponsorships, sales, the way the 
product should be regulated, and so on.
<P>
	The minister is so concerned that he will be making regulations 
on just about everything. But at the same time, it has to be said that 
the minister is grabbing a great deal of power in an area which, in 
theory, is none of his concern, since this is a health issue. Again, 
the provinces are not even mentioned.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The minister has arranged it in such a way that he will be pulling 
all the strings and retaining full power through regulations. The 
thing is, we would like him to table his regulations in this House. 
We would have liked him to do so while the bill was before us, but 
at least he should do so very soon. In fact, we have moved an 
amendment to that effect.
<P>
	The official opposition has acted constructively, proposing a 
series of regulations at the clause by clause review stage of the bill. 
We succeeded in having one agreed to, regarding vending machines 
with remote controls. We had to negotiate long and hard for this 
and we were quite proud of ourselves. We won this point in 
committee, but now, at report stage, what do we see? The words got 
changed around to read only vending machines with locking 
devices. That is what would be allowed, even in bars where 
customers under the age of 18 are not admitted. They want to put 
tobacco into the category of illegal and dangerous substances and 
treat it as such, requiring that it be kept under lock and key, even in 
places where children are not admitted.
<P>
	I am running out of time. I will not go into histrionics, I will 
simply encourage the members across the way to do their duty as 
lawmakers and, unlike the hon. member from the Reform Party, not 
to rush into supporting a bill before getting a copy of the bill and 
reviewing it thoroughly, particularly clauses 31 and 53, where the  
presumption of innocence is reversed and the onus or burden of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8706"> 8706 </A></B>
<P>
proof that should be on the accused is on the victim instead of the 
other way around.
<P>
	I will conclude on this: read your bills, as it is your duty as 
Liberal members, before voting for or against them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand in the 
House today as a parliamentarian who truly believes that we should 
have small government with as few rules and regulations as 
possible and that personal responsibility is very important. I try to 
judge every piece of legislation by those yardsticks.
<P>
	On this issue I could be and have been accused of forgetting 
freedom. I could be accused of forgetting the fact that individuals 
who decide to smoke should have that ability and that 
responsibility. Therefore I would like to explain to my colleagues 
in the House and those people in Canada who are interested in this 
issue why I have chosen to support and vote for Bill C-71.
<P>
	I do not often trust statistics, especially statistics that are 
gathered by those on the various sides of an issue. I made my own 
graph of cigarette consumption per capita for Canada and the 
United States between 1970 and 1994. I used figures that are 
completely independent of any side on this issue.
<P>
	The graph illustrates that over the past 20-plus years the 
incidence of smoking in Canada and the U.S. has been declining, 
and declining considerably, in lock step in fact. The graph is 
fascinating. Since I cannot show it in the House, I can only 
demonstrate with my hand that the graph is like a toboggan hill 
with both Canadian and American per capita consumption rates in 
lock step coming down.
<P>
	For the previous 15 years there had been no interruption in that 
downward slope. However, in 1993 the Canadian smoking rate 
went up while the U.S. smoking rate did not. The increase in the 
Canadian smoking rate makes the slope of the graph look like the 
lip on a ski jump.
<P>
	Two things have happened in Canada during the time I have 
spent in this House: a tobacco tax rollback, where the price was 
reduced in some provinces; and the supreme court striking down 
the Tobacco Products Control Act, which was designed to prevent 
smoking.
<P>
	I also independently found the figures on overall Canadian 
tobacco consumption which include cigarettes sold over the 
counter, roll your own cigarettes, non-smoke tobacco like snuff and 
so on, the contraband market, smuggled cigarettes. I kept the 
grouping together as much as possible. I found that between 1990 
and 1991, overall consumption went down in Canada by 6 per cent. 
It then dropped almost half a per cent. The next year it dropped 
3.49 per cent. This verifies what was in  the other figures, that there 
was a downhill trend. However, in 1994 consumption went up 9.2 
per cent.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	These are very new statistics available through access to 
information. The results show what happened the first year after 
advertising of tobacco products was re-legalized.
<P>
	After the Tobacco Product Control Act, which affected the 
legality of advertising, was struck down in 1996, advertising could 
resume and the results were powerful. Brand switching did not 
significantly take place during that year when advertising was 
re-allowed.
<P>
	It is fascinating to look at what happened in the high tax 
provinces and the low tax provinces. When the tax rollback took 
place some provinces did not lower their taxes. In those provinces 
where taxes stayed high, the increase in smoking in 1996 was 1.72 
per cent. In the low tax provinces it was 2.32 per cent. That 
demonstrates to me a price sensitivity in tobacco consumption, 
especially for youth.
<P>
	Overall per capita consumption in Canada went up 2.32 per cent 
during the year when advertising was allowed. Those figures say to 
me that advertising sponsorship has an effect on youth.
<P>
	Another tidbit of information that is not commonly known is that 
chewing tobacco was on its way out. Chewing tobacco was very 
popular around the turn of the century. We have all seen the 
pictures of the cowboy and the spittoon. Chewing tobacco is 
another form of nicotine consumption. There were only two groups 
who continued to use chewing tobacco in North America: rodeo 
cowboys and baseball players.
<P>
	The consumption of chewing tobacco can be very clearly 
graphed and then an advertising program took place. We hear that 
the main factor in tobacco consumption is peer related. There was 
no peer relationship with smokeless tobacco. An advertising 
program was undertaken by one of the young, new chewing 
tobacco companies. It is fascinating to see what has happened. I 
will not mention the name. I do not want to give these companies 
an advertising presence in the House, but I have watched the name 
of chewing tobacco appear on race cars. I have watched chewing 
tobacco advertisements occur at drag races. I have watched 
chewing tobacco appear at rodeos.
<P>
	Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that chewing tobacco consumption 
has gone up? It is much more prevalent today than it was. That says 
to me that an advertising campaign completely independent of any 
peer group pressure can change human behaviour.
<P>
	I consequently said that my responsibility on this bill was to be 
non-partisan since I actually started out believing that this 
approach was nonsense, that there was no way to change human 
behaviour, that government  intervention in this area was 
worthless. Having changed my mind, I went to my colleagues and 
said: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8707"> 8707 </A></B>
<P>
``I believe this bill will have an effect on youth''. As a group we 
decided to do whatever we could do to make sure no roadblocks 
were put in the way of the bill.
<P>
	Why did we decide to expedite it? I found that Jake Epp, who 
was mentioned before, took 13 months, plus or minus, to get his 
bill through the House of Commons. Because 10,000 kids a month 
take up smoking, and if it took 13 months to get the bill through the 
House, I felt it would be unconscionable. How did we decide to 
expedite it? We made sure there were no procedural wrangles that 
could lengthen the time interval that this bill would stay in the 
House.
<P>
	Consequently, when I made my speech at second reading I asked 
for the question to be now put. What happened was fascinating. 
There was confusion in the House. All that needed to happen was 
for a member to stand and say debate and the debate would have 
gone on, but there would be no chance of procedural wrangling. It 
was interesting that the debate collapsed. My colleagues were 
ticked off at me because they said they did not get a chance to 
speak. I had members opposite speak to me.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I want Canadians to know there was not a Liberal on the other 
side of the House who had a clue what I was going to do. Not a 
member of the Bloc had a clue what I was going to do. I simply 
decided to prevent procedural wrangling. It was very effective, 
effective beyond my wildest dreams.
<P>
	On the issue of sponsorship and job losses, my colleagues in the 
Bloc feel as strongly about this issue as I do. I have an interest in 
race cars and racing. I have raced on the same track on the same 
day as Jacques Villeneuve's father, Gilles Villeneuve. I still own a 
race car and I still race although my political job has messed it up 
quite royally.
<P>
	I am fearful of anything that threatens the Grand Prix de 
Montréal. I very carefully looked at what has happened with 
tobacco sponsorship in other countries, with a view toward 
protecting my hobby, my interest, my avocation and the value of 
my race car.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> It was pretty well self-interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> It was self-interest for sure.
<P>
	France sought to ban all tobacco advertising effective in 1993. 
There was a huge outcry from sponsorship groups. FISA, the group 
that governs motor sport throughout the world, organizers of the 
Grand Prix circuit, announced the French Grand Prix of 1993 
would be withdrawn.
<P>
	The French Grand Prix is the longest running grand prix in 
history. To those people in France the grand prix is extremely 
important. The threat occurred before the law was passed in 1993. 
The sponsorship ban in France  went through. The 1993 French 
Grand Prix was held. The 1994 French Grand Prix was held. The 
1995 French Grand Prix was held. The 1996 French Grand Prix was 
held. The 1997 French Grand Prix will be held devoid of tobacco 
sponsorship.
<P>
	Exactly the same argument was made about jobs for advertisers 
and the advertising industry, that there would be a huge withdrawal 
of funds to the advertising industry and jobs would be lost. My 
colleague in the Bloc is concerned and rightfully so for jobs in the 
advertising industry. I have testimony saying that 22 per cent of the 
labour force working directly in the outdoor advertising industry 
would be lost. It is a big deal.
<P>
	The president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of Canada 
wrote to a marketing magazine. Tobacco advertising had been 
banned in Canada and he wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ad ban under the Tobacco Products Control Act was arguably one of the best 
things to ever happen to our industry. It drove our members to develop other 
advertising categories so that today packaged goods, not tobacco, are our largest 
spending group. The loss of tobacco revenues has been completely recouped and 
then some.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are being given a bill of goods from self-interest groups. Let 
me refer to the issue of the shopkeeper bearing all the onus. When a 
youngster goes into a shop to buy cigarettes and is sold cigarettes 
the shopkeeper is fined. I have listened to the shopkeepers at home. 
They are quite concerned that their businesses will be wrecked and 
that there will be cigarette inspectors throughout the country.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I tried hard to amend the bill to put some onus of responsibility 
on the youth who broke the law. I wanted a small fine for the 
15-year old who went into the shop to buy cigarettes. It would be a 
slap on the wrist: ``Don't do that. It is illegal''. That was my one 
attempt to amend the bill. I was not looking for procedural 
wrangling. I tried to make that little attempt but it was 
unsuccessful.
<P>
	Another big issue for my party and me was the regulations which 
put meat on the bones of the act. Over and over again I have 
lobbied for the regulations to be scrutinized by the whatever 
committee would be appropriate, which in this case was the health 
committee. I put those proposals, ideas and thoughts forward. I had 
hopes the minister would hear me out on the issue and the 
regulations would be scrutinized.
<P>
	As it turned out, a Liberal member put forward such an 
amendment which through design or mess up was passed. I was 
told the scrutiny of regulations was against parliamentary tradition.
<P>
	This is an historic occasion. It will not be noticed by the press or 
by those worried about tobacco. However as a health committee we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8708"> 8708 </A></B>
<P>
will receive the regulations, may do a study of them and make 
changes. I circle the word may. I sincerely hope the member who 
put forward the  amendment gets huge credit for having done so. 
The scrutiny of regulations will take place by elected 
representatives and not just by order in council. That little one is 
great for me; it is my smile on the tobacco bill.
<P>
	I must say a few words to my smoking friends, those people 
whom I tried all my life in my capacity as a physician to convince 
not to smoke. I hope they can stop. I have expressed words of 
advice. I know how tough it is. To that end I have looked at the 
cancer statistics.
<P>
	I see the ads for cigarettes which try to convince young women: 
``You've come a long way, baby''. I will talk about cancer of 
females for now. From 1970 to 1995 colorectal cancer has dropped 
somewhat. Ovarian cancer has stayed reasonably level. Stomach 
cancer has come down. Cervical cancer has come down. Cancer of 
the uterus has come down slightly. Melanoma has stayed static. 
However there is one cancer that has taken off like a rocket ship, 
cancer of the lung. It has gone from less than 10 per 100,000 to 
almost 35 per 100,000. It is the only female cancer that has taken 
off.
<P>
	There is only one reason for this in our female population, in our 
young women, in our wives and in our daughters: ``You've come a 
long way, baby. You've learned how to smoke''. It is a shame. I 
hope this will be very evident to the young women.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The bill will soon go to the other place. I will watch with great 
interest certain of the individuals there, three very prominent 
senators: Michael Kirby, William Kelly and Roch Bolduc, all of 
whom are very intimately involved in the tobacco industry. They 
are on the boards of these big companies. I will watch them very 
carefully to see whether or not they will vote on these issues. If 
ever there has been a conflict of interest on a voting issue, there it 
is. I will watch with profound interest to see what happens. Will 
they abstain?
<P>
	Before I came to Parliament I made a little promise to myself 
that if I were ever offered compensation for changing my mind on 
something I would not do it. That is a nice way of putting what I 
would like to say very strongly. I cannot say the word that I would 
like to say because it is inappropriate to use it in the House.
<P>
	One night not so long ago I received a phone call. The person on 
the line said: ``Doc, if you change your mind on this bill it will 
mean something to you personally in a financial way. If your party 
changes its mind on this bill funds will flow''. I am making that 
announcement in the House of Commons today. I as a member of 
Parliament was offered compensation for changing my mind on 
this issue.
<P>
	I have a lighthearted but not so lighthearted request for the 
tobacco companies. They are looking for things to sponsor. They 
are looking for areas to put their money. What if they sponsored 
funeral parlours? What if they  put a little sign on every hearse 
saying that it is sponsored by the tobacco company involved?
<P>
	I considered the approach taken on the bill. I thought it was the 
wrong way to go. I am still not sure the bill is perfect. I find flaws 
and holes in it.
<P>
	When I went to Parliament the people at home said that I should 
try to be as non-partisan as I could and try to support legislative 
measures that would make a difference. For the 10,000 children per 
month who are taking up tobacco, half of whom will die 
prematurely, I say that the bill is imperfect but it is better than a 
vacuum.
<P>
	I will reflect back on the first patient I had as a medical student. 
The fellow was a veteran. He was my very first assignment. I was a 
green, untrained medical student in the Mewburn pavilion at the 
University of Alberta. He had emphysema. He had smoked all of 
his life. He was dying; he was literally at the end of his life. He was 
on oxygen. I went to visit him day after day after day. I was getting 
to know what it was like to deal with a patient, to listen to 
somebody in distress and to watch him slowly slip away.
<P>
	His last words to me were: ``Doc, don't let the young kids 
smoke''. He did not last much longer. I will never forget him. I will 
never forget his advice to me. In my judgment this legislation will 
help in the quest not to let the young kids smoke. Let me close by 
saying with memory of my first patient: ``Don't let young kids 
smoke''.

	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a most important debate. We are debating a social 
issue: our society's values. What will be the future of our young 
people? Should we try to reduce the number of smokers and, if 
possible, eliminate smoking completely? On our side of the House, 
we think so.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	I strongly support Bill C-71, even more so because I had the 
honour to introduce, in the Quebec National Assembly, the first 
legislation in Canada protecting non-smokers, Bill 84. I have heard 
the opponents of this bill.
<P>
	Bloc members claim that it is almost as an attack against 
Quebec, against freedom of expression, and even that Montreal's 
economic future is in jeopardy. True to form, members of the PQ 
and the BQ said that it was Quebec against the rest of Canada, the 
rest of Canada against Quebec. Those who vote for the bill are 
against Quebec and against Montreal's economic future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8709"> 8709 </A></B>
<P>
	The media opposed to the bill even called those who support Bill 
C-71 ayatollahs, and now the Bloc's big guns have adopted the 
term. There are goodies and baddies,  and yet, I wonder if this is 
such a clear cut issue in Quebec.
<P>
	Let me name just a few of the hundreds of organizations that 
support Bill C-71, as I would not have the time to name them all: 
the Association des cardiologues du Québec, the Association des 
médecins de langue française du Canada, the City of Montreal's 
public health branch, all the hospitals in the Montreal region and 
across the province, all the CLSCs, l'Association des étudiants du 
Département d'éducation physique de l'Université Laval-these 
people definitely have an interest in sports-the Association 
régionale du sport étudiant de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the 
Association régionale du sport étudiant du 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, the Association régionale du sport 
étudiant Laurentides-Lanaudière, the Gouffre school board, in 
school board, the Fédération québécoise du sport étudiant, the 
Maison des jeunes d'Amos Inc., the Maison des jeunes de 
Desbiens, l'Illusion, the Maison des jeunes de Saint-Jovite, the 
Maison des jeunes du Bas-Saguenay, the municipality of 
Lotbinière, the municipality of Saint-Bruno-de-Kamouraska, the 
municipality of Saint-Simon-de-Rimouski, the regional county 
municipality of Rivière-du-Loup, the City of Deux-Montagnes, the 
City of Rimouski, the City of Roberval, the City of Saint-Félicien, 
and hundreds of other cities, CLSCs, sports organizations, etc. Are 
these people ayatollahs of tobacco?
<P>
	Are the countries that are taking similar measures, and those that 
have already done so, ayatollahs of tobacco? France, Germany, the 
United Kingdom, Belgium, Australia, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, 
Finland and, in 1998, the United States with much stricter 
legislation than the bill before us, are these countries also 
ayatollahs of tobacco? Do they not understand?
<P>
	On December 10, 1992, the Fédération internationale du sport 
automobile (FISA) stated unequivocally that the French Grand Prix 
was over, that it was going to be cancelled. Four years later, the 
French Grand Prix is still going strong and, in 1997, Jacques 
Villeneuve will definitely try to win it. The Grand Prix will still be 
there in 1998-99, in the year 2000 and well beyond that.
<P>
	In 1988, officials of the Canadian open golf championship said 
that if Du Maurier withdrew its support, it would be the end of that 
event. Yet, this golf championship will be held in Montreal this 
year, with the support of Bell Canada. The Virginia Slims women's 
tennis tournament is still going strong, even though Virginia Slims 
was replaced by Corel. At one time, the Australian world tennis 
tournament was sponsored by Marlboro; now, it is sponsored by 
Ford.
<P>
	It has been said that Bill C-71 would deal a deadly blow to 
Montreal. It has been said that the economic future of Montreal 
will be brought down by Bill C-71. But when the big guns in the 
Bloc Quebecois' who are condemning Bill C-71 because of its 
economic impact on Montreal are told that  political instability in 
Quebec is weakening and hitting Quebec hard, they tell us that this
<P>
is a figment of our imagination. We have referendum after 
referendum. We just had a referendum at a cost of several millions 
of dollars that divided Quebecers and caused political instability, 
and what is the Quebec government doing to reshape the economic 
future of Montreal? They are talking about a third referendum, 
maybe for next year or the year after.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The mayor of Montreal, who should know something about it, 
said himself that political instability is hitting Montreal hard, that 
we cannot go on like this with our never ending quarrels from 
referendums to language battles. That was the mayor saying that, 
and he should be in a position to know about it.
<P>
	We were also told that there is no link between advertising and 
young people starting up smoking. Yet, there are studies about that. 
I will quote only a few of them for lack of time, but I could send our 
colleagues from the Bloc seven boxes full of studies, hundreds of 
them, showing a link between the two. I will quote only a few. The 
team of Pollay, Siddars, Siegel, Haddix, Merritt, Giovino and 
Ericksen studied this issue over a 14-year period, from 1979 to 
1993. These people are experts in marketing, social sciences, 
health sciences, etc. They concluded, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because brand shares of advertising voice are significantly related to 
subsequently realized market shares, cigarette advertising appears to influence the 
smoking behaviour of adolescents. Notably, the effect is substantially larger amongst 
adolescents than among adults by a factor of about three. The battle of the brands for 
market share is waged largely among the young, for it is a brand's success among the 
young that leads to greater brand sales and profit in the long term.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A 1996 U.S. study by Evans, Farkas, Gilpin, Berry and Pierce 
comes to the same conclusion. These studies have extensive 
references.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Our results support the hypothesis that tobacco marketing may 
be a stronger current influence in encouraging adolescents to 
initiate the smoking uptake process than demographic 
characteristics, than perceived school performance or exposure to 
other smokers in a peer or family network. The cumulative 
evidence supports the need for effective strategies to prevent 
adolescents from starting to smoke''.
<P>

<P>
	In his book entitled <I>Smoke &amp; Mirrors: the Canadian Tobacco 
War</I>, Rod Cunningham quotes an Imperial Tobacco chairman, who 
said: ``If we keep at it long enough, we can get tremendous benefits 
by sending to  the public a longer-lasting message''. He also quotes 
a vice-president of marketing at Imperial, who thinks that even the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8710"> 8710 </A></B>
<P>
less privileged smokers can choose a brand because it conjures up a 
comfortable lifestyle.
<P>
	Also mentioned is a project carried out by a marketing research 
company from Ontario in 1977 on behalf of Imperial Tobacco. It 
was called ``Project 16 years old''. The report stated and I quote: 
``The purpose of this project was to learn as much as we can about 
smoking uptake, about how high school students feel when they 
start smoking and what they forecast will be their future tobacco 
consumption''.
<P>
	In another of its documents entitled ``Media Plans 80'', Imperial 
Tobacco describes the groups it is targeting in 1980 for its various 
brands. The target groups are defined according to demographic 
characteristics such as age, sex and education. Some of the ads 
were aimed at boys and girls from 12 to 17 years of age.
<P>
	The ``National Media Plan 81'' Imperial Tobacco prepared the 
following year contained a similar market analysis strategy for 
comparable target groups. For some brands, the 12 to 17-year old 
smokers still represented the major target group. They were given 
the highest weighting used.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	In <I>La Presse</I> of March 5, 1997, Normand Turgeon, a marketing 
professor at the École des hautes études commerciales who did a 
study showing that tobacco companies sponsor events because it 
boosts their sales, is quoted as saying: ``These results contradict 
what manufacturers have been saying. What they keep telling you 
is not the truth''. In <I>La Presse</I> of March 5, 1997, Vincent Fischer, a 
champion of sponsorship in Quebec, said: ``If tobacco companies 
invest $60 million in sponsorships, it is not because they want to be 
nice, but because it pays''.
<P>
	We have been told that Montreal would be losing the Canadian 
Grand Prix. I wonder if Bloc members are not a bit worried that, if 
their fondest dream ever came true and Quebec became a sovereign 
country overnight, Montreal would lose the Canadian Grand Prix. 
Would the Australian Grand Prix still be held in Australia if it 
became the Victoria Grand Prix overnight? I doubt it very much. 
But they do not worry too much about that.
<P>
	In the March 4, 1997 edition of the <I>Journal de Montréal</I>, Jacques 
Duval, a former president of the Montreal Grand Prix exposed the 
odious blackmail that is going on, saying: ``One does not have to be 
a rocket scientist to realize that what is going on is a rather clumsy 
conspiracy by people who are primarily concerned about their own 
interests''.
<P>
	The Canadian Grand Prix will survive if it deserves to survive, 
and I think it will, because it does. We are also being told that arts 
and artists in Quebec will be affected by the loss of sponsorships. It 
is as if the whole artistic  community in Quebec were opposed to 
Bill C-71. However, the Artistes pour les commandites sans tabac 
represent 300 Quebec artists such as Claude Meunier, Serge 
Thériault, Marc Favreau, Gilles Pelletier, Plume Latraverse, Édith 
Butler, and talk show hosts Gregory Charles and Marc-André 
Coallier. One of their spokespersons said: ``These sponsorships sell 
cigarettes. One cannot try to enrich people's life while contributing 
to the shortening of their existence. We cannot keep silent while the 
tobacco industry uses the addictions it creates to stop a piece of 
legislation as crucial as this one in the area of health''.
<P>
	We have to know exactly how much the tobacco companies 
contribute to Quebec arts: at the National Theatre School of Canada 
in Montreal, 1 per cent of total revenues; at Les Grands Ballets 
Canadiens in Montreal, 0.4 per cent; at Ballet Jazz de Montréal, 2 
per cent; at the Centre du Théâtre d'aujourd'hui in Montreal, 1 per 
cent; at Montreal's Orchestre de chambre I Musici, 0.3 per cent; at 
Montreal's Place des Arts, 0.1 per cent; at the Montreal Symphony 
Orchestra, 0.3 per cent; at the Montreal Opera, 0.3 per cent.
<P>
	Except in one case, no percentage is higher than 3 per cent.
<P>
	It is said that in Quebec all movements, political or otherwise, 
are against Bill C-71. And yet, here is what Minister Rochon said in 
the November 27, 1996 edition of <I>La Presse</I>: ``We will go as far as 
we can. Sponsorship is subliminal advertising. It is a very strong 
means to promote consumption of a product, especially among 
young people. Some events have become as addicted to tobacco as 
the smokers themselves''.
<P>
	In <I>La Presse</I> of November 11, 1996, Rémy Trudel, the minister 
responsible for sports and recreation, expressed his concerns about 
the close links between tobacco manufacturers and a sports facility: 
``There are priority values a government should not give up''.
<P>
	In <I>Le Soleil</I> of November 28, 1996, Louise Beaudoin said: ``I 
agree that Quebecers' health must come first''.
<P>
	Allow me to quote clause 22 of Minister Rochon's tobacco bill. 
This bill, now in draft form, is the fifth version to be discussed by 
the Government of Quebec, and is expected to be introduced in 
June 1997.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Clause 22 of the bill says: ``Any direct or indirect funding of 
sporting, cultural or social events or facilities whose purpose is to 
promote tobacco in any way is prohibited''.
<P>
	To those who are opposed to this bill, particularly my colleagues 
from the Bloc, I ask this: what would they have said if Minister 
Rochon had introduced a bill before the federal minister did? 
Would they have condemned Minister Rochon publicly? I am 
talking about a bill supported by the Parti Quebecois government 
itself, a  bill that exists, a bill whose clause 22 I read, a bill I have a 
complete copy of here, a bill that goes much further than Bill C-71. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8711"> 8711 </A></B>
<P>
What would they have said then? What would they have said if the 
bill at issue came from the Quebec government?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I will tell you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> You see, Madam Speaker. They cannot accept any 
debate.
<P>
	We listened to their colleague a few minutes ago. We did not 
attack him, but they cannot accept any debate. They cannot accept 
it because, according to them, something is either black or white. 
You are either for or against it. There is nothing in between. They 
cannot accept another view.
<P>
	This is why, whenever we speak, they feel the urge to interrupt 
us. Well, let them. What I would like is to see them ask Mr. Rochon 
where he stands, why a pequiste minister at their headquarters in 
Quebec has come out with a bill that goes much further than the 
federal bill and said they wanted to go further.
<P>
	What would they have said then? Would they have attacked the 
federal government? Would they have called Mr. Rochon an 
ayatollah? Would they have called Mr. Trudel an ayatollah? Would 
they have called Ms. Beaudoin an ayatollah? Of course not. They 
turned it into politics, petty politics at that.
<P>
	Their line now is that it is the rest of Canada against Quebec. It is 
Mr. Dingwall, the health minister, against all of Quebec. It is 
everyone against Montreal. But this is simply not true.
<P>
	This impressive list of 560 organizations-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Céline Hervieux-Payette is on our side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln: </B>Madam Speaker, he is interrupting again to tell 
me: ``Céline Hervieux-Payette''. You see the difference between us 
and the Bloc Quebecois. We are not a monolithic block; we 
Liberals can think for ourselves. Some of us are in favour of the 
bill, and some have reservations. Perhaps the senator has 
reservations. That is her business, that is her fundamental right.
<P>
	We are not like them, caught in a stranglehold, unable to move, 
unable to accept that anything could depart even slightly from their 
monolithic view of things. What distinguishes the Liberal way of 
thinking is that individuals think for themselves, arrive at their own 
decisions. If anyone in our party wishes to say otherwise, let him or 
her do so. That is what democracy is all about. Our hands are not 
tied. We are human beings first and foremost.
<P>
	I for one, as a Liberal living in Quebec, am 100 per cent in 
favour of Bill C-71. When we passed Bill 84 in the National 
Assembly, smoking was allowed in hospitals, clinics, restaurants, 
everywhere in Quebec. Today, progress has been made. Things are 
certainly not perfect,  but smoking is far less prevalent or 
practically non-existent in hospitals and clinics. Even in 
restaurants, there are areas set aside.
<P>
	The legislation Mr. Rochon is proposing, and that I would dearly 
love to see passed, will mean the end of smoking in restaurants and 
public places. It is smoking we are battling. We are battling for a 
future concept, a social value. I therefore strongly support Bill 
C-71.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
Liberal colleague asked a number of questions of the Bloc 
Quebecois and I had trouble refraining from giving him the 
answers since he was so insistent about it.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	First of all, I would like to tell all my Liberal colleagues that the 
Bloc Quebecois agrees with the principle of Bill C-71. It agrees 
with the content of the bill, barring a few exceptions. However, 
when a bill includes the use of means that should not be used 
because the end never justifies the means, it is our duty as the 
official opposition to point out those aspects of the bill.
<P>
	You will recall that, unfortunately, debate was cut short at second 
reading. We probably could have drawn these aspects of the bill to 
the attention of Liberal members and of all Canadians if that debate 
had taken place. But it did not, and we are forced to raise these 
issues now.
<P>
	So, the first major irritant is the reverse onus, which means that 
people will be considered guilty until they can prove their 
innocence. This is totally new in our justice system, and that is why 
it is a major irritant. As the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois 
cannot accept such a change of rules in our justice system.
<P>
	The second irritant concerns sponsorships. It may be desirable 
that tobacco companies stop sponsoring various events some day, 
but it is not something that can be done overnight. That is the 
problem. The minister is telling us that if young people do not see 
any tobacco advertising at sporting and cultural events, they will 
not start smoking. I admit that it may influence them a little, but it 
is not their main motivation.
<P>
	When I was young, many people smoked and I, myself, started 
to smoke. Thank God, I was able to quit later on. However, there 
were no sponsorships on television. This was at the beginning of 
television. We had black and white screens only, and there were 
just a few programs. But did we ever smoke. Therefore, there must 
be other factors that lead young people to smoke.
<P>
	In fact, if the health minister is so convinced that sponsorships 
are one of the important factors that lead young people to start 
smoking, why then does he not provide a transition period in order 
to help sponsored events to find other sponsors? How can we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8712"> 8712 </A></B>
<P>
believe a  minister who is not ready to invest a single penny to 
support his principles?
<P>
	This is not grandstanding, we are only looking at the facts as 
they are. Without a transition period, the direct losses will amount 
to $60 million. As for indirect losses, they will amount to $200 
million for the Montreal area, an area where there are more poor 
people than in all the maritimes. We are not grandstanding, we are 
looking at the facts. If the losses are that high, it will cause 
unemployment. Unemployment means poor families. Poor 
families mean poor children, malnutrition, a high dropout rate, 
health problems.
<P>
	Even worse, studies show that poor families smoke more. By 
refusing to provide a transition period, the minister will endanger 
the health of those same young people he claims he wants to 
protect. This really is a measure the minister did not foresee the 
possible perverse effects of.
<P>
	In fact, we must realize that the sponsored events proposed some 
interesting compromises to the minister but it seems that he prefers 
going to court, because this is sure to happen. Sponsored events and 
sponsors will go ahead and force the minister to go all the way to 
the Supreme Court and once again, in five years or more, the 
problem will still be with us.
<P>
	I want to tell my Liberal colleague that in the health committee I 
myself proposed active measures aimed at the young, for example, 
an awareness campaign where stars popular with young people 
would tell them that they do not smoke to preserve their health.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Last November, I had the opportunity to discuss the bill with Mr. 
Rochon and I expressed my concerns. You will know that Mr. 
Rochon's bill has not moved a bit since then. His bill will be 
reviewed by cabinet because good intents are one thing, but 
negative impacts are another and they must also be taken into 
consideration. That is one of our main points. We want the bill to 
have maximum efficiency and we want full protection for the 
health of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	However, the clauses on sponsorship will have the effect of 
replacing a problem with another which might be even worse.
<P>
	I have a twofold question for my colleague. First, could it be that 
the minister is more stubborn than convinced? Is the Minister of 
Health sick? Why does he not invest the money in his own budget 
to finance a transition period? Finally, and I would really 
appreciate an answer from my colleague, is the minister not afraid 
that the right he is assuming to decide what can or cannot be seen 
on television might be declared unconstitutional? Other countries 
tried to decide for their citizens what could and what could not be 
seen and we know what happened to them. I ask the member across 
the way if, out of sheer  stubbornness, the minister is not losing 
sight of what is best for the health of Canadians and Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, if the minister is 
really losing sight of the health objectives of Canadians, then why 
is he getting support from all health organizations across Canada, 
including Quebec? Hospitals, Local Community Service Centres, 
doctors, in fact everyone supports the minister. If he is against 
health, why would all these groups give him their unqualified 
support?
<P>
	They say there was no debate on this issue. This is an issue that 
has been discussed for years. For years we have been debating this 
question. Every time a bill is introduced. In fact the Conservative 
government introduced one, and there was endless debate on the 
subject. There is a debate in our society between the pro-tobacco 
groups and the anti-tobacco groups. This has been going on for 
years. All the facts are known.
<P>
	I told the hon. member for the Bloc Quebecois that if he wanted 
to go and see them, I would show him seven boxes full of 
documents that prove there is a connection between tobacco 
sponsorships and smoking, especially among young people. There 
are studies, and I quoted two of them, but there are hundreds more 
that prove this fact.
<P>
	And if it were not true, why would France, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, the Scandinavian countries, and so 
forth, have done the same thing we are doing? Even if Minister 
Rochon's bill is being revised in cabinet, the fact is that he and the 
Quebec government said quite clearly they wanted to go further.
<P>
	They talk about unemployment in Montreal, where I come from. 
Montreal is in bad shape today. But I think there is something 
wrong when they talk about the connection between sponsorship 
and unemployment and never mention the connection between 
political instability and unemployment in Montreal. Why is Zellers 
leaving? Why did Canadian Pacific leave? Why are we losing 
5,000 Quebecers more per quarter than we get, including 
immigrants? Why is this happening?
<P>
	They do not want to face the facts. They do not want to face the 
consequences of this endless debate that has been going for years. 
They had the first referendum, but that was not enough. They had a 
second one, it was still not enough. So they will have a third one. 
Even the hon. member for St. Hubert, who is running for the 
leadership of the Bloc Quebecois, said the other day: ``After a third 
referendum, no more, because people are fed up''. She herself 
admitted this had to stop someday in order to provide some 
political stability. That is what we need.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will respond immediately to the hon. member 
for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis who said my colleague had 
mentioned Mrs. Céline Hervieux-Payette.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8713"> 8713 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe it would be a good idea to start off with two little 
paragraphs the hon. member is, no doubt, not aware of. I will also 
remind him that this lady is the chief organizer for the next 
elections, or one of those who will be helping him get elected in 
his riding. I trust she will be on the platform with him to defend 
this stand.
<P>
	What she said is this: ``In my opinion, restricting advertising and 
sponsorships has a minimal role to play in overcoming this 
scourge. If sporting and cultural activities in Quebec are earmarked 
as the testing grounds for a policy that will not have the desired 
effects, I say no way. Give me your support to stop Montreal from 
being the major victim of this policy, when it is already nearly 
crushed by unemployment''.
<P>
	The person speaking here is not a separatist but a good Liberal, 
one rewarded by the government across the way with an 
appointment to the other place, the other House. Yet she does not 
support the colleague we have just heard in any way. Do you know 
why there is a difference between what the Liberals on the other 
side here and the Liberals in the other place have to say? It is 
because in the other House they were not elected, while here the 
Liberals across the way are, and they want to look good on the 
campaign trail. They want to look like the good guys in a matter as 
vital as health.
<P>
	What did the Liberals do in the area of health in 1993? Nothing, 
or next to it. I will give you only a few examples, because my time 
is limited. And I will take this opportunity, Madam Speaker, to tell 
you that I will be sharing my time with the member for Joliette.
<P>
	The Department of Health did major studies on raw milk cheese. 
In the end it was shown beyond a doubt that the whole thing was 
totally absurd, and the Liberals backed off.
<P>
	There was the national forum on health where the government 
spent $18 million, and yet health is a provincial jurisdiction. There 
was no reason for this forum. It was so unpopular that the provinces 
did not even take part in it, although it is under their jurisdiction.
<P>
	Then there was the Minister of Health, who, in the first years, 
went to war. She went to war against tobacco with her famous plain 
cigarette packaging. The packages were beige and were supposed 
to stop young people from smoking.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They were drab like the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Indeed, they were just as drab as the minister 
and that is why it was stopped at that point. It was said that it did 
not work.
<P>
	Now, on the eve of elections, the Minister of Justice realized that 
voters will be wondering what the Liberals have done in the area of 
health. They needed a noble cause. They found it among the young 
people, in the health of the young. They latched on to the idea that 
they  would protect the health of young people and intervene in the 
issue of smoking.
<P>
	If the government really had the courage of its convictions, it 
would prohibit what it says is dangerous. Tobacco seems to be 
dangerous, it must be prohibited. I heard the health minister and the 
parliamentary secretary telling us that the effects of tobacco use, 
particularly among young people, cost our society several billions 
of dollars. He estimates at $3.5 billion health care costs directly 
related to smoking.
<P>
	But I did not hear the same health minister or the same 
parliamentary secretary telling me and the House that indeed it 
costs us $3.5 billion, but that the federal and provincial levels of 
government make at least $5 billion in various taxes on cigarettes 
and tobacco products. Sure it is no laughing matter when you 
consider people suffering from lung cancer or other diseases 
related to tobacco abuse, but we live in a free country. Why is the 
government insisting on wiping out this industry?
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	If it had raised the real issues regarding tobacco use, we would 
not have ended up with this hypocritical piece of legislation which 
is before the House today. Moreover we have been gagged at 
second reading of this important bill. It was read very quickly. We 
were gagged in committee as we were reviewing the bill clause by 
clause. Again today at report stage and at third reading, the 
government is applying closure. We will not be able to discuss the 
bill at leisure. Why? Because the Liberals opposite do not want to 
discuss it.
<P>
	Earlier, the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis said there are 
seven boxes of documents proving there is a direct link between 
smoking and diseases. I can tell you that on the other side, there are 
also seven boxes of documents to prove the effect is not as 
immediate as they claim. There are also studies that show that just 
because young people go to the Du Maurier open does not mean 
that, when they go home, they want to go out and buy a package of 
cigarettes.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition said, the young person who 
watches a game of tennis and sees ``Du Maurier'' at the back 
during the whole game is far more interested in getting a new 
tennis racket when he comes home than a package of cigarettes. 
There is no immediate effect. No studies have been able to prove 
this.
<P>
	Furthermore, quite frankly, we are not 100 per cent against Bill 
C-71, the anti-tobacco bill. We support most of the bill, and we said 
so to hon. members opposite. We even proposed as many as 32 
amendments to improve the bill and provide more active ways of 
educating young people, for instance, if we really want to protect 
them. But no, the government ignored our comments and continues 
to do so because it is the sole repository of the truth. When you gag 
the opposition, it is because you do not want to listen to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8714"> 8714 </A></B>
<P>
opposition. You do not want to listen to them because you think you 
are right. That is the problem.
<P>
	That is why when I listen to a speech like the one made this 
morning by the Quebec member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, I 
can hardly take it seriously. It is really too bad. He is here to defend 
the interests of Quebec, but for 20 minutes he defended the 
interests of Ottawa, not like us, the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, who have the interests of Quebec at heart.
<P>
	For instance, the part of bill that we cannot accept, that no one in 
Quebec can accept, is the part that concerns sponsorships. If this 
bill is passed, we will not be able to have a number of sports and 
cultural events which the people of Montreal and people from other 
parts of Quebec are accustomed to having.
<P>
	I will name a few that are at risk because the government 
opposite will not listen to reason: the jazz festival, the Benson &amp; 
Hedges fireworks, the Just for Laughs festival, the summer festival 
in Quebec City, the Montreal Grand Prix, the Trois-Rivières Grand 
Prix, plus the whole domino effect of banning sponsorships. The 
loss in Montreal alone will be $240 million plus more than 2,000 
jobs. This is not counting the domino effect on the regions.
<P>
	In Berthier-Montcalm we have the Gilles Villeneuve museum. 
If there is no Grand Prix in Montreal, you can bet that the 10 or 15 
per cent who visit the museum during the Grand Prix will no longer 
come. These are people from Europe, Japan and United States. 
These tourists bring money into Quebec. If there is no Montreal 
Grand Prix, no Trois-Rivières Grand Prix, they will never come to 
Berthierville to visit the museum. They will not make a special trip 
from Japan to come and visit the Gilles Villeneuve museum.
<P>
	You must understand this, Madam Speaker. Try to make them 
understand. In concluding, if it is so important to the government 
opposite, it should make this part of its election platform and let the 
Secretary of State for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
in Quebec go on the hustings in Quebec to sell Bill C-71, and the 
people will decide whether or not they want this bill. In Quebec, the 
answer will be no, we do not.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I think you know the respect I have for all my colleagues in the 
House and of course for a great many of the official opposition 
members.
<P>
	However I find ironic and contradictory-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Surprising.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> ``Surprising'' does not go far enough. Their 
attitude, the reaction they have of saying that the member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis was not looking out for Quebec or for 
Quebecers, what utter nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> The truth hurts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> It is not the truth, it is complete nonsense.
<P>
	The last member who spoke, the one before last, is an hon. 
member with a reputation that far surpasses that of most members 
of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin: </B>It has been a long time since you yourself were in 
Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> They know it. He is a member known for his 
honesty. I find it appalling that they would use this opportunity to 
try to insult him, to embarrass such a person.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I would like a 
little more respect to be shown members of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> We all know that any credible research shows a 
link between tobacco and health. We have just heard the member 
try to tell us that other researchers say the opposite, but how many 
Canadians buy this?
<P>
	Honestly, use arguments that make sense. There are almost 600 
groups in Quebec, credible people, who support this bill, 600 
groups. A majority of Canadians, including Quebecers, support this 
bill. And they are trying to make people think otherwise. Why? In 
order to try to rationalize their position, to try to scare people.
<P>
	They said it would mean the end of all sorts of events.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> It would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Why? Because their position is unfounded. They 
are trying to scare people, to get them worked up. That is their only 
strategy. Obviously, when they have nothing to say, they attack, 
they scare people. Why not? That is the only tactic they have left.
<P>
	It is unfortunate. It is not true to say we are playing politics with 
this bill. We are here to try to protect young Canadians, including 
Quebecers.
<P>
	That is what we should be trying to do together, rather than 
trying to use the opportunity to engage in petty politics. That is 
what they are up to and I would like to know why. Why are they 
defending smoking, which leads to poor health? I would like to 
know how they can defend such a position.
<P>
	It is unbelievable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> What about the museum in 
Berthierville?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to reply to the 
hon. member for St. Boniface. I am defending the economic spinoff 
aspect, one of the reasons being that we agree with the health 
aspect of it, the question of protecting our young people, the 
requirement about being over 18. This is part of the 80 per cent of 
the bill we agree with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8715"> 8715 </A></B>
<P>
	The part that bothers Quebec-and the reason I referred to the 
fact that the hon. member comes from Quebec and is not 
defending Quebecers-is that not defending Quebecers in such a 
matter means that $30 million will be lost in sponsorships, $240 
million in Montreal alone in economic spinoffs of all kinds. That 
means, for Montreal alone, a minimum of 2,200 jobs lost.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Let him come and tell those 2,000 people who are unemployed 
after Bill C-71 is passed at third reading, that it is their fault, the 
Liberals' fault, that the Montreal tourist industry has been dealt a 
death blow, that $240 million annually in economic spinoffs of all 
types is being lost, that $30 million in sponsorships is being lost.
<P>
	Let him come and tell people that during the election campaign. 
I invite you to come and say that in my riding. The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Health, who is in the House, can also 
come and tell people that. Let him explain to the Gilles Villeneuve 
museum what it is going to lose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I had begun, 
in my earlier speech, to explain that the bill before us is 
unreasonable, because it mixes very different values. Sponsorship 
does not mean advertising. The two things are very different.
<P>
	The fact that a company's name appears on a car is not going to 
cause us to buy more of the company's product. If the company 
advertised the merits of its product, I would agree we should 
prevent this sort of advertising, which would encourage people to 
use a product more. But this is not what sponsorship is about, not at 
all.
<P>
	The aim of sponsorship is simply for a company to present an 
event or let the public know it is presenting one. It is to show that 
the company shares the concerns, social life, daily life, recreational 
activities and culture of the people. If it also promoted its product, 
that would be advertising. Just because we see an image, we do not 
necessarily try to imitate it.
<P>
	We have seen certain political figures in the federal government 
for the past 30 years, and we have not turned into Liberals. By 
seeing them, we were not tempted to do as they do. Once we get to 
know them, we no longer wanted to imitate them. That is the 
difference.
<P>
	We are surrounded daily by sources of pollution. Statistics 
indicate that 60 per cent of the population is overweight. However, 
advertising and sponsorship by chocolate products has not been 
prohibited. Chips, peanuts and animal fat are all still permissible.
<P>
	The doctor treating my weight problem became as fat as I was in 
a year. Should he have treated me by phone? It was not by treating 
me in his office that he put on weight. And yet, if anyone had the 
motivation it was he. He knew the causes and did not heed them. 
He avoided them.
<P>
	That is why I say we do things through education. On the news 
this morning, they were saying that, for the past 10 years, women 
have suffered from lung cancer more than men. The number of 
women smokers has quadrupled in the past 10 years. Does this 
mean that women are greater fans of car racing than men? Is the 
sponsoring of a cultural festival by Rothmans or Du Maurier and a 
racing event by Players to blame for the fact that the number of 
women smokers has increased fourfold?
<P>
	From what I can see on television, I do not think that such events 
are attended by more women than men. Inappropriate associations 
are being made. Why is that? Because the federal government, 
through its minister, has put its head on the block to please a 
powerful lobby: the anti-tobacco lobby. There is nothing wrong 
with those who are against tobacco use to fight for their cause and 
express their opinions; that is their role. There is nothing wrong 
either with the tobacco companies wanting to defend their position; 
that is their role.
<P>
	But when a minister says: ``If this bill does not pass, vote against 
the Liberal Party in the next election'', the real purpose of his 
legislation is clear: to please the very powerful anti-tobacco lobby 
representing thousands of well-meaning people.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	If it were not for this commitment made by the Minister of 
Health, I suspect the government would be more inclined to 
compromise and show greater flexibility in the implementation of 
this act. The Minister of Health wants to save his head at the 
expense of thousands of jobs throughout Quebec, particularly in 
Montreal, Quebec City and Trois-Rivières, in the riding of Joliette, 
where an important tobacco growing industry generates seasonal 
jobs. I would hate to see them have to lay people off.
<P>
	Try educating and convincing people instead; it is a much more 
effective approach. The best example of a successful education 
campaign is Operation Nez Rouge, which was designed to fight 
alcohol abuse. The whole thing is based on education and it did not 
cost the people of Quebec thousands or millions of dollars. It was 
initiated in Quebec 10 or 15 years ago by a professor at Laval 
University, in Quebec City.
<P>
	This initiative has now been extended not only to other provinces 
across Canada, but also to several countries, where similar 
organizations were created. Today, as a result of this campaign, the 
number of alcohol-related automobile accidents has been reduced 
by nearly 80 or 90 per cent. This is how effective this educational 
approach has been, instead of the government interfering with 
people's lives through legislation.
<P>
	Drunk drivers were not condemned, they were educated. Today, 
these individuals are proud of what they have learned. They are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8716"> 8716 </A></B>
<P>
proud to play a role in social  development and to help reduce the 
number of traffic accidents. We did not convince these people by 
intruding in their lives, but by teaching them principles.
<P>
	In addition to being ill-advised, this intrusion is a dangerous 
precedent. If, whenever there is abuse of any kind, the government 
must legislate to prevent such abuse, eventually no one in Quebec 
or in Canada will be able to act of his own free will. Everything will 
be regulated.
<P>
	Discotheques will be closed, because they are too noisy. Indeed, 
it is dangerous for young people to listen to loud music because 
they could go deaf. The fact is we do not prohibit music in 
discotheques. As long as it is played inside, the number of decibels 
is not regulated. Then again, maybe we should do something about 
it, because it is harmful and it is costly to society if a young person 
loses his hearing.
<P>
	Similarly, we do not prevent people from overdoing it, from 
staying up until four or five in the morning. Some young people do 
that. Quite often, they roam the streets. Should we legislate, impose 
a curfew at one in the morning and tell these kids they must not be 
on the street after that time? That is not what we do. We leave it up 
to parents to educate their children. And it is through education that 
we will succeed.
<P>
	There are many other examples. Cars pollute the environment, 
and not just because there are tobacco company logos displayed on 
them. They pollute because they release carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. This adversely affects the quality of life of all of us. 
When I breathe the carbon dioxide released by cars, it is harmful to 
my health. Yet, the government did not legislate on that. It does not 
prevent cars and buses from being on the road, even though it is 
harmful to my health.
<P>
	Earlier, I mentioned products that cause obesity. Again, the 
situation is the same. The companies that make these products were 
not prohibited from sponsoring social or cultural events. It is 
ill-advised to try to regulate such issues. The official opposition is 
merely asking the government to amend its legislation so as to 
allow the tobacco industry to continue to sponsor events that 
provide jobs for thousands of people.
<P>
	This bill might help save the lives of some people, but it could 
also ruin the lives of the thousands of others who will be deprived 
of their livelihood. Indeed, it might ruin the lives of some people 
because it will make them lose hope. And the same goes for their 
children.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	This is a bad remedy. They are prescribing a remedy without first 
looking at the side effects. It is like saying that, because I eat things 
that are not good for my health and a cure will not be found for 10 
years, my fingers will be cut off. It is not the best solution. It is like 
saying that if my fingers are cut off, then I will no longer be able to 
eat those bad things.
<P>
	Instead of cutting off people's fingers, we should try to educate 
them, to show them how to eat, how to better protect their health 
and their bodies. This is what we mean by educating people. It is 
more work and it may be more costly but, in the long term, it is 
much more beneficial and much more respectful of people's 
freedom. We are asking the government to respect people's 
freedom and to recognize this freedom by accepting our proposed 
amendments to the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
paid great attention to the very meaty and lengthy speech by my 
hon. colleague from Joliette. It appears that he has not bought into 
the notion-nor have I-that a person will live forever if he stops 
smoking. People do die of other things.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I am one of those victims of cigarettes. I am a 
heavy smoker, as you know, Madam Speaker. But I am free to do 
so. There is one aspect of this bill which I do not feel has been 
discussed enough. I may cough a lot, but I would rather die of lung 
cancer than to die a captive, a victim and a prisoner. Sad to say, that 
would be even worse.
<P>
	Since the sixties, we have moved into the era of ``one size fits 
all'', ready to wear clothes that fit everybody but do not really fit 
anybody, and fast food, ``ready to eat''. Maybe that is what lies 
behind the problems of obesity my colleague was referring to. Then 
there is the ``ready to think'', the ``one thought fits all''. We 
certainly cannot ask the questions that bother us any more. Let us 
take one simple example: immigration. It is certainly frowned on 
for a citizen to ask whether we are letting too many immigrants in, 
or not enough, one type rather than another, and so on. One can no 
longer ask questions in this area, for it is not politically correct. So 
now we have ``one p.c. thought fits all''.
<P>
	Now, with this bill, we have the ``one sight fits all''. They want 
to ban from the public eye certain names, corporate names, honest 
names that have earned their visibility. That is one of the aspects of 
the bill. They are treating as something shameful the names of 
corporations, good corporate citizens nonetheless, who have-or 
so I hope-paid their fair share through their taxes and so on. I 
therefore approve of the hon. member for Joliette's reference to 
doing away with excess, whether eating, smoking or whatever. I 
agree with him, but people must be left with the freedom to choose.
<P>
	I have always been afraid of regimes that feel they are the 
possessors of the absolute truth, with a calling from the Creator, 
telling us ``From now on, you will no longer smoke''. I ask my hon. 
colleague for Joliette if he does not believe instead in the virtue of 
educating our young people, for they are the ones we want to 
protect.
<P>
	I would also ask him whether he could address the regulatory 
aspect a bit. There are whole chunks of the bill, seven sections of it, 
which leave a shameful amount of discretionary power to the 
Minister of Health,  someone who has not dazzled us with his 
judgment so far. To confer upon a man lacking judgment the power 
to judge is not such a great idea for a bill. The power needs to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8717"> 8717 </A></B>
<P>
channelled, the regulations need to be passed by the 
governor-in-council. That way, if there is one minister who is not 
all there, the others can put him back on track. But that is not the 
case.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Now, without any judgment-the Liberals showed that they did 
not have any in the raw milk cheese issue-the minister will now, 
on his own, be able to issue rules, poultices and wooden legs from 
one day to the next and have regulations made in response to 
pressure from anti smoking groups or others. The worst of it all is 
that, if Bill C-25 is passed, the regulations will not even be made 
public.
<P>
	So, I ask my hon. colleague from Joliette to say, for the benefit 
of this House and especially for the minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec and also for the 
benefit of the Liberals present, whether he does not see a certain 
danger in the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, I see that I have only 30 seconds 
left. That is not much time to answer my colleague's question.
<P>
	I spoke primarily of sponsorships because this is what affects us 
most immediately. We could of course have spoken of the 
regulations, but it would have been with great uncertainty, because 
we do not know what it is about.
<P>
	Furthermore, the bill's regulations will not in all likelihood be 
presented until after the election, because a Liberal promise is 
involved. And we know what to expect from a Liberal election 
promise. We had them at the last election, and they were not 
honoured. The government does not want to reveal them 
immediately. It will wait until after the election, because the cost to 
it will be less then.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to take part in a debate which 
is close to my heart. I have talked about this subject for the last 
eight years, probably more than any other member.
<P>
	I thank my colleagues on this side of the House for their 
understanding of my position. It is important and very difficult 
sometimes to stand and talk about the tobacco issue. I particularly 
thank the minister and his departmental officials for accepting 
amendments put forward by tobacco farmers. Specifically I thank 
the member for Lambton-Middlesex for her amendment. She 
worked very hard on contributing to this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The number of tobacco farmers have greatly decreased since 
1984. Most of the 1,200 remaining are in my riding of 
Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant. The economic consequences of the 
tobacco industry in my riding are significant. It represents almost 
one in three jobs. Within Canada about 60,000 Canadians are 
employed by the industry as a whole. The impact in my area is 
greater than in any other area. Its rural economy is dramatically 
impacted. With that many jobs it means income that people can 
spend. Certainly the economic impact is greatest. Of all the tobacco 
money generated in my riding, 80 per cent of it actually remains 
there.
<P>
	A study done by Deloitte &amp; Touche entitled ``Economic 
Contribution of the Tobacco Industry in the Tobacco Growing 
Regions of Ontario'' outlines the importance of the industry to a 
small community such as mine. It is important for all hon. 
members and all Canadians to understand that.
<P>
	If we look at the total number of jobs directly involved in 
tobacco growing, the producing of the product, there are 16,189 
full time and part time jobs. That averages out to 4,578 FTE or full 
time equivalent jobs, which accounts for 22 per cent of all 
agricultural jobs within my area.
<P>
	In terms of university students, $13.4 million of labour income 
goes to university and high school students in my area each year. It 
helps students attend high school and university.
<P>
	I have some other figures on income. The total income created 
by tobacco is $315 million. In Haldimand-Norfolk it is $174 
million. In Brant county it is $31 million. In Oxford county it is $44 
million. In Elgin it is $66 million.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at its impact on local communities. Communities and 
municipalities throughout Ontario are being dramatically cut back 
by the Harris Conservatives. Let us also look at the income tobacco 
taxes bring to these areas. In Brant county federal taxes amount to 
$6 million; provincial taxes, $3 million; and local taxes, $1 
million, for a total of $10 million. In Haldimand-Norfolk the 
federal taxes amount to $34 million; provincial taxes, $16 million; 
and local taxes, $7 million. This industry is generating $56 million 
in taxes in the area.
<P>
	Where do the jobs come from? Locally hired family members 
account for the largest portion. These are family farms that help put 
children through school. It is estimated that 33.4 per cent or $11.3 
million goes to local high school students from these growers. 
Almost 20 per cent of the income goes to students.
<P>
	My argument is simple. As long as Canadians can legally smoke, 
which is difficult sometimes given some of the legislation, espe-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8718"> 8718 </A></B>
<P>
cially municipal legislation, they  should be able to smoke 
Canadian tobacco. The benefits of that will be seen in my 
community.
<P>
	That money does not only go into the pockets of the growers and 
the people who work in tobacco growing regions. It goes to 
schools. It goes to corner stores. It goes to support local hospitals. 
It goes into charitable events within the community.
<P>
	Within the area of Delhi, Tillsonburg and Aylmer or the entire 
tobacco growing area, the level of money given by that community 
is a greater percentage than most other regions of Ontario. Tobacco 
producers give back what they take out of the soil.
<P>
	Tobacco growers are normal people. They are good people. They 
are Canadians who have contributed to the fabric of the country. 
They came from all over the world to Haldimand-Norfolk to 
produce tobacco. We have one of the largest German communities 
and one of the largest Belgian communities. We have Hungarians 
and all kinds of different groups that have come to our area to 
produce tobacco.
<P>
	They were encouraged to get into the industry by the federal 
government, by the provincial government and by consumers. My 
argument is simple. Let us not throw them to the wolves. We have 
taken the time to encourage them to get into the business. Why do 
we not take some time if it is the view of governments to move 
them out?
<P>
	The industry can be stabilized. Some of the measures the 
government has implemented have helped producers in my area. 
People ask why they do not move into another area or why they do 
not grow wheat or melons. That has been tried. The soil is not 
suitable for other crops. The size of the tobacco farms are on 
average 80 acres and today not much money can be made with 80 
acres of soil. They just cannot have viable farming operations. 
Certainly the area they have tried have already been flooded. There 
is no easy answer to help them move.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The government has helped. I congratulate it for that. I will 
continue to work for more help. Past governments, this 
government, consumers and political parties have all participated 
in the debate. Sometimes they forget these farmers are normal 
Canadians who want to earn a living for their families. As a 
member of Parliament for that area I will continue to speak out on 
their behalf with regard to the tobacco legislation. I hope hon. 
members on all sides will help me speak out for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the hon. member who spoke for the 
Liberal Party. I see that he too is very concerned about the 
economic aspects. Apparently, his riding is in an agricultural area 
where a lot of tobacco is grown. He mentioned 16,000 jobs, 22 per 
cent of all farm  jobs and $56 million worth of taxes. And this is in 
a very rich province. Today, the economy in Montreal and the 
province of Quebec is facing a host of problems.
<P>
	I would appreciate if he would explain a few things for me. Did 
he at any time consider talking to his government to try to establish 
a measure of fairness and ensure some kind of economic balance?
<P>
	Not so long ago, when it wanted to harmonize the GST in the 
provinces of Eastern Canada because it thought they would lose a 
lot more than Quebec, the government offered them $1.2 billion or 
$1.3 billion as compensation. It has been calculated that in the 
province of Quebec, and especially Montreal, this bill will cost us 
$30 million.
<P>
	I wonder why the Liberal Party, which decided to give $1.2 
billion in compensation to the provinces in Eastern Canada, would 
not do the same for Montreal. Does he think he could get this point 
across to his government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Madam Speaker, obviously the hon. member was 
not listening to me as closely as he said he was. Members on this 
side from Quebec and the minister have spoken out strongly on 
behalf of the people of Quebec and Montreal. They have put 
forward the argument very forcefully and have been very 
successful in doing so.
<P>
	I will not get into the GST, but I was going to comment on the 
economic impact of the bill on my community and the impact of all 
governments and the actions they take. Frankly the economic 
impact of the bill will be very minimal. However I assure the hon. 
member the people of Quebec are very well represented within 
government by capable ministers, much more so than they are 
through some of the voices on the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I compliment my colleague for 
highlighting a couple of points. Unlike some other members of the 
House he was here to appreciate an amendment was put forward by 
a member on this side of the House which dealt with the concerns 
of the Bloc and the Reform on the question of regulations. That 
amendment has passed and regulations will be available for 
scrutiny by the committee. It is a precedent setting item that works 
to the advantage of all who want to take a look at the complete 
impact of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	On this issue my colleague, who has always spoken on behalf of 
his own constituents, will have to address the bill as it stands. The 
speaker who proceeded him talked about the importance of 
education to curbing behaviour, to modifying behaviour and to 
weaning people away from the evils of tobacco use. I am 
wondering if while 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8719"> 8719 </A></B>
<P>
he  is defending the interests of his growers is he also accepting that 
education and by extension controlling-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Order. The 
hon. member, very briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. If it is a question of raising tobacco taxes like the 
Reform Party would have us do or putting in an education program, 
I would certainly support the education program rather than 
increasing an export tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have reservations about this bill but I support it strongly 
despite those reservations.
<P>
	I am a former smoker and at one time I smoked 60 cigarettes a 
day, which is a lot of tobacco. I first began smoking at age 16 as a 
result of peer pressure and gradually I began smoking more and 
more. Tobacco is a very insidious drug. It tends to grow on you and 
the addiction develops both physically and psychologically over 
the years. It was very difficult to quit the habit but I did about 10 
years ago. So I know something about the problems of tobacco.
<P>
	I support the spirit of the bill because it is certainly true that 
young people tend to be the ones who get first hooked on tobacco 
products and become the addicted adults later in life. In reality 
cigarettes are a nasty product when you are first introduced to 
them. I am sure if people began as adults to try cigarettes they 
would reject them absolutely. It is something that really develops 
as a result of peer pressure. The idea behind the bill that we should 
address the problem of young people beginning to smoke is a very 
good one.
<P>
	I am not entirely certain that creating more restrictions on young 
people who smoke will actually have the desired affect because 
when you prohibit something from young people they tend to want 
it that much more. On the other hand, given the importance of the 
intent of this legislation, it is worth trying these restrictions that the 
legislation proposes.
<P>
	The second reservation I did have is sponsorship. I always 
regarded the sponsorship by tobacco companies, breweries and 
distilleries of arts and sporting events as something they did as 
good corporate citizens. In reality we need the tobacco companies, 
the distilleries and the breweries. If legitimate companies do not 
produce these products that are demanded by the consumers, even 
though these products have adverse health effects, then we know 
from past historical experience that organized crime will produce 
these products. It is a very necessary and good thing to have 
legitimate industry producing these products for the marketplace. 
The benefits flow to shareholders of those public companies, and 
that is as it should be.
<P>
	I always thought the payback of companies engaged in 
producing products that have potentially adverse health effects 
would be that they would want to be especially  good corporate 
citizens. I always regarded the sponsorship of tobacco companies 
of things like the Grand Prix, or the breweries and distilleries of 
things like the theatre, as something that they did as good corporate 
citizens in order to in a sense make up for the fact that they were 
producing products that did have adverse health effects.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	I must say that in my own riding this theory that I have held for a 
very long time was eroded somewhat when I found that a local 
volunteer theatre, Theatre Aquarius, developed in the community, 
wanted to go into the big leagues and managed to obtain some 
government money and also some sponsorship from a tobacco 
company. When the new theatre was built as a result of this 
sponsorship they changed the name to the du Maurier Centre. That 
was about 10 years ago. I felt at the time that was a terribly tacky 
thing to do and that it eroded the whole sense of generosity from 
the tobacco company that it should want to rename the theatre with 
its own logo.
<P>
	In the one sense I am not so sure that the sponsorship of these 
major events that has been the subject of so much debate here 
actually is going to have an effect in deterring young people from 
smoking. I am not sure that is going to be the case. However, again, 
like the other aspects of the bill, it is worth trying.
<P>
	In the other sense I do not understand why the tobacco 
companies if their intention is not so much advertising as it is being 
good corporate citizens, I do not see why they take umbrage at the 
provisions in the bill which do not eliminate their logos but which 
merely put them in a less prominent position. I would have thought 
that this would not be something that they would reject so hotly, as 
appears to be the case.
<P>
	That brings me to the third point. The reason why the tobacco 
companies react so aggressively to Bill C-71 is a tremendous 
climate of conflict has been created as a result of the lobby groups 
on both sides of the equation. Certainly the tobacco companies 
have been able to afford very strong lobbyists but what has actually 
fueled the acrimony and the conflict have been the government 
funded lobbies that exist on the other side, the anti-smoking lobbies 
like the Non-Smokers' Rights Association and the Canadian 
Council on Smoking and Health.
<P>
	These groups have received tens of millions of dollars from 
Health Canada and provincial health ministries over the years in 
order to promote anti-smoking. I wish I could say that this was 
something that was prompted by altruism, but I am afraid that big 
bucks count in this instance and many of the principal players in 
these lobby groups, just like the lobby groups supported by the 
tobacco industry, are getting very big bucks indeed. In fact, if we 
try to find out how much money they are receiving it will enter into 
the range of $100,000 plus.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8720"> 8720 </A></B>
<P>
	Indeed I believe a chief executive of one of the anti-smoking 
lobbies is around the range of about $180,000 a year. This is 
government money ultimately, government money coming from 
our Department of Health. I point out that the Department of 
Health has supplied $500,000 a year over the last two years to 
the Non-Smokers' Rights Association, a lobby.
<P>
	The lobbying extends beyond these named organizations. It also 
includes various health organizations that have very much 
something at stake. What is at stake ultimately is research dollars.
<P>
	If we look at the public accounts for Health Canada what we find 
is a disproportionate amount of money from Health Canada which 
is spent on various types of studies on tobacco control. Some of 
these studies are nothing less than exercises in propaganda, 
attempts to propagandize members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	I refer very quickly to a study that we all saw, a questionnaire 
that we were approached with last November from the faculty of 
medicine of York University, I believe it was. It was conducted by 
Mary Jane Ashley, M.D., faculty of medicine of the University of 
Toronto. This was a survey that asked us for our views on health 
promotion. It was a telephone survey. After one got into the survey 
by the person questioning one realized that these questions were 
directed toward tobacco control.
<P>
	I submit that this survey was nothing more than an exercise to 
propagandize members of the House. When I called the authors of 
the survey they refused to give me copies of the survey. As a matter 
of fact, they hung up on me. When I called Health Canada to find 
out how much money was spent and whether I could get a copy, 
because Health Canada was sponsoring the survey, it said the 
survey was not available.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	In other words, I could not get a copy of the survey that was 
phoned to all the MPs in this House of Commons from either 
Health Canada or the authors of the survey even though it was 
entirely financed by Health Canada. So it was simply a propaganda 
exercise.
<P>
	I am happy to say that I do not believe that this Minister of 
Health or this government is bringing forward C-71 as a result of 
being driven by these propaganda exercises by these various lobby 
groups that stand to make so much money in government funds. I 
really do believe that the bill is being driven by a genuine desire to 
find a solution to young people smoking.
<P>
	What I do hope is that when this bill finally passes, the health 
minister will turn to the Department of Health and do something 
about the $60 million in the last three years on tobacco control 
research. I hope he will turn back to the department and redirect 
that type of funding to health care, research, muscular dystrophy 
and cancer and even the creation of tobacco abuse clinics. 
However,  let us stop funding lobby organizations. That is the third 
reason why I support this bill.
<P>
	The fourth and final reason is the amendments moved by the 
member for Lambton-Middlesex, a backbencher, who moved I 
think the most important amendment and the most important 
element of this bill which is to require that any regulation to be set 
as a result of this legislation be referred first to this House of 
Commons and debated by a standing committee before the 
regulation can be passed. This means that when this legislation 
passes there will still be an opportunity for all the stakeholders to 
make sure that the regulations really do reflect the needs not only 
of the tobacco industry and the freedoms of the tobacco industry 
but also the needs of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth for his remarks.
<P>
	A long time ago, Victor Hugo wrote, in <I>Les Misérables</I>, that the 
State does the accounting for us and it does not make mistakes. 
That is what Inspector Javert told Jean Valjean when he put in a 
request for payment of the very small amount he had earned after 
spending 19 years in jail in Toulon.
<P>
	Today, the modern version of <I>Les Mis</I> would read: ``The State 
thinks for you and it does not make mistakes''. As my colleague, 
the hon, member for Chambly, said earlier, ready to think has 
replaced ready to wear, one thought fits all has replaced one size 
fits all.
<P>
	There is something fundamentally wrong in this. Everyone in 
this House is against smoking and against tobacco being readily 
available to young people, but this is not the way to deal with the 
problem.
<P>
	I myself come from a family of smokers. My father's father used 
to smoke a pipe, my mother's father smoked Alouette tobacco, and 
both of them enjoyed cigars. My father smoked approximately two 
packs of Export a day, unfiltered, and my mother still smokes the 
same brand today.
<P>
	I saw so many of those packs of cigarettes on the kitchen table at 
my parents, so many cigarettes and butts all over the place, that the 
thought of starting to smoke never occurred to me. I have never 
touched that forbidden fruit. Perhaps I should have abstained from 
other things, but seeing my parents and family smoking around me 
acting as a disincentive, made me a non smoker. Still today, I look 
at my mother smoking and it says right on her pack of cigarettes 
that smoking is harmful to her lungs, that it could be dangerous if 
she became pregnant-nothing to worry about on that score-and, 
since she smokes American cigarettes, that the surgeon general has 
determined that smoking can be dangerous to your health.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8721"> 8721 </A></B>
<P>
	Smokers do not even read these warnings any more, they are 
so used to them now.
<P>
	The education effort the hon. member for Joliette and the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm referred to earlier is the best 
thing we can do.
<P>
	Where should it start? In school and with people giving a good 
example, but it should continue at work. When our young people 
go to work, when they are in school-let us prevent dropping 
out-they are not smoking.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	When young people are at work or in school, they do not engage 
in criminal activities. It is all a matter of how one uses one's time. 
One way to keep our young people busy is to get them back in 
school or in the workplace, to convince them to pursue their 
professional development.
<P>
	Reducing tobacco use is definitely a noble cause, but I do not 
think that the bill will help that cause. Rather, it will result in 
economic losses for regions such as Lanaudière, and it will also 
increase unemployment in regions such as Haldimand-Norfolk, 
which is represented by the hon. member.
<P>
	Are we going to solve a problem by creating other problems 
elsewhere? I do not think so. Nor do I believe that the promoters 
and sponsors themselves would be seriously hurt if international 
events in Montreal, Valleyfield, Ville-Marie and elsewhere in 
Quebec and in Canada were to disappear because of the loss of 
major sponsors.
<P>
	Therefore, I will oppose Bill C-71, as I did at second reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to pick up on something 
my hon. colleague said, which was that the key to stopping young 
people from smoking is education. One reason I support passage of 
the bill is that I believe we have to try whatever we can to stop 
young people from smoking.
<P>
	However, one thing that it will accomplish is take government 
money way from the special interest groups, the lobbys that make 
so much money by propagandizing both sides of the issue, by 
fomenting conflict and by pretending to educate the public.
<P>
	Millions of dollars are given to these organizations that say they 
are educating the public. If Health Canada really wants to educate 
young people, let it give those millions of dollars to the schools, to 
teachers in the schools whether in Quebec, Ontario or any other 
province, Let the schools teach the children the problems with 
smoking. Do not give the money to the lobbyists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-71 today. I would like to 
make a few remarks about the  comments of the member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk, who extolled the benefits of tobacco 
producers and the positive impact it has made on Canadian society.
<P>
	I want to go on record by saying that it is an absolutely 
outrageous distortion of the truth to say the tobacco producers in 
any way are even remotely considered a benefit to Canadian 
society. It is an affront to every Canadian who is suffering from 
tobacco related diseases. Today the Canadian Cancer Society 
released a study which tragically demonstrates that women have 
unfortunately bypassed men in terms of lung cancer. It is the 
number one killer of women. What a tragedy. Those are the 
benefits the tobacco producers are giving to Canadians.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, 45,000 people die every year as a result of 
tobacco related diseases; 250,000 children take up tobacco every 
single year. Half of them will die prematurely and the morbidity 
statistics will be greater for them than their non-smoking 
colleagues.
<P>
	The cost to the health care system is billions of dollars. The loss 
in gross national product is billions of dollars. What is the benefit 
of this?
<P>
	Today the primary cause of cancer deaths in women is lung 
cancer. It took women 20 year to catch up, but by heaven, ``you 
have come a long way, baby''. Indeed, they have. These are 
statistics of which no one can be proud and are a tragedy.
<P>
	In 1994, just after the election, the situation was similar to what 
it is today except there was tobacco smuggling primarily centred in 
Quebec and on aboriginal reserves in Quebec. That is a bad thing.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	However, not only was tobacco smuggled but also alcohol, 
people, weapons and drugs. Smuggling conduits were occurring 
across the board in full view of the police who were told to leave 
things alone because they were afraid of instigating another Oka 
situation, a significant consideration.
<P>
	What did the government of the day do? This Liberal 
government dropped the tax on tobacco, decreasing the price by up 
to 50 per cent in some provinces. What has that done? It has 
increased the number of children who begin smoking every single 
year by about 50,000 to 100,000.
<P>
	I want to read from a document published by the Ministry of 
Health by Drs. Morrison, Mao and Wigle called ``The Impact of the 
Cigarette Price Rollback on the Future Health of Canadian 
adolescents''. I will read a couple of excerpts.
<P>
	``It is estimated that a 20 per cent reduction in the price of 
cigarettes in the next five years will result in over 142,000 new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8722"> 8722 </A></B>
<P>
adolescent smokers by the end of 1998. Among these persons, 
almost 16,900 smoking  attributable deaths will occur before the 
age of 70, well before their normal life span should be finished''.
<P>
	``A 50 per cent price reduction is estimated to result in over 
355,000 new adolescent smokers over the next five years which 
will result in approximately 40,000 smoking attributable deaths 
before the age of 70''. That is what the government has done.
<P>
	The last paragraph of this document put out by the Ministry of 
Health says: ``Government tobacco control in Canada has had three 
main components: health promotion campaigns, high tobacco taxes 
and restrictive policies on public smoking''. This is important. 
``Even the temporary abandonment of high cigarette taxes will 
likely lead to large numbers of teenagers becoming and/or 
remaining cigarette smokers. The health consequences of the 
recent tax decrease will continue for decades''.
<P>
	I cannot think of a single piece of legislation by any government 
in the history of the country that has had a more negative impact on 
the health and welfare of Canadians, and certainly on the health and 
welfare of children. I do not understand how the people on that 
side, who have children themselves, can in all good conscience 
support that bill.
<P>
	Right after that, I brought in a private member's bill which 
demanded that the government put the tobacco taxes back where 
they were as of January 1994. What was the government's 
response? It would not make it votable so that it could become law. 
It would not give the House the opportunity to make the bill 
votable, become law and have a chance for a full debate. The 
government cut it off in committee. What a shame.
<P>
	In the intervening three years, as a direct result of this policy, 
hundreds of thousands of children are now picking up cigarette 
smoking. It did not have to happen. There was a solution to 
addressing the smuggling situation without compromising the 
health, welfare and lives of Canadian children.
<P>
	In 1992, the Conservative government of the day put an export 
tax on cigarettes. Within six weeks, smuggling went down by 70 
per cent. The tobacco companies said to the government: ``If you 
don't remove this export tax, we will get out of Canada''. What did 
the Conservative government do? It buckled under the pressure, 
removed the export tax and the smuggling went up again. There are 
solutions. The reason why I focus on this is that cost is the single 
most important factor in consumption, particularly among 
children.
<P>
	The government sold out in 1994 because it knew the tobacco 
companies would bring a strong lobby and say to the government: 
``You can't put an export tax on''. Instead the government lowered 
the price and we heard champagne bottles being uncorked in all the 
tobacco companies. They must think we are fools to do this. They 
probably could not imagine that any government would  
compromise the health, welfare and lives of Canadians for political 
expediency, but that is exactly what happened.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore the government promised a $60 million investment 
in education after it lowered the cost because it recognized there 
would be an increase in consumption. However, it did not even put 
$6 million into education. The other $54 million somehow 
disappeared. The government's promise was not kept and people, 
particularly children, are paying the price to this day.
<P>
	During the past three years, with obvious evidence of the 
devastating effects of the government's tobacco tax rollback, the 
government has done nothing. Now it is bringing in a bill which we 
are going to support. It is not perfect by any stretch of the 
imagination, in fact it is quite weak. We are going to support it 
because it is better than nothing.
<P>
	However, there are solutions to the problem. The government 
could have enacted solutions that would have addressed the 
smuggling situation without compromising the health and welfare 
of Canadians. That is what the government should have done.
<P>
	First, it should have kept the cost at the January 1994 level and 
even increased the taxes on tobacco. Second, it should have put an 
export tax on tobacco in order to eliminate smuggling. Third, it 
needed to enforce the law.
<P>
	Nobody talks about the law-abiding aboriginal people on 
reserves who live in the midst of thugs who engage in smuggling. I 
do not care whether they are aboriginal or non-aboriginal. These 
people are breaking the law. If they are breaking the law, the law 
has to be enforced and they should be dealt with accordingly. One 
law, one land, one people. However, that is not happening.
<P>
	The government has put its tail between its legs and has not 
enforced the law. The law needs to be enforced not only for the 
sake of principle but also because nobody speaks for the 
law-abiding aboriginal people on the reserves who live in a culture 
of fear in the midst of these thugs. It does not suit them very much 
to have people who traffic in automatic weapons in their midst.
<P>
	Fourth is education. Unless you have been living in a cave, 
Madam Speaker, it is impossible not to recognize the harmful, 
damaging, deleterious effects of tobacco consumption. We have to 
invest in children. As a physician I know that most people pick up 
tobacco when they are 11 or 12 years of age, not when they are 20. 
When they are 11 or 12 they do not know the difference. You can 
tell them as much as you want that tobacco will cause lung cancer, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a number of other 
problems later on and they simply will not listen because they have 
a sense of immortality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8723"> 8723 </A></B>
<P>
	If we are going to have an effective education policy we have 
to address children in terms that are meaningful to them. We have 
to address their sense of narcissism, which is normal for that age, 
and their sense of self. Tell them that their skin will look ugly, 
that their breath will smell, that their hair will smell. These are 
things they can understand. Tell them that they will age 
prematurely. These are the things they should be telling children, 
not that their lungs will look black when they are 55 years of age. 
That would be a far more effective way to address the educational 
situation with children.
<P>
	The primary reason women and young girls start smoking is to 
be thin, to be skinny. This gets into a whole different issue which 
we can address at another time. The secondary reason is to be cool, 
which is a very difficult issue to address. If we attack their sense of 
narcissism, we will be much more effective in our educational 
policies than we would be if we talked about the long term effects 
of smoking to one's health.
<P>
	Fifth, the government needs to stop subsidizing tobacco 
producers. Sixth, stop promotion and seventh, introduce crop 
substitution policies for the farmers. Contrary to the claims of the 
member for Haldimand-Norfolk, these policies do work.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to address again the aggressive lobby which is being 
put on by the Bloc Quebecois on the sponsorship issue. Would 
these cultural and athletic events really disappear from the 
Canadian scene? Where would they go? To England? To France? 
To the United States? Of course not. All of those countries either 
have or are going to ban tobacco sponsorship of cultural and 
athletic events. They are not going anywhere. This is just another 
move by the tobacco companies to try to prevent having any 
restrictions placed on them and they will go to any length to do 
that.
<P>
	This week during this debate the Bloc Quebecois sponsored an 
event in the Hall of Honour of the House of Commons, which was a 
front for the tobacco companies, where free drinks and food were 
served. It was a cheap, shameless effort to try to seduce members 
of the House to vote against Bill C-71. I cannot think of one reason 
why the people of Quebec should be proud of the members they 
elected to the House who would compromise the health and welfare 
of their children. The province of Quebec has the highest number 
of kids who smoke. They are compromising those children under 
the guise of tobacco sponsorship.
<P>
	The tobacco companies claim that it is an issue of free speech. 
They hide their true agenda under spurious arguments.
<P>
	In the United States they increased the content of carcinogens 
and addictive materials in tobacco.
<P>
	If they say that advertising has no effect on children, why are 
they currently engaged in such a fight? Why do  they invest 
millions of dollars into sponsorships? Out of the goodness of their 
hearts? I do not think so. Why are they currently engaged in the 
most aggressive advertising campaign in China that the world has 
ever seen? They are doing it because they recognize there are 
millions of potential smokers they can capitalize on. China is only 
beginning to realize the cost.
<P>
	The tobacco companies have one agenda, to ensure that the 
greatest number of people in this or any other country smoke. They 
do not give a damn whether there will be any adverse effects. They 
are purveyors of a carcinogenic, toxic material which, if brought to 
this country today, would never be legalized.
<P>
	A libertarian would say that people have the right to do what 
they want. People should have the right to consume whatever they 
want, whenever they want. However, libertarian views do not apply 
to 11 year olds. That is why we are trying to put forth good, tough 
legislation that will address the tobacco epidemic we have in 
Canada today.
<P>
	I urge the government to do the following. First, be courageous 
and restore the tobacco taxes to the January 1995 level. Second, put 
an export tax on tobacco. That will cut the legs out from underneath 
the smugglers. Third, enforce the law so that those people who are 
smuggling are brought to justice. Fourth, introduce appropriate and 
effective educational policies within our schools, not only for 
tobacco but also for alcohol, pot, cocaine, heroin, et cetera. The 
dangers of all those substances need to be told through our 
education system.
<P>
	This is an opportunity for the government to take a leadership 
role on this important issue. It can do something constructive for 
the health and welfare of all Canadians and, most important, for the 
health and welfare of our children.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his comments. As the 
hon. member knows, I do not agree with them certainly.
<P>
	I did not mention this earlier in my speech, but in my riding of 
Haldimand-Norfolk not only do I have the largest number of 
producers of tobacco in the country but I also have the largest 
native reserve in the country. I use reserve in that sense.
<P>
	Yes, the tobacco producers do support me in my riding. 
However, I was shocked to hear some of the statements coming out 
of the Reform Party members who have called on the government 
to put on an export tax and to increase the taxes. Even today on the 
local radio station the Reform candidate in my riding said they are 
against this. I wonder if he has consulted with the local candidate in 
my riding who keeps claiming that Reform would not do any of 
that if they were in government. It is just a question of free speech.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	I know the hon. member and I know his background. We have 
talked about this issue today. I heard just a clip of him talking 
about the tobacco diversification program. I know he, unlike other 
members in his party, has spoken to me and has said that he is 
concerned with tobacco farmers and producers, unlike his House 
leader who said that we should just get rid of them all.
<P>
	I want to explain to the hon. member, who may not be aware, in 
terms of the tobacco diversification program, as I explained earlier, 
there are only so many places where we can diversify. In fact, with 
an 80 acre farm there is not a lot that one can do in terms of 
producing other products. They have been into ginseng and some 
other things but frankly the markets have been cluttered. What does 
he expect these farmers to do when his party puts them out of 
work?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
are very sensitive to anybody who could lose a job. That is the last 
thing we want to happen. However, we have to balance this 
situation out with what is actually occurring.
<P>
	We have a group of individuals producing a substance that is the 
single leading cause of preventable death in this country today. The 
hon. member may talk about 16,000 people who are employed in 
the industry but let us balance this off with the fact that 45,000 
Canadians die every year from tobacco related diseases. Two 
hundred and fifty thousand children pick up the tobacco habit every 
year.
<P>
	The fact is the tobacco lobby is actively going and supporting 
this member for its own gains. It wants to invest money into this 
individual's coffers, not for the benefit of the individual but for the 
benefit of its own pockets. It has no interest whatsoever in trying to 
do something for the betterment of Canadian society and for the 
people therein.
<P>
	The reality is that tobacco producers are caught in a difficult 
situation. Crop diversification has worked in a number of countries 
and I will be happy to offer the hon. member examples of where 
this has occurred. However, beyond that we are looking at a 
situation where the production of the substance is costing the 
Canadian taxpayer and society billions of dollars in losses to health 
care and to the gross national product.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member, when he contemplates this 
situation, to balance out the supposedly tiny gains that he has in his 
own riding to the collective good of Canadian society.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member who 
has just spoken about Bill C-71. He gave us a few issues to think 
about and I would like to congratulate him.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about one thing that our friends in the 
Bloc Quebecois are ignoring. While he, and we, are speaking about 
the health of Canadians throughout the country, wherever they may 
live, the members of the Bloc Quebecois are ignoring the health of 
young and old alike. They are still confusing the issue of 
sponsorships with the issue of health. I would like to thank the 
member for coming back to the topic that concerns us today, which 
is a bill that deals with health.
<P>
	He emphasized certain very important themes, obviously, but I 
would like to ask him a question. It is somewhat political, I admit, 
but it is also necessary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When the member talks about the importance of a 
comprehensive strategy to combat a preventable illness he 
addressed a series of items and he made some recommendations. 
They have been considered by committee and they will continue to 
be debated in this House.
<P>
	He pointed to the export tax which regrettably was tried a few 
short years ago and did not work. We would be prepared to consider 
that or at least his views on the matter. More important, the 
member ought to know that when there was a reduction in the taxes 
on tobacco a few short years ago there was as well a commitment 
of $180 million to provide funds for education, enforcement, 
promotion and research. Of those moneys spread out over four 
years, he will know that in the course of the last three years there 
was $104 million and $24 million currently available for this year.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure there is enough of a question in there for 
the hon. member to address it in one minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
certainly there were quite a few questions in there. I will hit them 
one after another.
<P>
	First, contrary to what my hon. friend said, the export tax did 
work. In 1992 the Conservative government of the day put forth an 
$8 export tax on tobacco. Within six weeks smuggling decreased 
70 per cent. What did the government do in response to pressure 
from the tobacco companies? It put its tail between its legs and 
removed the tax. The tax did work.
<P>
	Second, this government earmarked $64 million for education. 
Less than 10 per cent has actually been spent on tobacco education. 
Where the other $54 million went only the government knows. 
Most likely it went into the general revenues. What is certain is that 
it did not go to where it was supposed to go; again another broken 
promise by this government, compromising the health and welfare 
of Canadian children.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m. we will now proceed to Statements

Sciences for the technological development of IMAX.
<P>
	While studying at the Galt Collegiate Institute, Robert Kerr and 
Graeme Ferguson, together with Bill Shaw, came up with the idea 
of a large screen format motion picture. Following their first IMAX 
type film at Montreal's Expo '67, 148 IMAX theatres have opened 
worldwide and more than 100 IMAX films have been produced, 
making the company one of the largest grossing motion picture 
theatres in North America.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead,

Quebec are panicking. The proof is that a provincial Liberal, 
Monique Gagnon-Tremblay, is supporting the present Conservative 
member for Sherbrooke, with the blessing of the Liberal ministers 
of finance, intergovernmental affairs, and citizenship and 
immigration.
<P>
	The electoral message sent to the Quebec people by federalists is 
therefore the following one: ``Do not vote on the basis of the ideas 
presented by the federalist parties, because in the end, Liberal or 
Conservative, it boils down to the same thing. You must vote 
against the Bloc Quebecois''.
<P>
	What federalists fear most is that Quebecers will once again rise 
up, as they did in 1993, and take real power for themselves by 
voting for the Bloc Quebecois, the only federal party devoted to the 
defence of Quebec's interests until sovereignty is achieved.
<P>
	When provincial Liberals start supporting federal Conservative 
candidates, it means that the federal Liberal Party, the head office, 
as the Prime Minister so often says in this House, has quite simply 
lost control of its provincial branch offices.

Wetaskiwin Composite High School's vocal jazz band ensemble, 
the JazScats.
<P>
	For one week next February New York City will eclipse New 
Orleans as the jazz capital of the United States. Ten of the best 
student jazz ensembles from Canada and the U.S. have been invited 
to participate in the second annual North American Vocal Jazz 
Extravaganza.
<P>
	The Wetaskiwin students will give two solo appearances in 
Carnegie Hall and then join the other groups for the grand finale. 
While in New York the ensemble will take part in special 
workshops and give concerts.

Park City West Community Club in my riding was audited by 
Revenue Canada and found to be in arrears to the tune of over 
$10,000 on the basis of not having charged and remitted GST on 
registrants in sports programs for people 15 years of age and older.
<P>
	I object to the policy of charging GST on these programs. I even 
more strongly object to demanding of a community club run by 
volunteers that it comes up with this kind of money.
<P>
	At a time when we hear so much from the government about 
dealing with youth crime and other related issues, it beats me why 
we should be penalizing community clubs and making sports 
activities more costly for Canadian families with teenagers.
<P>
	I call on the Liberals to change this policy before other 
community clubs are hurt as well. Get tough on the big 
corporations for a change; pick on somebody your own size.

accomplishments the government has made in the sphere of 
women's issues. Let me name a few.
<P>
	Bill C-72 made a defence of self-induced intoxication a thing of 
the past. We passed approximately 100 Criminal Code amendments 
to deal with women's concerns. The witness protection program 
provides safety for women who come forward and report crimes. 
Amendments have been made to the Criminal Code to prosecute 
Canadians who travel abroad and sexually exploit children. There 
are tougher laws against those who exploit juvenile prostitutes and 
those who stalk their victims, and tougher laws to protect the public 
from sexual offenders.
<P>
	We listened to Justice Arbour's report on prison reform. We 
formed a partnership with the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters to wage a public campaign against violence against 
women.
<P>
	Our health strategy is responsive to women's health. The 
national health forum devoted a section to women's health and we 
are listening to its recommendations. Prenatal nutrition programs, 
research funds for children, the strategic initiative program and the

against the behaviour of the hon. member for Saint-Maurice and 
Prime Minister of Canada, who will become known as one of the 
people with the primary responsibility for the first class funeral of 
such events as the Trois-Rivières Grand Prix.
<P>
	In fact, it will remain in the collective memory that, despite 
massive mobilization on a number of fronts, particularly from 
people in his own region who fear for their jobs, the Prime Minister 
continues to unfeelingly turn a deaf ear to these calls for help.
<P>
	In 1993, the Liberals managed to convince the people in 
Saint-Maurice that they would benefit, as would the people in their 
entire region, and Quebec as a whole, from the Prime Minister's 
actions. Today, like the rest of us, they see that the end result is 
nothing but profound frustration, because the Prime Minister 
refuses to react to the negative impact of the anti-sponsorship 
clauses in his bill.

not government spending cuts.

located in Elliot Lake in my riding of Algoma.
<P>
	These Canadians are Robert Boyle, Walter Curlook, Walter 
Holyk, Alfred Powis, Franklin Spragins and Joseph Tyrrell. Clearly 
it is through the efforts of people like these that many small and 
some remote communities are able to enjoy the high technology 
and environmentally sustainable development associated with 
mining today.
<P>
	In particular Walter Holyk provides an excellent example of this 
pioneering spirit. His innovative theories on the genesis of 
volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits led to the discovery of the 
Half Mile deposit in New Brunswick, Nanisivik on Baffin Island 
and, most notable, the Kidd Creek deposit near Timmins, Ontario. 
On behalf of all members I congratulate these inductees on their

friendliest borders in the world. Every year there are over 90 
million border crossings at over 500 ports of entry such as border 
crossings, airports and harbours.
<P>
	Given this, it is remarkable that so few criminals gain access to 
our country. This is not by chance, but it is the result of a very 
effective co-operative effort between Canadian and American law 
and border officials.
<P>
	Every year countless lawbreakers are apprehended at ports of 
entry. Moreover, through efforts such as the joint 
immigration-RCMP task force initiative and Bill C-44 the 
government has done much to rid Canada of such undesirables. In 
1995-96 over 1,600 criminals were removed from Canada.

co-operative efforts that exist between Canadian and American law

pressures from his Liberal caucus colleagues and announced 
adjustments to the employment insurance act.
<P>
	In order to counteract the potential negative effects of the 
calculation of short work weeks, the government has just launched 
plans for adjustments in 29 high-employment regions. These will 
run until November 15, 1998, and two different methods will be 
used to encourage the unemployed to accept the so-called short 
work weeks.
<P>
	In certain regions, the method applied will make it possible to 
group short weeks together, while in others the method selected 
will be to exclude these when calculating eligibility for benefits.

unfortunate record: wages paid women in Canada are the lowest of 
all the industrialized countries, after Japan. In 1994, women 
formed the main contingent of the poor.
<P>
	Employment equity is essential to an egalitarian society. When 
jobs are increasingly threatened and income security is vital to a 
changing society, the Liberal government is denying its election 
promises, cutting social programs dramatically and lowering its 
unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois considers that the Liberal government,

problem.
<P>
	Under the leadership of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development we have taken swift action to solve this problem as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	In Cumberland-Colchester where unemployment is greater 
than 10 per cent and long term jobs are difficult to find, the new 
adjustment project will enable workers to bundle small weeks.
<P>
	In other areas workers will be able to exclude small weeks from 
their calculation of benefits. This will ensure that workers in every 
region of the country are able to take full advantage of all available 
work without having their benefits lowered.

the Sports Network.
<P>
	On one hand, the spokesperson for Health Canada says that the 
bill does not prohibit broadcasting of the Australian Grand Prix and 
other Grand Prix racing events of the season. On the other hand, 
according to Normand Legault, who has the TV broadcasting rights 
for the Formula I race, and I quote: ``If the bill is passed, Grand 
Prix events will not be broadcast because cigarette brands sold in 
Canada appear on the cars and the drivers''.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us whether under the provisions of the bill, 
it will be possible to televise the Australian Grand Prix on the 
weekend and whether broadcasts of other Grand Prix events will be 
allowed, even if the cars carry a logo or brand of a tobacco product?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister has attempted over the last number of months to be 
extremely candid with the hon. member opposite. I hope he and 
members of his party will start to be responsible in terms of the 
information contained in the bill.
<P>
	Just so that the hon. member fully understands-and this is 
about the fifth time people have had to clarify it-I ask him to 
listen very attentively. Before and after October 1, 1998 the 
legislation-and I want to be careful here-will not prohibit the 
broadcasting of sporting events originating in Canada and in other 
countries including Grand Prix racing.
<P>
	Even representatives of the firms he stands to support and tries to 
speak on behalf of knew that information a long time ago.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the time frame referred to by the minister does not apply 
to one clause, and if I could say it is clause 31, I would, but I will 
not, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Please put your question now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the minister, if it is true 
that this clause is protected by this time frame, to put it in writing 
and say so-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I would rather the bill not be 
mentioned at all, but, after questions were raised a few days ago, I 
reviewed all the questions. Since none dealt directly with the bill, I 
allowed them.
<P>
	I would also ask that, in their answers, the ministers not refer to 
the bill or any of its parts. If answers could remain general in 
nature, it would be best, much better than referring directly to 
clauses after saying they would not be mentioned and then 
mentioning them again.
<P>
	That is my decision. The hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Health.
<P>
	I find it ironic that, on the one hand, the minister claims to want 
to protect the health of young people in Quebec and Canada, while, 
on the other hand, the primary effect of his anti-tobacco policy will 
be to jeopardize the future of events such as the film festival, which 
gives young creators a chance to make themselves known, show 
what they can do and get their career off the ground.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that his policies banning the 
sponsorship of cultural events may well result in denying young 
artists important opportunities to launch their career?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the preamble of the hon. member's question is absolute nonsense. 
The hon. member knows that the full intent and purpose of that 
legislation are health related.
<P>
	The hon. member also knows, as do all the groups in his 
province and elsewhere to which he has referred, that sponsorship 
is not being banned, that sponsorship promotion is not being 
banned and that after the implementation period there will be no 
banning of promotion and no banning of sponsorship promotion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us approach 
the issue from a different angle. The government is attacking 
sporting and cultural events in Quebec, while continuing to support 
tobacco research in Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> How can the minister claim his sole focus is health, 
when his government is still subsidizing, through Agriculture 
Canada, experimental research on tobacco growing?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman should know 
that in 1996-97 the funding for research was down some 90 per cent 
compared with the level it was at in the mid-1980s. That research, 
which involves about one and a half person-years, is focused on 
agronomic matters which have absolutely nothing to do with the 
promotion of tobacco production. Our emphasis is on 
diversification and assisting farmers in finding ways to get out of 
tobacco production.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for a month the Prime Minister has been in denial about 
his government's role in cutting health care. But yesterday in 
question period he finally admitted that the Liberals had cut health 
care, and cut it they have, with a $1.2 billion cut in federal transfers 
to Ontario alone.
<P>
	The effects of these Liberal cuts are being felt today in Toronto 
with the announced closings of 10 hospitals, including the 
Wellesley and the Women's College hospitals. Ten hospitals are 
gone in Toronto, a dozen closed in Thunder Bay, Sudbury, 
Pembroke, London and Ottawa, and behind it all, the Liberal 
Government of Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8730"> 8730 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	How does the health minister propose to repair the damage that 
federal cuts to health care are doing in Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when a government is faced with a deficit the size of ours it has to 
cut. It cannot ignore 20 to 25 per cent of its spending which is 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party referred to the $1.2 billion 
reduction in those transfers to Ontario. What he did not mention 
was the $500 million reduction in interest cost to that province as a 
result of the actions that the government has taken. Nor did he 
make a reference to the $4.5 billion tax cut that will reduce 
Ontario's revenues, three and a half times larger than the reduction 
in transfers.
<P>
	In other words, he should understand that if hospitals are being 
closed in Ontario it is as a result of a political choice. Tax cuts are 
being made. I will not dispute them, but they are not the result of a 
reduction in transfers from the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, where was the health minister in all of this? This health 
minister clawed and scratched to get a couple of million dollars 
transferred from another riding to his riding but where was he when 
there was a $4 billion cut in health care?
<P>
	There was a budget discussion in cabinet before the budget came 
down and a choice was made to subsidize businesses and 
corporations to the tune of $7 billion while cutting health care by 
almost $4 billion.
<P>
	Why did the government choose to cut health care by almost $4 
billion but continued to fund crown corporations and subsidize 
businesses to the tune of $7 billion? Where are the priorities of the 
Liberal Party?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
provinces across the country are cutting in a number of social 
areas. The fact that it is happening in Ontario is not the result of the 
reductions in transfers. It is the result of a political decision taken 
by that government.
<P>
	At the same time the province of Alberta is declaring surpluses 
and cutting taxes. He cannot say that it is reductions in federal 
transfers when Alberta is cutting taxes and declaring surpluses.
<P>
	The province of Saskatchewan began cutting and closing 
hospitals before this government took office. The statements of the 
Reform Party are nonsense and they do not bear any kind of 
examination.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government cannot avoid the fact that it had a choice 
and it chose not to cut subsidies to crown corporations and 
businesses and it chose to cut health care.
<P>
	Thanks to the Liberal government, hospitals across the country 
are closing. Thanks to the Liberal government, waiting lists are 
longer. Over 170,000 Canadians are on waiting lists, and 45 per 
cent of them say they are waiting in pain. That is what the 
government's choice to cut health care and to continue to subsidize 
corporations and businesses through handouts has meant to 
Canadians.
<P>
	When the government had a choice between corporate handouts 
and hospital closures, why did the government choose hospital 
closures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the leader of the Reform Party has not read two documents. The 
first document is the series of budgets brought down by this 
government. Subsidies to businesses have been cut by 70 per cent. 
Crown corporations have been privatized. The Canadian National 
Railway has been privatized. Air navigation has been privatized. 
The funding to crown corporations has been cut.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not seem to understand that when we 
chose the priorities we put the money back into health care in this 
budget. We put the money into research and development. We put 
the money into education.
<P>
	As well, there is a second document which Reform has obviously 
not had a chance to take a look at. It happens to be its own fresh 
start.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Where does the leader of the Reform Party get the nerve to stand 
up in this House, having recommended over the last three years that 
old age pensions be cut further, that health care be cut further, that 
the basic social fabric of the country be cut further and then say that 
the first thing Reformers would do on taking office is cut the 
Canadian health and social transfer by a further $3.5 billion. That is 
what they said. Now stand up and justify it.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, we learned that Serge L'Archer, a Quebec volunteer 
with the Canadian Centre for International Studies and 
Co-operation, was captured on Friday, in Niger, by Toubou rebels. 
When the incident occurred, Mr. L'Archer was with four local 
people at an oasis in the Sahara located 1,200 kilometres from 
Niamey, the capital of Niger.
<P>
	Can the minister reassure this House and tell us, without any 
doubt, that Mr. L'Archer is safe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie,  Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
officials from my department and from the Canadian International 
Development Agency had a telephone conversation with

<HR>
<B><A NAME="8731"> 8731 </A></B>
<P>
Mr. L'Archer. I personally had an opportunity yesterday to talk to 
Mr. L'Archer's sister. I telephoned her, at her house, to inform her 
of the communication between her brother and departmental 
officials.
<P>
	It goes without saying that the Canadian government is 
demanding that those who are detaining this Canadian volunteer 
release him immediately, so that he can continue the good deeds 
and the humanitarian work that he is doing, as are all those who do 
this kind of work for the good of humanity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to point out that we did not get any information about whether Mr. 
L'Archer is safe.
<P>
	Therefore, as a supplementary, I ask the minister whether he can 
tell us why Toubou rebels are holding Mr. L'Archer hostage and 
what demands have been made for his release.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at this point we do not know why Mr. L'Archer is being held 
hostage.
<P>
	Of course, there has been some speculation in the media. For 
example, some newspapers wrote that the rebels seized Mr. 
L'Archer to use him as a bargaining tool in their negotiations with 
the country's authorities. These are merely allegations reported by 
the media. The hon. member probably read these reports but, at this 
point, the Canadian government still has not met personally with 
Mr. L'Archer, who is being detained as an hostage. We managed to 
talk to him once and we are doing our best to reach him again.
<P>
	Again, the Canadian government is demanding that those who 
are holding Mr. L'Archer hostage release him as soon as possible, 
so that he can continue his humanitarian work.

could table our parliamentary document to show what the fresh 
start really says about health care-$4 billion back into it, by the 
way.
<P>
	The new hospital closings in Ontario are being announced today. 
Yet the Liberal government continues to give, for example, 
$323,000 to the Canadian wine development program and 
$300,000 to friends at the Shawinigan Industrial Centre. It is 
straightforward. That money should be going back into hospitals.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government continue to waste health care 
dollars by subsidizing business and its corporate buddies instead of 
putting money into hospitals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in September 1993 the leader of the third party said that his party 
supported user fees or deductibles and would eliminate universality 
when it comes to health care.
<P>
	On March 5, 1996 the leader of the third party was asked point 
blank his position on transfer payments. He said: ``There's going to 
have to be continued reductions in social transfers''.
<P>
	We have just seen the fresh start that has been referred to by the 
Minister of Finance. In it another $3.5 billion cut is being 
advocated by the members of the third party. I wish they would 
stop the hypocrisy.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would much prefer that we stay away from 
words like hypocrisy because it triggers reactions that we might not 
want to have. I would ask members to refrain from using that word 
and being very judicious in their comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the health 
minister voted for the Liberal cuts he voted for the closure of the 
hospital in Sudbury. He voted for the closure of the Wellesley. He 
also voted for a closure of the hospital in Thunder Bay.
<P>
	Why does the health minister not stand up in the House of 
Commons and publicly admit that the cuts he voted for are closing 
hospitals across the land and they are in fact a Liberal legacy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the unholy alliance continues with the Harris government in the 
province of Ontario. The hard core reality is that Canada has the 
second most expensive health care system in the OECD countries. 
As report after report have said, the issue is not one of funding, it is 
one of management.
<P>
	The gall of the hon. member, to stand in his place and to suggest 
that we on this side are responsible when it was he and his party 
just one year ago that, by way of amendment put forward by the 
leader of the third party, was asking for additional cuts to transfer 
payments.

finally listened to reason and announced a six month moratorium 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8732"> 8732 </A></B>
<P>
on removals to Algeria; a  moratorium that the Bloc Quebecois has 
long been calling for.
<P>
	In recent weeks, the media have been reporting daily on the 
extremely serious situation in Zaire. Now that it has finally seen the 
light in the case of Algeria, what is the government waiting for to 
announce a moratorium on removals to Zaire?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows, the Advisory Committee on Country Conditions 
for Removals monitors countries and decides and recommends to 
the government what action to take on different countries.
<P>
	It recommended that there be some assistance with Algeria. That 
is why we requested that all removals to Algeria be suspended for a 
six-month period until CIC officials are in a position to assess more 
accurately the dangers.
<P>
	Rwanda, Burundi and Afghanistan are three other countries 
which are covered in addition to Algeria. At this time Zaire is not a

closures in Ontario. That is a fairly significant matter with respect 
to health care.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	The health minister seems utterly indifferent to that fact and 
seems unable to see any connection between that and a reduction of 
$1.2 billion in transfers from the federal government to Ontario.
<P>
	Does the federal health minister accept any responsibility at all 
for the hospital closures that are occurring in Ontario today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite cannot have it both ways. One day he 
stands up and says to the Government of Canada ``you do not have 
any role to play with regard to the delivery of health care in this 
country, it is a provincial responsibility''. Now he stands in his 
place and says to the Government of Canada ``now you have a role 
to play in terms of the management of hospitals within provincial 
jurisdiction''.
<P>
	The hon. member has to realize, and perhaps an early course or a 
quick course in constitutional law would allow him to understand, 
that this a provincial jurisdiction, a management decision which 
the province of Ontario had to make and it made that decision.
<P>
	The question is does the Reform Party support Michael Harris in 
his closures of hospitals in the province of Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all members in the House know that the federal 
government has a responsibility with respect to funding of health 
care and the broad framework. It is the funding aspect that we are 
talking about.
<P>
	We are wondering where this minister was in the prebudget 
discussions when the government decided to subsidize crown 
corporations and businesses to the tune of $7 billion a year and 
decided at the same time to cut health care by almost $4 billion.
<P>
	Where was the minister when that decision was made? Why did 
he not stick up for health care in that circumstance, as he obvious 
did not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite just does not get it. Does he support the 
Conservative Government of Ontario? In view of the fact that he 
has not taken a position, I can only assume that he does support the 
closure of hospitals in the province of Ontario. That is a decision 
that the Conservative government in the province of Ontario had to 
make, and it made the decision. I charge that the leader of the third 
party supports the decisions of Michael Harris in the province of

<P>

which we have done, and take the steps that we did to improve the

<P>
overall financing and management of the fund, very  clearly this, 
which was not a tax, would not be seen as a tax but as what it really 
is, a contribution to people's pensions.
<P>
	The basic question that Reform members have to answer is this. 
Is it their intention to abandon current seniors and those who are 
about to retire? Is it their intention to renege on the $500 billion 
liability in the Canada pension plan? If it is not, how do they justify 
the 13 per cent increase in Canada pension plan contributions that 
will result from their plan?
<P>
	How do they think, in that weird little mind where they do their 
own arithmetic, 13 per cent is lower than 9.9 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister said that if the government moved quickly on this thing it 
would not be seen as a tax. Any Canadian who gets their T-4 in the 
mail this week is going to have a really hard time saying they do 
not see this as a tax when they see CPP premiums go up by 70 per 
cent. It is just ridiculous.
<P>
	The minister's non-answers in the House day after day on this 
topic point to a very serious problem with this government, the 
issue of trust. The minister continues to ignore his own department

How could Canadians trust this government with anything, let

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	We learned recently that last year, on at least three occasions, 
Canadian customs officer stopped individuals trying to bring into 
the country hundreds of syringes containing bovine somatotropin.
<P>
	In view of the fact that a Health Canada inspector has 
acknowledged how easy it is for dairy farmers to get this hormone, 
what action is the government contemplating to prevent it from 
entering Canada in large quantities and eventually finding its way 
into the dairy supply system and onto our plates?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman will know, 
the responsibility for conducting the necessary scientific reviews in 
terms of health and safety matters rests with the department of 
health. The department of health is conducting its work and has 
been since about 1990. No decision has been taken, meaning that 
no notice of compliance has been issued. Accordingly, the laws of 
Canada stand in terms of preventing the importation and sale of 
rBST in Canada.
<P>
	The responsibility for watching the border in terms of illegal 
importations or potentially illegal importations of course rests with 
Canada customs. They duly exercise their responsibilities and carry 
out their duties at the border to make sure that products which are 
not legal in Canada are not allowed into Canada.
<P>
	We will always do our very best to enforce the law and maintain 
the health and safety of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

<P>
	Will the Minister of Agriculture commit to holding a public

should the study conducted by his department result in the

Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. The type of

<P>
	Could the minister tell us what the objectives of his mission are 
and what its impact on Quebec farmers and the agri-food industry

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 1997 is Canada's year for 
Asia-Pacific and my agri-food trade mission to Japan and 
Indonesia is part of our ongoing Team Canada effort to build on our 
export success in that region of the world. Asia-Pacific is the 
fastest growing economic zone on the face of the earth and we have 
to be there vigorously and persistently to get our share of the trade

the largest ever Canadian agri-food trade delegation from the

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us do a 
simple comparison. The MP pension plan will pay out a maximum 
of $48,300 a year after 19 years of service, while Canadians have to 
work 35 years for a mere pittance of $8,800 a year. Not only that, 
but if a senior only has the new seniors benefit and the CPP, the 
Minister of Finance will take back half the CPP, which is blatantly 
unfair.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance promise this House that he will 
introduce legislation now to clawback the MP pension plan on the 
same basis as the CPP?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the question of MP compensation is one that has been debated in 
this House. There are several different ways to go at it. When the 
government brought in its legislation it substantially cut the MP 
pension plan which had existed prior to the legislation. It did this in 
a number of ways. The cut approximates some 25 per cent to 30 per 
cent for certain MPs.
<P>
	The basic issue is that we decided to go at it that way. Reform 
suggested that MP salaries should be doubled. We said no.

The minister knows that Sharjah Oil Refinery Company in the 
United Arab Emirates has applied to the Federal Export 
Development Corporation for export financing in order to buy and 
dismantle the Ultramar oil refinery in Eastern Passage.
<P>
	Nova Scotians, in particular those who lost their jobs when 
Ultramar shut down its refinery in 1994 in breach of its 
commitments, are outraged that the EDC would even consider 
helping this foreign company to dismantle its Canadian assets.
<P>
	Will the minister insist that the EDC respect its legislative 
mandate and will he ensure that not one cent of taxpayer money 
goes to support this fire sale of the Ultramar refinery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have sympathy for the position that many 
people in Nova Scotia have expressed with respect to the closing of 
this refinery. But it was to be closed some three years ago. It is no 
longer producing jobs for the people of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The package that the Export Development Corporation is 
looking into is much broader than that one refinery. It is looking at 
a package that will involve some 700 person years of employment 
for Canadians and some 150 person years of employment for Nova 
Scotians.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-71, 
an act to regulate the manufacture, sale, labelling and promotion of 
tobacco products, to make consequential amendments to another 
act and to repeal certain acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in favour of Bill 
C-71, the government's tobacco control strategy.
<P>
	Over the past few months I have been part of a group of 
concerned caucus members encouraging and providing support to 
the Minister of Health in his efforts to introduce the legislation. I 
am pleased to see his efforts have finally been realized.
<P>
	It is estimated that more than 40,000 Canadians die each year 
due to the effects of smoking, mostly due to lung and heart disease. 
Twenty-one per cent of all deaths in Canada can be attributed to 
smoking. This makes smoking the number one preventable cause 
of death and disease in Canada.
<P>
	We are all well aware of the links between the use of tobacco and 
serious disease. We can also assume that as tobacco use continues 
to rise among Canadians the death toll will increase accordingly.
<P>
	It is not only by reducing the demand for tobacco now that we 
will be able to reduce the number of Canadians  who will die 
painful tobacco deaths in the future. This is why the health 
minister's new tobacco control strategy is so important.
<P>
	When the Supreme Court of Canada struck down certain 
elements of the tobacco producers control act in 1995 it left the 
Canadian government, representatives of the Canadian people, 
with too little control over tobacco regulation. Alternative control 
measures became a necessity. This is not an entirely new initiative.
<P>
	The government has been exploring its options ever since the 
Supreme Court ruling. Many of my constituents have been critical 
expressing their disappointment with how long it has taken for the 
government to act. I shared some of their concerns but it was 
important that all available options were studied thoroughly. This 
time we had to get it right.
<P>
	Late last year the government released a blueprint on tobacco 
control outlining the various options available. Since then we have 
received comments from many different Canadians, doctors, 
business people, the tobacco industry, consumers, parents and 
various credible advocacy groups. These new regulations are a 
product of this ongoing study.
<P>
	I am confident they will arm us for a successful battle to curb 
future tobacco use in Canada. Tobacco use is not simply a problem 
for the individual who smokes. Tobacco use is costly to every 
member of society in a number of ways. It is estimated that in 1991 
the cost of smoking in Canada totalled $15 billion in direct health 
care costs and lost productivity.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Smokers visit the doctor more than non-smokers. They spend 
more time in hospitals and they occupy more spaces in long term 
health care facilities. In total smoking alone costs the health care 
system $3.5 billion.
<P>
	Smokers are absent from work more than non-smokers. It has 
been estimated a smoking employee costs over $3,000 year more to 
employ than a non-smoker due to lost days. In addition, lost 
productivity from smoke breaks, waiting for smoke breaks and 
thinking about smoke breaks cannot be calculated.
<P>
	Finally, 40,000 smoking related deaths amount to about $10.6 
billion in lost revenue for Canada. Compare this figure to the $2.6 
billion the federal excise tax and duty on tobacco products 
generates. In the end smoking costs the Canadian economy billions 
in lost productivity, health care and social assistance to the families 
of those who are incapacitated by smoke related diseases. The new 
tobacco legislation will see many positive improvements. It will 
limit youth access to tobacco products to fight tobacco use before it 
becomes an addiction.
<P>
	I recall visiting the Woodlands Secondary School in my riding as 
the local trustee the year we banned student  smoking rooms and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8738"> 8738 </A></B>
<P>
smoking areas in schools. I was asked by students why we were 
banning smoking rooms for kids and allowing the teachers to 
smoke in the staff room. At the time I gave a very facile answer. I 
said: ``They are adults and they are old enough to kill themselves if 
they choose to''.
<P>
	The real answer was that they were all addicted. By banning 
student smoking areas we were trying to stop the influence of one 
smoker over another and stop young people from smoking.
<P>
	Immediately after the visit to the school, though, we put a 
proposal before the board of trustees to ban all smoking on all 
school property for adults as well as students, and those rules still 
stand today. The interesting part is that teachers have to put on their 
coats in the bad weather and walk up and down the street to smoke. 
This is not a very glamorous image. The kids are beginning to see 
how horrible it is, how addicted the teachers are, and how foolish 
they look walking up and down the street.
<P>
	Almost 30 per cent of 15 to 19 year olds and 15 per cent of 10 to 
14 year olds are currently smokers. This is both frightening and 
unacceptable. Eighty-five per cent of smokers begin their addiction 
before they are 16 years of age when they are most susceptible to 
peer pressure and the desire to fit in. The new measures introduced 
in the legislation will specifically target youth prohibiting 
self-service displays, banning vending machine sales and requiring 
photo ID to confirm age.
<P>
	The new legislation will also limit the marketing and promotion 
of tobacco products including restrictions on tobacco advertising, 
packaging, sales promotions and promotions through sponsorships. 
Promotional materials containing tobacco brand names will be 
restricted to publications with primarily adult readerships.
<P>
	Some will argue that these regulations unfairly hurt the tobacco 
industry as well as the events they sponsor. However this concern 
must be tempered with the concern for the health of our children. 
We cannot afford to sacrifice the health of the country by allowing 
another generation of smokers to begin this life threatening habit.
<P>
	Marketers of tobacco products use a range of lifestyle 
advertising to sell their products. They are very appealing methods 
to attempt to create a link between tobacco and an attractive 
lifestyle. They are particularly fascinating to children and youth. 
``Smoke Marlboroughs and be a real man''. ``Smoke Slims and 
men will fall in great stacks at your feet''.
<P>
	The government has no intention of telling tobacco companies 
what they can or cannot sponsor. Nor is it prohibiting the 
sponsorship of a whole category of events. The government is 
simply restricting the extent to which companies can relate tobacco 
brand names to activities which convey a desirable, glamorous and 
exciting lifestyle.
<P>
	The new tobacco strategy in Canada will also see increased 
health information on tobacco packages, the establishment of an 
enforcement mechanism to regulate the chemical contents of 
cigarettes, control of the practice of supercharging with addictive 
nicotine and the adding of other chemicals to enhance the effects of 
nicotine. Altogether I am confident these measures will eventually 
have a significant impact on the consumption of tobacco products 
in Canada.
<P>
	This is not the end of government action in this area. In addition 
to the actions of the Department of Health other ministries will be 
taking part in this initiative. The federal and some provincial 
governments will raise their taxes on tobacco products to a 
combined rate of $1.40 a carton, together with an extension of the 
federal surtax on tobacco manufacturers at the rate of 40 per cent 
for three years.
<P>
	Many of my constituents have been calling for such measures. 
They serve the dual purpose of increasing the price of tobacco 
products as well as increasing government revenue to pay for some 
of the costs associated with tobacco use. This tax increase will be 
accompanied by anti-smuggling initiatives to make sure the 
increase does not result in the resumption of cigarette smuggling. 
In fact, it is estimated that since the government began its 
anti-smuggling initiatives in 1994, enforcement has prevented $2 
billion worth of illegal products from reaching the streets in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	The final element is also one of the most important. Fifty million 
dollars over five years have been committed to enforce this 
legislation and to provide health education programs. I can say 
from experience that education programs are essential in fighting 
tobacco use among young people.
<P>
	As testimony to that fact, the government is focusing its 
initiatives where they most matter, to prevent Canadians, 
particularly youths, from becoming addicted to tobacco products. 
Retailers will only be marginally affected by the legislation. Retail 
displays will be limited and photo ID will be required for purchase 
but the government will not regulate who can sell tobacco products 
at this time. This is very reasonable legislation.
<P>
	I am pleased to have had the opportunity speak on behalf of this 
long awaited legislation. I am particularly proud of the Minister of 
Health, the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary for their 
diligence in the face of so much organized and well-funded 
opposition.
<P>
	Tobacco use in Canada is a health problem. We must ensure that 
the health of the country is not lost to this addictive product. We 
already have one of the best records in the world and we must strive 
to make it even better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I listened to the hon. member's comments  about Bill 
C-71, I was reminded of travelling and talking with a number of 
constitu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8739"> 8739 </A></B>
<P>
ents when I was last back in my riding about the legislation and 
other issues.
<P>
	One thing was brought home to me by small business people 
who, among other things, sell tobacco to consumers. They were 
wondering why it is not illegal for young people to possess and 
smoke tobacco. If the government is as concerned as it says about 
the health risks posed by cigarettes and tobacco to young 
Canadians, why would the government not make it illegal for 
minors to possess and smoke cigarettes?
<P>
	If it is looked at in the context of alcohol, for example, the shops, 
bars or liquor vendors who sell product to minors are held 
accountable for that action and can be charged and fined, or 
perhaps lose their licence or permit. In the case of cigarettes 
vendors can be fined, and rightly so, if they sell this hazardous 
product to young people. But it is not illegal for young people to 
smoke.
<P>
	I wonder why the hon. member has not added her voice to those 
who are calling for that type of action by the government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am continually amazed and 
appalled at the desire of members of the Reform Party to 
criminalize as many people as they can. Their net is now including 
14-year-olds which I find appalling.
<P>
	It is illegal to sell cigarettes to kids. We should be going after the 
adults who are doing this and making a profit off the health of 
young people. But to collect a bunch of 14-year-olds, charge them, 
take them to court and turn them into criminals is not the idea of the 
government or any other government.
<P>
	Again, I find it appalling that the Reform's law and order goes 
beyond all limits when it wants to see 14-year-olds arrested.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the 
inconsistency that bothers us on this side of the House. The 
government is quite willing to charge 14-year-olds for the 
possession of liquor. It is going to charge and convict store owners 
for selling to 14-year-olds or 16-year-olds inadvertently, but it is 
not going to charge 14-year-olds for possession.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Dealing with tobacco, this situation is being advocated by our 
hon. colleague who just responded to my colleague's question. On 
the other hand the government is charging 14-year-olds and anyone 
under age for the possession of liquor. Where is the consistency in 
the Liberal policy? There is none.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are being very consistent. The 
consistent desire of the Liberal government is to increase health 
protection for the youngest child to the oldest senior. We are 
consistent in wanting to charge adults who lure children into 
smoking. We are consistent in that the penalties are for the crass  
people who purposely sell to children without asking for ID. We are 
very consistent in being very concerned about their health.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
amazement and chagrin that I rise to take part in the debate today.
<P>
	When I was 13 years old I took up smoking. Yes, both my 
parents smoked, as did most adults I knew. It was 1961 and in spite 
of the U.S. surgeon general's report some eight years earlier, 
smoking was still the norm.
<P>
	Five years ago, after numerous tries, I finally managed to quit. I 
thank God daily that I did so. During those pretty awful weeks that 
followed my last cigarette, I brooded considerably about why I had 
taken that first step as a teenager. The answer, actually, was fairly 
easy. It was considered grown up. It was considered sophisticated. 
It was considered cool, an adjective or attribute as desirable in 
1961 as it is in 1997.
<P>
	I do not know why we have not succeeded in killing this image 
of smoking for our young. I suspect the reasons are complex and 
manifold, but I do know that the advertising of cigarettes is part of 
the problem.
<P>
	I truly cannot believe the commentators, the pundits and the 
Bloc Quebecois who somehow pretend to believe that the 
advertising of tobacco is unrelated to increased smoking by young 
people. I actually heard one person, no doubt just off the shuttle 
from Mars, say that young people's smoking was unrelated to 
advertising, but particularly unrelated to arts advertising. That 
makes me sick.
<P>
	Smoking cigarettes kills people. It is not a theory, it is a fact. 
Smoking is a cause of lung cancer. It is a cause of emphysema. It 
exacerbates asthma. It is a cause of heart disease and it is a cause of 
strokes. Recent research has made strong links to the incidence of 
breast cancer being caused by smoking or exacerbated by smoking.
<P>
	Smoking is dangerous. It is deadly. Take any smoker in the 
country and beleaguered as he or she may be by being forced to 
congregate in the cold or in small ghettoizing rooms, lectured 
constantly by the medical profession and by the converted like me, 
I will bet that the most militant smoker does not want his or her 
child to take up this habit. It is not because of any social stigma. It 
is not because of the cold porches. It is not even because your 
clothes and your hair stink. It is because no loving parent wants a 
child to place his life in jeopardy.
<P>
	Let us look at the issue of advertising and consumption-the 
consumption of any good-and let us make it really simple.
<P>
	Companies that want to sell their goods spend massive dollars on 
advertising. Why do companies spend massive dollars on 
advertising? To sell their product and to make a profit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8740"> 8740 </A></B>
<P>
	We all know that is true, but for some reason, as I noted with 
surprise yesterday, the editorial writers of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
were having a problem with this. I hope what I have said today 
may be of some help to them.
<P>
	Just in case there is any further doubt, people do not buy 
cigarettes for decoration or bookends or ballast. They buy 
cigarettes to smoke them and smoking them makes them sick. The 
difficulty here of course-I do not minimize it-is the question of 
arts funding. Let me state, unequivocally, my long time devotion to 
the enhancement of Canadian cultural endeavours.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	In my previous life I was an actor, first in amateur and later in 
professional productions. I have served on the boards of theatres, 
dance, music and other arts organizations. I have maintained an 
active interest in the visual and performing arts in my city, my 
province, my region and my country. This is something that is very 
close to my heart.
<P>
	I want more and better funding for artists and artistic 
endeavours, from Halifax's wonderful Shakespeare in the Park to 
CBC Radio and I will work my fingers to the bone to help find it. 
But I will not, I cannot, say that money earned from a dangerous 
product is okay.
<P>
	Tobacco must not be the saviour of the arts in Canada. There are 
other sources and we must each work together, all of us on all sides 
of this House, and with the people in our constituencies to find 
them.
<P>
	I know from personal experience what it is like to sit around a 
board room table late at night in the face of government cuts, in the 
face of private sector cuts, desperately searching with other 
devotees and volunteers for alternative sources of funding; 
scrambling, scrimping and scraping to maintain this festival or this 
theatre company. I know.
<P>
	I also know what it is like to watch a friend walk around carrying 
a portable oxygen tent, unable to walk up stairs, unable to pick up a 
grandchild because of the emphysema that is choking off his life.
<P>
	I have spoken many times to hard pressed artists, producers and 
artistic directors about this terrible dichotomy that we face, but not 
one of them suggested that tobacco was benign. The artistic 
community is in a terrible position. I understand the position of the 
people in Quebec and across the country who are terrified for their 
jobs. However, this issue goes beyond that. It is a question of right 
and wrong.
<P>
	I do not blame people for fighting but I say to them that while we 
do not have all or even some of the answers with regard to funding 
in these days of financial restraint and cutback, the answer is not to 
turn a blind eye to a hazardous, dangerous product.
<P>
	The legislation gives us and them two years. I pledge my 
strongest efforts, and I know millions of other  Canadians will as 
well. We cannot afford the status quo. I cannot in all conscience 
indulge my passion for the theatre, for the ballet, for the music I 
love, if always in the back of my mind I see teenagers trying to be 
cool, trying to be grown up in a corner of the schoolyard, beginning 
an addiction that will lead them ultimately to an early grave.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address a question to the member for Halifax. She said that 
this bill is a question of right or wrong. Could she elaborate on 
whether it is not also a question of individual rights and 
responsibilities?
<P>
	We are here as politicians assuming our responsibility of trying 
to do what is in the greater interest of a greater number of people. 
The target of this bill is youth and trying to prevent them from 
becoming addicted to this habit.
<P>
	In so doing, how far does one go before ending up stepping on 
individual rights, freedom of choice, freedom to choose to smoke 
or not to smoke, to drink or not to drink? These are, after all, legal 
products. How far does one go before ending up having to conclude 
that, if it is so bad, if all the statistics being put out today are true, 
why is smoking legal?
<P>
	I submit that it is also individual rights and responsibilities. We 
are trying to address our responsibilities here. I am supportive of 
the bill because of its target. It is just a question of the other 
element.
<P>
	I see what is happening in our society. Legislatures are trying to 
be so good at looking after all the problems that they end up going 
too far, intruding into people's lives and tramping on their rights.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	What if we sort of twisted this and said maybe parents are 
responsible for their kids a little as well? Would she elaborate on 
the issue of rights and responsibilities?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre for his question because I know that it was heartfelt 
and well meant. I am glad he asked it.
<P>
	I do not know the exact dates because I am far too young, but 
there may be others in this House who do, but many years ago when 
we had prohibition in this country, I had a great uncle by marriage 
who made a great deal of money from prohibition because he 
owned a number of boats that sailed from St. Pierre de Michelon 
down through the St. Lawrence before the seaway right into 
Chicago. He was a rum runner. He sat at a desk in an office in Cape 
Breton and made a whole lot of money being a rum runner because, 
as we learned then, one cannot prohibit by law certain things. There 
are certain laws that cannot be enforced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8741"> 8741 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation that I am advocating here does not prohibit the 
sale or the purchase of cigarettes. That would not work. I wish 
it would and I wish it could, but it does not.
<P>
	What does work, however, is chipping away at the idea of young 
people that smoking is somehow a good thing. I go back to the 
words I used in my original speech, that it is cool, sophisticated and 
grown-up. The hon. member knows, I know and all of us in this 
House know that what smoking leads to ultimately is lung cancer or 
emphysema or asthma or heart disease, all of these terrible things 
that we want our children to avoid as much as possible.
<P>
	Consequently, we are not going into the area of restricting rights. 
People still have the right to go, if I may use the word, to hell in 
their own direction and in their own way. They can walk into any 
store if they are of age in the relevant province and buy cigarettes. I 
wish they would not and I wish they could not but I know, as the 
hon. member knows, we cannot prevent that by legislation.
<P>
	However, we can and we have a duty and an absolute 
responsibility to do whatever we can not to make it look as if it is 
either benign or a good thing that people should smoke.
<P>
	Most particularly in this debate, when we tie cigarette 
advertising to one of the most glorious manifestations of our joint 
culture and society, that of the performing arts, it absolutely 
inflames my heart that we have to do this, that we have to have this 
kind of a debate. It is wrong that we let a product that hurts people 
and that can hurt our children be one that puts us into a debate on 
the future of our magnificent artistic endeavours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my speaking time with the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	First of all, I want to say that as a member of the Bloc Quebecois, 
this is my proudest moment in the past three or four years. Last 
time, in 1993, we campaigned under the slogan: ``On se donne le 
vrai pouvoir''. I remember the taunts of our opponents across the 
way who said: ``Listen the real power is the government, not the 
opposition''.
<P>
	Yesterday we clearly saw how that power could be exercised at 
the expense of Quebec. Yesterday, the power of Liberals was a 
sorry sight. It was pitiful how Liberal members from Quebec who 
tried to get out of a tight spot, extend moratoriums and find money 
elsewhere, were finally crushed under the weight of their caucus. If 
that is the real power of the Liberals, we can do without, and the 
people of Quebec, I am sure, will re-elect those who defend their 
interests.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I am fed up with the sentimental rhetoric dished up by members 
opposite who tell us: ``Listen to these people who can no longer 
bend over to pick up their grandchildren without falling down, 
because they smoked too much''.
<P>
	At second reading, we agreed with the health objectives of the 
bill, but now at third reading, when we look at the way 
sponsorships have been cut, $60 million in Canada, which includes 
$30 million in Quebec, there is a major problem. There is no 
compensation.
<P>
	We heard the Minister of Health say that perhaps the banks could 
take up the slack. His colleague at Heritage Canada told us there 
was no way the government could take over the tobacco 
companies' sponsorships because it would cost far too much.
<P>
	So the government is getting no for an answer everywhere. The 
only way was to leave the sponsorships as they are now. There are 
statistics. The government brandishes its statistics, and we have 
ours. As the Leader of the Opposition explained yesterday, when 
young people go to watch the Tennis Canada championships in 
Montreal, the Players open, will they say on the way home: ``I am 
going to buy a carton of Players?'' They are more likely to say they 
wished they were able to play tennis at that level.
<P>
	It has not been clearly proven to my satisfaction that advertising 
automatically creates a need to smoke and automatically induces 
young people to smoke. I have not seen that happen so far.
<P>
	I also want to condemn the procedure for getting this bill through 
the House. We were pushed to adopt this bill very quickly. The 
government took a very cavalier attitude, which will prevent us 
from having a debate on the substance of the bill, and even if we 
have a chance to do so this afternoon, we would have needed far 
more time to consider how to deal with the health issues and at the 
same time protect sponsorships. But the government is dead set on 
having its way. There will be a political price to pay for the 
government, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	What sets Quebec apart is its series of festivals. It is something 
we see everywhere in Quebec, especially in the Montreal area, the 
French speaking capital of America, where there are many 
festivals, and their impact is considerable.
<P>
	The elimination of sponsorship hits the festivals broadside. I will 
give you a few figures: the Just for Laughs festival, $1 million or 
10 per cent of its budget; the Montreal and Trois-Rivières Grand 
Prix and the Montreal film festival, $1.5 million or 16 per cent; the 
Montreal jazz festival, $1 million or 71.4 per cent; the Benson and 
Hedges International, the fireworks festival that lights up Montreal 
once a year; the Players tennis open, half a million dollars or 11 per 
cent; and the Quebec City summer festival.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8742"> 8742 </A></B>
<P>
	It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that all the 
festivals will be hit hard. They are being threatened by the bill 
before us.
<P>
	<I>La Presse</I> mentioned a survey taken on September 6 that 
revealed that 81 per cent of young people would not take up 
smoking just because they realized an event had been sponsored. 
Young people are going to start smoking for all sorts of reasons, but 
certainly not because of sponsorship. It is a matter of education. 
Rather than take this approach and set up anti-smoking campaigns, 
the government has gone on a witch hunt. And, as I said before, the 
festivals in Quebec and in the greater Montreal area will bear the 
brunt.
<P>
	Sixty-eight per cent of these people opposed the prohibition of 
sponsorships, because they could see quite simply that this was not 
the way to resolve the problem of smoking among young people, or 
adults, for that matter.
<P>
	I would like to bring a new argument to the debate: the impact on 
other festivals. In my region, in the riding of Saint-Jean, we have 
the Haut-Richelieu hot air balloon festival, the most beautiful of 
the balloon festivals in Quebec and Canada. My colleague says 
there are others. There is one in the Outaouais as well, but 
unfortunately, it lacks the prestige and grandeur of the Festival de 
montgolfières du Haut-Richelieu. The festival receives $1.5 
million in sponsorship. I might perhaps give you some figures 
before I present my argument.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The number of people going to the hot air balloon festival has 
substantially risen since its beginning. Attendance was 130,000 in 
1993, 160,000 in 1994, 190,000 in 1995, and 250,000 in 1996. Just 
as the festival is becoming big enough to attract this type of 
sponsorship, this bill is pulling the rug out from underneath it. The 
bill says that, from now on, sponsorships will not be allowed, 
therefore the festival will never be able to get that kind of 
sponsorship.
<P>
	Worse than that. This bill will affect not only the hot air balloon 
festival, but all the other, smaller festivals in Quebec. With $30 
million less in sponsorships in Quebec, major festivals are going to 
turn to the sponsors of smaller festivals, such as the hot air balloon 
festival in the Haut-Richelieu region, which generates $8 million in 
economic benefits. This bill has an adverse impact on 
sponsorships.
<P>
	This bill is not about health. Personally, I think it is true that in 
Canada smoking kills many people, the young and the not so 
young. However, the government should not go as far as 
prohibiting sponsorships. This threatens not only the major 
festivals that I mentioned earlier, but also the one in my region.
<P>
	With economic spinoffs of $8 million and a sponsorship of $1.5 
million for the festival in my riding, we cannot afford to be told, in 
two years from now:  ``We were thinking of sponsoring your event, 
but the World Film Festival approached us and we will have to 
transfer our sponsorship''. Sponsors always choose the most 
prestigious events, and this is understandable.
<P>
	The big festivals are not the only ones to be affected. I invite the 
minister, the Prime Minister and all of my colleagues to the hot air 
balloon festival. I would be very pleased if the Minister of Health 
did come next summer. Not only will I promise him a ride in a hot 
air balloon, but we will certainly have a welcoming committee 
explain to him why the bill is unacceptable and how it is a threat to 
festivals that are the pride of the regions.
<P>
	My colleague from Trois-Rivières showed me a message from 
one of his constituents who is extremely proud of the festival there. 
She could see that the Trois-Rivières Grand Prix was in jeopardy.
<P>
	It is the same thing everywhere. In Saint-Jean, we are worried. 
We ask the minister to back down. If he does not, I hope he will 
come to Saint-Jean this summer. We will give him an interesting 
welcome. We will send him up in a hot air balloon and hope that he 
never comes down.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the 
member opposite and other members of the official opposition.
<P>
	The member said he is tired of listening to the demagoguery of 
the government members who support Bill C-71. He contends that 
there is no link between sponsorship promotion and tobacco 
consumption. It is his party's only argument to justify its position 
on Bill C-71.
<P>
	How does the member opposite respond the mounds of studies 
and information, the substantial evidence that establishes that there 
is in fact a link between sponsorship promotion and the 
consumption of tobacco?
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute of Canada stated: ``There is 
substantial evidence that young people are aware of and respond to 
cigarette advertising. Advertisements present images that appeal to 
the young and are seen and remembered by them. Images are used 
in tobacco marketing rather than information to portray the 
attractiveness of the function of smoking. The human models and 
cartoon like characters used in advertising convey independence 
and strong self-concepts, helpfulness, social acceptance, adventure 
seeking, attractive role models and youth activities, thus appealing 
to youth and tapping into area relevant to important development 
tasks''.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	What about the information that we receive from the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration that says: ``Evidence from social, 
psychological and marketing  research shows image based 
advertising such as employed by the cigarette and smokeless 
tobacco industry is particularly effective with young people and 
that the information 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8743"> 8743 </A></B>
<P>
conveyed by imagery is likely to be more significant to young 
people than information conveyed by other means in advertising''.
<P>
	The American Psychological Association provided expert 
opinion with specific citation to numerous studies to show that 
tobacco advertising plays directly to the factors that are central to 
children and adolescence and thus plays an important role in their 
decision to use tobacco. How does the hon. member refute this 
evidence?
<P>
	I would be glad for the hon. member's perusal to table this 
evidence that I am speaking of. The World Health Organization-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the member inadvertently put some papers 
on his desk and he is going to take them off.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was just indicating that I would like 
to table these documents and I was getting them ready for the page.
<P>
	The World Health Organization states: ``The tobacco industry 
uses the sponsoring of sports and entertainment to complement 
and/or replace other marketing activities to reach large audiences 
and to associate their products with positive images'', maybe like 
balloons-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. I know that he wants to 
get into it but I am going to give the other member a chance to 
answer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to 
answer. I was wondering if I had enough time left to do so.
<P>
	Look, this is not the Canada Cancer Foundation. I, for one, am 
interested in finding out how people start smoking. In my case, it 
happened in my backyard. Somebody who was already a smoker 
came and asked me if I wanted to try. I said yes. There was no 
psychological trigger, as the North American psychologists 
association would say. It was not because I saw this brand of 
cigarettes during the Player's International Tennis Championships 
or the hot air balloon festival. It had nothing to do with that. We did 
not care what brand it was. I was not coerced into smoking by 
tobacco sponsorship.
<P>
	I thank God that I choked on the first puff and never tried again. 
This has nothing to do with seeing one brand or another on a 
billboard. As a matter of fact, some studies prove the reverse of 
what my colleague said and indicate that it may influence smokers 
to switch brands.
<P>
	Those who start smoking have quite a choice of brands: Player's, 
Du Maurier, Benson &amp; Hedges. Does this mean that young people 
who go and see fireworks will smoke Benson &amp; Hedges, and those 
who watch  tennis will smoke Player's? That is not the way it 
works. I beg to differ with my colleague and think that the 
government has gone too far in banning sponsorship. For us it is a 
health issue, but is also a sponsorship issue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague, the member for Saint-Jean, is generous enough to share 
his 20 minutes with me.
<P>
	What I feel like saying about this provision on sponsorships is 
that the government missed its mark. We agree, the Bloc has 
always agreed with the purpose, the principle of the bill which is 
aimed at curbing tobacco use. But as regards these provisions on 
sponsorships, it seems there is no correlation between them and the 
stated purpose of the bill or the arguments offered.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Especially since Montreal's cultural and sports events are 
directly affected, the city having already been dealt a serious blow 
at the social and economic level as a result of the policies 
implemented by this government since it came into office. I would 
be remiss if I did not review them with you. Montrealers are angry 
because this is like the last straw. This measure would have a 
devastating impact on Montreal, not only economically but also 
culturally and socially.
<P>
	Here is the list. As a result of this government's drastic cuts to 
unemployment insurance in its very first budget, Montreal was hit 
with $290 million in cuts in 1995. With the new employment 
insurance scheme, Montreal will lose another $125 million this 
year. Benefits will be reduced by $415 million in the Montreal area 
alone, and by more than $800 million for all of Quebec.
<P>
	Who is affected by Bill C-29 aimed at banning the additive 
MMT in gasoline? The Montreal refineries. Who will be affected 
by the ports' user fees? All the ports on the St. Lawrence River, 
which will have to pay more than other ports on the Atlantic and 
the west coast for ice-breaking and dredging. Montreal will be 
particularly hard hit.
<P>
	There are as many poor people in Montreal as there are in all the 
Atlantic provinces combined. Where is our Hibernia project, in 
which the federal government invested over $2 billion? Where is 
our bridge to the mainland, our Confederation bridge, built at a cost 
of $800 million for the 130,000 residents of Prince Edward Island?
<P>
	Did the federal government build the proposed fast train link 
between Dorval and Mirabel? No. That was too much money for 
Montreal.
<P>
	Given this situation, the government, which has been in power 
since 1993, comes up, on the eve of the Grand Prix, with provisions 
that put it in jeopardy. You have seen the outcry from the people 
involved when that decision was made in Ottawa, in this House, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8744"> 8744 </A></B>
<P>
where the  Prime Minister shed a tear for the young Quebecers who 
smoke more and earlier.
<P>
	Does he know that there is a strong link between poverty and 
smoking and does he realize that his government is contributing to 
the impoverishment of Montreal and Quebec? Will the bill ban 
clips by their favourite performers if they are smokers? No. Does it 
prohibit models? And it could not do so anyway. We know that 
Montreal and Quebec, as well as regions with a high 
unemployment rate, are those that bore the brunt of the deficit 
reduction, whether through employment insurance cuts or the 
Canadian social transfer.
<P>
	There is a relationship between poverty and smoking. This is 
true for young people and also for people in other age groups. Yes, 
Montreal is poor. And it is humiliating to have to come here, to 
Ottawa, to plead or to be angry with a government that does not 
care about the plight of people in Montreal, which has an 
unemployment rate of 15 per cent. Montreal is one of the poorest 
major cities in Canada and, when the governments stopped funding 
these cultural and sporting events, we managed to get some 
sponsorships and to keep alive and vibrant. Now these are being cut 
under the pretext that young people will start smoking.
<P>
	I do not want young people to start smoking, but I do not want 
them to be used as a pretext for a policy that says it is aimed at 
protecting health, but that, in fact, is an attack on the economy of 
Montreal and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I repeat, it is humiliating to have a decision imposed on us, as the 
president of the Montreal chamber of commerce said, without any 
consideration of its immediate impact. The government cannot say 
that it does not see the economic impact this will have on Montreal.
<P>
	If the government had been concerned with not creating such an 
impact on the economy, it would have tried to find some solutions. 
All the suggestions that were made by the official opposition have 
been rejected, swept aside and abandoned. No one will convince 
me that the desired effect is not to harm the economy of Montreal. 
No one will be able to convince me of that. There is no urgent need 
for these harmful provisions.
<P>
	Young people do not start smoking because of advertising, but 
because of peer pressure.
<P>
	Sponsorships are being targeted, singled out. The leader of the 
official opposition asked a very simple question, which is worth 
repeating. He said: ``What will a young person coming back from a 
tennis tournament ask his parents for: a tennis racket or a pack of 
cigarettes?'' He will ask for a tennis racket and, on top of that, he 
will be aware of the fact that, if he wants to be any good at a sport 
that requires so much speed, he had better not smoke. Young people 
are aware of that.
<P>
	We feel the joke is on us, a joke of monumental proportions, 
which is not funny at all, because health is no joking matter. We do 
agree with the health related principles, but not with the means. We 
are being forced to choose between what would be a health related 
objective and events that help young people get by in a context 
where jobs are scarce, cultural events that attract tourists and 
promote a degree of economic development without which 
Montreal would do ever more poorly than it is doing.
<P>
	Montreal is not doing as well as it should. It used to be the 
metropolis of Canada, it is the metropolis of Quebec, but it has 
suffered terribly from this unresolved issue between Quebec and 
Canada. No metropolis can develop properly without a State with 
full powers behind it. Montreal does not have this State with full 
powers behind it and both Montreal and Quebec as a whole are 
badly off because of it.
<P>
	This bill is a hit and miss bill. What is hits is Montreal and 
cultural and sporting events in Quebec, and it hits them hard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians would want to ask the member if she really believes 
what she says. Does she really believe that advertising does not 
have any influence whatsoever on the decision of anyone to use a 
product? Why would the tobacco companies spend $60 million a 
year?
<P>
	She also said that children smoke because other kids smoke. 
That is a total copout. It is basically saying that is the way it is and 
that is the way it is always going to be so let us not do anything 
about. She offers no solutions. She asks why the bill attacks the 
economy of Montreal. If she is concerned about the economy, and I 
think she should be, she should be concerned about the 40,000 
Canadians who will not be part of the economy next year because 
they will have died as a result of tobacco. They will not have those 
jobs. They will not be productive contributors to society for the rest 
of their lives. That is the part of the economy the member has not 
recognized as important. The jobs are no good to children when 
they are dead.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I have a very simple question for the member. If she cannot 
answer a simple question there is no point in posing others.
<P>
	Just for Laughs is one Montreal festivals that has said: ``Isn't this 
awful? If we lose our sponsorship we will be gone and all the jobs 
will be gone''. The Montreal Just for Laughs comedy festival 
receives 10 per cent of its revenue from tobacco. Will the member 
tell the House today if she honestly believes that Just for Laughs 
will totally disappear from the face of the earth if the 10 per cent 
from tobacco is not included in sponsorships?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said that I agreed with the 
objective to fight tobacco use. This fight should, first and foremost, 
include prevention, and it does.
<P>
	However, what does this government, which is supposed to be 
concerned about these 40,000 deaths, propose? A measly $10 
million, while the Canada Information Office and others are getting 
about $67 million per year. If this government really cared about 
Montreal's economic situation, it would have found ways to make 
up for this loss.
<P>
	Needless to say, I care about the health aspect, but I also react to 
demagoguery and to the fact that young people who are poor smoke 
more than others. It is not a matter of choosing between poverty 
and health.
<P>
	We have to find a successful approach, and such an approach 
must be based on prevention. Montreal must continue to hold its 
events. To say that this bill is necessary to avoid 40,000 deaths is 
simply ridiculous. A solution, a real solution must be found. Until 
then, I will keep thinking that the goal pursued is really to hurt 
Montreal and the Province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the hon. member for Mercier for her very eloquent 
and sensitive testimony on the harmful effects of this legislation on 
Montreal's economy.
<P>
	Do I really have only one minute left?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> More like 17 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> I will rise again later, because there is 
something interesting I am eager to tell you. Again, I congratulate 
the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know what the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières wants to tell us. It concerns a letter from one of his 
constituents, who worked for the Trois-Rivières festival. That 
person is a non-smoker, but she fully supports our position, 
because, as she puts it: ``The festival provides me with a job and I 
do not understand why the Liberal government is going after this''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	Throughout the debate on Bill C-71 we have heard compelling 
evidence about the dangers of smoking. Tobacco use puts the lives 
of millions of Canadians at risk every day. Canadians are 
increasingly aware of the dangers of tobacco use. Consensus has 
been building for some time on the need for strong, well 
co-ordinated action to meet this public health challenge head on.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The announcement by the Minister of Health of a comprehensive 
federal strategy to help protect Canadians from the harmful effects 
of tobacco is a step to be applauded and supported by all members 
of the House.
<P>
	Bill C-71 is an indispensable tool for regulating tobacco 
advertising and promotion and ultimately for reducing tobacco 
consumption.
<P>
	We must recognize that the legislation has as its ultimate goal 
public health. It is our responsibility as members of Parliament to 
ensure that it receives quick passage through the House.
<P>
	This debate has given us a clear picture of the devastating effects 
of tobacco use on the current generation of Canadian smokers. Just 
as alarming, however, is the potential devastation awaiting a whole 
new generation of young Canadians who are taking up smoking at 
an alarming rate.
<P>
	I will read a letter I recently received from a grade 5-6 class at L. 
E. Shaw School in Avonport in my riding of Annapolis 
Valley-Hants. The teacher wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The grade 5-6 students are very concerned about the effects of smoking on our 
bodies and the environment. We have also looked at the advertising and the 
influence it has on people, especially young people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In their letter they urge me not to support any measures that 
loosen the restrictions on advertising tobacco products.
<P>
	As a parliamentarian I have a responsibility to protect their 
rights and their health. I am pleased to report that the measures 
included in the bill are an appropriate response to the health threat 
that smoking poses for the young people of Canada.
<P>
	Let us begin with what we know about youth and smoking. One 
in three Canadians smoke. Half of them will ultimately die 
prematurely of tobacco related diseases. In my own family I have 
certainly seen this devastation. Youth are the most tragic casualties 
of tobacco use and addiction. Youth are the most vulnerable to 
tobacco promotion.
<P>
	That is why the government's priority in developing the 
legislation and the overall strategy has been young people. I think 
we can all agree that young people are certainly the future of the 
country. We must invest in them by protecting them and by 
ensuring the safest and healthiest environment for their growth and 
development.
<P>
	The statistics, however, show that we have our work cut out for 
us. Twenty-nine per cent of 15 to 19 year olds and 14 per cent of 10 
to 14 year olds are current smokers. Smoking among teens 15 to 19 
years of age has increased 25 per cent since 1991. According to the 
1994 youth smoking survey, 260,000 kids between the ages of 10 
and 19 years were beginner smokers that year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8746"> 8746 </A></B>
<P>
	Figures like these are being replicated in all other countries. 
These statistics have promoted the World Health Organization to 
classify youth smoking as a global pediatric epidemic.
<P>
	What is striking about the evidence on youth smoking is the 
knowledge among youth about the effects of tobacco use. More 
than 90 per cent of people between the ages of 10 and 19 believe 
that tobacco is addictive. A similar percentage believe tobacco 
smoke in the environment can be harmful to the health of people 
who do not smoke. I certainly I can attest to that. Despite being 
clearly aware of the hazards over a quarter of the young people still 
smoke.
<P>
	Research indicates a strong association between the smoking 
habits of youth and the number of friends who smoke. The most 
common reason cited for starting to smoke is the influence of 
friends or peer pressure. Eighty-five per cent of all smokers 
surveyed say they began smoking before they were 16 years of age. 
A critical time for the smoking decision process appears to be 
between the ages of 12 and 14. It is no surprise the tobacco 
companies know this statistic. They need new customers to replace 
the legions of those who are dying every year from smoking.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Currently the tobacco industry has a voluntary code that 
prohibits advertising to young people or using advertising with 
young people pictured in it. However the industry has breached this 
code time and time again.
<P>
	The tobacco industry says it does not advertising to encourage 
youth to take up smoking. It claims it is only to encourage older, 
established smokers to switch their brands. Young people like those 
in our gallery are sophisticated enough to understand the point of 
tobacco company marketing tools.
<P>
	Some 85 per cent of young smokers and 83 per cent to 
non-smokers agree that advertising for events sponsored by 
tobacco companies is a means to directly advertise cigarette 
brands. I am sure the group of young people in our gallery would 
agree with those statements.
<P>
	Despite the claims of the tobacco industry it is clear people in 
young age smoking groups are more likely to start smoking and to 
switch brands than older people. Otherwise, why would the tobacco 
companies support events that are so popular with young people, 
from sporting events to popular music festivals, to entertainment 
events? Young people tell us that the use of brand names in tobacco 
sponsored events acts as an advertisement for tobacco products and 
smoking as well as for the specific event.
<P>
	Bill C-71 will respond to the realities and to the tobacco 
industry's indirect focus on youth. Bill C-71 will restrict the 
association of tobacco brand names with sponsored events while 
still allowing tobacco companies to sponsor whatever events they 
please. The legislation  will also control the extent to which young 
people are exposed to tobacco advertisements and promotions by 
banning broadcast, billboard, bus panel ads, and counter top 
displays in stores. In addition, it prohibits the use of tobacco brand 
names or logos on non-tobacco products that are youth oriented or 
have lifestyle connotations such as baseball caps and knapsacks.
<P>
	The legislation will also reduce youth access by banning vending 
machines and mail out sales and by requiring photo identification 
to confirm minimum age.
<P>
	These measures and others in the bill are designed to protect the 
health of Canadians, particularly young Canadians. Collectively 
they form a balanced and reasonable piece of legislation that 
addresses the broad range of factors which contribute to a young 
person's decision to smoke.
<P>
	Since the bill was introduced the Minister of Health has 
consistently reiterated that he would listen to the views expressed 
in consultation on the bill. The minister has subsequently tabled a 
series of amendments that demonstrates our government is giving 
serious consideration to what all parties have to say on this 
complex issue.
<P>
	The proposed amendments are straightforward and fall into three 
categories. Six of the proposals are technical amendments. They 
simply bring greater precision to some of the terms used in Bill 
C-71. Four amendments respond to requests by representatives of 
the tobacco industry that the government clarify its intentions. We 
have done so in the interests of providing greater certainty to 
affected parties.
<P>
	The final amendment responds to the requests made by the arts, 
cultural and sports community and groups. Some groups expressed 
concern over what might happen if subclauses 24(2) and (3) took 
effective immediately upon proclamation. These subclauses 
restrict the display of tobacco related brand elements and the 
placement of permanent materials.
<P>
	The government recognizes that many sponsored events bring 
important economic benefits to communities. We have therefore 
agreed to a one-year or two summers implementation period for 
this portion of the bill only to give affected groups more time to 
adjust their promotional strategies.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	We have introduced these reasonable amendments in a way that 
will not compromise the integrity of the bill or the government's 
health objectives. As I said earlier, this bill is about protecting the 
health of Canadians, particularly young Canadians.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to be able to rise during the question and comment 
period following the speech made  by the hon. member for 
Annapolis Valley-Hants, who stressed the so-called pernicious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8747"> 8747 </A></B>
<P>
effects of sponsorship on our youth and on their decision to take up 
smoking.
<P>
	I just received this morning a very nice letter from a resident of 
my riding who is 18 years old, whom I have never met, whom I do 
not know and who took the time to e-mail me a letter at 8.45 this 
morning.
<P>
	Let me read you the letter sent to me by Lisa-Marie Dupont from 
Trois-Rivières: 
<P>
``Mr. Rocheleau, 
<P>
	I saw the position you have taken on the issue of tobacco 
company sponsorship and I had to tell you that I support it. I am an 
18-year-old woman who has lived all her life in Trois-Rivières, 
which hosts the annual Player's Grand Prix, and I have never 
smoked a cigarette in my whole life. Moreover, I have volunteered 
to work in the press room these last two years, an experience which 
will be very useful when I have to find a good job. It is nonsense to 
think health depends on sponsorship; the decision to take up 
smoking or not, especially among the young, is more a matter of 
education and guidance.
<P>
	For a city like Trois-Rivières, this kind of event is very 
important. Tourism picks up considerably, the whole city comes 
alive with pride and hundreds of volunteers enthusiastically give a 
helping hand to make this event successful.
<P>
	Such events give national and international visibility to cities. Is 
that not a sure advantage in this era of market globalization?
<P>
	Please do not succumb to the pressures and keep defending your 
point of view. It is very important to our region.
<P>
	Signed, Lisa-Marie Dupont''.
<P>
	There is one sentence that I would like to read again for my 
colleague: ``It is nonsense to think health depends on sponsorship; 
the decision to take up smoking or not, especially among the 
young, is more a matter of education and guidance''. This is quite a 
change from the shortsightedness, the partisanship and the kind of 
intolerance shown by government members and also by the health 
workers lobby-because it is indeed a lobby. I think such a 
testimony reflects good faith, intelligence, wisdom, balance and 
common sense.
<P>
	Common sense is exactly what is lacking in this bill, 80 per cent 
of which we agree with. The members opposite seem to forget that. 
What we are opposed to are the sponsorship provisions in this bill, 
which will have a devastating effect on economic development.
<P>
	If smoking kills-and I would like my colleague to comment on 
this-can the lack of jobs, as has been demonstrated, have the same 
effect? Is it possible that someone who is unemployed will have a 
tendency to smoke more, which will also contribute to killing him 
or her? So the public interest will not be served by these  
shortsighted policies that create more problems than they solve. I 
would like my colleague to comment on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. First, let me applaud the young person who did not start 
smoking.
<P>
	If members remember my speech, we are talking about a health 
issue here, not one of economics and not one of one-letter lines that 
indicate one individual.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	I put this to my hon. colleague. Why would the tobacco 
companies spend all these millions on fancy logos for tobacco 
advertising if they were not trying to entice people to smoke? 
These people are doing a good service in the sense that they will 
still be promoting, but, believe me, they are not doing this out of 
the goodness of their hearts. They are doing it mainly because they 
want to draw young people into the web because others who are 
dying are leaving the web due to tobacco related diseases.
<P>
	His argument is not compelling. As a matter of fact it only 
applauds that one individual who decided to stop smoking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill on behalf of my 
constituents. I realize that the bill contains many contentious 
issues, but its over-arching principle relates to the fact that people 
are dying in Canada as a direct result of tobacco consumption.
<P>
	There are lots of ugly statistics related to tobacco consumption. 
The 1991 figures indicate that 41,000 Canadians died of tobacco 
related diseases. In Ontario over 12,000 deaths per year are 
attributed to tobacco. It is projected that over half of today's 
smokers will die of a tobacco related disease.
<P>
	It has been said that tobacco is the only product legally available 
on the market which is lethal when used as the manufacturer 
intends it to be used. The statistic that half of people smoking today 
will die from it produces a 50 per cent kill ratio. We do not use 
them much any more, but there are weapons of war that have a 
lower kill impact than 50 per cent. This kind of toxicity rates right 
up there with weapons of war, perhaps with cyanide, perhaps with 
the depletion of the ozone layer, perhaps with bullets. These are all 
things that society has to regulate for the general well-being of its 
citizens.
<P>
	Principally the bill does four things. It will further limit youth 
access to tobacco. It will restrict the promotion of tobacco products 
to youth. It will increase the health information on packages related 
to tobacco consumption. Finally, it will establish powers to further 
regulate the sale and consumption of tobacco products.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8748"> 8748 </A></B>
<P>
	Much of that regulatory activity already exists in legislation. 
However, the bill will improve or refine existing legislation.
<P>
	A lot of discussion has taken place about the impact of this 
legislation on public events which are sponsored by tobacco 
companies. These events are sponsored as part of the advertising 
campaigns of the tobacco companies. As someone said earlier, why 
would tobacco companies spend $66 million a year on advertising 
if there was not a benefit? They advertise because it enhances the 
profitability of their enterprises.
<P>
	With respect to the impact on public events which are currently 
sponsored by tobacco advertisers, it is not just an Ontario issue, it 
is not just a Quebec issue, it is not just a Toronto issue or a 
Vancouver issue. I am disappointed that the tobacco companies and 
the lobbyists are wrapping themselves in the flag of Quebec. I do 
not think it is helpful to us in the House. I do not think it is useful 
for Canadians to see an issue that way.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I accept that a large amount of money is spent in the city of 
Montreal on these events. As a representative of my area, I have 
been shown the large amount of money spent in the Toronto area on 
these events. People do come from all over the place to see and to 
participate in the events. We have heard the names: the Benson &amp; 
Hedges Symphony of Fire, the du Maurier Jazz Festival.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Good advertising for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> I am not afraid. I am going to speak to that later. I am 
not embarrassed to mention the name of a tobacco company. I am 
not even afraid to hold a cigarette in my hand. I do not smoke. We 
have to be careful that we do not demonize in our society. We do 
not want to demonize things the way we did with firearms. Good 
people have firearms. Good people smoke and let us recognize that.
<P>
	There happens to be a jazz festival in Toronto. There happens to 
be jazz festivals in Montreal and in Vancouver and a tobacco 
company happens to sponsor part of the costs. It is a good thing that 
the jazz festival happens. I want to see those events continue. The 
government recognizes that there could be a difficult period of 
adjustment. It has allowed two summers of adjustment. Technical 
provisions in the bill may further complicate the adjustment. 
Perhaps the minister's regulatory authority will be able to smooth 
that over.
<P>
	As an MP I will be working with others in my community to 
make sure these events can continue without the high level of 
tobacco advertising support that they currently have. That does not 
mean that there cannot be any tobacco advertising support, but 
under this bill a lot of that support will be reduced.
<P>
	We have two seasons to work on this. I hope we will have some 
success. I commend the tobacco companies to  the route that says 
get creative, work within the law and advertise their product to the 
extent that it is legal. I exhort them to stay away from our youth, 
but I do not have any problems with attending a festival that 
happens to have a tobacco company sponsor.
<P>
	I found it disappointing to hear references in the media over the 
last couple of days about the impending cancellation this weekend 
involving an Australian auto racing event. It is almost unbelievable 
to think that an advertising agency would consider doing this.
<P>
	This bill has not even left the House yet, let alone to get into the 
other place. It is not even law yet and someone is saying we are 
going to have to punish the people of Canada for considering this. 
We are going to punish the people who are fans of driver 
Villeneuve. We are going to victimize Canadians because they are 
considering this legislation.
<P>
	I was very disappointed by that. Shame on those who conceived 
of this as a way of influencing us. Hopefully the event will still be 
publicized and the fans of Jacques Villeneuve will get to see him.
<P>
	I want to comment on the insertion in the bill of a provision that 
allows the House to review regulations put in place by the minister. 
This is the first bill that I recall in some time that has such a 
provision. I want to commend the member for 
Lambton-Middlesex for her drafting and moving of this 
provision. It is a concurrence provision that may be the precursor 
of others which we may wish to make use of in the House of 
Commons, given the extremely high volume of delegated 
regulatory authority not just in this bill but in many other bills. 
Once we delegate that authority rarely do members see the 
regulations again. This amendment will allow the regulations 
created under this bill to come before the House for our approval.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> You had better give credit where credit is due.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> I am giving credit to all members who participated in 
this initiative.
<P>
	Having been goaded by some members earlier, I raised that fact 
that I was little uncomfortable with the atmosphere that demonizes 
people who smoke. I know we are not trying to do so, but in an 
effort to spin up the politics and get the bill passed we can say 
smoking is bad for our health. In fact it is lethal. We must recognize 
that there are many good people out there who are addicted. We 
must look for soft landings for people who are addicted.
<P>
	I close by saying that tobacco is now seen as an enemy of the 
people. It has taken us 400 years since Sir Walter Raleigh to get 
that far. Let us realize what it is. Let us recognize other countries 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8749"> 8749 </A></B>
<P>
such as France and the United  States care about the health of their 
citizens and are doing the same. I am prepared to support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by reminding my colleague of what he just 
said, about being disappointed, about being shocked, about the 
media being used to underline the impact of the bill on events and 
economic activities, about how people are going around attracting 
attention.
<P>
	The actions of his own colleague, the Minister of Health, have 
been raised in the House, and this is in the hands of the Speaker. 
Even before the bill has been passed, the minister has filled pages 
in the newspapers with his references to the ``act'', not the ``bill'' 
but the ``act''. He is referring to Bill C-71 as though it were already 
enacted. What is shocking is not so much that people are attracting 
attention, but that a minister is using the word ``act'' when the bill 
has not even been passed here in Parliament. That is what is 
shocking, not the other way around.
<P>
	I would like to remind members that not only did the official 
opposition vote in favour of the principle of the bill at second 
reading, but that it worked in committee and presented no fewer 
than 32 amendments in order to take a proactive stance in the fight 
against smoking. What did the government do? It rejected our 
amendments. It did not see the worth of our proactive amendments 
to combat smoking, did not think they could be useful to it. Why? 
Because it rejects everything out of hand. This government is 
intransigent and rejects the contribution of others out of hand.
<P>
	The other extremely important point is that we tried to draw this 
government's attention to the direct consequences of $30 million in 
economic spinoffs for events, not in order to distract it from the 
fight against smoking, and to get it to see that in many countries 
provision has been made for transition. It is possible to negotiate, 
to allow transitional measures.
<P>
	Australia did and France is preparing to relax its bill to make an 
exception for major events. Austria is doing likewise. In Hungary, 
an exception is made for major events. In Belgium, a bill has just 
been introduced that makes an exception for sports and related 
events. This government has demonstrated its intransigence in this 
regard and it is here that we would like to see the government take a 
more responsible attitude.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises the issue of 
transition as an important part of legislation which requires 
adjustment. That is a very good point. It is a very good point. We 
need transition for our tobacco farmers and there is something 
happening now for them in terms of transition.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	On the advertising issue, the hon. member will recognize that the 
bill has a two-summer delay before implementation to allow for
<P>
adjustment on some of the advertising prohibitions. I know the 
frustration of an opposition member when the government does not 
seem to move. I sat over there for a long five years. Sometimes we 
win and sometimes we do not.
<P>
	I am delighted to know the official opposition endorses the bill 
in principle. It is up to the official opposition whether or not it gets 
hung up on all the details. The principle is very much there and I 
am pleased to see the opposition endorses it and hopefully will vote 
for the bill at third reading.

C-71, the Liberal government's proposed tobacco act. My 
constituents and I have discussed the bill at length. We have talked 
about it at town hall meetings and I have had a great deal of 
correspondence on the issue. People called with their views when 
the Liberals introduced the bill. I also conducted a poll in my 
riding.
<P>
	The poll confirmed that a statistically significant majority of 
respondents do not believe that tax increases will cause people not 
to smoke. Most important, 70 per  cent of the respondents who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8750"> 8750 </A></B>
<P>
were less than 18 years of age said that taxes were not a deterrent to 
smoking.
<P>
	When I recently visited the Keremeos Secondary School we 
discussed the bill. We held a classroom poll. The students agreed 
that they would not be deterred from smoking because of the 
contents of the bill. They felt that negative impacts of the bill 
would cause more harm than good.
<P>
	The students listed the problems they predicted if the bill were 
passed. They felt the black market in cigarettes would be 
encouraged and incidents of theft would increase. They were 
concerned there would be a rise in youth crime as a result of the 
bill.
<P>
	I have received a great deal of telephone calls and letters by mail 
and fax from businesses in my riding concerning the bill. These 
retailers are already doing everything in their power to prevent the 
sale of tobacco products to young people. The following retailers 
are furious the measures in the bill target them directly: Lai Wah 
Lok, owner of Courtesy Corner in Lower Nicola; Adam Eneas, 
owner of the Snow Mountain Market in Penticton; Denis 
Bissonette, owner of the Osoyoos Duty Free Shop; and Dennis 
VanRaes of the Super Save Gas Bar in Penticton.
<P>
	All of them wrote to me outraged about the bill. They spelled out 
the hardships their retail outlets would experience as a direct result 
of Bill C-71. They are furious with the Liberals. They have told me 
about the construction costs they will have to pay to modify their 
retail outlets to satisfy the tobacco display requirements of the bill. 
Their businesses will suffer once Bill C-71 becomes law. Their 
businesses will be left with virtually a clandestine method for 
selling tobacco products.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals should be creating and developing a climate that 
encourages growth for small and medium sized firms. Instead, the 
Liberal approach is to penalize entrepreneurs with red tape, 
restrictions and bureaucracy.
<P>
	Bill C-71 is creating a special police force responsible for 
patrolling small businesses to ensure they are not in contravention 
of the bill. This is unbelievable in Canada, not to mention that it is 
very costly.
<P>
	With Bill C-71 we see that the Liberal solution to a problem is to 
impose restricting regulations, laws and tax increases. The bill will 
not solve the problem. The Liberals have let us down again.
<P>
	The real answer to the problem of young people smoking is 
education. My constituents and I want to see the government 
educate our youth with respect to the effects of smoking.
<P>
	Children are not stupid even though the Liberals think they are. I 
have talked to many young people, students and very young 
children in every corner of my riding.  They are all very eager to 
learn. It can be seen in their faces. The Liberals should throw away 
the bill and all the things in it and focus their efforts on talking 
directly to children.
<P>
	The bill makes it clear the Liberals have totally disregarded the 
option of spending federal government time, effort and resources 
on delivering an anti-smoking message directly to the young 
people of Canada.
<P>
	My constituents do not want the federal government to be given 
more power and control over our lives. We do not want the 
government to interfere further into our lives.
<P>
	Therefore the Liberals are not deterring smoking with the bill. 
They are making older Canadians pay more for a substance to 
which they have become addicted, tobacco, which has been legal 
all their lives. It is not fair to tax senior citizens who began 
smoking decades ago and cannot quit.
<P>
	The bill should not seek to punish smokers. It should seek to help 
prevent people who do not smoke, especially young Canadians, 
from smoking.
<P>
	The bill imposes a de facto ban on tobacco company 
sponsorships but the Liberal health minister says that is okay. He 
talks about the high profitability the banking industry is enjoying 
and that it should be sponsoring events the Liberals are preventing 
the tobacco companies from sponsoring.
<P>
	Is the minister making a threat? Are the banks the next industry 
to be punished by the Liberals in their attempt to address the 
problem of smoking? How much of a punishment tax will the 
Liberals make the banks pay to finance the sporting and cultural 
events that have been stripped of funding by the same Liberals?
<P>
	Who else will the Liberals tax to pay for these events? Will it be 
other financial institutions? Maybe communications firms or 
telephone companies. I predict the Liberals will pick a prosperous 
industry, one that provides jobs for Canadians. Then they will 
proceed to kill those jobs. They will assault that industry with a tax 
grab and force it to pay for lost funding of cultural and sporting 
events. The Liberal solution to every problem is tax, tax, tax, which 
kills jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	The bill imposes a de facto ban on tobacco product advertising. 
In my previous career I sold advertising. The bill makes clear that 
the Liberals have made a serious error in their understanding of 
how advertising works. They have seriously overstated the 
influence of advertising on the Canadian public.
<P>
	The Liberals believe we can lead a horse to water and make it 
drink. The bill and its emphasis on advertising is an insult to the 
intelligence of Canadians.
<P>
	I do not smoke. I have never smoked. I am not influenced by 
tobacco advertising. When I was young I was not influenced by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8751"> 8751 </A></B>
<P>
tobacco ads. Nor was I influenced  by one of my parents, three of 
my siblings and most of my peers who smoked.
<P>
	Who are the people the Liberals think are affected and 
influenced by tobacco advertising? The young people to whom I 
have spoken do not feel that they are influenced by tobacco ads 
either. Products are sold through advertising efforts that are aimed 
at the people who use the product. Companies pursue a market 
share. They are chasing a piece of the pie and that pie consists only 
of people who smoke. Tobacco advertising is focused on the people 
who smoke.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Tobacco companies are concerned about increasing the sale of 
their brand by securing a larger percentage of the market. Their 
advertising effort is not aimed at non-smokers. Such campaigns do 
not work. There is no getting people to smoke. The results from 
that kind of effort are not worth the cost of such a campaign. From 
a sales and advertising campaign perspective, teenagers are not the 
target, smokers are the target.
<P>
	For example, if you are selling Cadillacs, you are going to starve 
if your strategy is to sell a Cadillac to a person that drives a 
compact car. Your advertising should be directed at the consumer 
in the luxury car market. A Cadillac can be sold to a person that 
drives a Lincoln.
<P>
	The Liberals think that Canadians are stupid. This bill is so 
typical of virtually all the legislation the Liberals have proposed 
and passed during the course of this Parliament. The Liberals 
support big government supported by big taxes and their policies 
have resulted in high unemployment. This bill continues the legacy 
of Liberal mismanagement.
<P>
	Products that assist Canadians to quit smoking are becoming 
very popular. Devices such as the patch and other therapies 
designed to help smokers quit is a boom industry. What did the 
Liberals do to help Canadians quit smoking? They raised taxes on 
smokers and promise to raise them even higher and higher in the 
future. What a pathetic effort.
<P>
	My constituents and I are amazed at the parallels that can be 
drawn between this legislation and the Liberal's Canada pension 
plan contribution changes announced last month. The Liberal's 
proposed Tobacco Act is not the solution to the problem and it will 
punish Canadians who do not deserve to be punished.
<P>
	In the case of the Canada pension plan the Liberals are punishing 
young Canadians because successive Liberal and Tory 
governments have mismanaged the Canada pension plan. Young 
Canadians have to pay through the nose because of the largest 
payroll tax grab in Canadian history. The Liberals promised 
Canadians jobs, jobs, job. Their proposed Tobacco Act will kill 
thousands of jobs as soon as its blade slashes through corner stores, 
cafeterias, truck stops and gas bars across the country.
<P>
	My constituents and I believe that young people are not going to 
be prevented from starting to smoke as a result of this bill and 
therefore I am very proud to stand on their behalf and vote against 
Bill C-71.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
really quite taken aback when the member started his speech and 
announced that he would explain why he is not going to support the 
tobacco bill, Bill C-71, after the vast majority of his colleagues 
have risen in their place and have spoken so eloquently on the 
fundamental health impacts of tobacco and the cost to our society, 
not only in dollar terms but also in terms of lives.
<P>
	The member said he went to kids and asked them whether or not 
they thought advertising affects them. He concluded from this 
interaction with these children that since they said it would not 
impact them that is it. The irony here is that the research that has 
been done over the last 25 years has concluded very clearly that if 
you do not start to smoke by age 19 then likely you will never be a 
smoker. Everybody in the tobacco industry, as well as the health 
industry, knows that very well. This member knows that the 
tobacco companies spend about $66 million a year on advertising. 
He knows they do things like putting out slim packages of 
cigarettes and calling them slims to attract young women. We 
heard the statistics about lung cancer being the biggest cause of 
deaths among women.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I do not have to explain to the member the impact that 
advertising has because the member was in advertising. That was 
his profession. How can he stand here and say that advertising has 
no impact? It cannot be both ways.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member to explain again to Canadians 
why he thinks that tobacco advertising has no impact on the 
preferences of children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question. I would like to address the first part of his comments 
when he said he was surprised that a member of the Reform Party 
would stand and speak against the thoughts that others in his party 
have voiced. That is the difference between this side of the House 
and the other side. Reformers are not afraid to stand in opposition. 
When we oppose something we can vote against the party if we so 
choose and support our constituents.
<P>
	I can understand why he is surprised and probably a little 
envious of the position that I have taken today because it one he 
cannot possibly take in the Liberal Party of Canada or this 
government.
<P>
	Yes, I have spent a considerable time in advertising and I can say 
that advertising is designed for those people who are in the market 
for a product. People will not buy something they do not want.
<P>
	In my example I made it quite clear that a person who sells 
Cadillacs cannot sell a Cadillac to someone who  drives a compact 
car. It would be a waste of money to attempt that. The advertising is 
targeted to the people who are in the market for luxury cars. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8752"> 8752 </A></B>
<P>
are after a market share. It is naive of this member to assume that 
any form of advertising can influence people to change their 
lifestyle or their attitude toward something.
<P>
	I will use the example of people in the auto supply business who 
are trying to sell anti-freeze in the middle of a hot summer. It 
cannot be done. It is a market share and there has to be a need for 
the product. The companies are trying to increase their market 
share among the ones that are competing for the business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill is teaching me a lot about life in 
general. In Canada we have guaranteed rights and freedoms-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I apologize to the member, but I have to 
read this before five o'clock. Would he permit me to do it and then 
we can go back and he will get an extra 20 seconds on his speech?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to the Standing Orders, to inform the 
House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka-small business.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in Canada 
we have guaranteed rights and freedoms except when it comes to 
any activity ending in i-n-g. Then we have governments that 
interfere in our every day lives in the name of a better good with 
new regulation and laws.
<P>
	Bill C-71 is an example of a much bigger issue than just tobacco 
and smoking and who and where it can be used. It is also about 
rights and responsibilities.
<P>
	Before I elaborate, let me state that because I agree with the 
intent and target of the bill to help care for, educate and protect 
one's minor children, a big responsibility of all levels of 
government, I will vote for and support the bill.
<P>
	It will restrict advertising in magazines with less than 15 per cent 
youth content. No advertising will be allowed on billboards and bus 
shelters, but it will be allowed in areas and places restricted to 
minors. Displays will be restricted in retail outlets and no vending 
machines will be allowed in public places.
<P>
	Finally, the one that bothers the tobacco industry and of course 
the Bloc members, is the limitation being placed on sponsorships 
where the space occupied by an ad cannot exceed 10 per cent of the 
surface area.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	These regulations will not stop young people from smoking. 
They will be a deterrent, but they are only a step in the right 
direction. What is needed is education.
<P>
	There should be funding for legitimate organizations, such as the 
Neighbourhood Tobacco Recovery Network, which is active across 
Canada. It reaches out to aboriginals. We must teach young females 
that smoking does not keep them thin. I believe that is why a lot of 
young females smoke. They believe it keeps them thin.
<P>
	I encourage the minister to start investing in schools, in groups, 
in hospitals and in other places where we can educate and give all 
concerned the proper facts from which to make an informed 
decision.
<P>
	That brings me to the bigger issue. I quote from a paper on civic 
responsibility in Canada which was prepared by the Library of 
Parliament on August 22, 1994. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Canada -individual rights are both entrenched in the Constitution and 
safeguarded in legislation at the federal, provincial and territorial levels. While it is 
generally accepted that with these rights come corresponding duties, individual 
responsibilities do not appear at the forefront of Canadian society to the same extent 
as individual rights. Moreover, it is not simply the protection and advancement of 
individual interests which form the basis of civic responsibility. There is also the 
broader type of public duty to advance the common interest or good. Responsibility 
from this perspective involves contributing to the construction, maintenance, 
transformation and improvement of the community as a whole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given that both rights and responsibilities are an essential condition for the 
normal functioning of any society, many people feel that more emphasis must now 
be placed on public responsibilities in order to recognize, preserve and strengthen 
Canada's social fabric.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the part I like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A balance must always be maintained between individual liberty, the liberty of 
other individuals and the reasonable demands of the community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Seeking this balance is what divides Canadians. Seeking this 
balance is what is pitting tobacco industry manufacturers, retailers, 
political parties and provinces against one another. It is a tough 
problem to solve. The bigger issue is encroachment into the area of 
rights and freedoms. However, sometimes we forget about 
responsibilities.
<P>
	I submit that while young people are definitely influenced to 
smoke through advertising and accessibility, this bill has not and 
cannot prevent the two biggest causes. I believe that my colleague 
from Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt who just spoke has 
underestimated the value of advertising. It has a huge influence on 
people. That is why companies and retailers spend billions of 
dollars on advertising. They do not just target the people who use 
their product, they target non-users to show them the kind of 
lifestyle they could live.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8753"> 8753 </A></B>
<P>
	Advertising is a big factor which the bill addresses. I support that 
measure. However, the two biggest reasons that cause young 
people to smoke, which the bill does  not and cannot address, but 
which I will mention because it pertains to the responsibilities of 
people in society, are the adults and parents who smoke. Kids see 
adults smoking everywhere. The adults tell their kids: ``You cannot 
smoke. Do not smoke. You are too young. It is not good for you''. 
However, when the children see adults doing it, what influence 
does that have? I do not know how to combat that, but it is there.
<P>
	The second reason young people smoke is peer pressure, to be in, 
to be accepted. Every generation goes through that. We all went 
through it when we were younger. We all rebelled against the older 
generation, to which I now belong. Young people like to rebel. I am 
50 years old and in the three or four generations I have been aware 
of smoking was one way to rebel. That will continue.
<P>
	However, we can combat that through education and better 
information on the effects of smoking and the higher degree of 
addiction for cigarettes versus alcohol. All those statistics are 
important. Maybe one good cure is to take an underage person out 
behind the barn somewhere and give him a cigar or make him 
smoke a half a pack and let him get green in the face. That will cure 
that person. According to one Bloc member if you have one 
cigarette you are addicted for life and you have to have another one 
after five minutes.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Those are some of the issues in terms of this bill that will not 
really be able to solve youth smoking. We know it is going to 
continue to exist. It is important to find that balance especially with 
something that is legal. Smoking is legal and we have to remember 
that. The government is trying to both huff and puff and suck and 
blow at the same time. When it is doing that it has to be very 
careful to balance all aspects of individual rights, corporate rights, 
citizen responsibilities, civic responsibilities and the cost to our 
society in terms of the health, opportunity and the loss of freedoms.
<P>
	This issue is also about money. There is a thriving and healthy 
industry called the tobacco industry. It generates huge profits and it 
also pays taxes. Governments collect these taxes and reinvest them.
<P>
	I had one constituent write to me on this issue and I said I would 
mention it the next time I spoke to this bill. The problem is that 
some of these things like smoking and drinking have an impact on 
those taxpayers who do not smoke and drink because it is their tax 
dollars that are going to subsidize those who are sick in hospitals, 
those we have to pay for because of the greater number of diseases 
that smoking and drinking cause over and above what we eat, 
because eating also causes diseases. As I said, everything that ends 
in i-n-g seems to have a problem with it.
<P>
	We do have a responsibility as politicians. I believe that this bill 
for the very reason that it targets a specific  area, youth smoking, 
has tried to balance and finish a job that a prior government did in 
terms of regulating something that is legal. It is better to make it 
legal, to monitor it and regulate it than to ban it. If smoking were 
banned, then obviously there would be a lot of underground activity 
in that area. We would have a lot more criminals in the streets and 
people committing crimes. We do not want to make criminals out 
of people who want to smoke.
<P>
	It is a tough act to debate. I am in favour of the targeting of better 
education for youth, making it less accessible for youth and so on. 
However, I in my heart of hearts as a businessman I do not like it. I 
feel very threatened by governments that try to tell me how I can 
market my product, how I can sell my product, when I can sell it, 
where I can sell it and how much advertising I can do. All these 
things that get to the other side of it bother me.
<P>
	On balance I feel that the government and the health minister 
have made a very commendable effort to resolve all the 
differences. Listening to the debate today I was almost scared. If it 
is that bad maybe we should be doing something more serious 
about it. I guess we will keep it legal. We will continue to monitor, 
regulate it and try to keep it out of the hands of those people who 
are the most easily influenced, who can become addicted the 
quickest and the longest, thereby shortening their lives.
<P>
	Therefore factoring in all these things, I submit that this is a bill 
that should be passed and certainly the majority of the Reform 
Party will be supporting this bill. I would like to congratulate our 
critic on this issue from Macleod who has listened to debate within 
our caucus very often and very reasonably. There were a lot of us 
who had different opinions and differing points of view. He 
certainly welcomed the debate and did a good job of bringing out 
all aspects of this complicated issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague for Calgary-Centre for his speech.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	He dealt in his own way with the major objection we have to this 
bill, although we agree with much of its substance, that is, the 
effect of the abolition of sponsorships on smoking, particularly 
among the young people.
<P>
	With the disappearance of sponsorships, there will be no 
sponsoring of sports and cultural events. Quebec receives $30 
million out of the $60 million spent for sponsorships. It will be 
greatly affected, and this will create unemployment. 
Unemployment is a source of problems. It has been demonstrated 
that when there are problems, smoking increases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8754"> 8754 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague a question about that. 
Following a study by Statistics Canada, we read this in the press, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Studies show that young people smoke first and foremost to imitate their friends. 
But this does not account for the fact that their consumption has increased in the last 
few years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to analyses, the fact that teenagers rebel against ``the system'' may 
have something to do with it. The data indicate that 53 per cent of the young people 
who drop out of high school smoke. Disheartened by the gloomy prospects for the 
future, they are all the more inclined to challenge the increasing prohibition on 
smoking.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When we see what the government has done on unemployment 
insurance, it is clear that these prospects are even more gloomy. As 
the people's sufferings increase, so does their smoking.
<P>
	Here is another quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have seen however that peer pressure or restrictions such as those imposed by 
governments do not encourage smokers to quit. Two times out of three, that is, in 66 
per cent of cases-health concerns prompt smokers to butt out.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does the hon. member believe in the equation that the 
government makes between the abolition of sponsorships and the 
reduction in the smoking?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would answer that question in this way. 
First, it has been quite clear, if one reads the bill, that sponsorship 
has not been banned or abolished. I wonder if the member 
understands what is in the bill. Sponsorship has not been abolished. 
The amount of space that can be put on a sign has been reduced. 
The fact that one cannot have the whole sign but only a bit of the 
sign does not mean that sponsorship is abolished. The tobacco 
companies can still sponsor these races and participate. Therefore, 
that issue has been somewhat misrepresented.
<P>
	The quickest way to get people to do something is to tell them 
they cannot do it. I do agree with the member on that issue. If we 
tell young people they cannot do something, their curiosity is 
perked and they will want to know why. They are curious and 
therefore will tend to try it. We can never stop that because it is 
human nature. However, the only way to combat that is to educate 
the children and make the product more unavailable and 
inaccessible to them until they are adults.
<P>
	We must tell those parents and anyone listening to me now that if 
you smoke and you have children, let your children know what is 
good or bad about smoking and do not let them smoke until they 
are of age. If the parents do that then they will have done their part. 
The children are then making an informed decision. We should 
have the right to chose the poison of your ilk because that is, after 
all, what we get if we are Canadians. We have individual rights and 
human rights. We are born with certain rights and we have the 
freedom of choice.
<P>
	However, we have to educate people that by choosing this way or 
that way, these are the consequences. I am sure that the minister 
will also spend some money in education. Just like Alcoholics 
Anonymous, there are tobacco recovery networks out there that 
will help those people who want to quit. It is an addictive, strong 
habit and those who want to quit cannot. We have to help those 
people as well. That is our job and the job of government.
<P>
	This is one example where I see that this bill is a much bigger 
issue than just tobacco. It is a balancing act. With respect to all the 
sponsorships to all the sporting events in Quebec-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Sorry to interrupt the hon. member. The 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak again on Bill C-71, for it seems to be that the 
debate has grown out of all proportion to the reality of the situation.
<P>
	It appears that, as a result of the regularization of tobacco 
advertising-and not a total ban-almost all cultural events and 
associations are going to disappear from Montreal. I must, 
therefore, point out a few things.
<P>
	First of all, the bill before us is the result of a Supreme Court of 
Canada judgment. Prior to that judgment, there was a total ban on 
tobacco company advertising, yet cultural and sporting events did 
exist in Montreal and elsewhere in the country.
<P>
	Second, let us look at the percentage of revenues coming from 
tobacco sponsors compared to the total revenues of the various 
cultural groups. Mr. Speaker, were you aware that tobacco 
sponsorships account for only 1 per cent of the total revenues of the 
National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal, 0.4 per cent of the 
revenues of Montreal's Grands Ballets canadiens, 0.8 per cent of 
the revenues of Centaur Theatre, 0.4 per cent of the revenues of the 
Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, and 0.3 per cent of the 
revenue of the Opéra de Montréal? I have a much more detailed list 
here, but those few examples are enough to lead me to my next 
point.
<P>
	The question that inevitably arises is this: why do tobacco 
companies contribute such minimal amounts to support cultural 
events of this calibre? Why? The answer is simple: because the 
people who go to these events are adults, not teenagers.
<P>
	I would like to explain how tobacco advertising during a cultural 
or sporting event can influence our young people, since the sports 
media, manipulated by the tobacco companies, give the impression 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8755"> 8755 </A></B>
<P>
that watching or  attending a sporting event has no impact on the 
consumption of tobacco.
<P>
	I would like to quote Francis Thompson, who said the following 
in the monthly magazine Info-Tabac:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To sell a product as repugnant as cigarettes, you have to invest massively in 
marketing. It is no coincidence that for more than 70 years, the tobacco industry, 
which is quite small, has invested more in advertising and promoting its product than 
any other industry, with the exception of the automobile industry. The marketing 
budgets of cigarette manufacturers are a long-term investment in what we could call 
``social seduction''. Remember that expression ``social seduction''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The primary objective of tobacco companies is not to sell a product outright as in 
the case of a car or another product but to influence the social or cultural image of 
the product, the shared perception of what it means to be a smoker.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One element has not changed: the vast majority of new customers are recruited 
among young people, because almost no one starts to smoke once they reach 
adulthood.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although manufacturers say they do not aim their advertising at non smoking 
teenagers, they nevertheless have to design their advertising so as to reach young 
adults. Obviously, ads aimed at 19-year olds may very well have an impact on 
16-year olds or 17-year olds.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most boys know perfectly well they will not become racing car drivers by 
smoking Rothmans; girls also realize that Matinée cigarettes will not make them look 
like Claudia Schiffer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Teenage girls also know they will never be as rich as Madonna, but that does not 
prevent millions of teenage girls from imitating her look. Adolescence is a time 
when we seek ways to create a new identity, symbols that we can flaunt, that show 
we belong to a certain group and set us apart from the world of our elders, our 
parents or our teachers who impose a list of don'ts which, paradoxically, are also part 
of the rites of passage.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is also peer pressure, not advertising, that leads a person to his 
first cigarette. So, what role does marketing play? It adds a little 
impetus to peer pressure.
<P>
	Over the years, a fairly extensive list has been compiled of the 
risk factors found often among adolescents who take up smoking.
<P>
	Among the most important are poverty, change in social status, 
the perception that smoking is what everybody does, identification 
with peers rather than family, lack of self esteem, failure in school, 
aggressiveness or shyness and, finally, difficulty in turning down a 
cigarette.
<P>
	Those just starting to smoke have no doubts about the dangers of 
smoking, because they almost universally think the risks do not 
apply to them, since they will not become addicted. You know, 
when you are an adolescent you are invincible. This brings me to 
the subject of marketing.
<P>
	As the industry can hardly affect poverty levels or promote 
failure in school, it focusses on making cigarettes the norm and on 
personal freedom. Tobacco is at times associated with, believe it or 
not, happiness, even  health, because the ads depict dynamic 
individuals, who appear to be in great shape, sociable and well off, 
often in settings involving sports.
<P>
	We must not forget that brand identities have been created. In an 
Ontario study done in 1992, anthropologist Grant McCracken

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP)</B> moved 
that Bill C-304, an act to amend the Criminal Code (aiding 
suicide), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, each year in Canada more than 190,000 
Canadians die. We know that some 40,000 Canadians die each year 
of tobacco related causes and I am very pleased that this House has 
just passed Bill C-71 which will have an impact on health, in 
particular young Canadians.
<P>
	Of those 190,000 Canadians who die each year, some die of heart 
disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, AIDS and other infections. 
They die of trauma, genetic illness or a host of degenerative 
diseases.
<P>
	Among those Canadians who die each year are a small number of 
Canadians who unfortunately and tragically suffer terribly. The 
purpose of the bill before the House today is to amend the 
provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada, specifically section 
241 of the Criminal Code, to allow individuals who are terminally 
or incurably ill, who are suffering terrible anguish, pain or 
indignity who cannot be assisted by palliative care, to seek the 
assistance of a doctor to end that pain and suffering.
<P>
	The last time I introduced this legislation was September 21, 
1994. Earlier that same year, on February 12, 1994, Sue Rodriguez 
died. Sue had fought a long and courageous battle, a long and 
courageous battle in Parliament through parliamentary commit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8757"> 8757 </A></B>
<P>
tees, in the  media, publicly through a variety of public fora and of 
course in the courts to change the criminal law.
<P>
	On September 30, 1993 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled 
against her petition. By the narrowest possible majority of five to 
four, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of 
section 241 of the Criminal Code of Canada. Before that the British 
Columbia Court of Appeal, again a deeply divided court with the 
chief justice of the court dissenting, upheld the constitutionality of 
that law.
<P>
	What every judge of the supreme court clearly argued, what each 
of the three judges of the B.C. Court of Appeal powerfully and 
eloquently stated, was that this issue, this complex, difficult and in 
some cases agonizing issue, is one which must ultimately be 
resolved by the Parliament of Canada, which must ultimately be 
decided by the elected representatives of the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	In the days following the death of Sue Rodriguez the Prime 
Minister of Canada and the Minister of Justice both promised in 
this House and elsewhere that there would be a free vote in the 
House of Commons, that each member of the House of Commons 
would wrestle with their conscience, would listen to the arguments 
of their constituents and others and would be allowed to vote on 
this change in a free vote.
<P>
	In my speech on this bill previously in September 1994, I 
reminded the government of that promise. I reminded the 
government of the commitment that was made, the solemn 
commitment of the Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister and of 
many other members of the government to allow this House to vote 
on that issue. I suggested that there might be a vote on that issue 
hopefully by June 1995.
<P>
	Here we are over two and a half years later, and after those 
promises were made what we see is once again betrayal, once again 
another broken Liberal promise.
<P>
	There is a very important and fundamental principle here. 
Canadians are entitled to assume that when a minister of the crown, 
when the first minister, the Prime Minister, promises that the 
House of Commons will be able to vote, surely they are entitled to 
believe that promise, to take the Prime Minister at his word, to take 
the Minister of Justice at his word.
<P>
	That has not happened. When I questioned the Minister of 
Justice last fall on this issue it was very clear that the House would 
not be allowed to vote in a free vote or any other vote on this issue 
in this Parliament. Shame on the government of Canada.
<P>
	I hear one of my colleagues from the Reform Party agreeing, the 
member for Elk Island. Whatever one's perspective on this issue, 
surely we as members of this House should be given an opportunity 
to voice that  perspective, to vote according to our conscience on 
this issue of how we live and how we die.
<P>
	What has happened in the meantime since the last debate in this 
House in September 1994? Too many terminally or incurably ill 
patients have suffered, in some cases terrible pain or anguish or 
indignity, or they have been sedated to the point of pharmaceutical 
oblivion, or in some cases they have chosen to take their own life 
prematurely because they did not want to face those terrible 
choices. In some cases they have been assisted, assisted by a loved 
one, by a family member or by a doctor to end their life in some 
cases in defiance of the criminal law.
<P>
	I recall the case of a gentleman from Windsor, Austin Bastable, 
who chose to leave his country. I say chose to leave his country. He 
felt he had no choice other than to leave his own country because he 
was not able to obtain the assistance he sought to end his suffering 
at the end of his life.
<P>
	Under the present provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada for 
an individual who is one of those individuals, and I believe it is a 
very small number, who is terminally or incurably ill, who has 
sought the assistance of a physician, who has sought palliative care, 
pain management, that individual for whom palliative care or 
proper pain management simply and unfortunately did not respond 
to their suffering, what are their choices?
<P>
	Yes, there are Canadians in that situation. Fortunately through 
good palliative care there are only a small number of Canadians 
who cannot be assisted. But even the Canadian Association of 
Palliative Care Physicians and others acknowledge that there are a 
small number who cannot be assisted by palliative care, who will 
suffer pain, anguish, profound indignity.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	Under the existing provisions of the Criminal Code, those 
people, in the final few months of their lives, face one of two 
choices. I remind this House that suffering in many cases is shared 
by their families and loved ones. Either they continue to suffer or 
be sedated into a state of complete stupor or pharmaceutical 
oblivion, as one of the witnesses to the Senate committee recently 
said.
<P>
	For some Canadians those choices are simply not acceptable. It 
is for that small number of Canadians that I believe another option 
should be made available. One of those Canadians was Sue 
Rodriguez. It is because I believe the other option, the other choice 
should be made available, with very strict safeguards to be sure, 
that I am presenting once again this private member's bill to amend 
section 241 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I believe it is profoundly unjust and inhuman to force people to 
make that choice between suffering and anguish on the one hand 
and complete stupor and sedation on the other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8758"> 8758 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been some developments both in the law and in 
Parliament since the last debate in this House. The Northern 
Territory legislature in Australia became the first jurisdiction in 
the world to legalize, again with strict safeguards, changes in the 
law to allow for choice in dying.
<P>
	Circuit courts of appeal in the United States, the second circuit, 
the ninth circuit, both ruled in favour of choice in dying.
<P>
	A special committee of the Senate studied this issue in great 
depth and came to the same conclusion on the issue of assisted 
suicide as the Supreme Court of Canada. Again, by the narrowest 
possible majority, four to three, the Senate committee 
recommended against a change to section 241 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	However, I think it is particularly significant to note that the 
dissenting senators were Senator Joan Neiman who chaired the 
committee, a very distinguished senator who no longer sits in that 
place, Senator Sharon Carstairs and Senator Wilbert Keon, one of 
the most distinguished heart surgeons in Canada, who in the end 
supported the change in law which my bill would seek to achieve.
<P>
	The committee members heard from many witnesses and made a 
number of profoundly important recommendations. Many of the 
recommendations I agree with. They recommended that 
governments make palliative care programs a top priority in the 
restructuring of the health care system. They recommended that the 
Criminal Code be amended to clarify the practice of providing 
treatment for the purpose of alleviating suffering that may shorten 
life. They recommended that the Criminal Code be amended and 
necessary legislation be enacted in order to explicitly recognize 
and clarify the circumstances in which the withholding and 
withdrawal of life sustaining treatment is legally acceptable. They 
recommended that provinces move ahead on advance directives.
<P>
	As I said, a minority, three of the seven senators, recommended 
changes to section 241 of the Criminal Code as well as voluntary 
euthanasia for competent individuals who are physically incapable 
of committing assisted suicide.
<P>
	Recently Senator Sharon Carstairs presented a bill in the other 
place, Bill S-13. I commend Senator Carstairs for her leadership on 
this issue. Her bill would provide that no health care provider who 
honours the wish of a competent person for the withholding and 
withdrawing of life sustaining treatment would be guilty of an 
offence under the Criminal Code.
<P>
	We are told by a number of people that is the existing law and yet 
Dr. Wilbert Keon, who seconded Senator Carstairs and who 
strongly supports her bill, has said that there remains great 
uncertainty in the law in this area. He said that many doctors are 
looking for more definition and more direction from society as to 
how the  subject should be addressed. He said that dying patients 
are suffering needlessly because their doctors do not want to 
provide adequate sedatives to reduce pain just in case the drugs 
themselves cause death and they find themselves facing criminal 
prosecution.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	We should listen to the very powerful plea of Dr. Keon and 
others to at least take this modest step. When the bill ultimately 
comes to the House of Commons I hope members will see fit to 
support that change.
<P>
	I am somewhat discouraged. If members of the government were 
not prepared to support a very straightforward proposal to 
effectively codify the existing law, it is clear to me the proposal to 
amend section 241 of the Criminal Code is still some way off in 
terms of support from the Government of Canada.
<P>
	The Liberal politicians in this case and others are way behind the 
public. I commend the leader of the Reform Party, the member for 
Calgary Southwest, who some time ago canvassed the opinion of 
his constituents. In his survey he found that 82 per cent of his 
constituents supported this change in the law. The leader of the 
Reform Party has said that he would vote in respect of the 
recommendations of his constituents on the issue.
<P>
	The fundamental issue is one of personal autonomy, the right of 
a competent adult to make this choice for himself or herself. There 
are a variety of models before the country. I do not have the time to 
outline them now.
<P>
	The Right to Die Society, for example, has put forward a 
proposal by Dr. Eike-Henner Kluge that warrants serious 
examination. Dr. Stanley Rosenbaum on behalf of Choice in Dying 
and a number of people in Ottawa put forward another option. 
Dying with Dignity has yet another suggestion. There are a variety 
of proposals. There must be strict safeguards, but at the end of the 
day choice should be available.
<P>
	Many doctors believe the law should be changed. A study 
presented last September to the annual conference of the Royal 
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada by two Calgary 
doctors, Dr. Douglas Kinsella and Dr. Marja Varhoef, found that a 
significant majority of doctors supported a change in the law to 
facilitate and allow physician assisted suicide. That survey was 
very extensive.
<P>
	Dr. Marcel Boivert, a very respected palliative care physician at 
the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are playing ostrich if we do not believe that covert, active euthanasia is being 
practised right now. On Fridays, people who are near dying are having their doses of 
morphine increased by 50 per cent, 100 per cent or 150 per cent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Surely it is time to take this issue out of the shadows. It is time to 
listen to the doctors, other health care workers and social workers 
like Russel Ogden who pointed out  the extent to which this is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8759"> 8759 </A></B>
<P>
happening without any safeguards. It is sometimes horribly 
botched in the community of people who are dying of AIDS.
<P>
	Sooner or later our laws will change to end this cruelty. I hope it 
is sooner. It is clear we cannot rely on the courts. Perhaps it will 
take a brave doctor to challenge the law. I do not believe in the 
narrow circumstances that any jury would unanimously convict. 
We recall it was another doctor who challenged the law on abortion 
which ultimately led to the Supreme Court of Canada striking down 
the law.
<P>
	I urge Canadians who are concerned about the issue to ask 
candidates in the upcoming federal election where they stand on 
this important issue.
<P>
	In closing, I remind members of this House that in her final 
public words Sue Rodriguez said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I hope my efforts will not have been in vain and that the Minister of Justice will 
introduce legislation into Parliament soon so that terminally ill people will have 
another option available, thereby permitting physician assisted suicide for the 
terminally ill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I quoted those words in concluding my remarks in September 
1994. I wanted to quote those words again and leave the House with 
them. As I said at that time, I profoundly hope Parliament will 
respond to this plea.
<P>
	I have to ask how much longer we must wait before the law 
changes. How much longer must we wait before the House is 
allowed to vote on the issue? How many more people and families 
must suffer in some cases unspeakable pain, anguish and indignity 
before the law is finally changed?
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to comment on Bill C-304, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (aiding suicide), introduced in the House by the hon. member 
for Burnaby-Kingsway.
<P>
	Let me begin my remarks by recognizing that the hon. member 
has on a number of occasions attempted to bring the issue before 
members of the House for discussion and debate. Clearly it is a 
matter of particular concern to our colleague. I commend him for 
his efforts in trying to deal with what he perceives as weaknesses in 
the current provisions of our Criminal Code which deal with aiding 
suicide.
<P>
	Before I turn to the specific provisions contained in Bill C-304 I 
would like speak of the work undertaken in the Senate to examine 
this and relate issues. The matter of assisted suicide and a variety of 
subjects related to the end of life care and decision making such as 
palliative care, cessation and withdrawal of treatment and 
euthanasia were examined in great detail by members of the 
Special Senate Committee on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide. The 
special committee issued its report  on life and death following 
many months of hearings and deliberation.
<P>
	The Senate currently has before it Bill S-13, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (the protection of health care providers), which is 
now the subject of second reading debate. The purpose of the bill as 
stated by the hon. senator who sponsored the bill is to implement 
the unanimous recommendations and chapters 4 and 5 of the Senate 
report which deal with pain and pain control and the withholding of 
and withdrawal of life sustaining treatment.
<P>
	Senator Carstairs has taken great care to point out when 
discussing the subject matter and merit of the proposed amendment 
to the Criminal Code that it does not deal with either assisted 
suicide or euthanasia. Why is that? I suggest that it is because the 
members of the special Senate committee were not unanimous with 
respect to the matter of assisted suicide.
<P>
	After months of study and deliberation they were unable to agree 
that the Criminal Code should be amended to remove the 
prohibition against aiding suicide. I further suggest this lack of 
unanimity may well reflect the views of many Canadians with 
respect to the issue. There is great public interest in issues 
surrounding the end of life. These are issues which every one of us 
must face. We must bear in mind, however, that there are many 
perspectives from which to examine these issues, be they medical, 
legal, social or ethical.
<P>
	In addition, we must remember these issues are not confined 
solely to an analysis of assisted suicide or physician assisted 
suicide.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to provide a brief overview 
of the analysis of the particular provisions contained in the bill 
proposed by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway.
<P>
	Bill C-304 provides that no qualified medical practitioner 
commits an offence of counselling, aiding or abetting suicide or 
any other criminal code offence where the practitioner aids a 
terminally ill person to commit suicide at the request of and with 
the voluntary consent of that person, with the approval of at least 
one other qualified practitioner.
<P>
	Some may think at first glance that this provides concise and 
sufficient guidelines. I am of the view that if we were to agree at 
any time that such an amendment is required more work would be 
necessary to give Canadians the appropriate legal framework 
within which to reach this kind of decision.
<P>
	Save for the exception presented in the proposed subsection 
241(2), aiding suicide would remain an indictable offence with a 
maximum of 14 years imprisonment. The circumstances in which 
the protection would operate must be clear. I suggest that a number 
of clarifications would be required.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	First, the term terminally ill is not defined. There is no generally 
accepted medical definition for this term, only operative 
definitions, for example, for placement in palliative care. This 
would prove problematic.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Second, as set out in Bill C-304 the patient must provide 
voluntary consent without spelling out what constitutes voluntary 
consent. One potential difficulty is that there is no requirement that 
the patient be competent to consent. I suggest by way of example 
that persons suffering from depression may not be competent and 
may still provide voluntary consent.
<P>
	Third, there are no provisions in the bill regarding the situation 
of the incompetent patient. This was an issue raised during 
argument in the Rodriguez case before the Supreme Court of 
Canada, that is how the case of the incompetent patient would be 
dealt with if competent patients were permitted to request assisted 
suicide.
<P>
	Fourth, the bill does not deal specifically with children. Though 
the general language of the bill would include children, there are no 
provisions dealing with substituted consent in the bill. Are children 
who may be able to give valid consent to be permitted to request 
assisted suicide? If substituted consent is to be provided who may 
validly give that consent?
<P>
	Fifth, we are all aware that family and friends of patients are 
sometimes prevailed upon to assist the patient in dying. As written 
Bill C-304 would provide no protection even to the most 
sympathetic cases of this kind. It would provide protection only for 
those in the status of a physician. While it is not suggested that this 
is or is not the manner in which the House may decide to deal with 
the issue, it is important to ensure that when we do so we are 
cognizant of and discuss all situations where the need to address 
the question of assisted suicide may arise.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister has indicated this is a highly complex 
social and moral issue. Assisted suicide, euthanasia and cessation 
of treatment are difficult matters for all Canadians. The Senate 
committee after many months of consultation produced a very 
thoughtful report which must be considered by everyone concerned 
with these issues. They were unable to agree on how the matter of 
assisted suicide should be addressed.
<P>
	We have been assured by the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Justice that it is the intention of government to provide through 
Parliament at the appropriate time a forum for informed discussion 
to allow members to consider matters relating to the end of life 
decisions.
<P>
	Therefore, while I commend the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway for the steps he has taken to see that 
parliamentarians turn their minds to these issues, in my view it 
would be inappropriate for members of the House to deal with the 
amendments proposed in Bill C-304.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate on Bill 
C-304 introduced by our colleague, the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, and I have several reasons for that, the main 
one being that the debate stirred by our colleague is one that has 
been going on for years in our society. I am convinced-and I will 
get back to it later in my remarks-that a great many people wish 
the government would move on this.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway and commend his courage on this issue and 
others in the past, particularly what he did for Sue Rodriguez. 
Through his courageous actions, he keeps the debate alive and 
gives it credibility. This is much to his credit.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	As he pointed out, assisted suicide is a serious issue that 
deserves consideration. Again, this is a moral issue and, as such, it 
necessarily calls for a free vote in this House and, as hard as it may 
be to deal with psychologically and emotionally, it needs to be 
addressed and solutions need to be found.
<P>
	In debating bills in this House, it is often argued that, when a 
government at any level adopts legislation, there is already a broad 
public consensus on this issue. Governments always act after the 
fact, because governments are seldom proactive, and this issue is a 
perfect case in point.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Burnaby-Kingsway mentioned 
surveys, and several could be quoted here, all of which clearly 
show that the public is far ahead of politicians, and government 
members in particular, because, so far, they have not had the 
courage to fulfil their commitments in this respect. They are way 
behind because there is a broad public consensus that this issue 
should be addressed not only on a legal level but also on a human 
level.
<P>
	We all recall that, just a few years ago-I am sure it must have 
been the same in the rest of Canada as in Quebec-one would go 
out of his way to maintain anyone who was ill, especially the 
terminally ill, by any therapeutic means available, whether drugs or 
technology.
<P>
	The medical community, and particularly the public, protested 
against what was then called aggressive therapy. The expression 
became widely known. Eventually, a stop was put to this practice, 
except for rare isolated cases. Now, the medical community and the 
public at large recognize the need to respect the individual.
<P>
	This is a fundamental notion that comes into play when a person 
reaches the end of his life. I believe an individual has the legal 
right, but should also have the opportunity to die with dignity, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8761"> 8761 </A></B>
<P>
when faced with a disease  that leaves him no hope and nothing to 
do but wait for a lingering death.
<P>
	We can think of the physical and psychological pain of the 
person who is going to die, but let us not forget the psychological 
torment of the close ones. That pain too must be taken into account. 
This is why, in Quebec, the lawmakers introduced a legal provision 
with a very limited scope, whereby any individual can make what 
is called a living will. This means that the person can, in an official 
legal document, decide how he wants his life to end, should he find 
himself be in a situation where he is unable to make that decision, 
particularly if faced with an incurable disease that could unduly 
prolong his life in excruciating pain.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Although I do not have with me figures to support my 
contention, I know through my family and the people I meet, that 
an increasing number of people have a living will. In other words, 
more and more people not only hope, but demand to die with 
dignity.
<P>
	It is strange to have a debate on one's right to die with dignity, 
considering we usually make sure of this for our pets.
<P>
	Indeed, anyone who owns a sick cat or dog will immediately 
seek to put an end to its suffering. I am not saying that measures 
must be adopted blindly that would lead to decisions being taken 
lightly. I am saying that, when it comes down to it, it seems a bit 
odd-ridiculous even, I would say-for there to be a discussion of 
the need to die with dignity. This ought to be an automatically 
recognized right, which does not need to be proven.
<P>
	Our present system involves hypocrisy, as the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway has said. At the present time, the practice in 
Quebec-and in the rest of Canada, I understand-is to relieve the 
suffering of patients who are headed inexorably toward death by 
stepping up their medication, even if this hastens their end. This 
cannot, however, be done openly. Physicians or nurses who do so 
could be brought before the courts at any time, unless the Criminal 
Code were amended along the lines the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway wishes. Let us put an end, then, to this 
hypocrisy, given the public consensus on this.
<P>
	I will close on this point. A new term would also have to be 
adopted to replace ``assisted suicide''. It is true that, in reality, if 
someone asks to have his life shortened, this is a form of suicide, 
but I believe that presenting it in this way is putting it in a negative 
light, whereas all the person is asking is to die with dignity. 
Everyone ought to have that right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened to 
the speeches today and I must admit that the  arguments are 
seductive. I listened to the member for Burnaby-Kingsway say 
that very few people in Canada would require these mechanisms.
<P>
	I have up to date research from a country that has practised 
euthanasia and assisted suicide. This study from the Netherlands is 
brand new research which I received last week. This discussion has 
engaged the Netherlands for some 20 years. Although it is not 
legal, for about 10 years in the Netherlands there have been no 
sanctions against euthanasia and assisted suicide, if certain criteria 
are met. These are the criteria that the Netherlands required for 
euthanasia or doctor assisted suicide to take place.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	It must be voluntary. It must be a well informed, well considered 
request. There must be a persistent wish to die. There must be in 
the patient intolerable and hopeless suffering. The procedure 
requirements are such that another physician must be consulted so 
that not just one doctor is involved. Finally, a report of the case 
must be sent to the coroner's office. Those are the tight, nice strict 
criteria that doctors in the Netherlands must follow.
<P>
	What has happened in Holland? I am going to be selective in the 
information I give here. The information is quite vast. About 2,000 
people per year have been euthanized in the Netherlands following 
those criteria supposedly.
<P>
	In the survey of the family physicians in this study it was found 
that 9 per cent of those individuals had on one or more occasions 
deliberately terminated the life of a patient without the patient's 
explicit request. Let us round out the figure to 10 per cent. About 
200 people per year are euthanized in Holland, and I am being very 
specific, without the patient's consent.
<P>
	One of the first criteria for euthanasia was that it must be 
voluntary, then well informed, then well considered, then a 
persistent wish to die, intolerable and hopeless suffering. For 200 
people in Holland none of those things existed. A physician, by 
himself or herself, decided that the quality of life was no longer 
worth living. It is the only country in the world where there is this 
sort of experience.
<P>
	I believe that the criteria were well meant, were well discussed, 
were well laid out and failed. The colleagues of mine in the 
Netherlands who debated this, set down very strict criteria. They 
failed. They flopped.
<P>
	I am going to give two examples of how I think this path is the 
wrong path. The first one is from my own practice experience. I 
had a terminal cancer patient in hospital. She was suffering all the 
bad things at the end of life. She said to me in the evening: 
``Doctor, could you just give me something to end my suffering?'' I 
said to her: ``I anguish for you. I feel for you. My heart goes out to 
you. I think we might be able to find an alternative''. I talked to the 
nurses on the station telling  them my patient was really down. 
``We need to change her medication. We need to alter her 
treatment. Instead of giving her shots, we need to give her some 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8762"> 8762 </A></B>
<P>
intravenous medication''. We changed the palliation that I had been 
giving her. My palliation was not good enough.
<P>
	I got the nurses to stay with her. She needed some personal 
support that night. Then I phoned her family and said: ``Grandma is 
really, really tough tonight. Could anyone from the family please 
come and be with her. She needs some support''. Things did settle 
down. The medication worked better and she was no longer 
suffering so badly and I went home. When I went back the next day 
to the hospital I found her sitting up, playing chess with her 
nephew. This was a different woman over this span of time.
<P>
	The next day she said to me: ``Dr. Hill, thank you so much for 
not listening to me two nights ago''. From that I took it her plea to 
me was based more on depression and intolerable pain. The change 
I had made was a palliative change.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	I will give another example that is much worse. It is from the 
Dutch experience. A doctor I know had a compatriot with an 
85-year old patient with congestive heart failure, treatable only in a 
hospital and needing a shot of a medication called Lasix. She did 
not want to go to the hospital because, she said, they performed 
euthanasia on 85-year-olds in that place. The physician promised to 
look after her, so she agreed to go to the hospital.
<P>
	She received her shot of Lasix which makes the kidneys more 
effective. She voided all this extra fluid in her lungs and felt much 
better the next day. It was a Friday and her physician was off duty. 
He had left to do the normal things a doctor does on weekends.
<P>
	He returned on Monday to find that the covering physician 
whom he did not know well had needed a bed for a younger patient. 
He just went down the list and found the 85-year-old and 
determined that she was the least likely to live a worthwhile life. 
Members know the rest of the story. She was gone on Monday 
when he got there.
<P>
	He will never be able to face what he did. He had promised her 
that she would be fine. The best intentions, the best safeguards and 
the best ideals did not work for that 85-year old individual. It was 
the wrong way to go.
<P>
	I can quote my own constituents on the issue. I have polled them 
and it was fascinating. Thinking there would be a free vote on the 
issue I did a quick poll. I asked: ``What do you think of doctor 
assisted suicide?'' The poll came back with 55 per cent in 
agreement.
<P>
	When it became obvious I had more time and it would not be a 
sudden thing, I polled my constituents in a much more specific 
way. I laid out the options of palliative  care, the options that are 
available, and the switch in my constituents was dramatic. They no 
longer supported doctor assisted suicide when it was educationally 
explained to them.
<P>
	My stand was very plain to them on both surveys. I am against 
doctor assisted suicide from my personal experiences and my view 
from international experience. It is the wrong way to go and I do 
not support any move toward doctor assisted suicide. I will do 
everything in my power while I am in the House to move down the 
road toward palliative care, the road toward care for those who are 
dying rather than snuffing them out.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no further members rising, 
the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway is entitled to sum up the 
debate fairly briefly.
<P>
	He has indicated he does not wish to do so.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> As there are no more members wishing

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESS">SMALL BUSINESS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, further to my question to the Minister of Industry, I do not 
think there is anything quite as important or quite as critical for us 
as a government than our support of small business.
<P>
	It is absolutely essential that as a government nationally and as 
individual members of Parliament in our ridings we have a strategy 
to help the small business men and women who every day go out 
there and risk everything they have to create wealth and jobs in our 
ridings.
<P>
	I see a strategy for small business consisting of three 
components: access to information, access to capital and a 
streamlining of regulations as we talked about with the minister 
during the question.
<P>
	In terms of access to information, in my riding we have had the 
opportunity to host three economic development forums to give the 
business community the opportunity to explore new strategies, to 
see new opportunities and to pursue new initiatives.
<P>
	We have had an opportunity to have two access to capital 
seminars where we have had a chance to talk with our business 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8763"> 8763 </A></B>
<P>
community and our providers of financing  and to explore ways 
they could have better access to capital.
<P>
	I make a point to regularly communicate with my business 
constituents so that they know about the programs and initiatives 
we are undertaking as a government.
<P>
	A number of initiatives in terms of access to capital, both 
nationally and locally, in ridings like Parry Sound-Muskoka have 
been undertaken. First of all, through work that I was able to do on 
the industry committee and on the access to capital task force, we 
worked with the Canadian chartered banks to introduce five tools to 
help individual business people obtain capital.
<P>
	We have in rural Canada and particularly in Parry 
Sound-Muskoka the Community Futures Development 
Corporation. In my riding we have three branches of that 
corporation which are providing small businesses with loans up to 
$75,000.
<P>
	The Business Development Bank also operates in my riding. The 
government has raised the lending limit for the bank from $3 
billion to $15 billion. New tourism initiatives have just been added 
for the Business Development Bank. They have loaned millions of 
dollars to the small business men and women in the riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	We have also seen an increase in the small business loan limit, 
which went from $4 billion to $14 billion in the most recent budget.
<P>
	Of course in northern Ontario, in the Parry Sound portion of my 
riding, FedNor, the regional development agency, has seen its 
budget increase to $60 million.
<P>
	Finally, a third component of the strategy is streamlining 
regulations. The minister mentioned in the reply to the question 
that a 15 per cent decrease in regulations has taken place. The new 
hires program introduced by the government will provide a tax 
holiday on new hires for EI premiums. We have seen a move to 
quarterly remittances instead of monthly remittances. These are all 
attempts to streamline regulations.
<P>
	I urge the Minister of Industry to continue the government's 
initiative to support small business both across Canada and in my 
riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can assure the House that Statistics Canada is actively working 
with small business to choose the best time of year to complete 
survey information.
<P>
	For example, in the tourism sector, an area of concern for the 
hon. member, the traveller accommodation survey has been 
changed to a mail-out in March instead of the end of April, as was 
recent practice, to avoid burdening business during the start of their 
busy season.  The retail travel survey is always mailed out in 
January or February.
<P>
	Statistics Canada is firmly committed to reducing paper burden 
and has taken a number of specific initiatives. By using existing 
data collected by other departments, small businesses are receiving 
tens of thousands of fewer questionnaires. Many surveys use a 
simpler, shorter questionnaire for small business. Rather than 
survey all businesses, the smallest possible samples are used.
<P>
	These measures have enabled Statistics Canada to move in the 
last two years to reduce the burden it imposes on small business by 
over 15 per cent.
<P>
	As a further measure to assist small business, Statistics Canada 
has in the last month created the position of ombudsman 
responsible for response burden reduction. The ombudsman will 
review individual cases to assess how businesses can be helped 
most effectively.
<P>
	The government has been listening to the small business people 
from across Canada and their concern about the extent and number 
of requests for information they have been receiving. Because 
information burden is a government-wide issue, the President of 
the Treasury Board has established the joint forum on paper burden 
reduction. The is a unique partnership comprised of small business 
and federal government representatives and is a tangible measure 
of the government's commitment to breaking down barriers to 
small business growth.
<P>
	The seven departments represented include Industry Canada, 
Human Resources Development Canada, Revenue Canada, Public 
Works and Government Services Canada, Finance Canada, 
Statistics Canada and Treasury Board Secretariat-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at ten o'clock.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.39 p.m.)
