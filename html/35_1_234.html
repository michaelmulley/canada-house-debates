	The House resumed from September 28 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-98, an act respecting the oceans of Canada, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and on the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I join with those in support of 
Canada's oceans act this morning.
<P>
	Last November the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans released a 
document setting out the potential elements of an oceans 
management vision for Canada. The government sought the advice 
of all Canadians and the message was loud and clear: the federal 
government has a leadership role to play in oceans policy. 
Federally, ocean related responsibility has been fragmented and 
there is a need for focus in order to meet the needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	Several key oceans programs are being brought together under 
one department to promote synergy in operational policy 
development, to eliminate duplication and overlap and to provide a 
more efficient and effective service to Canadians.
<P>
	In recognition of these principles, the Canadian Coast Guard was 
merged with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans last April. 
This merger has already improved the government's ability to 
manage and protect Canada's oceans and marine resources and has 
strengthened its commitment to marine safety.
<P>
	This merger decision was not taken lightly. The decision to 
seriously consider a merger was made in mid-October of 1994. A 
study of the proposal was conducted by a joint program review 
initiative by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the 
Canadian Coast Guard, with input from the Department of the 
Environment, the machinery of government, the Privy  Council 
Office, the Treasury Board Secretariat and Natural Resources 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	The purpose of the study was to propose measures to strengthen 
the policy and program framework and policy delivery capacity for 
the administration of Canada's oceans.
<P>
	The goal was, first, to ensure the environmental protection and 
sustainable development of Canada's oceans resource; second, to 
provide essential marine safety services; third, to foster efficient 
and competitive commercial and other marine activities in Canada.
<P>
	The feasibility study was completed in November 1994 and it 
confirmed that a merger of the two organizations could result in a 
number of benefits at the policy and program level.
<P>
	One of those benefits was improved policy development and 
direction of the environment and response to the United Nation's 
Convention on the Law of the Sea. Another was increased 
effectiveness with respect to fisheries management, enforcement, 
marine safety, environmental response and one focal point for 
industry.
<P>
	With the merger, DFO has assumed responsibility for coast 
guard marine operations, including search and rescue, marine 
communications, vessel traffic services, aids to navigation, 
icebreaking and pollution response.
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard and the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans have many things in common. They have similar 
backgrounds and traditions. They have similar operations and 
marine policies and they both share similar views on improving 
ocean management.
<P>
	While becoming the principal marine of the new Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, the coast guard brings to the organization a 
reputation for distinguished service from coast to coast.
<P>
	Collaboration is not new to the government. The coast guard and 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans pull together as a strong 
team in responding to the Grand Banks fishing dispute on turbot. 
The coast guard played a valuable role in helping solve this dispute 
and one for which all Canadians are most grateful. Together the 
coast guard and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
demonstrated their commitment to preserve and protect  our 
fisheries

resources when others wanted to continue their destructive 
practices.
<P>
	This merger can serve only to enhance Canada's efforts in 
conserving and protecting fishermen, fish and our marine 
environment. Together they now have a combined fleet size of 148 
vessels, including 42 offshore vessels that will improve coverage in 
the area of search and rescue, as well as the ability to move more 
aggressively toward a tougher conservation regime through 
increased enforcement activities.
<P>
	This will allow the maintenance of the frontline enforcement 
presence while strengthening surveillance, fishing enforcement 
and environmental protection activities. The coast guard has a well 
earned reputation reflected in its motto: Safety First-Service 
Always.
<P>
	Both DFO and the coast guard are strong organizations with a 
common history of working in the marine environment and with 
shared goals and interests in ocean safety and environmental 
protection. Together they are building a stronger and more effective 
department.
<P>
	With the merger, Canada has the opportunity to become a world 
leader in oceans and marine resource management.
<P>
	To make our oceans vision a reality, we need to manage 
Canada's oceans and major waterways so that they are clean, safe, 
productive and accessible to ensure sustainable use of our fisheries 
resources and to facilitate marine trade and commerce. We need to 
build on our understanding of the oceans so that we can be more 
responsive to the changes and priorities.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	With this merger we will be better able to deliver marine safety 
services effectively and efficiently while maintaining high national 
standards. Issues such as boating safety and licensing, marine 
navigation infrastructure, safety systems and emerging 
technologies, levels of service as well as user fees and other cost 
recovery mechanisms must be addressed.
<P>
	As I pointed out, Canada's ability to manage and protect its 
oceans has improved with this merger. Amalgamation of the two 
fleets has increased offshore enforcement capabilities on both the 
east and west coasts. I am convinced this merger forms a very 
strong partnership that will streamline oceans management in 
Canada. I am delighted to speak in support of Bill C-98.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by pointing out that Bill C-98 
before the House today on second reading is a typical example of 
the kind of bill I like to discuss.
<P>
	Indeed, it will give me another chance to show Quebecers it 
would be both useless and dangerous to leave Quebec's 
development under federal control.
<P>
	Consider the endless jurisdictional squabbles that would be 
generated by the passage of this bill. My colleagues from 
Laurentides and the Gaspé have already discussed this but I feel I 
must say more on the subject, at a time when Quebecers are about 
to make an important decision on their collective destiny.
<P>
	The bill starts by identifying, in Canadian domestic law, 
Canada's jurisdiction over its ocean areas. To do so, however, the 
text merely incorporates provisions of the Canadian Laws Offshore 
Application Act and the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act. 
Since the legislation I just mentioned has not been amended in any 
way, this part of Bill C-98 is redundant. Especially since Canada's 
sovereignty over its ocean areas is recognized by the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, of which Canada is a 
signatory.
<P>
	Part II of this enactment is supposed to provide for the 
development and implementation of a national oceans management 
strategy based on the sustainable development and integrated 
management of oceans and coastal activities and resources. This is, 
in fact, one of the most ambitious attempts by the federal 
government to invade jurisdictions over which it has no authority 
and which it would be folly to cede to the federal government.
<P>
	According to officials from the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Part II of the bill could have been dropped, since it does 
not give the Department of Fisheries any new powers to manage a 
national oceans strategy. According to the preamble, the purpose of 
the bill is merely to encourage the minister to collaborate with his 
colleagues on identifying a strategy. Obviously, the minister cannot 
assume the authority to manage a strategy that has yet to be 
defined.
<P>
	In the light of the foregoing, I wondered why the government 
bothered to table a bill that apparently is no more than a series of 
good intentions.
<P>
	A closer look at the bill gave me the answer. First of all, the bill 
identifies two classes of intervenors in the process of implementing 
a national oceans strategy: the federal government and interested 
persons and bodies. In other words, provincial governments are 
considered on a par with any lobby group. This is one way of 
telling Canadian voters that ``if you voted for the right side, we will 
consider what your provincial government wants''.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	In the case of lobbyists, particularly major ones, this government 
tells them ``If you contribute to our slush fund-the slush fund of 
the right party-our government will lend a much more attentive 
ear to your concerns''. For examples of this we need only think of 
the role of the Liberal government in the case of Power DirecTv or 
the purchase of MCA by Seagram, the sale of Pearson airport, and 
most recently the privatization of  Petro-Canada. We have learned 
just this week that the sale of federal shares in the latter will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15031"> 15031 </A></B>
<P>
handled by Gordon Capital of Toronto, the Prime Minister's former 
employer. It will be remembered very clearly that, when it came 
time to vote on a private member's bill on public funding of 
political parties, the government opposed it in order to be good and 
sure to go on playing the little game of ``he who pays the piper 
picks the tune''.
<P>
	The parallel to be drawn between businesses contributing to the 
right party fund and voters supporting the right party is obvious, 
particularly since there is no obligation for the minister to follow 
any recommendations by the governments of Quebec and the other 
provinces.
<P>
	Similarly, sections 31, 32 and 33 of Bill C-98 empower the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans to develop and implement a 
national management strategy for estuarial, coastal and marine 
ecosystems. Such a strategy will require a number of elements to 
be created. First, activity management plans; second, 
administrative or consultative bodies; third, a number of programs; 
fourth, environmental standards; fifth, scientific data gathering and 
analysis on the ecosystems concerned.
<P>
	These are already functions of either Environment Canada or the 
provinces. We have seen that the minister is seeking through this 
act to encroach on the provinces' influence over the environment. 
Thus, the only useful purpose that we can see in this bill is to 
invade areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is also worthy of note that the bill before us, as I have already 
pointed out, will enable the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to 
encroach upon areas over which the Minister of the Environment 
has jurisdiction. Like my colleagues, I wondered why cabinet 
failed to see that and I concluded it was doubtless because, when 
the Minister of the Environment tries to invade Quebec's area of 
jurisdiction, she can be seen coming so far off in the distance that 
the job had to be given to someone else.
<P>
	The fact that the minister is not obliged to come to an agreement 
with the provinces, which have a keen interest in the management 
of the marine environment, is both incomprehensible and 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that the environment is not one of 
the areas of jurisdiction the constitution attributes explicitly to one 
level of government in particular. It is what they call an ancillary 
jurisdiction and is subordinate to those jurisdictions the 
constitution explicitly mentions.
<P>
	In theory, the Department of the Environment is responsible for 
the administration of this ancillary jurisdiction in co-operation with 
each of the departments concerned.
<P>
	Until the mid 1980s, the Government of Quebec, which has 
jurisdiction over local and territorial matters, played a leading role 
in environmental matters,  occupying the largest part of the field of 
jurisdiction. The federal government limited its involvement to 
areas relating to its jurisdiction, as the constitution provides.
<P>
	After 1985, the federal government began to meddle in 
environmental matters. It did so primarily by virtue of its spending 
power and the new powers the courts had accorded it. That was the 
beginning of many instances of duplication and overlap. They 
continue to exist and have grown more numerous since the election 
of the present Liberal government, which is trying to centralize 
decision-making in Ottawa. The Government of Quebec considers 
Bill C-98 another step toward centralization.
<P>
	In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada, which Mr. Lévesque 
likened to the tower of Pisa, always leaning the same way, took 
management of the marine environment and surrounding territory 
away from the provinces and gave it to the federal government in a 
decision of four justices to three.
<P>
	With Bill C-98, the federal government is trying to get the most 
out of this decision. Quebec fears that this centralizing tendency 
means the federal government will sooner or later claim 
management of the waters and the use of the tributaries to the 
coastal estuary and ultimately all fresh water rivers on the pretext 
that the contaminants in these waters are a source of degradation of 
the marine environment.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	There is currently a great deal of overlap and duplication in 
federal and provincial environmental regulations. As a result, 
private businesses very often have to spend time, money and 
energy on many things such as collecting information on the many 
government programs, providing the two levels of government 
with the required data, participating in the various advisory 
committees and subcommittees in charge of regulating the 
industry, preparing for the inspections carried out alternately by the 
federal government and the province, and complying with the 
requirements of both governments.
<P>
	In this regard, the toxic waste regulations are a convincing 
example. At this time, eight federal regulations overlap similar 
regulations that already exist in Quebec. Let us take, for example, 
the storage of PCB material regulations and the pulp and paper 
effluent regulations. Quebec sovereignty would effectively end this 
duplication.
<P>
	Although it must recognize that it can no longer afford to take 
environmental action, since cuts of 32 per cent over three years 
were announced in its last budget, the federal government 
continues to usurp the role of the provinces in setting national 
standards and priorities. The new Environmental Assessment Act 
that came into effect in January 1995, which encroaches directly on 
provincial jurisdiction, and the eco-government policy in which the 
federal government favours relations with  citizens and the private 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15032"> 15032 </A></B>
<P>
sector rather than with the provinces are striking examples of this 
kind of attitude.
<P>
	On the face of it, the federal government has noble objectives 
and respects these areas of jurisdiction but, in practice, it bypasses 
the provinces, forcing its agenda on them and effectively taking 
over provincial responsibilities.
<P>
	Bill C-98 adds fuel to the fire as the federal government, despite 
its financial situation, allows itself to create new structures to 
protect a particular ecosystem.
<P>
	Bill C-98 sends an ambiguous message. It seems to reflect a 
concern for marine ecosystems while at the same time taking away 
from the Department of the Environment part of its responsibilities 
and treating provincial environment ministries on the same basis as 
the industry or municipalities. Will Fisheries and Oceans withdraw 
just like Environment Canada? It is obvious that Environment 
Canada is becoming a policy generating department instead of 
taking real actions-the Irving Whale is a case in point-mainly 
for budget reasons.
<P>
	This leads to a number of problems. Here are the main ones. 
First, environmental concerns must clearly be identified by the 
grassroots. Policy coming from Ottawa is less likely to be suited to 
local circumstances, let alone be endorsed by the community. In 
fact, it has become increasingly clear that efficiency in terms of the 
environment is dependent upon a sense of ownership at the local 
level. For real progress to be made the people must be concerned 
about their rivers and marshes, their environment.
<P>
	Second, one of the federalists' arguments for centralizing 
environmental management is that pollution knows no boundaries, 
travelling from one province or state to another. Acid rain and river 
pollution are good examples of that.
<P>
	The federal government is apparently the only one who is able to 
legislate with efficiency and make international agreements, and to 
take a holistic approach in order to provide global solutions to 
global problems. Also, it is unthinkable that the minister not be 
required to work together with EC officials, as my hon. colleagues 
from Laurentides and Gaspé said earlier. Unsatisfied with creating 
jurisdiction conflicts with the provinces, the federal government 
has now set out to create jurisdiction conflicts between its own 
departments, all this in a context of fiscal restraint.
<P>
	Once again, we have before us a bill which, like many others 
before, is designed to centralize it all in Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have much respect for my friends from the Reform Party 
because they say what they think and they think what they say. 
They are the only ones actually to speak about decentralization. 
They are pretending to offer  decentralization for the good of all the 
provinces, including Quebec. I think that would be a good thing 
and I think they are really serious about it.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	However, in that offer somewhere is a catch 22 because my 
friends in the Reform Party will never form any government in 
Canada as long as Quebec is a province. Quebec holds the balance 
of power in the country as far as the vote is concerned and Quebec 
will never vote Reform. It is not because we hate Reformers; we 
love them very much. It is because our philosophies are too far 
apart. We just have to look at our positions on gun control, gay 
rights, bilingualism and on all of the bills which have been 
presented to the House. Most of the time we and the Reform Party 
have voted differently.
<P>
	My friends all know the country will soon hit the wall. They all 
know we are going bankrupt, as it was said in the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I> not so long ago.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The second richest country in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> We need a change and a fast one. My friends in 
the Reform Party should realize they should support the 
sovereignty of Quebec. I hope sincerely that somewhere down the 
road my Reform Party friends will finally see the light on their way 
to Damascus and find within themselves the courage to follow the 
logical path of their reasoning and bring it down to the right 
conclusion.
<P>
	Most Canadians have actually come to three assumptions about 
Quebec: first, we are a bunch of troublemakers, never happy with 
what we get; second, we receive much more money from Canada 
than what we give to Canada; third, the economic disaster in 
Canada is partly due to the political instability in Quebec. If those 
three assumptions are right, then the sovereignty of Quebec should 
normally be seen by all Canadians as a good way to solve the 
problem once and for all and make money out of it, providing of 
course that we assume our fair share of the Canadian debt.
<P>
	That is exactly what we intend to do through the negotiations 
which will start after the yes vote, although by all international 
rules and regulations Quebec has no legal obligation to take any 
part of the debt. Four studies were produced for the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission. Two were done in Canada, one in 
England and one in France. Those studies all came to that 
conclusion.
<P>
	In 1994 David Crane in the Toronto <I>Star</I> stated: ``Canada's 
foreign creditors would not want to transfer part of Canada's debt 
to Quebec. This is money they loaned to Canada, not Quebec''.
<P>
	That helps Quebec in a way. It means that Canada would have to 
reach an accommodation with Quebec since Canada cannot force 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15033"> 15033 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec to take its share of the  debt. The article continued: 
``Technically Quebec could walk away from its share of the debt''.
<P>
	In the <I>Gazette</I> on December 13 William Johnson said:``Ottawa 
would suddenly lose one-quarter of all its taxpayers, but would be 
responsible for the entire national debt, some $600 billion, nearly 
half of which is held by foreigners. Ottawa signed for the loans so 
only Ottawa is responsible before the creditors. Legally, Quebec 
would have no obligation to pay anything''.
<P>
	In spite of all this, we are offering to all Canadians that we will 
assume our fair share through negotiations. It is a shame the Prime 
Minister of Canada is refusing to negotiate. It jeopardizes Canada 
and Quebec at the same time.
<P>
	Canadians should have the right to run their country the way they 
want without having to please Quebec at each moment. The 
referendum which will be held quite soon in Quebec will have an 
answer: yes or no. If it is a yes vote, and I think it will be-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Because every Quebecer remembers full well what Mr. Bourassa 
himself said, that status quo would be the worse solution for 
Quebec, and what we are being offered is exactly that, the status 
quo.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
If it is a no vote what will happen? If it is a no vote we are back to 
square one. Fifteen years of constitutional debate to the next 
referendum. Nobody wants that.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I quote perhaps the greatest political analyst ever produced, 
Mr. Yogi Berra: ``It ain't over till it's over''. It will never be over 
with Quebec until we win because the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc 
Quebecois do not exist to support an idea. They exist because there 
is an idea to be supported.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-98, and I will conclude on this, demonstrates Ottawa's 
will to centralize, which permeates every bill. I would like to point 
out to my hon. colleagues that, in almost every committee we sit 
on, the Bloc Quebecois has had to produce minority reports each 
time Quebec's jurisdictions were at risk of being encroached on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before moving to questions and 
comments, let me say that I find it very regrettable for my 
constituents, many of whom are fishermen who work hard, to hear 
the opposition, and in particular a member representing an urban 
riding, say with such arrogance that the federal government is 
responsible for the problems in the fisheries sector.
<P>
	What I find even more regrettable is that the member probably 
never set foot on a fishing boat, does not know that sector, and did 
not bother to meet fishermen and see  for himself that these people 
are honest, hardworking people.
<P>
	I find that regrettable and I think it is an insult to the intelligence 
of fishermen and plant workers from the Gaspe Peninsula and the 
Magdalen Islands to say that the only way to solve the problems 
related to fisheries, including dwindling stocks, is to become 
sovereign. The opposition is exceedingly arrogant when it makes 
such comments.
<P>
	The fisheries sector must, to a large extent, rely on close 
co-operation with the provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward 
Island, Nova Scotia and, of course, Quebec. But I can tell you that 
the federal government is also involved. It is there to look after the 
real interests of fishermen by protecting the integrity of Canada's 
200-mile zone. What the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc are actually 
proposing is to close these 200 miles, this natural access, to Quebec 
fishermen, if that province becomes an independent country.
<P>
	I find it regrettable to hear opposition members tell us that we 
will reduce the fishing rights of Quebec fishermen by 60 per cent in 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean. The opposition 
did not even consider the ocean perch industry, for example, which 
will resume its activity some day, but our fishermen must fish that 
stock along the Nova Scotia and Atlantic shores. Unfortunately, the 
opposition does not take that into account.
<P>
	It is only concerned with sovereignty, with independence at any 
cost, and that is what I find regrettable. The opposition could not 
care less about the plight of my constituents. I invite opposition 
members, and particularly their leader, to come to the Magdalen 
Islands and to tell us that they are prepared to protect the real 
interests of Quebecers-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, before replying to the hon. 
member, I want to tell him that I was born in Val-d'Espoir, in the

clearly. You may not have heard it, but everyone on this side heard 
the member use the word ``traitor''.

invite the member to go back to the Gaspe Peninsula and withdraw 
his own comments.

seems to think he is the only person from the Gaspé in this House, 
withdrew what he said.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I was indeed born in the Gaspé, in Val-d'Espoir, and my family 
still lives there. I know all about the problems of the fishermen 
down there. I also spent my holidays in the Gaspé, on Chaleur Bay 
in the hon. member's riding, and I have seen for myself what the 
problems are.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the economic future of this country, 
Mr. Speaker. We want the sovereignty of Quebec for economic 
reasons. I remember when in 1980, at the time of the first 
referendum, Mr. Bourassa told us, and this will conclude my 
speech: ``If you say yes to the sovereignty of Quebec in 1980, you 
can expect a lot of debt, taxes and unemployment''. So people 
decided they should vote no. They did, and we remained a 
Canadian province. The federal debt rose from $80 billion to $600 
billion; the unemployment rate practically doubled; the number of 
welfare recipients doubled; our young people no longer have a 
future, and we are still in Canada.
<P>
	I think the hon. member should do his homework, visit his riding 
again and check with the people there, because in the Gaspé we are 
going to win.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there appears to be 
a warm wind blowing from this side of the House.
<P>
	I was interested in hearing the remarks of the member from the 
Bloc. He made some statements with which I do not agree and I 
have some questions for him.
<P>
	He suggested the Reform Party was honest in its approach. I 
agree with him that we are being direct and honest in our approach. 
He also suggested it is unfortunate that we are in a catch 22 
situation. While the people in Quebec can identify with the 
aspirations of the Reform Party because we represent the 
aspirations of people in other regions of Canada, the Bloc feels that 
we will never have the opportunity to form a government because 
philosophically we are miles apart.
<P>
	When the gun control legislation passed through the House we 
were approached by organizations in Quebec representing 1.2 
million law-abiding gun owners in Quebec who could not get 
representation in the House or at the committee meetings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask hon. members, especially 
those who were here during the previous Parliament-the people of 
Canada must think we are pretty silly. I would ask members to 
show some courtesy to their colleagues who have the floor, and the 
hon. member for Skeena has the floor at this time.
<P>
	The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize his microphone was 
not turned on, but since a few minutes ago, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine has been uttering threats at 
me. I would like him to withdraw what he said, as well as his 
invitations to step outside the House. After all, this is not a 
kindergarten. I would like him to withdraw what he said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Excuse me, Mr. Speaker, I never threatened a 
single member in this House, and I would invite the member to 
withdraw, because today I have heard nothing but personal insults 
from the opposition.
<P>
	I only invited the junior member of the opposition, who is my 
age, to talk about this in a civilized way outside the House, and I 
invite him to do so now.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I never uttered threats at anyone in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, this may be a matter of interpretation, 
but the gestures he made earlier along with his invitation to step 
outside, anywhere, anytime, were self-explanatory. In other words, 
the hon. member wanted to settle a matter in a way that is 
unacceptable in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In the circumstances, I will again 
recognize the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not a school yard. This is the 
House of Commons. And as I said, if the hon. member has anything 
to tell me personally, I would invite him to do so outside, that is all, 
to settle this matter once and for all.
<P>
	However, to say that we are threatening members of the 
opposition-I think it is unfortunate the level of debate should sink 
so low.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I also 
witnessed this incident, and I can confirm to the House that the 
hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine actually 
invited my colleague to step outside and fight.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think we have had enough of these denials of what 
happened and these attempts to convince others that this was not 
the case. It was. He invited my colleague to step outside of the 
House and fight.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I did not hear the words 
we are discussing now. I will review the blues, the minutes of the 
proceedings, and if I see anything, I will get back to it later in the 
House, if necessary. For the time being, we must take the hon. 
member at his word. The member for Skeena has the floor.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, to finish my remarks before 
we get into school yard tactics here, the hon. member from the Bloc 
was suggesting the Reform Party would never form the 
government. I beg to differ with him. I feel genuinely sorry for 
those members because they earnestly believe they will achieve 
their goal. However we all know they will not.
<P>
	When the people of Quebec vote no in the referendum on 
October 30, they will then be looking for alternatives and the 
Reform Party is the only political party on the national landscape 
right now that offers serious alternatives.
<P>
	Members of the governing party have a vested interest in 
keeping the debate ongoing for the rest of their lives because there 
is a political gain in it for them.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a completely different vision of that, a 
completely different point of view. If the Reform Party gets the 
opportunity to form the government, which we believe we will in 
the next federal election, there will be an opportunity to discuss a 
new federal arrangement with all the provinces, not just with 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I fully understand the trouble in 
the minds of my friends in the Reform Party, but it is a reality, it is 
a fact, that within the country there are three major voices. The first 
one goes to Ontario, the second one to Quebec due to the 
demographic compilation, and the third one goes to westerners. In 
my own opinion it is a shame. Even the Liberal government is 
always calling the Reform Party the third party because that is the 
way it is.
<P>
	I sincerely think westerners should have a real say in Parliament. 
They should be entitled to run for power, which is not the case 
actually.
<P>
	My friend suggests that if the no wins, the Reform will probably 
form the next government. However, if the no wins, for a short 
period of time the Prime Minister of Canada will be seen as the 
saviour, Captain Canada, and he will be elected again. We will be 
here too. To have the potential to take power the Reform Party must 
assume that it should support the sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting here listening to the 
complaints of the hon. member of the Bloc, the official opposition.
<P>
	There are two points I should like to clear up before I deliver my 
speech. It is sad for me to see in the House that both the Bloc and 
the third party are seeking an alliance and to see the Reform Party 
trying to ask for friendship from the separatists. I could not take 
that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not true. Tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> You were not here to hear the praise that was offered 
by that party.
<P>
	As an immigrant I came to this country at the age of 17. My 
family went to Hong Kong and I came from Hong Kong to Canada. 
I came to Canada as it is. To hear the separatists day in and day out 
in the House trying to destroy the country that I came for is very 
sad.
<P>
	There is also another point. The hon. member from the Bloc was 
talking about the provincial rights the bill infringed upon. This is 
not true. There is no change with respect to provincial rights. 
Where a province has rights today it will continue to have rights 
after the bill is law.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	What all provinces and territories along our coast will gain is the 
federal government's commitment to work together with them to 
ensure an integrated approach to providing greater protection of 
our marine environment, improve the management of our ocean 
resources, and ultimately better economic opportunities for our 
coastal communities. The Bloc's accusations are not true.
<P>
	I am pleased to join my colleagues and members of the House in 
the second reading of the oceans act. I rise today in support of this 
legislation, which will establish major new rights over the oceans 
that surround our country. Canadians pushed hard in the councils of 
the world for the opportunity to establish these rights. The new 
zones grant Canada powers that go well beyond the powers our 
country asserted in the past.
<P>
	As the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans said, Canadians are not 
naive. We know that the oceans act will not forever end maritime 
disagreement with other countries. There are undoubtedly bound to 
be some problems in the future with our circumpolar and Pacific 
and Atlantic friends and neighbours.
<P>
	What the act will do is put in place a clear definition of 
jurisdiction that is fully supported by global agreement. The world 
recognizes Canada's jurisdiction over Canadian waters and now we 
must continue to work hard. With ownership comes both 
opportunity and responsibility. With jurisdiction comes 
stewardship. With respect for the efforts of the past comes respect 
for the needs of the future.
<P>
	For all of the excellent co-operation that went into establishing 
oceans jurisdiction, the truth is that Canada's policies for actual 
management of oceans were fragmented. The same spirit of 
partnership, co-ordination, co-operation, and innovation that 
enabled Canada to gain authority over ocean resources must now 
be used to manage those resources.
<P>
	We have before us the task of making sure that the pieces all fit 
together: conservation and commercialization, deep ocean research 
and cold ocean rescues, emergency responses and sustainability, 
navigational safety and national security, national goals and re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15036"> 15036 </A></B>
<P>
gional initiatives, resource restoration and job creation, inspection 
and protection.
<P>
	There are pieces of the puzzle that seem to grow larger and larger 
in size and importance: climate change, ecotourism, aquaculture, 
Arctic pollution, interrelationship of species, expanding human 
population, new technologies.
<P>
	The oceans themselves are constantly fluctuating. They are 
independent, living ecosystems. Yet they are interconnected and 
linked with one another and with the entire global environment. 
Just as in the tropical rain forests, there are yet unknown medicines 
to be found in the oceans and yet unknown dangers to be faced.
<P>
	The oceans act defines a new vision for Canada's oceans. It 
allows for the development of a new management regime to protect 
its oceans. This is a regime based on co-operation, collaboration, 
and partnership. It allows the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to 
enter into collaborative agreements and partnerships with all 
stakeholders to implement this ocean management regime.
<P>
	The oceans act does not attempt to create a fully developed 
ocean management strategy. It recognizes that we must work 
collectively. The bill before members of the House of Commons 
creates the jurisdictional foundation and some of the policy 
framework so that all Canadians can build the strategy together.
<P>
	We must have a better understanding and knowledge of the 
oceans. Science must be multi-disciplinary. Partnership across 
organizations and disciplines and sectors of society is essential. 
Precisely because our ocean jurisdiction is so huge, our ocean 
sciences must be on the leading edge. Better information is 
essential for better decision making. Better science is essential for 
economic viability and ecological sustainability. Canada's 
credibility in future ocean negotiations and future ocean trade will 
depend on the quality of our science.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The oceans act is tailored to increase, co-ordinate, and disperse 
scientific, environmental, and management information relating to 
our oceans and their resources. Marine resource management will 
be an important policy element in the building of a successful 
oceans strategy. Traditionally governments have carried out their 
responsibilities in consultation with stakeholders but not in 
partnership with them. The distinction is critical.
<P>
	The old way must change and it is changing. The Atlantic 
Fisheries Resource Conservation Council now brings together 
industry, academia, and government to make recommendations on 
fishery conservation and the federal government now follows 
through on those recommendations. The time has come to expand 
such partnerships beyond fishery conservation, and the oceans act 
makes it possible to expand partnerships even further to encompass 
marine plants, underwater exploration and seabed mining, and a 
vast range of development activities that could impact in a marine 
environment.
<P>
	A key element of an effective oceans strategy must be the 
consideration of environmental consequences in management 
decisions. It will take time, effort, and compromise to accomplish 
this, but Canada needs a functional ecosystems approach to oceans 
policy. Such an approach must converge across lines of jurisdiction 
and economic sectors. The issues of environmental concern must 
be addressed through a range of tools, including coastal zone 
management, pollution prevention, and marine environmental 
quality indicators and guidelines.
<P>
	Another key element of a successful oceans strategy is the 
facilitation of marine trade commerce and development. It goes 
without saying that icebreaking, fish inspection, marine navigation 
services and ocean mapping have priorities in ocean trade and 
commerce. So do new ocean laboratory partnerships, technology 
development, regulatory harmonization, and resource assessment. 
This synergy of collective interests and integrated capabilities is 
recognized in the act and is exemplified in the new Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The increase in Canada's oceans jurisdiction marries well with 
the merger of the Canadian Coast Guard and the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. The new organization will comprise the 
principal civilian marine operational component of the 
Government of Canada. We will be able to realize efficiencies, 
streamline operations, integrate the operation of the coast guard 
and fisheries fleets, and promote multi-tasking. All of this will help 
us to work more effectively to provide high national standards and 
effective services.
<P>
	For years we have supported commercial enterprises in the 
Arctic. We have ensured and will continue to ensure the safe 
movement of millions of dollars of cargo through ice filled waters 
and have provided sophisticated analysis in the operation of the 
St. Lawrence.
<P>
	Commercial enterprises must have easy access to government 
data and we have to ensure that new ideas and technologies are 
transferred form government researchers to the private sector.
<P>
	The expertise that Canadians have developed in forging oceans 
policy can be and should be the backbone of extraordinary new 
global market opportunities. That leads directly to a key element of 
an oceans management strategy, international relations. From the 
days when others denied John Cabots's discovery of the new world 
to the days when others denied Canada's right to protect the turbot, 
international relations have been centre stage in Canada's maritime 
saga. Canadians have shown that fisheries conservation will never 
be sacrificed on the altar of economic trade or political relations. 
We have shown that conservation is not a bargaining chip in a 
larger game. Our responsibility now is to make this legislation the 
turning point in our approach to all international ocean issues.

<P>
	Canadians need to establish a strong and credible international 
strategy to carry our messages on marine pollution from ships, on 
the control of ocean dumping and coast zone management with our 
neighbours. Circumpolar oceans management, spill response 
assistance, international shipping, offshore energy, precise 
territorial boundary delineation, and emerging high seas issues will 
all require thoughtful leadership by Canadians globally and 
thoughtful examples by Canadians domestically.
<P>
	Support from all Canadians for Canada's international actions is 
of enormous importance. I look forward to the active involvement 
of Canadians in forging Canada's position on emerging global 
ocean issues.
<P>
	As the minister stated on Tuesday, the oceans act signals 
renewed federal leadership for oceans management. It signals the 
federal government's commitment to a comprehensive and 
co-operative approach to oceans policy. It signals that shared 
information, shared planning, and shared oceans stewardship are 
the wave of the future. It signals that Canada and Canadians are 
prepared to act in making the most of our ocean assets, 
opportunities, and obligations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have to respond to the initial comments of the parliamentary 
secretary as he described his reaction to this whole Bloc-Liberal 
fight that is going on this morning.
<P>
	Somehow he is trying to tie in some association between the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party. When he is making that kind 
of an analogy, how does the minister reconcile the fact that when it 
comes to acquiescing to the Bloc and it comes to electing 
vice-chairs, when it comes to making sure that the water is never 
ruffled, it is always the Liberals making a deal with the Bloc?
<P>
	The idea that the Reform Party somehow has any similar vision 
to the Bloc is crazy. We have repeatedly said the Bloc Quebecois 
will be defeated, hopefully at the end of the month, that it will 
hopefully lose its reason for being here, which would be another 
sweet treat. It surely has the wrong vision about how to fix Canada.
<P>
	I agree with the minister when he says Canada is a great place. It 
does need some changes though, and the way to change it is not to 
leave but to work within the system to make a better decentralized 
Canadian federation that can be better for all Canadians.
<P>

up. I thought I would give you a chance to catch your breath and 
come back at it right after question period, when the minister will 
also have a chance to get wound up.

now proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take this 
opportunity to congratulate Mr. John Willoughby, who has been 
working diligently for several years on a project called the Ellen 
Foundation.
<P>
	In the late 1800s and early 1900s, a farm emigration policy on 
juveniles was established between England and Canada. This 
agreement brought 100,000 English children to Canada to work as 
farm labourers. These children came to be known as ``home 
children''.
<P>
	Mr. Willoughby has just launched his book entitled <I>Ellen -The 
Story of a Home Child who was sent to P.E.I.</I> Ellen, as it turns out, 
was the inspiration for <I>Anne of Green Gables</I><B> </B>by Lucy Maude 
Montgomery.
<P>
	The Ellen Foundation is dedicated to assist home children and 
their descendants to establish and locate their roots in the United 
Kingdom, to preserve the history and heritage of the home 
children, and to provide the information here and abroad on their 
story and their strong contribution to the building of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to Robert Fairholm, an economist from a prestigious 
American firm, the financial markets will force Canada to quickly 
negotiate division of the debt and to maintain the existing 
economic ties between the two partners. He says that they will be 
seeking each other out to sign such an agreement.
<P>
	Since Canada's is the worse external debt in the G-7, foreign 
investors will obviously want to protect their investments by 
forcing Canada to negotiate with Quebec. The financial markets 
will be there to cool down the emotions of those involved.
<P>
	It is hard to believe that the Minister of Finance for Canada is 
incapable of grasping this and keeps saying that Canada could not 
negotiate a new partnership with Quebec even if it wanted to.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance forgets his duty as the manager of the 
Canadian debt, and if he forgets where the interests of Canadians 
and Quebecers lie, the financial markets and one of the worst debts 
in the western world will be there to remind him of that duty.

yesterday one of our Canadian peacekeepers, Major Bruce 
Henwood, was injured when the jeep he was riding in hit a mine in 
Croatia. As a result Major Henwood had both legs amputated 
below the knee.
<P>
	It is this unfortunate and horrid type of incident which 
underscores the dangerous and perilous duties performed by our 
peacekeepers working abroad. Major Henwood is one of many 
Canadian peacekeepers serving abroad who come face to face with 
this kind of reality every day.

attention of the House a concrete example of our government's 
commitment to day care.
<P>
	In my riding of Brant we have day care centres attached to two of 
our local high schools. They provide care to the children of single 
adolescent parents who are continuing their education and to the 
children of mature students who are also parents.
<P>
	Our thinking here is that if we provide appropriate day care to 
the children, their parents will continue with their education, which 
is so important to their future in terms of getting a job and in some 
cases to breaking the welfare trap.
<P>
	Unfortunately because of significant provincial government cuts 
these facilities faced closure on October 1. Thanks to the quick 
action of my colleague, the Minister for Human Resources 
Development, we found funding through the human resources 
investment fund to keep the facilities open.
<P>
	I congratulate him on recognizing the direct and important link 
between day care, jobs and education, and thank him for allowing 
us to continue this unique and effective day care strategy.

Canadians who served overseas during the first and second world 
wars.
<P>
	On Thursday, September 21 a plaque was unveiled at the 
National War Memorial, a gift from the British people as a symbol 
of their abiding gratitude for Canada's support during both World 
War I and World War II.

Republic of Poland, approved the posthumous award of the Polish 
Home Army Cross to 26 Canadian airmen for their support in the 
liberation of Poland.

	Spirituality, as the member says, has been the missing element in 
the political process to reclaim native land and the right to

create new wealth and new jobs for the benefit of all Canadians, 
and make Canada's health and educational sectors models for the 
rest of the world.
<P>
	I am also pleased to see that the council's recommendation for 
dealing with illegal content such as hate propaganda mirror the 
intent of the motion I introduced in the House last January, which 
was adopted without dissent.
<P>
	No doubt when these recommendations are fully adopted by the 
government we will have a guarantee that the information highway 
will be a highway of harmony, not of hate. No doubt we will have

owed to the public purse-but in return, we ask each Quebecer to 
help us put an end to the mad race toward illegality''.

seen the light. Indeed, at a one-day  conference of the Association

Quebecers by Messrs. Beaudoin and Garcia.

supporting the No side does not seem to be shared by Mr. Dufour, 
chairman of the Conseil du patronat du Quebec. While commenting 
Hydro-Quebec's withdrawal from his organization, he Dufour 
made veiled threats to Mr. Martineau when he said: ``From now on, 
he will have to look for friends''. End of quote. This type of

everyone pays the government what they owe''.
<P>
	This is the same minister who, on February 8, made the 
following comment about the division of Canada's debt should 
Quebec become independent: ``This is not our debt. It is Canada's 
debt''. Yesterday, speaking before a student audience, he suggested 
that a separate Quebec may not assume its share of the debt.
<P>
	How much confidence can the people of Quebec put in a finance 
minister who publicly tells taxpayers: ``Do as I say, not as I do''. 
On October 30, the people will say No to this kind of double talk.

	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
marks the fifth anniversary of the World Summit for Children. 
Under the leadership of Canada, 70 nations pledged that by the year 
2000 they would eliminate illiteracy, reduce malnutrition by half 
and provide universal access to clean water around the world.
<P>
	This year UNICEF reports that as a result of the summit four 
million children in the third world will not only survive but will 
become full productive members of society. However more needs 
to be done since 13 million children are still likely to die each year 
for lack of basic health care and safe water.
<P>
	I rise today to salute the excellent work of Results Canada which 
continues to promote the summit ideals. As a government we must 
continue to step up our efforts to ensure that the basic needs of all 
children worldwide are met by the year 2000.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in March 1994 I rose in the House to call on the 
government to delay the sale of the Grumman Goose while a 
dedicated group of Canadians in Prince George raised money to 
keep it in Canada.
<P>
	This RCMP plane was built in 1944 and can land on water, snow 
or ground and has logged over 24,000 flying hours. It has seen 
service on both coasts, in Ottawa and the high Arctic. It has been 
used for drug busts, surveillance, rescues and air shows in addition 
to ferrying people and equipment.
<P>
	I am pleased to report the federal and B.C. governments listened 
to the Save the Goose committee. Through the committee's efforts 
this piece of Canadian heritage has been saved for the enjoyment of 
future generations.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUEBECREFERENDUM">QUEBEC REFERENDUM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebecers will decide their political future on October 30. 
In order to make an enlightened choice, they are entitled to know 
the whys and wherefores of the two options before them: 
sovereignty-partnership, on the one hand, and the status quo, on the 
other.
<P>
	I am therefore asking the Prime Minister if he and his ally, 
Daniel Johnson, will agree to take part in a real four-way televised 
debate with Jacques Parizeau and myself. Does he recognize that it 
is all the more vital he take part in such a debate because he alone is 
in a position to tell Quebecers what exactly awaits them if they vote 
no?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very surprised, having known Mr. Parizeau for so 
many years, that he is suddenly losing his self-confidence and is 
afraid to face the leader of the No side, Mr. Johnson.
<P>
	As for me, when the Leader of the Opposition suggested last 
spring that Parliament be adjourned in the fall, I decided to come to 
Parliament to have the privilege of meeting the Leader of the 
Opposition every day, at every question period. We have been here 
for hours, and I do not refuse to answer. The leader of the No side is 
Mr. Johnson, I believe; he made an agreement with Mr.  Parizeau. 
Mr. Johnson will keep his word; he will face Mr. Parizeau. What is 
new is Mr. Parizeau's fear of facing Mr. Johnson.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we never asked that the House be adjourned. We were 
immediately delighted to learn that we could talk with the Prime 
Minister every day and converse about the future of our respective 
options and we will be here every day until the end.
<P>
	We wanted to add to what we already have, because we only 
have a few seconds, which go by too quickly for my liking. I think 
that Canadians know full well that a question period, however 
practical it may be, does not provide the depth that a debate, a real 
intellectual confrontation on the things opposing us can give.
<P>
	I think we would learn a lot more, because, had we not had the 
opportunity to see the Prime Minister for a number of weeks, we 
would not have known, for example, that he is refusing to 
recognize a democratic yes vote and we would not have known that 
he is preparing to slash the old age pensions of those approaching 
65 years of age. We are learning things. The more we talk to him, 
the more we learn.
<P>
	So we ask him, one last time, to agree to come, as the Prime 
Minister of Canada, and face those who do not think the way he 
does on television, live, for an hour and a half.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am answering all the questions here throughout the 
entire referendum debate. There is a leader of the Yes side, his 
name is Mr. Parizeau; there is a leader of the No side, his name is 
Mr. Johnson. The two of them reached an agreement on a debate. 
Mr. Johnson wants to have a debate with Mr. Parizeau. I have a 
debate with the Leader of the Opposition, here, every day. They try 
to frighten people every day, but if people want to live in Quebec 
and want to keep the security they currently enjoy in Quebec, the 
best solution, which involves no fear at all, is to vote no and stay in 
Canada.
<P>
	The old age pensions will go on being paid out and Quebecers 
will be treated exactly like all other Canadians in unemployment 
insurance and old age pension matters. We have nothing to hide, 
but the Leader of the Opposition, instead of telling Quebecers why 
he wants to separate, used a new term 
today-sovereignty-partnership-to try once again to hide the 
truth. They will invent another one soon, more change, more 
illusion. Let them say the truth: ``We want to separate from 
Canada''. Quebecers want to stay in Canada and they will say so. 
This is what they will say in the vote on October 30.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we live in a democracy, and democracy needs enlightened 
opinion. One of the most  crucial moments in any electoral or 
referendum campaign is when the protagonists with the highest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15042"> 15042 </A></B>
<P>
profile meet face to face before the public and debate the merits of 
their options for an hour and a half or two hours.
<P>
	Could it be, as Canada and Quebec face their destiny and as the 
people of Quebec make a fundamental decision, that the Prime 
Minister of Canada, the defender of Canadian unity, is afraid of his 
option to the point of refusing to take part in a televised debate of 
an hour and a half?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 32 years, this is the first time I have been accused of 
being afraid. Really! I have had debates with the Leader of the 
Opposition, I have a debate with him every day. Had I been afraid, I 
would simply have asked you, Mr. Speaker, not to recall us in 
September. I was the one who insisted we be here, to give the 
Leader of the Opposition the opportunity, on television, every day, 
to tell Quebecers why he wants to separate Quebec from Canada.
<P>
	And again today, he used another little term. What was it again?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Sovereignty-partnership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Ah yes, 
sovereignty-partnership. Another word, another change, another 
pirouette. Why not have the courage to say that you are separatists 
and we shall see clear results on October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
we learned that we had to thank the Prime Minister for our right to 
sit in this House and, today, that we should thank him for 
summoning Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> He thinks he showed courage by summoning 
Parliament. But that is his job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Since the Prime Minister used all kinds of tricks 
to avoid answering the question directly, I will go back to the same 
issue.
<P>
	I will go back to the same issue and ask him, quite sincerely and 
honestly, on behalf of the people of Quebec, on behalf of those who 
want to know what he has to offer the people of Quebec when he is 
asking them to vote No, would the Prime Minister be willing to 
take part in a debate with his boss, the leader of the No forces, and 
the leader of the Yes side, the Premier of Quebec, as the Leader of 
the Opposition offered him? Will he agree to explain his own 
proposal to the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise every day in this House. I am not the one who passed 
the referendum bill.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The Quebec government's referendum bill names Mr. Parizeau 
as the leader of the Yes side. He is the one who  challenged the 
leader of the No side, Mr. Johnson, to a debate. This challenge was 
accepted by Mr. Johnson, the legitimate leader of the Yes side, who 
is doing a terrific job. He agreed to a debate with Mr. Parizeau. 
Mr. Parizeau is now trying to get out of it. I myself face the Leader 
of the Opposition every day, and I am very seldom here on Fridays. 
But I am here today. I am still the Prime Minister of Canada with 
all the problems of a prime minister, but I take whatever time is 
needed to be in the House of Commons every day. Mr. Johnson is 
eager to meet with the leader of the Yes side, Mr. Parizeau, but 
clearly Mr. Parizeau is not eager to meet with Mr. Johnson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister not agree that Mr. Parizeau, the Premier of Quebec, 
wants to speak with the real boss, the one who can provide answers 
on cuts in social programs, on the proposal that he is now hiding 
but that we know he has in mind? Does the Prime Minister not 
agree that he should participate in this debate because he will be the 
one shaping tomorrow's country if Quebecers dare to vote No?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do so every day in this House, and I am not trying to 
avoid my responsibilities in any way. We are answering the 
questions. The Minister of Finance gave an important speech this 
week. Other ministers are criss-crossing Quebec to answer 
questions. I myself will be in Quebec on several occasions until the 
referendum. However, under the referendum bill, the leader of the 
No side is not me but Mr. Johnson, who, as I said earlier, is doing a 
terrific job. I think it is obvious that, for the first time in his life, 
Mr. Parizeau has lost his self-confidence. This surprises me, 
however, because it is unlike him. He should nonetheless have the 
courage to face Mr. Johnson. In the meantime, the Leader of the 
Opposition may find the courage to tell Quebecers that he is a 
separatist. I myself am here and I-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> You are afraid of Parizeau.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It is obvious that Mr. Parizeau 
needs Mr. Bouchard, because he has lost his confidence. Mr. 
Johnson is quite capable of defending himself.
<P>
	I face the Leader of the Opposition every day in this House, and 
he has not yet given us a single good reason why Quebec should 
separate from Canada.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
last election campaign the government ran on a policy of creating 
jobs and growth. This year there have been absolutely no new jobs 
and today's GDP  figures confirm there has been no economic 
growth this year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15043"> 15043 </A></B>
<P>
	Since the Minister of Finance has failed to deliver on his 
promised financial and economic statement what is it exactly that 
he intends to do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as is so often the 
case, the basis for the question is without foundation.
<P>
	Within the first year of our taking office this country created 
over 430,000 jobs. Since November of last year there have been 
over 230,000 new jobs created in the private sector.
<P>
	Yes it is true there have been job losses in the public sector at the 
federal, provincial and municipal levels. I find it surprising the 
Reform Party would not point out that this is because governments 
are cutting their spending. There is a lot less job loss in the public 
sector than there would have been if the slash and burn policies of 
the Reform Party had been brought in.
<P>
	We came into office intending to reverse the terrible destructive 
policies of the previous government, a government this member 
worked for. We have done it and the Canadian economy is now well 
poised for long term sustainable growth.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I left 
the Conservative Party in 1986 because of economic policies such 
as this minister's. It is surprising that it has taken him ten years to 
figure it out.
<P>
	Yesterday investment dealer Wood Gundy released a scathing 
indictment of the government's policies on jobs and growth. 
According to the report, we have ``experienced the weakest 
recovery in domestic spending in the post-war period because of 
high taxes and tax increases''.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance agree the country needs fiscal 
policies that allow for tax relief in the next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when reading these 
studies the hon. member should read them all.
<P>
	It is very clear that as a major exporting country we are affected 
by the declines in the economies of Japan and the United States. 
That is obviously going to affect us.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to say they 
sound like a cow herd in heat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Only you would know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
parliamentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the minister should not display to us his lack of knowledge of 
the beef industry.
<P>
	It is domestic spending that has not recovered since 1991 
because federal and provincial government tax increases have 
pulled more than $12 billion out of the pockets of consumers, an 
additional $155 for every Canadian every single year.
<P>
	Will the government admit that it has increased taxes because it 
has only rolling deficit targets instead of a firm date for deficit 
elimination?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to refer back to the 
study, the tax increases that led to that $12 billion the member 
referred to occurred under the previous government, of which he 
was a very ardent worker until he decided to skip town.
<P>
	This government, in its first budget and in its second budget, did 
not increase personal taxes one iota. The tax increases, of which 
there were 39, occurred under the previous government.
<P>
	I am quite proud to say I do have a beef herd, so when I hear the 
Reform Party I sure as heck know what a cow herd in heat sounds 
like.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, in response to one of my questions, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development stated that he would agree to 
support a youth project in his riding if I would vote no in the 
October 30 referendum. He said and I quote ``I am very pleased to 
say that I would certainly like to give him the assurance of 
supporting that project if he can give me the assurance of 
supporting the no vote on October 30''.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not find it indecent that his minister of 
human resources development is formally tying funding to 
organizations in my area to my political opinion?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for his question. I think what we should be 
focusing on from his question is what the government is doing for 
the young people of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	I had the pleasure during the summer months to introduce the 
summer job action plan, which created over 44,500 new jobs for 
young people.
<P>
	The hon. member should be a bit more consistent with what he is 
saying. On the one hand, when we introduced the program he said 
that we were intervening into provincial jurisdiction. On the other 
hand, in a letter written to the minister he asked us to support a 
project that deals with Youth Service Canada, a project that he said 
was intervening in provincial jurisdiction. It is clear that we have a 
confused bunch on the other side.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say that 
the parliamentary secretary is the one who is confused because I 
put my question to the Prime Minister but he did not reply.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	By refusing to denounce the Minister of Human Resources 
Development who linked funding with my political opinions, does 
the Prime Minister not realize that once again he is demonstrating 
his lack of respect for democracy?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to

the hon. member cannot have it both ways. On the one hand he is 
saying that Youth Service Canada is intervening in provincial 
jurisdiction. On the other hand, for young people in his riding he 
wants this program. He should make up his mind.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt 
asked the Prime Minister to explain glaring inconsistencies in the 
government's pronouncements about Canada's mandate in the 
former Yugoslavia. The Prime Minister's response was flippant 
and I would like to ask for clarification.
<P>
	In March the Prime Minister expressly declared that following a 
debate in the House the government was renewing our mandate for 
another six months. That time expires this weekend, but officials of 
both the Department of National Defence and the Department of 
Foreign Affairs claim that the mandate does not expire for another 
month or even two months.
<P>
	I seek clarification from the Prime Minister. When does 
Canada's formal commitment to the mission in the former 
Yugoslavia expire? Has the government undertaken to extend the 
mandate that was debated in the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs,  Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member refers to a debate in the House, and I 
remember the position of the Reform Party. It was actively 
encouraging the government not to keep our troops in 
ex-Yugoslavia for the reason that progress was not being made.
<P>
	I think the hon. member, with his experience, would very much 
appreciate that in Croatia our troops were withdrawn when the job 
was done, with no further ado.
<P>
	Right now I think the House is entirely aware of the progress that 
has been made in Bosnia and how close we are to the peace process. 
To suggest that progress has not been made I think was wrong in 
the spring and it is wrong now.
<P>
	Specifically, the United Nations mandate will expire on 
November 30. The Canadian rotation for the troops is due in 
mid-November. In view of the progress that has been made, the 
government will decide by the end of October on the future of 
Canadian participation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the issue here is not progress in the former Yugoslavia. The issue 
here is the mandate of our troops and the discussion in the House.
<P>
	Last September and again last March the government pretended 
that Parliament and the people of Canada had a voice in 
determining our peacekeeping commitments. We remember that in 
March the debate was held only two days before our mandate 
expired. Now we find that the government is acting unilaterally, 
without any consultation.
<P>
	Canada's peacekeepers have always been faithful in their duty 
and they are right now. Along with other Canadians, they deserve a 
clear indication of the mandate and deserve a better answer from 
the government than the Prime Minister gave yesterday or what I 
heard just now.
<P>
	When does our mandate expire, and why has the government not 
consulted Parliament about its extension?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I remind the hon. member his colleague, then the defence 
critic, as a member of the standing committee, agreed to a report 
that in essence said that with respect to the committal of 
peacekeeping troops in mandates such as the one under discussion, 
under normal circumstances the House would have a debate. He 
agreed, somewhat reluctantly, that there were occasions when a 
debate could not take place. This may be one of them.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. In August we learned that the 
government had decided to increase the rate with which it was 
issuing citizenship certificates in Quebec so as to allow the greatest 
possible number of new citizens to exercise their right to vote in the 
coming referendum, close to 10 000 people.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister says he would never use new Canadians for 
political purposes. Would he indicate to us whether this is standard 
practice when an election or referendum is in the offing?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question 
asked by the hon. member relates to the voting process in the 
province of Quebec. The province of Quebec obviously handles 
these matters on their own. The Canada-Quebec accord is such that 
it is an example of federalism at its most flexible and at its best. If 
the hon. member does not understand that, she does not understand 
the accord.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fear that 
the hon. member has not understood my question, because 
speeding up this process does not depend on Quebec but on the 
federal government.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister explain, for instance, that the 
processing of citizenship applications is being accelerated in 
Quebec at this time, but that was not the case when elections were 
held recently in New Brunswick and Ontario?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

wish to become citizens, whether they are from Quebec, New

there so that the  government can calculate its racial targets for its 
employment equity program.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry confirm that the government 
intends to prosecute Canadians who refuse to participate in the 
exercise of racial identification?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member will know that the purpose of conducting a 
periodic census is to determine the composition of Canadian 
society. This is useful for a wide range of purposes.
<P>
	On the issue of race, in the past people have made calculations 
based on language rather than a specific question on racial origin. 
This time we think the provision of fuller information will give us a 
much better understanding of the make-up of Canadian society. 
That should be beneficial for a wide range of purposes.

the option of stating whether they are Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
South Asian, West Asian, or Southeast Asian. However, those who 
want to identify themselves as Canadians will have to select the 
category ``other''. In our own country we will have to be 
considered ``other''.

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately the Reform Party has repeatedly both in the House 
and elsewhere failed to recognize that the face of Canada is one of 
many colours and many languages. In looking at Canada it sees it 
only through its own eyes and is not able to understand how varied 
and diverse a mosaic we have created here. This is one of the 
strengths of Canada. It is unfortunate it has taken this approach to 
what is a very simple gathering of information for very useful 
purposes.

<P>
	Recently, the president of the Canadian Broadcasting

</B>Mr. Speaker, we know that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation

budgetary requirements. On behalf of the government we have 
initiated a process to examine the mandate of the CBC. We will 
also consider the finances of the CBC in the next budget, and that is 
our position at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage knows perfectly well that the 
inequities in financing between the English and French networks 
are obvious proof that francophones are discriminated against 
within the CBC, especially since the French network is far more 
successful than the English network in reaching its target audience 
and does so at a lesser cost. Would the minister at least have the 
courage to admit this?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I most certainly agree that the CBC's French network 
plays a magnificent role in developing the ``francophonie'' in

being made to assess the product as quickly as possible. Health

because the Somalia commission is of pressing national concern, I 
address the Prime Minister regarding Mark Boland.
<P>
	The commission admits that its refusal to grant standing to 
Private Boland violates strict logic. Further, doing so undermines 
the commission's terms of reference which stress that attitudes, 
discipline and decisions at all rank levels of the chain of command 
are to be investigated.
<P>
	Boland's rejection sends a signal throughout the 
non-commissioned member community that this inquiry is by 
officers, for officers and discourages them from coming forward.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister uphold the perception of justice by 
ensuring that Mark Boland is given standing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. I believe he is 
aware that the commission has taken this decision not to grant 
standing before the inquiry for Private Mark Boland. He is also 
aware that the authority to grant standing rests with the 
commission of inquiry which is constituted under the rules of 
Canada and their ruling on this is publicly available for all to know.
<P>
	He is also aware that because the commission is an independent, 
properly constituted inquiry, it would be totally inappropriate for 
me to comment on it and for the minister to interfere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the reason I went to the Prime Minister was that the inquiry, as I 
understand it, comes under the Privy Council which answers to the 
Prime Minister. My question was to him.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The 
Canada Council has decided to go ahead with the implementation 
of its new development plan, despite the opposition expressed by 
the Quebec cultural community. As a result, there are no longer two 
linguistic sectors and francophones are left with no contact.
<P>

will no longer be a factor, this decision means that requests for 
financial support made by francophone organizations will be like 
drops in the ocean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the Canada Council has undertaken an in-depth 
review of its structures and business plan, the main objective of 
which is to increase the council's efficiency and effectiveness, not 
to hit one group or another with punitive action. I think it can be 
said that the Canada Council has been and will continue to be a 
driving force for the development of the French culture in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr.

francophones are the ones bearing the brunt of federal cuts? Is this 
not another way for the federal government to minimize and 
trivialize our identity as Quebecers?
<P>

</B>Mr. Speaker, I will not use the argument that this is an organization 
operating completely at arm's length from the minister. What I 
want to say, however, is that there are no signs indicating that the 
Canada Council is discriminating against francophones. Far from

commitment and a strong attachment to the environment. I was 
pleased only a few moments ago to entertain a question from the 
Reform Party on calving grounds for the Porcupine caribou herd. It 
is certainly an indication that environmental issues are not 
exclusive to party lines and every Canadian believes that our 
environment is a part of our heritage and a part of who we are.
<P>
	Since becoming environment minister I have met some 
incredible people from across the country, people who spend most 
of their waking hours working on environmental issues such as 
climate change, biodiversity and reducing toxins.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yesterday evening, I was in Montreal to attend the Second 
International Hydrogen Summit, where I met people who really 
take seriously the technological opportunities which will be the 
major challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have also seen communities like my own that have fought back 
against environmental degradation to achieve great things. There 
are communities that have restored waterways, reduced waste, 
protected wildlife habitat, created jobs and at the same time have 
sparked innovative, fledgling incubator industries, communities 
like my own hometown of Hamilton.
<P>
	In Hamilton people from all walks of life came together to 
transform our community from a city that was polluted and full of 
economic, environmental problems to a community that is cleaner 
and full of environmental and economic promise. The efforts of 
Hamiltonians have even been recognized by the United Nations. 
Hamilton was named Canada's only model sustainable city.
<P>
	Hamilton was a city which only a few short years ago at the wake 
of tremendous transition in the steel industry had an unemployment 
rate of around 16 per cent. Today Hamilton has the lowest 
unemployment rate in the country and the fastest growing 
industries are the environmental industries.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Based on what I have seen in my home town and elsewhere, I 
know that the real power to make changes does not rest with 
politicians but, rather, with Canadians and their communities.
<P>
	It goes without saying that governments and businesses have an 
important role to play to better protect the environment. However, 
without a degree of awareness and understanding, and without 
some initiatives by the various regions of the country, we will 
never reach our goal of ensuring sustainable development.
<P>
	This is why I am pleased to announce a new program called 
Action 21. We are keeping the red book promise where we said we 
would give Canadians the necessary tools to protect the 
environment in their daily lives.
<P>
	Action 21 will help regional groups carry out their 
environmental projects. We will match any community financing 
initiative by giving an amount equal to the community's 
participation for all admissible projects pertaining to the 
improvement, the depollution or the protection of the environment.
<P>
	Action 21 will have to emphasize the measurable advantages of 
any initiative and favour activities dealing with air pollution, 
climate changes, biodiversity, toxic substances, and the 
preservation of ecosystems.
<P>
	Action 21 includes a public awareness program which will 
encourage Canadians to make the environmentally friendly 
choices. We must all learn to care about the environment in our 
daily lives because we are all responsible for creating a healthy 
environment in our community.
<P>
	Action 21 will help only non-governmental and nonprofit 
organizations. We want to support service clubs, senior citizens 
associations, youth groups and environment protection groups.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We want to support car pooling and transit initiatives because we 
think it is critical to reduce vehicle emissions and the effects of 
climate change. We want to support initiatives which reduce the 
use of pesticides in fertilizers in non-farm settings because it is 
important to improve the health of Canadians.
<P>
	My hope is that we can particularly give a boost to young 
Canadians in their efforts to improve the environment in their own 
communities. They will have to do the work. We will match them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15050"> 15050 </A></B>
<P>
dollar for dollar, but  they will have to raise half of the money. I 
know they will do that because it is obvious that young Canadians 
understand that the environment is the key to our future.
<P>
	We have a lot to do. A recent study by Dr. Sverre Vedal of the 
University of British Columbia estimates that in that province 
alone 82 Canadians die prematurely every year as a result of air 
pollution in the form of inhalable particles. The Government of 
Canada has the responsibility to take whatever action is necessary 
to prevent those premature deaths.
<P>
	Through action 21 we are empowering Canadians to join us in 
that battle. We are giving Canadians the means to make their own 
decisions, to build on community based environmental protection 
and to make sure that Canadians are not only part of the problem, 
but that every single Canadian is part of the solution.
<P>
	Action 21 will have an annual budget of $10 million. I will 
repeat it for the benefit of the taxpayers of Canada: Every dollar we 
give to any project must be matched by a dollar raised in the 
community.
<P>
	Canadians want to find a role in being a part of the solution to the 
environmental challenges of the 20th century. With action 21 we 
will be able to achieve that into the 21st century. I know there is not 
a member of Parliament in the House, whatever his or her political 
stripe, who does not understand that the future of our children 
depends not only on the role of government, not only on the 
important role of business to clean up its own act, but also on the 
chance for Canadians to change the way we live and to build 
sustainable development as a cornerstone in all of the actions in 
every day of our lives.
<P>
	Action 21 is a small step to get Canadians involved in choosing 
the right solutions for a better environment into the 21st century. 
Action 21 will provide them with a small vehicle to get government 
help to achieve that.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, Quebecers care a great deal about the 
environment. It is part of their culture and of what they are.
<P>
	Some of them have dedicated their life to protecting the 
environment, raising their fellow citizens' awareness, as well as 
studying nature and its interaction with man. Some even called on 
the courts to prevent the federal government from going ahead with 
projects which were potentially harmful for human health and the 
marine ecosystem.
<P>
	Local initiatives to clean up riverbanks, reforest urban spaces or 
even organize carpools are often taken on by individuals convinced 
they can and must preserve a safe environment for their children. 
They deserve our grateful thanks.
<P>
	Clearly, I share the minister's vision regarding the 
appropriateness of helping initiatives aimed at reducing man's 
impact on nature.
<P>
	However, there is a major flaw in the minister's argument. The 
program she announced today is obviously the kind of measure 
which upsets programs and priorities established by provincial 
governments, creates new expectations, and constitutes dubious 
management practice.
<P>
	Action 21 is a perfect example of what Quebecers, sovereignists 
as well as federalists, have been fighting against for decades. The 
environment minister seems to have trouble understanding that. 
And yet, it is rather clear: Quebec no longer wants to see the federal 
government clumsily step in and negate its efforts. Many provinces 
share the same feeling.
<P>
	The only purpose of Action 21 is for the federal government to 
use its spending power in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Quebecers have heard this song before. Its intent is laudable, 
and just about everybody recognizes how important it is. The 
federal government is setting itself up as a saviour generously 
handing out mana.
<P>
	What the minister does not realize is that Quebecers know that 
government funding will be reduced, even stopped, within a few 
months or a few years. Budget constraints will then be blamed, as 
is already the case now.
<P>
	Groups who have initiated projects will then turn to Quebec for 
the kind of assistance they really need, at which time the province 
will be faced with the following choice: either completing ongoing 
projects or putting an end to them. In one case, the federal 
government will have shifted to the province responsibility for part 
of its expenditures and, in the other, responsibility for quashing the 
projects.
<P>
	This is something Quebecers have experienced over and over in 
many areas. Take for example the contaminated sites rehabilitation 
program and the greater Montreal greening program.
<P>
	By being very careful not to mention in her speech the amounts 
earmarked for and actual duration of Agenda 21, the minister 
confirmed the misgivings we had.
<P>
	Action taken under Agenda 21 is based on a fifteen year old 
philosophy aimed at giving the federal government the sole 
initiative on environmental issues. Relying on the authority of the 
Supreme Court and on its own spending power, the federal 
government is gradually taking over this area of responsibility, 
establishing new national standards which, in many cases, add to 
existing provincial standards.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to thank the hon. minister for just proving to us 
that her government never intended to change the federal system in 
any way and that all it has to  offer Quebecers is the good old 
Trudeau-style centralization. As long as it is able to get away with 
it, the federal government will use its spending power in areas of 
provincial responsibility, disregard priorities set by Quebec minis-

resource utilization and widespread pollution are occurring in so 
many areas and it is imperative that we address these problems.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	We applaud the intent and intention of action 21. It will help 
Canadians to deal with environmental considerations in their lives, 
to deal with sustainable development, recycling, and to increase 
environmental awareness.
<P>
	However we have some concerns. Where is the $10 million that 
is put forth annually coming from? Is it being used for more 
bureaucrats? Will the money actually go where it was intended to 
go? We also have some concerns in that the November 1994 
environmental partners fund, a program which is virtually identical 
to action 21, was shut down. Here we are creating another system 
to do exactly what the environmental partners fund was supposed 
to do.
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister provide us with some 
information? Why are we creating a new program to fulfil one that 
we just closed down?
<P>
	We also have concerns about the assessment process, 
accountability, monitoring and follow up. I am sure the Deputy 
Prime Minister would agree that it is critically important to ensure 
that the moneys actually go to where they are intended to go, which 
I am sure is her intent.
<P>
	I hope the program does not become like the Tory green plan, a 
$2.5 billion boondoggle that went nowhere. The hon. minister 
knows that. I am sure she will look into ensuring that the same 
mistakes are not made.
<P>
	I ask the minister to look at her own back yard in Hamilton. 
Hamiltonians have worked very hard to address significant 
environmental concerns on their doorstep, but yet the two largest 
dumpers of benzene, Dofasco and Stelco, are in Hamilton. I ask the 
hon. minister to provide us with information so that we know what 
is being done in those areas.
<P>
	I also ask that we ensure the program has an identifiable 
framework, that we have adequate monitoring and follow up, and 
that the groups receiving it are accountable. We agree with the 
matching concept in action 21. It is something the Reform Party 
has continually put forth in other areas. It is a good idea because it 
shows ownership for those who are receiving the moneys.
<P>
	We should also focus on school programs. The minister 
mentioned that she was very interested in youth. If we focused on 
youth and school programs we might be able to supplement the 
moneys in the program from existing programs. It might be a cost 
effective way of expenditure.
<P>
	As an aside, we speak about the environment and yet 40,000 
people die in the country of smoking related illnesses every year. 
Tragically the government's smoking platform that it has put forth 
since inception has caused the greatest increase in tobacco 
consumption we have seen in the last 20 years.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned that 82 people tragically die of 
diseases related to the inhalation of toxic substances. That is a very 
big tragedy. However let us put it into context with respect to the 
40,000 people who die of smoking related illnesses and an 
indeterminate number who die of second hand smoke. Also 
one-ninth of all women get breast cancer which might have a 
genetic toxic component. Let us also look at some of these larger 
issues.
<P>
	Our intent is the same as the government's in trying to increase 
awareness in environmental degradation, sustainable development 
and environmental awareness. We hope the program will do what it 
was intended to do, that is increase awareness among Canadians. 
Let us make sure the moneys go to where they are supposed to go 
and not to developing more bureaucracy.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-98, 
an act respecting the oceans of Canada, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific 
was to reply to the question of the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
East. I believe the member for Fraser Valley East had completed 
his question or comment.
<P>
	The member is indicating that he had not. I ask him to do so 
briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the minister.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	In what way does he see the government moving to decentralize 
the Canadian federation to provide services at a cheaper rate with 
less taxation, and at a cheaper expense to Canadians, to promote 
businesses and promote a better delivery of services in the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I will respond to his concern that I was pointing to the 
alliance between the separatists and the Reform Party. When the 
separatists propose to separate the country, the onus is on the 
separatists to demonstrate why they want to separate. What we 
have to offer is Canada which has been regarded by the UN as the 
number one country to live in and so on.
<P>
	During debate today a Bloc member tried to praise the Reform 
Party because of its tactics and so on, and there was applause from 
the member's benches. That is what triggered my comment. I hope 
I have answered that part of the question.
<P>
	On the decentralization process, during the process of refining 
government actions the government has been negotiating with 
provincial governments on all sectors, trying to reduce 
redundancies and trying to make things more efficient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The same is true with the oceans act. We are proposing a 
partnership to bring people together, the provincial side, the 
private sector and the federal government, to find ways to simplify 
and to promote harmony in our policies.
<P>
	I would be glad to support the bill and I hope we will get the 
support of the Reform Party too.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wish to inform the House that, because 
of the ministerial statement and answers, Government Orders will 
be extended by 16 minutes today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There have been five hours of debate on Bill C-98 and we are 
now into 10-minute speeches without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be given an opportunity to address the 
House on second reading of the oceans act.
<P>
	As we consider the legislation before us, we must also take into 
account the vastness of Canada's ocean area on all three coasts. We 
must also recognize the increasing stresses on our oceans 
environment, especially in our coastal areas.
<P>
	These stresses have resulted in resource depletion, habitat 
degradation and marine pollution. If we do not act decisively and 
now, the problems will only worsen. We are becoming increasingly 
aware that oceans are subject to impacts and influences of both 
natural and human origins.
<P>
	We now recognize that we must manage oceans to achieve 
economic opportunities while sustaining the environment, 
including the living resources of our oceans. That is true of the 
Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific coast and the Arctic. Whether it be 
improving the safety of Atlantic shipping, restoring fish habitat in a 
Pacific estuary or protecting the fragile Arctic environment from 
marine pollution, all these require leadership by the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	The time has come for leadership in integrated management of 
Canada's oceans, a leadership that will be provided by the 
government through the oceans act. We know that this cannot be 
done by the federal government alone. Jurisdiction is divided 
among federal, provincial, local and aboriginal authorities. That 
will not change. We embrace this reality and will address it through 
co-operation and partnership.
<P>
	What will change, however, is regulatory duplication, conflict 
and inadequacy that result in inefficiencies, failure to protect the 
environment and impediments to development. Private sector, 
public interest groups, non-governmental organizations, academics 
and federal advisory bodies have all called repeatedly for a 
comprehensive approach to oceans management, an  approach that 
will foster innovative internationally competitive ocean industries 
and preserve and sustain our oceans.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	First Nations have special concerns. Comprehensive land claims 
can involve important implications for protecting and developing 
both renewable and non-renewable ocean resources.
<P>
	These challenges are obvious in the Arctic. Use of the Arctic 
ocean and sea ice must take account of the fragility of the Arctic 
ecosystems and ensure that traditional patterns of hunting and 
fishing can be sustained.
<P>
	The recognition of the need for an oceans act is not new. The 
previous federal government said it would do all of this. In 1987 
the government of the day announced an oceans policy and that 
policy was not acted on by it. It said it would submit to Parliament 
a Canada oceans act but it did not bring forward a proposal.
<P>
	The legislation for this long awaited act is now before us and 
because this government is acting. Not only is it acting on a 
promise from the red book but acting out of the recognition of the 
need for a more cohesive approach to oceans management.
<P>
	The National Advisory Board on Science and Technology's 
report on Canada's oceans policy released last year condemned the 
federal government for neglect of its oceans responsibilities. It 
recommended an oceans management strategy and an oceans act to 
provide a firm legal basis for this strategy. These recommendations 
were supported by provinces, municipalities, businesses, unions, 
academics and others.
<P>
	The government realizes we must turn away from partial, ad hoc, 
short term measures based on expediency. We must manage our 
oceans on an ecosystems basis, not on the basis of single sector 
resource considerations separate from, say, the regulation of 
shipping or separate from environmental protection. Integrated 
resource management requires decision making that is open, 
transparent and based on sound science. It must apply 
multi-disciplinary approaches and it must integrate economic, 
environmental and social considerations and the involvement of all 
affected stakeholders.
<P>
	Stewardship of ocean and coastal resources is a responsibility 
that we must all share: federal, provincial, territorial, municipal 
and aboriginal governments in partnership with business, unions, 
non-governmental organizations and academics.
<P>
	As all members are aware, the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans took an important step toward integration of oceans 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15055"> 15055 </A></B>
<P>
management when it merged with the Canadian Coast Guard last 
April. This merger provided the department with the tools to more 
effectively provide cohesive oceans management. The merger 
brought  together the key elements of oceans management: 
shipping, fisheries, ocean sciences and environmental protection. 
The Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the coast guard fleets 
became one and in the turbot dispute last winter the red vessels of 
the coast guard fleet and the grey vessels of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans performed admirably as a team in the service 
of their country.
<P>
	While Canada has taken many steps in the past year to protect 
and conserve all of our oceans resources, environmental 
organizations like the World Wildlife Fund, the Canadian Arctic 
Resources Committee and the Canadian Nature Federation have 
long called for the creation of marine protected areas under the 
oceans act. The government has listened to their concerns.
<P>
	The oceans act will provide for the creation of marine protected 
areas to protect biodiversity and endangered species. There will be 
two types of areas. One will be developed in consultation with the 
stakeholders, the other will be designated by the Ministry of 
Fisheries and Oceans on an urgent temporary basis in response to 
the resource crisis.
<P>
	The ocean act signals a renewal of Canada's leadership in oceans 
management, a renewal that is long overdue. From the mid-1960s 
until the early 1980s Canada led the world. In the intervening years 
our initiative faltered. The federal government in the late 1980s and 
the early 1990s no longer led Canada in the forefront of global 
oceans policy. Now this government is reclaiming Canada's role as 
a world leader.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	While Canada has a major domestic interest in its oceans, it has 
the responsibility to manage them as a shared global resource and 
we must lead by example. The government is well aware that if 
Canada is to once again be a world leader in the oceans it will 
require that the oceans act establish a clear federal lead for the 
implementation of the oceans management strategy. That is the 
goal of the government and the legislation. It is to ensure there is a 
place under the federal leadership of the Ministry of Fisheries and 
Oceans in close co-operation with other federal and provincial 
ministers and stakeholders, mechanisms to manage all of Canada's 
ocean resources. The goal is for our oceans to be clean, safe, 
productive and accessible.
<P>
	The oceans act is a key part of the government's commitment to 
a new oceans management strategy. Developing and implementing 
that strategy will take the work of many people across Canada. It 
will be an ongoing process. The government is committed and 
ready to act on then development of an oceans management 
strategy. The oceans act signifies a commitment to all Canadians, a 
commitment to the world.
<P>
	I ask that other members in the House join with me in voting in 
favour of this very important legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the previous member for Dauphin-Swan River has stated, our 
oceans represent a shared global resource. Canadians watching this 
debate today may not be aware that 80 per cent of the world's 
population lives in coastal areas attached to oceans. Not only are 
oceans an important and integral part of Canada's key to survival, 
they certainly are for the world. The bill before us today calls for 
Parliament to formalize Canadian jurisdiction over vast new areas 
of ocean waters and resources off our coasts.
<P>
	This August in New York the United Nations Conference on 
Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks reached agreement 
by consensus on a new UN convention on high seas fisheries. When 
this new UN convention is properly implemented it will provide 
permanent protection for straddling stocks on the Grand Banks of 
Newfoundland. This is an enormous step forward. It is fully 
consistent with the oceans act. It completes the protection of some 
of Canada's most important ocean resources, the once great cod 
and flounder stocks on the Grand Banks.
<P>
	While the oceans act is an important element in protecting these 
resources inside 200 miles, the new UN convention is key to 
providing permanent protection for them outside 200 miles.
<P>
	There is massive fishing power deployed on the high seas. The 
nations of the world have often been unable to control it. The result 
has been destructive overfishing, depleted resources, human 
misery and conflict among states.
<P>
	Before this new UN convention it was unclear whether the 
escalation of fishing power could devastate resources before the 
international community had crafted the legal tools needed to 
prevent that from happening. However, Canada had taken the lead 
by approving Bill C-29 to protect threatened straddling stocks until 
effective international means to do so are implemented.
<P>
	To fill the gaps in international law and control high seas 
fisheries before it was too late required that coastal states as well as 
distance water fishing states do their part. All countries at the UN 
conference had to view matters in the global context.
<P>
	There have been serious failures in conservation of straddling 
stocks in all of the oceans of the world. There will continue to be 
such failures as long as the international legal framework is 
incomplete. The foundation in the law of the sea convention is 
sound but by itself it is not adequate. That was recognized at the 
UN Conference on Environment and Development by the UN 
General Assembly when the UN conference on straddling stocks 
was convened. It is significant that the  UN conference on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15056"> 15056 </A></B>
<P>
straddling stocks arose out of the UNCED conference on the 
environment.
<P>
	Over the past 20 years international environmental law has 
developed and found wider and wider application.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Environmental law and the law of the sea are becoming more 
integrated. Environmental concepts such as sustainable 
development, the precautionary approach and the ecosystems 
approach must be applied to achieve effective fisheries 
conservation. The new UN convention will greatly advance that 
integration.
<P>
	The new UN convention contains the five principle elements 
needed for an effective international system for conservation. First, 
the international framework of rules must be legally binding. The 
new UN convention will be legally binding. Second, there must be 
proper conservation and management measures. The new UN 
convention provides for this, notably in the precautionary 
approach.
<P>
	Third, there must be compatibility of conservation and 
management measures both inside and outside 200 miles. The new 
UN convention provides for this. Fourth, there must be binding and 
compulsory dispute settlement. Again the new UN convention 
provides for this. Finally, there must be some means to deal with 
the situation where the flag state is unable or unwilling to control 
its vessel fishing on the high seas. The new UN convention does 
this as well.
<P>
	Let me explain why high seas enforcement is necessary for an 
effective conservation system. There are serious and chronic 
control problems in high sea fisheries. The FAO in its March 1995 
report on the state of world fisheries highlighted problems of 
control and pointed toward pollution.
<P>
	Renewed international attention is focusing on unauthorized 
fishing and the role of monitoring, control and surveillance. 
Fisheries conservation and management are being undermined by 
such fishing and, together with the lack of effective monitoring, 
control and surveillance systems is threatening the sustainability of 
fisheries.
<P>
	The international community also acknowledges that the 
accurate collection and reporting of fisheries by-catch and discards 
data are important aspects of monitoring, control and surveillance, 
issues that will attract increasing attention.
<P>
	The most realistic and effective means of collecting, verifying 
and reporting these data are through the use of increased at-sea 
monitoring of fishing activities.
<P>
	The FAO report has it right. At-sea monitoring of fishing 
activities is needed for an effective conservation system. It is a 
necessary element of the new UN convention.
<P>
	The new UN convention will make the high seas fisheries 
provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of  the Sea work as 
they should but have not until now. Together, the UN Convention 
on the Law of the Sea and the new UN convention will constitute an 
effective international legal framework for sustainable 
development in high seas fisheries.
<P>
	Under such a regime we can rebuild straddling stocks and 
harvest them on a sustainable basis. This is a great advance over the 
situation Canada has faced in the past: foreign overfishing, 
depleted resources, economic decline and conflict with distant 
water fishing states.
<P>
	For responsible distant water fishing states like Japan, creating 
an effective international conservation regime is strongly in their 
interest. With us they should ratify and implement the new UN 
convention as soon as possible. Implementation of the new UN 
convention will be an important advance for humankind. It will be 
a giant step toward sustainability. In Canada it will be of great 
benefit to the tens of thousands of fishers and fish plant workers in 
Atlantic Canada whose livelihood and future depend on the 
straddling stocks of cod, flounder and turbot.
<P>
	With the oceans act and the new UN convention in time those 
resources will be bountiful once more. I am happy to support the 
bill and I urge all members to join me in allowing the legislation to 
move forward quickly. The oceans act charts a wise course for the 
future of ocean policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
considerable pleasure that I rise to offer my support to the oceans 
act.
<P>
	The legislation deals effectively with jurisdictional issues which 
have been under study for a long time. It also deals effectively with 
ocean management issues in a manner which will serve Canadians 
for many years to come.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	For a long time Canada has worked to focus the world's attention 
on ocean issues. For a long time Canada has worked to establish 
formal jurisdiction over the ocean waters and ocean resources that 
border our country.
<P>
	In the 1950s Canada played a leading role at the first UN 
conference on oceans. In the 1960s Canada played a leading role in 
calling for a UN convention on the law of the sea. In the same 
decade Canadians asserted their jurisdiction over the northwest 
passage by adopting the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act 
and declaring new fishing zones off both coasts. In the 1970s we 
took unilateral steps to declare a 200-mile fishing zone and a 
12-mile territorial sea.
<P>
	Canadians are all well aware of the recent successful efforts of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to protect the fishstocks 
within our 200-mile limit from overfishing outside and to lead the 
world in reaching agreement on the conservation of straddling 
fishstocks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15057"> 15057 </A></B>
<P>
	The oceans act when passed will formalize Canada's jurisdiction 
over all our oceans. The bill before Parliament is backed by 
international agreement. The bill declares that Canada not only 
has jurisdiction over our internal waters, territorial sea, fishing 
zones and continental shelf, but we also have jurisdiction over a 
new 12 nautical mile contiguous zone and 200 nautical mile 
exclusive economic zone.
<P>
	In the contiguous zone Canada will have formal jurisdiction to 
apply our fiscal, immigration, sanitary and customs laws. In the 
exclusive economic zone Canada will have formal jurisdiction for 
exploring and exploiting all economic resources, not only fish and 
for conserving and managing those resources.
<P>
	In this zone covering nearly five million square kilometres of 
ocean, Canadians will also have jurisdiction over marine research 
and protection and preservation of the marine environment. If that 
was all this legislation accomplished it would be an important 
achievement. We have fought long and hard to establish Canadian 
ocean rights.
<P>
	The bill does not stop there. It goes on to streamline and 
strengthen federal responsibilities for responsible ocean 
stewardship. It goes even further by establishing the legislative 
base for a new comprehensive and co-operative oceans 
management strategy.
<P>
	The bill sets in motion a new approach to oceans policy, an 
approach based on the federal government working in partnership 
with all those who have a stake in the future of our oceans, from the 
provinces and territories, to the local communities, to fishermen 
and businesses and environmentalists. Our oceans are a wonderful 
shared Canadian blessing. They require a shared sense of 
responsibility and a shared plan for both development and 
environmental protection.
<P>
	The bill sets out the objective of achieving sustainable 
development of our oceans and their resources through an 
integrated management strategy. The bill aims to achieve 
integrated planning of ocean activities, harmonized regulations and 
improved environmental protection based on a comprehensive 
ecosystems approach.
<P>
	To reach those ends the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will be 
authorized to enter into partnership agreements with other 
Canadian jurisdictions and organizations and to co-ordinate a 
cohesive Canadian approach to sustainable ocean development.
<P>
	The oceans act includes provisions for the establishment of 
marine protected areas, the development of ocean environmental 
quality guidelines and the application of Canada's current 
environmental legislation to the new exclusive economic zone.
<P>
	When Parliament resumed this month, the Deputy Prime 
Minister introduced legislation to establish a commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable  development responsible for auditing 
the environmental performance of all federal government 
departments. In doing so the Deputy Prime Minister called on all 
ministers to become ministers for sustainable development and all 
departments to develop action plans for environmental 
stewardship.
<P>
	The oceans act takes the same message forward. It empowers the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to push ahead with an oceans 
strategy based on the primary principle that the economic 
opportunities offered by our oceans are completely and absolutely 
linked to the environmental well-being of those oceans.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has indicated that he will 
act quickly, act seriously and act effectively, as he always does. He 
will not however act alone. He is seeking the advice and the input 
of all Canadians in developing an oceans management strategy that 
merges national objectives with regional decision making and sets 
national goals based upon local wisdom, local needs and local 
desires.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Once the oceans act is passed, the minister will be in a position 
to work with all Canadians in meeting the major challenges ahead 
as we seek to make Canada the global leader in oceans policy for 
the 21st century.
<P>
	Through the establishment of the Atlantic Fisheries Resource 
Conservation Council, the minister has already proven the new 
willingness of the federal government to take the advice of 
industry, academic and government experts on fisheries issues. We 
all know that several heads are better than one and the new 
partnership approach to fisheries conservation proves it.
<P>
	The even greater opportunity now is to expand that sense of 
partnership into the multi-faceted spheres of ocean policy, from 
resource management to marine safety, from trade development to 
environmental management, from better knowledge of ocean 
sciences to stronger international action on global ocean issues.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that all members of Parliament will come 
together to allow this legislation to move forward rapidly and 
become law in the near future. The bill provides parliamentarians 
the opportunity to come together to act in the interests of all 
Canadians and in the interests of our oceans environment.
<P>
	The bill gives Canada important new ocean jurisdictions. The 
bill provides for solid and sensible federal leadership on ocean 
issues. The bill creates the legislative framework for the 
development of a modern and much needed oceans management 
strategy. Through those measures, the bill creates the conditions in 
which all Canadians can share in developing a future for our oceans 
of which we all can be proud.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Hillsborough for his speech 
on Bill C-98, the oceans act.
<P>
	It was interesting that just a few weeks ago I had the privilege of 
visiting Atlantic Canada, his part of the great country we live in. I 
had the opportunity to visit and dialogue with many inshore 
fishermen. I discovered somewhat to my surprise that while our 
current minister of fisheries seems to enjoy a lot of popularity 
among Canadians who have the impression that the minister is 
standing up for the Canadian fishing industry, the inshore 
fishermen I was speaking with in Atlantic Canada were appalled by 
the actions of the DFO and of course the minister of fisheries who 
is responsible for the DFO.
<P>
	These hard working, entrepreneurial people who make their 
living from the sea feel there is a conspiracy to put them out of 
business in the way the quotas are structured. They are given 
quotas to catch fish when the fish are not catchable and there is no 
quota for the species that is available. They have a quota for a 
species that is not even in the waters they are allowed to fish. When 
the other species come in the quotas are reversed. It is so bad that 
they cannot even pay for the fuel to take the boat out into the water 
to go after these fish.
<P>
	These fishermen are also very concerned about the 
implementation of access fees which I understand would be made 
possible if Bill C-98 is passed. That will be the trigger which 
allows the DFO to impose access fees on the fishermen. It will 
make barely profitable enterprises unprofitable.
<P>
	I ask the member for Hillsborough if he would stand up and vote 
for his constituents rather than voting the party line in supporting 
this bill. Perhaps he needs an opportunity-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe 
we are into 10-minute speeches with no time for questions or 
comments. I presumed the member was entering into the debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is the assumption the Chair made as 
well. We will assume the questions are rhetorical ones, that the 
member is making an intervention and any questions he asks are 
rhetorical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy if the member 
could respond to me perhaps even in his own time when we are not 
in the Chamber. These concerns were expressed to me by the 
people who make their living from fishing in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The fisherman said the minister is not standing up for his 
industry, that he is throwing roadblocks in their way and none of 
the Liberal MPs from Atlantic Canada are standing up and 
speaking for them. They are very concerned and appalled. They 
have 31 Liberal MPs in Atlantic Canada and one Progressive 
Conservative MP and quite frankly they do not see much difference 
between the two parties. They were asking if no one in  Ottawa was 
going to speak up on their behalf about these access fees. They see 
these fees as a tax imposed on them to put them out of business.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	I implore the member for Hillsborough and his colleagues, the 
other 30 Liberal MPs from Atlantic Canada, and the Progressive 
Conservative member for Saint John to vote against Bill C-98 
unless there is a commitment from the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans to not impose these access fees, this horrible tax on the 
fishing industry. These entrepreneurial fishermen keep the rural 
and coastal communities of Atlantic Canada alive.
<P>
	If those members refuse to listen to their constituents, if they 
insist on voting with their party, voting with the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, voting with the Minister of the Environment 
on this issue, I emphasize they will not be voting for their 
constituents. In the future why should these hard working people 
vote for members of Parliament who come to the House and refuse 
to vote for them? These are rhetorical questions but I would 
appreciate answers from the Atlantic members of Parliament in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose all of us as supporters of a united Canada should rejoice 
that the Reform Party has finally discovered Atlantic Canada. 
Nonetheless, it is a bit of overweening pride to assume that a very 
short visit to Atlantic Canada can possibly generate an awareness 
of the issues of the people of that region similar to the awareness 
the member for Hillsborough has after his many, many years of 
service to the people of his riding in Prince Edward Island and of 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I certainly hope members of the Reform Party will manage a 
return visit to Prince Edward Island. They might learn some 
humility and attain some understanding that it takes more than a 
flying visit with a political purpose to appreciate the views of 
Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	It is my pleasure to speak on the oceans act. Canada is a front 
runner in the area of oceans technology. This legislation will help 
ensure that Canadian companies involved in this field continue to 
grow.
<P>
	The current work in this area is benefiting not only all Canadians 
but also the world. Canadian oceans related industries continue to 
bring new and exciting products and opportunities to Canadians 
and particularly those who live and work in our coastal regions.
<P>
	One of the identifying factors of Canada is that we are a 
maritime nation. With our shores bordered by three oceans, our 
coastline is the longest in the world. We also have the world's 
largest archipelago and part of the world's longest inland waterway 
opening up to the sea.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15059"> 15059 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important that we continue to build our understanding of 
our oceans, waterways and aquatic resources. Marine navigation 
is essential to the safe movement of goods on which our trade is 
so dependent. Commercial ships carry more than 350 million 
tonnes of cargo to and from Canadian ports each year. More 
shipping passes through the St. Lawrence seaway than through the 
Panama and Suez canals combined.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill deals with the concerns of the National Advisory Board 
on Science and Technology and other stakeholders, by allowing the 
development of an oceans management strategy which includes the 
planning and management of marine activities while also involving 
all the partners, including provincial governments.
<P>
	In addition to promoting investment, the bill will increase the 
efficiency of environmental protection measures by establishing 
marine protected areas, by using a more global approach for the 
management of oceans, and by introducing the management of 
coastal zones.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to return for a moment to the importance of this bill to the 
growing marine industry which is so important to Canada's 
economy. We are already recognized internationally as having one 
of the world's most advanced hydrographic organizations. The 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans is leading the way in the 
development of new tools and techniques in partnership with 
industry.
<P>
	This will continue as the development serves two purposes. The 
first is to improve the efficiency with which the department does its 
work which is in line with government program review initiatives. 
The second purpose, through the transfer of technology to the 
private sector, is to help to foster the growth of Canadian industries 
specializing in this field.
<P>
	I will mention some of those industries. One of the most exciting 
new contributions, and this is within fisheries and oceans, is the 
development of the electronic chart display information system 
which allows mariners to navigate from a video screen array 
combining a digital chart with a radar display of shipping, 
navigational aids, coastline and other features. Canadian ocean 
industries continue to lead the way in areas of oceans technology 
and in many other areas.
<P>
	In the area of remote sensing Canadian industry has developed 
the compact airborne spectrometer imaging sensor for cost 
effective aircraft based monitoring of capelin spawning, coastal 
habitat and algal blooms. This technology was developed under 
contract to Canadian industry based on technology from the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans fluorescence line imager 
projects.
<P>
	Three Canadian companies have been exploiting the technology. 
Itres Ltd. in Calgary is producing, selling and servicing it 
worldwide. Borstad and Associates Ltd. have developed algorithms 
for interpreting CASI data into quantitative coastal zone 
information products and provide a monitoring and information 
service. AGI Ariel Geomatics of British Columbia collects, 
processes and interprets airborne imagery for environmental uses.
<P>
	All of these companies are developing collaborative 
arrangements with international partners to penetrate the coastal 
zone market niche in global environmental information services.
<P>
	The Gable Group is another successful Canadian firm 
developing products for markets in oceanographic and freshwater 
monitoring and conservation and industrial applications such as 
moisture and heat measurement systems for irrigation, forestry and 
ground water pollution.
<P>
	There are concerns for instance that salmon stocks are threatened 
by overfishing or poorly managed restocking and by the adverse 
effects of environmental pollution. For salmon the better 
management of the fish resources requires the availability of data 
on the origin of the fish, their migration patterns, the nutrients and 
pollutants they encounter during their life. An innovative new 
method to supply precise, reliable data for salmon migration 
studies has been developed by Elemental Research Inc. This 
company's product can measure the inorganic elemental content of 
fish tissue, bones and scales to the highest possible levels of 
sensitivity.
<P>
	The need to make Canada's coastal waters safer and more 
accessible has been recognized by Mr. Bruce Seligman who has 
developed the tracked amphibious vehicle, ARKTOS. The Beta 
prototype has been used by Transport Canada, the Canadian Coast 
Guard, and more recently the Atlantic Geoscience Centre in Nova 
Scotia. Watercraft Offshore has successfully achieved over $6 
million worth of contracts over the past few years with China.
<P>
	The list can go on. The future of these new industries is indeed 
bright. With the oceans act and the oceans management strategy it 
will be even brighter.
<P>
	Countries ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea will have to map their 200 mile offshore exclusive 
economic zone. With Canada's demonstrated leadership in this 
field many of these nations will turn to Canadian companies to 
assist in meeting those requirements.
<P>
	As the world's population grows and society becomes more 
industrialized, demands on the aquatic environment increase the 
stakes are more costly and guesswork becomes more dangerous.
<P>
	The oceans act furthers Canada's commitment to Canadian 
ocean industries and ensures the technology continues to flow 
between governments and industries as partnerships are further 
developed.

<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise and speak on this very important 
bill in Parliament today. I am very privileged to have the 
opportunity to do so.
<P>
	I will very quickly cover the purposes of the bill as I see it. I will 
make a few comments with respect to the concern this party has for 
the people of the region that is most closely identified on the east 
coast with the ocean itself.
<P>
	To begin, the bill is an excellent piece of work. It does what 
experts on the sea have been talking about. It should have been 
done a long time ago. Even before I get into the main objectives of 
the bill, it has to be looked at against the backdrop of the kind of 
country Canada is.
<P>
	There is no question Canada is a maritime nation. We have three 
seas as our main borders. We have the longest navigable coastline 
in the world. We have the longest non-navigable coastline in the 
world.
<P>
	If one adds up the water space not including the Great Lakes 
which themselves comprise a large percentage of the fresh water in 
the world, it is a pretty large piece of territory if one extends out to 
the 200-mile economic zone and follows the coast all along and 
includes the Arctic waters.
<P>
	The responsibility for the management of that piece of property, 
sea property and the resources beneath, is tremendous. It involves 
close co-ordination to ensure we are getting the most effective 
management we can.
<P>
	Canada has had many departments involved with the 
management of the seas. We have the Canadian forces, with the 
navy; the solicitor general with the marine aspects of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police; the old DFO as it was before this bill 
was conceived. Environment Canada has been doing surveys off 
the coast. The coast guard has been responsible for navigation and 
safety and keeping the sea routes open. Other departments have had 
peripheral concerns and interests.
<P>
	The main purpose of this bill is to establish a framework to 
support the new oceans management regime for Canada and to 
consolidate the federal responsibility for Canada's oceans. The key 
word here is consolidation.
<P>
	The other aspect of this bill that is very important is that it 
recognizes in domestic law Canada's jurisdiction over its maritime 
zones. That has been a very long time in coming.
<P>
	Without wanting to sound partisan about this, the actions that 
were taken by the government with respect to the extension of 
jurisdiction beyond the 200-mile limit out to the nose and tail of the 
bank, which was not ours by accident of geography, is now in effect 
ours. Bill C-29 was passed in the House last year very quickly with 
the unanimous support of all parties, passed quickly by the Senate 
and subsequently recognized in the United Nations as being right, 
valid and proper.
<P>
	One other thing the bill does is develop a new approach to 
managing the oceans and their resources. In that regard I want to 
pick one example. On the east coast of Newfoundland, Memorial 
University has what is considered by all those in the field of 
oceanography and marine sciences not just in Canada, not just in 
North America but throughout the world as being truly a centre of 
excellence.
<P>
	It has scientific laboratories. It has the venue, the Logy Bay 
Research Station, the sea tunnel to test various sea foils, excellence 
again not just in Canada but throughout the world. It is one of the 
few resources of that nature that exists. It contains the pilotage 
training simulator which I had the opportunity, with some of the 
members of the defence committee, to witness. Certainly the 
reality factor was so high that one would find it difficult not 
believing one was not at sea.
<P>
	These are a few examples of the elements of the Centres of 
Excellence that exist at Memorial University in St. John's, 
Newfoundland. I am very proud to have been associated with that 
over the years with some of my other colleagues and would 
hopefully continue to do so.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I want to address another aspect of this which is under the 
purview of ocean management and is certainly very much 
involved. This has to do with a statement made earlier by the 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster, I think half in jest but I 
know with an element of seriousness. Because of that I felt 
constrained to respond to the concerns he raised in all seriousness.
<P>
	I remind the House that in 1992 the cod fishery, after a bad year 
in 1991 because of ice that persisted all year, essentially had to be 
declared a failure. The previous government implemented a 
program called the northern cod assistance and recovery program 
to last for two years from 1992 with the hope that the northern cod 
stock would return. Regrettably, as we all know in the House, this 
has not happened.
<P>
	This is a matter of fact. It is generally not known that the 
previous government-I make this point to make another 
point-had made no allowance for a replacement for that program 
in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15061"> 15061 </A></B>
<P>
event the northern cod had not  recovered and said so. The minister 
of the day in St. John's indicated to the <I>Evening Telegram</I> that the 
government could not really be expected to continue to provide the 
kind of compensation that was involved should the NCARP 
program not succeed.
<P>
	When we became government we found that the budget and the 
books did not account for any money in the program to look after 
the failure of that program should the northern code not return. It 
was through the compassion of this government and the work of 
many of us in Atlantic Canada, spearheaded by the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and many of his colleagues in cabinet that 
only new money was found in the first budget: $1.9 billion for the 
Atlantic strategy program, TAGS, as it is referred to. That program 
is not a perfect program but there are 39,000 people who depend on 
TAGS in the hopes the cod fishery will return.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The program is a failure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just heard the hon. member repeat 
himself. I am glad he did because members of his party have stood 
up in the House and suggested this program is no good and it 
should be scrapped.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> The Reform Party?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> The Reform Party. Reform Party members have 
actually stood in this House and said that program should be 
scrapped. The only thing I have to say to the hon. member or other 
hon. members from that side of the House is if they believe this 
should be the case and they want to revisit Atlantic Canada I 
suggest they be really up front with Atlantic Canadians and make 
the point they are making here, that they do not agree with the 
TAGS program and that it should be scrapped.
<P>
	I have another concern as an Atlantic Canadian which is related 
to oceans policy because it is related to the well-being of Atlantic 
Canadians: the Reform Party's attitude toward the regional 
program that we rely on so heavily, the ACOA program. Again, 
members of the other party-I am not sure about the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster-have been very vociferous in saying 
that we should scrap the ACOA program while naming some of the 
people that have benefited. What audacity.
<P>
	I can give two examples of successes in my riding. For one 
example I have to quote the name and for the second example my 
constituent would prefer that I do not use his name but he will 
recognize the business of which I speak.
<P>
	The White Hills in Clarenville is a world class skiing resort. 
Through the negotiation of $2.9 million, mostly ACOA money, it 
has been able to do with the resort what would not have been 
possible thereby bringing many people, not just from 
Newfoundland but from eastern Canada, St. Pierre et Miquelon to 
come visit that area and to spread their money in the distribution 
centre of Clarenville, thereby benefiting from it.
<P>
	Second, I have a young man in my riding who without 
government help established a lumber business not many years 
ago. Through recent assistance by ACOA of not much money, he 
was able to develop the new piece of equipment which allowed him 
to export three times what he was exporting without this ACOA 
grant.
<P>
	I do not need any lectures from the Reform Party about what we 
should be doing for Atlantic Canadians. One of the things that we 
are doing for Atlantic Canadians includes those factors which are 
contained in Bill C-98, oceans management.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Instead of decrying members on this side and decrying the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and his colleagues for trying to 
use of these programs beneficially through consolidation and more 
effective measures, they should be getting on their feet to 
congratulate them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise to speak to the bill and to the issues raised by the 
hon. member who just spoke. He was talking about the supposed 
benefits of the ACOA program, more government subsidies and so 
on.
<P>
	I should like to tell the hon. member what I discovered in my 
recent trip to the Atlantic provinces and what some of the 
fishermen are saying. I do not claim it was an exhaustive trip, but I 
did find interesting some of the things they mentioned about the 
efforts that should be made by the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans to decentralize and to provide a better service to fishermen.
<P>
	When I was in Antigonish they told me that a few short years ago 
they had two employees of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
who took the time to deliver tags for their lobster traps right to their 
boats. Now there are 37 employees working out of some office and 
the fishermen have to go to Halifax to get their tags. This is not a 
streamlining of services. This is not a slimmed down bureaucracy. 
If the minister were keen on providing a better service at a better 
price and more cost efficiently, there would be widespread support.
<P>
	The reason there is so much cynicism about the bill as one step 
of many similar steps is that the bureaucracy continues to increase 
and service continues to go down. Fishermen on the west coast and 
on the east coast are having difficulty finding a DFO person on the 
enforcement side in the field. Yet there are many people who seem 
to be stuck in an office and not providing services.
<P>
	User fees will be allowed under the bill. The fishermen are 
saying that they do not mind paying user fees for the government 
services they use. However the government, not just in this 
department but in other departments too, continues to expand the 
requirements placed on the backs of fishermen, farmers and 
business people. The government continues to expand and charge 
the people. In other words it becomes a user pay bureaucracy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15062"> 15062 </A></B>
<P>
	The businesses have no say in what services are provided. The 
government continues to throw more people and more money at 
a problem and then doubles the fees. It is not a user fee for a finite 
service. It is just: ``Let us tax these poor guys, call it a user fee 
or a licence fee, jack them up and see if they go out of business''.
<P>
	If the government were sincere about helping out Atlantic 
Canadians and British Columbia fishermen with the Fisheries Act 
there are a couple of things it could do. It could provide services in 
the field.
<P>
	I have an article from the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> about the DFO. It states 
that John Fraser's report on the Fraser River sockeye indicated that 
the DFO nearly destroyed the salmon fishery in British Columbia 
last year through mismanagement and a shocking lack of 
enforcement.
<P>
	If the government wants to re-establish some credibility with 
west coast fishermen at all levels, whether sports, aboriginal or 
commercial fishermen, it would have some enforcement people in 
the field to make sure the rules are enforced. It has no credibility on 
the west coast.
<P>
	On the east coast it is a similar problem. Through successive 
years of federal government mismanagement it has managed to 
pretty well destroy certain parts of that valuable fishery. The people 
on the east coast do not run around saying: ``Thank you, Mr. Tobin, 
for the turbot'', even though we are all glad that the pillaging of 
that resource is not going on any longer.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	What they are really saying is thanks to the federal government 
for destroying what used to be one of the backbones of the 
Canadian economy and still is, through no help from the federal 
government, an important part of a maritimer's life.
<P>
	If the government wanted to help it could get off the backs and 
out of the pockets of fishermen and let them get on with life. It is 
not only fishermen when we talk about ACOA grants. I heard a 
member from the maritimes make a statement the other day: 
``Thank goodness for regional development grants. They are the 
way to prosperity. We will get more regional grants''.
<P>
	If that were the case the maritime provinces would be the most 
prosperous provinces in the world. The trouble is the government 
has not yet caught on to the basic economic fact of what is best to 
promote business, to promote diversity and to promote fellows like 
the hon. member was mentioning who want to export around the 
world. We should say to that person: ``Listen, I will offer you low 
tax rates because I am not wasting your money. I will offer you less 
government regulations so that you can have a chance to put a 
business together easily. I will make sure that the Department of 
the Environment does not take three years to do a study  when you 
want to start a mine and that there will be rapid approval 
processes''.
<P>
	Why not co-ordinate with the provincial governments so it is not 
overlapped and driven from Ottawa instead of being driven from 
the provinces where it should be? Then perhaps those people would 
have a chance to diversify, to get out in the world and do what they 
want to do? They used to be able to do it before the federal 
government stepped in and started kicking butt. If it would allow 
people in the maritime provinces to exert their free enterprise 
spirit, to go back to the roots that made them strong and the most 
vibrant part of Canada at that time, we would see a prosperous 
maritimes.
<P>
	If we continue with expanding ACOA, giving more grants and 
having a bureaucracy in the DFO that will not even deliver the tags 
but will sit back and ask for more user fees, it is hopeless. The 
government seems to have lost its sense of direction.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider

	He said: Mr. Speaker, on June 5, I had the pleasure of speaking to 
Motion M-292 tabled by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Timiskaming-French River, which dealt with mining incentives 
to help the industry replenish its ore reserves quickly enough.
<P>
	Without consulting each other, my colleague and I tabled in this

stakeholders urging the government and the Minister of Finance to 
analyze all possible scenarios and to adopt a policy to revitalize 
mining exploration.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order and 
apologize for interrupting my colleague who is speaking on his 
private member's motion. However, I wanted to clarify that the 
deferral of the vote is to 6 p.m. on Monday.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is so noted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the message I wish to convey 
today through this motion, which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider 
revitalizing investment in exploration in Canada and in Quebec by providing 
for fiscal incentives, including flow-through shares.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have noted for a long time how little mining exploration is 
done in both Quebec and Canada. Therefore, we must act quickly to 
revitalize mining exploration throughout this country in order to 
replenish ore reserves in this industry. This situation is mainly due 
to the fact that junior mining companies, which underpin mining 
exploration, cannot raise enough public funds to carry out their 
exploration work, while major companies, which have the money 
needed for exploration, spend an increasingly important part of 
their exploration budget in developing countries.
<P>
	The advantage is that those countries already have listed minable 
sites, while Canada offers few new deposits ready for mining. I 
remind the House that the committee on natural resources held 
hearings on this matter last fall and made nine recommendations 
that were supported by all the parties represented on this 
committee.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government decided to disregard all the work 
done by the committee and all the evidence we heard there.  That is 
how this government operates. It has given the fifth report of the 
committee entitled ``Lifting Canadian Mining Off the Rocks'' the 
following response: ``Keeping Canadian Mining on the Rocks''.
<P>
	I doubt that, by rejecting almost all of the recommendations in 
this report, the ministers, both of finance and of natural resources, 
were really aware of the true effect of their decisions on mining 
exploration in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	All the stakeholders in mining exploration are disappointed that 
this government did not agree with any of their recommendations, 
that were based on their expertise and knowledge of mining. I 
would like to remind the government that more than a quarter of 
Canadian trade is based on the natural resource sector and that it is 
time that the government saw the mining industry as an important 
means of ensuring economic development in our society by 
achieving the national priorities, which are, according to the 
Liberal government, employment and growth.
<P>
	Mines that will be closing in a few years as a result of the 
depletion of their reserves will not be replaced if new sites are not 
discovered. This will cause major layoffs and will have a very 
negative impact on the Canadian economy, especially in mining 
regions, where metal processing, transportation and other 
infrastructures will be hard hit.
<P>
	An immediate response is needed if we are to reverse this trend 
by the year 2000, since it takes five to seven years on average 
between the discovery of a mine and start up of production. Failing 
this, the industry will gradually disappear. Renewal of the reserves 
is urgently needed; the mining industry is facing one of the hardest 
challenges it has had to deal with in many years.
<P>
	As a result of the shift of mining investment to other countries, 
Canada's known mineral reserves have decreased. In 1992, 28 
mines closed and only 8 opened. There are many reasons for this, 
but the trend must be reversed or the industry will be totally gone 
within twenty years.
<P>
	Base metal reserves have been decreasing since 1980 and are 
unlikely to be replaced at an adequate rate in the near future. The 
industry has done its part. On numerous occasions it has voiced its 
concerns to the Government of Canada, which rather than 
facilitating the process of adapting to the new international 
competition, particularly from third world countries, has in fact 
added to the problems by allowing the investment climate in the 
mining sector to deteriorate compared to the competition.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15064"> 15064 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The industry is working hard to ensure its survival. The 
economic and political context has not kept pace in order to 
encourage the industry to remain in Canada. Declining mining 
investments in our country are linked to a number of growing 
concerns.
<P>
	To name but a few of those concerns: heavy financial burdens, 
compared to the countries of the south of course, particularly taxes 
and charges unrelated to profits; uncertainty and delays in 
environmental assessment and approval procedures; regulatory 
overlap between levels of government and between departments, 
creating needless difficulties; reduced access; uncertainty about 
tenure of mineral titles; and lastly, increased financial requirements 
to guarantee restoration.
<P>
	For there to be any recovery in the mining industry, an incentive 
plan must be promoted for mining exploration in Canada, similar 
but better controlled than the one in place in the 1980s.
<P>
	Even if base metal reserves are in decline, there is still immense 
geological potential in Canada, Quebec in particular. The recent 
opening of the Louvicourt Mine in my riding confirms the potential 
of the mining industry in Quebec and Abitibi and the expertise of 
those who discovered, developed and financed the mine and those 
who now operate it.
<P>
	It also confirms that governments were right to create the 
flow-through share system, which helped to finance the initial 
exploration work leading to the discovery of the mine in 1989.
<P>
	This particular mine, with $300 million invested to bring it to the 
production stage, will provide more than 350 direct jobs for the 
next fifteen years at least. It is the result of a joint effort during the 
eighties by the federal and Quebec governments to encourage 
mineral exploration on sites of former mines that were no longer in 
production and thus deemed unlikely to have sufficient potential as 
a source of major new discoveries.
<P>
	New technologies and adequate funding were instrumental in 
discovering this copper, zinc, gold and silver mine, whose mineral 
extraction capacity is assessed at 4,000 tonnes per day, while recent 
finds near the site may extend the lifespan of this mine to 25 years. 
Its potential classifies Louvicourt as a world class mine.
<P>
	Three more major projects will start up in my region in the next 
two years, thanks to the same flow-through shares from the 
eighties, and I am referring to the Grevet, Raglan and Troilus 
projects. Raglan in northern Quebec is becoming the largest 
potential site for copper ore in Canada.
<P>
	The role of mineral exploration is to find other Louvicourts or 
Raglans. The average lifespan of a mine is about 11 years, and 
since it takes between five and ten years from the discovery of a 
mine to the production  stage, we must start today to find the mines 
of the year 2000.
<P>
	Many world class mines remain to be discovered in Quebec. 
This is clear from the examples I just mentioned. Only a small 
portion of Quebec's territory has been developed, and we could 
discover mines of this calibre, in practically any mining region in 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	We have the human and technological resources to make further 
discoveries. For some years, however, the amount of exploration 
has been insufficient to renew mineral reserves because of 
competition from those same Third World countries and 
insufficient levels of public funding. The discovery of new mines is 
synonymous with economic development.
<P>
	Louvicourt and Raglan are a clear indication that the federal 
government should increase tax incentives, already provided by the 
Quebec government, for preliminary mineral exploration in order 
to replace base metal reserves which are running out in this 
country.
<P>
	The lack of mineral exploration in Canada is particularly 
disturbing, considering the general uncertainty as to Canada's 
commitment to encouraging mineral exploration and mining 
operations within its territory.
<P>
	The uncertainty rises from the fact that regulations for access to 
sites are becoming increasingly restrictive, while environmental 
regulations or criteria are subject to duplication or diverging 
interpretations. In addition, obtaining an operating permit has 
become an increasingly lengthy process.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Exploration companies can no longer be sure that their 
exploration rights automatically include mining rights. The 
impression is that they have the right to engage in exploration, but 
until they have spent millions of dollars to identify an 
economically viable ore body, they do not know whether they will 
be able to extract ore and under what conditions.
<P>
	In this context, there are three ways in which we could deal with 
the problem: re-establish public financing of mining exploration; 
improve the efficiency of exploration and make Canada more 
attractive to investors in the mining sector by improving fiscal, 
environmental and access regulations.
<P>
	The flow-through share system has shown over the years that, at 
least in Quebec, it has made a significant contribution to the 
discovery of a number of mines. If we consider the 26 base metal or 
precious metal mines that were in production in Quebec in 1994, 
flow-through shares were either entirely or partly responsible for 
financing the discovery of 14 of these mines. Still in the case of 
base or precious metals, this applies to the discovery of nine out of 
ten mining projects now in the development or pre-production 
stage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15065"> 15065 </A></B>
<P>
	Considering these discoveries, the flow-through share system 
has shown it is worthwhile for governments, since it generates 
major economic spinoffs.
<P>
	Already in September 1982, a report on the Canadian mineral 
industry identified five areas of urgency requiring immediate 
government intervention; there was urgency then, they said. They 
were: preventing further erosion of Canada's economic 
competitiveness in certain key areas of mineral production, 
including those of copper and nickel; halting and reversing the 
depletion of mineral reserves; finding new ideas and developing 
technologies, policies and programs to encourage greater 
efficiency in mining exploration; reversing the apparent trend of 
mining investors, including Canadian multinationals, to drop 
Canada in favour of countries in Latin America, Asia or the Pacific 
and other areas of development in the world where resources are 
plentiful; and, finally, generally creating a political and regulatory 
context better suited to maintain industry viability and stimulate 
investment in mining exploration.
<P>
	After 13 years of work by various committees on natural 
resources and others and with similar conclusions for problems 
which do not seem to have been resolved and after two federal 
governments, we are at practically the same point, hence the 
urgency and the need to act.
<P>
	If Canada remains at the forefront in the metals market, it is due 
to the low cost of its mining operations attibutable in large measure 
to the high level of industry productivity.
<P>
	The Canadian mineral industry therefore managed to increase its 
productivity significantly through the rationalization necessitated 
by the recession in the 1980s.
<P>
	All of the sectors of the mining industry have significantly 
increased their productivity by adopting new technologies and 
mining methods, developed, for the most part, in Canada.
<P>
	We must therefore support the industry's effort so as to avoid a 
decline in mine reserves and prepare new deposits for mining to 
replace those that will eventually be used up.
<P>
	For many years, the Association des prospecteurs du Québec has 
been calling in vain for three measures that would promote mining 
exploration: extension of the expenditure period to 12 months in 
the year following the year in which the equity was raised and 
harmonization by Ottawa; a federal measure whereby only the 
capital gain over and above the net purchase cost would be taxable, 
something the PDAC is also calling for-Quebec already has a 
similar measure-; and greater deductibility of exploration 
expenses federally-the rate is currently 100 per cent federally and 
175 per cent in Quebec.
<P>
	Carrying part of work funded in one year over to the next would 
not mean any additional expense to the public purse.
<P>
	To administer this measure, the Association des prospecteurs du 
Québec proposes a trust mechanism under a mandate conferred by 
the governments on private sector organizations, which would 
ensure technical and financial expenditures were justified. The 
users would pay the costs of the trust.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I have just given a long list of measures which would assist the 
mining industry and which would meet the demands of various 
groups. Not all are easy to implement in these times of severe 
government cutbacks.
<P>
	However, a large number of them would not cost the public 
anything and could be very profitable in the medium run. The 
government must learn to distinguish between measures which 
involve expenditures and measures which yield dividends for the 
public purse.
<P>
	It is essential to restore a climate conducive to mining 
investment in Canada and in Quebec. According to Natural 
Resources Canada, data dating back to June 1994 indicate that 
Canada's investment in exploration barely reaches 17 per cent of 
world spending in that field, while it was 23 per cent in 1991. We 
have good grounds to believe that within five years, if nothing is 
done to create a favourable climate for mining investment in 
Canada, this figure could drop to 10 per cent.
<P>
	Such data clearly suggest that Canada must do something fast to 
reverse this trend. The various levels of government will have to 
work together to improve fiscal and environmental regulations, as 
well as regulations governing access to land for the mining 
exploration industry.
<P>
	The mining industry can still contribute to the economic 
development of a country, as many South American countries 
which rely on the expertise and the financing of Canada to develop 
their economies have discovered. They know how to attract mining 
and exploration companies.
<P>
	The present outflow of exploration funds and the selling of our 
expertise to foreign countries will lead, in Canada in the years to 
come, to a reduction of employment in the mining industry and in 
associated industries like transportation, and therefore to a 
reduction of the share of the mining sector in the Canadian GNP.
<P>
	I hope that the measures I just proposed, as well as those 
proposed by the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources will be considered and implemented as soon as 
possible. In Canada and Quebec, we have the mining potential, the 
technical know-how and the money to allow our mining industry to 
increase its economic contribution, but the government has to be 
willing to do its part.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I  would like to address 
the House concerning this motion that the government should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15066"> 15066 </A></B>
<P>
consider revitalizing investment in mining exploration in Canada 
by providing fiscal incentives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me begin by thanking the hon. member for Abitibi for 
bringing this matter before the House. The Government of Canada 
acknowledges that it is important for all Canadians to recognize 
that mining will continue to be a key sector of the Canadian 
economy for generations to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On behalf of the Minister of Natural Resources, I am pleased to 
have this opportunity to be able to tell the House about the 
measures that the government is presently taking to maintain or 
increase the economic and social benefits Canadians derive from 
the mineral and mining exploration sectors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mining directly contributes $20 billion to the national economy 
every year and creates more than 300,000 jobs for some 115 
communities throughout Canada. It has significant benefits in 
almost every other sector of our economy. How many Canadians 
know, for example, that toothpaste has five minerals in it or that 
sunscreen contains zinc? How many Canadians think of the mining 
industry when they add salt to their food or when they switch on 
their computers or start their cars?
<P>
	Simply put, without mining and minerals many of the things we 
take for granted today would not exist. The World Bank recently 
released a new report ranking all countries on the basis of total 
wealth. That report ranked Canada as the second wealthiest nation 
in the world when taking into account our vast natural resources.
<P>
	Mineral exploration is fundamental to a healthy mining sector. 
We are witnessing a significant improvement in the fortunes of the 
Canadian mining industry, thanks in part to recent increases in 
spending on mineral exploration. Total exploration expenditures 
for 1994 were $630 million. This total represents an increase of 
$150 million, or 32 per cent compared to exploration expenditures 
in 1993. Moreover, the favourable trend is continuing, and 
spending could approach $675 million in the current year.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The amount of flow through share financing to support mineral 
exploration in Canada has been on the rise since 1991, when it 
totalled $40 million. This indicates the increasingly positive 
prospects for the mining industry in Canada. Flow through shares 
financing totalled $80 million in 1994 and is projected to be 
between $80 million and $90 million this year.
<P>
	There are other facts that demonstrate a turnaround for the 
industry. This year it is expected that 14 new  mines will be opened 
and that 11 mines will be reopened, representing a net gain of some 
700 new jobs. This year could be one of the best years for mining 
since 1981 in terms of mine openings. Preliminary data indicates 
the outlook for 1996 may be even brighter. In addition, figures 
concerning Canada's base metal reserves have been increasing 
recently. The Voisey Bay nickel discovery in Labrador has been 
cited as one of the world's richest. There has been tremendous 
interest and investment in diamond exploration activities. These 
are just a few of the highlights of healthy recent activity by the 
industry that is stimulating a number of benefits and jobs in 
particular.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the role of the federal government in the 
mining and minerals sector. The Government of Canada made 
some very difficult choices in the budget, which were made for the 
benefit of the country in the long term and did not include any new 
tax incentives for any sector of the Canadian economy, including 
mining.
<P>
	Although we cannot afford any new incentive programs, Canada 
is still one of the most generous countries in the world when it 
comes to encouraging mining exploration activities. At the federal 
level all exploration and preproduction development expenses are 
fully deductible. In recognition of the special needs and risks of 
resource development, the flow through share financing instrument 
allows those deductions to be transferred to individual investors.
<P>
	Provincial governments, as the resource owners, also have an 
important role to play in encouraging mineral exploration. Over the 
past few years a number of them have taken steps to promote 
exploration activities by introducing new tax incentives. Since the 
provinces have primary responsibility for determining the pace of 
activity within their jurisdictions, these steps are highly 
appropriate, in my view.
<P>
	We believe the mining industry has a strong future in Canada, 
but we are also aware the industry faces challenges. During the last 
federal election the Liberal Party was the only political party to 
release a detailed plan outlining its commitment to the mining 
industry. That commitment still stands.
<P>
	Working closely with the provinces, we will continue to support 
and encourage the mining sector in Quebec and in every other 
province and territory across Canada. One of the best ways to do 
this is to reduce the long term structural impediment to mineral 
investment. Many of these impediments were identified by the 
Whitehorse mining initiative, an unprecedented multi-stakeholder 
initiative that led to a common vision for Canada's mining industry 
through shared principles and goals. The federal government was a 
full participant in this 18-month exercise.
<P>
	To help develop an action plan to address the Whitehorse Mining 
Initiative issues that fell within federal jurisdiction, the Minister of 
Natural Resources has established an advisory committee 
composed of  representatives from the mining industry, labour, 
aborigi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15067"> 15067 </A></B>
<P>
nal and environmental groups. One of the committee's first tasks 
will be to provide commentary and advice on the sustainable 
development and minerals metals issues paper that was released for 
discussion in September in Vancouver.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has already taken several steps to 
address the most fundamental industry concerns. For example, in 
the 1994 budget we introduced a deduction for mine reclamation 
trust fund contributions. In ``Building a More Innovative 
Economy'', our government-wide plan for economic growth and 
job creation, we identified six major sectors of the economy that 
will benefit from substantive long term improvements to the 
federal regulatory regime. One of the six sectors is the Canadian 
mining industry.
<P>
	Mining sector areas under active consideration include changes 
to the administration of the Fisheries Act, land use and related 
decision making, the definition of waste, regulatory regimes north 
of 60, regulatory impact analysis, and toxic management. As well, 
important improvements on the issues of overlap and duplication 
may be achieved through the harmonization initiative of the 
Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	We believe that the less costly and more efficient regulatory 
regime that we are trying to achieve will lead to an improved 
investment climate that is respectful of sustainable development 
principles. I emphasize our commitment to environmental 
protection will not be compromised.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is already making an effective 
contribution to improve the conditions that are required to ensure 
that exploration activity will continue to rise in this country. The 
harmonization of environmental assessment regimes between 
federal and provincial orders of government and regulatory reform 
measures through the ``Building a More Innovative Economy'' 
initiatives are real and meaningful efforts to reduce overlap and 
duplication. The goal is to provide stable and predictable 
conditions that will attract more investment for mineral exploration 
and for economic activity throughout Canada. The result is that this 
activity will stimulate new opportunities in Canada and help to put 
more Canadians back to work.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is confident that the prospects for 
mining in Canada will continue to improve and that mining will 
realize the full potential of Canada's rich geology in a manner that 
is consistent with the principles of sustainable development. As a 
result Canadians will be able to enjoy the many benefits that come 
from a strong mining industry for many generations to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to follow the parliamentary secretary. Obviously there is 
no time for a major intercession.
<P>
	I find it interesting that one of the other initiatives of the federal 
government in response to how to keep mining off the rocks was 
that the standing committee made about 20 recommendations last 
year that an all-party committee agreed would help to spur on the 
mining industry within Canada, and the government chose to 
ignore every single one. They were good words, but I do not think 
there is a lot of proof in the pudding.
<P>
	We are here to address the motion of the hon. member for 
Abitibi:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider 
revitalizing investment in exploration in Canada and in Quebec by providing 
for fiscal incentives, including flow through shares.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In my capacity as the party critic for natural resources, it is a 
privilege to speak to this issue.
<P>
	Flow through shares are one way to subsidize industry. They cost 
the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a few years ago, with 
only a very few positive results.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have called for a reduction in 
government subsidies to business. We feel that if it is in the 
market's interest to explore for more oil, gas, diamonds, coal, or 
whatever it is, the market will marshal the funds necessary to go 
ahead and do the exploration.
<P>
	What is the role of the federal government in this regard? Does it 
have a role? I believe it does. It remains for the federal government 
to provide a regulatory regime for industry that clears the way for 
industry to go ahead with sustainable development.
<P>
	I will clarify what I mean by sustainable development. 
Development means we want to develop our natural resources. It 
does not mean preservation; it means sustainable development. 
Development is a key word. Canadians depend on natural resources 
for a huge proportion of our jobs, our income, and our standard of 
living. Sustainable means we want to continue to develop them for 
decades to come, and in order to do that we have to deal very 
carefully with our environment. This requires a balance between 
the two.
<P>
	A Price Waterhouse study released yesterday dealing with 
British Columbia's forest practices code illustrates how this 
balance is faring in Canada. Enforcing the new code will cost the 
economy 46,000 jobs in British Columbia. This shows that Canada 
is losing its balance when it comes to sustainability versus 
development.
<P>
	In our concern for sustainability, I believe we are bordering on 
hysteria and catering to preservationists instead of people 
concerned with sustainable development. We are stifling 
development 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15068"> 15068 </A></B>
<P>
in our country. This is not the intention of the concept of 
sustainable development.
<P>
	I met yesterday with representatives of the mining association 
and listened to the problems they are encountering in their industry. 
I will give the House one example. They told me that mining 
companies are warned before any exploration takes place that 
federal environmental regulators will take a minimum of three 
years to approve their application for a mine. Instead of getting one 
permit for one mine, a company must go to every federal and 
provincial department, official, and bureaucrat in North America to 
get separate permits to develop what should be a straightforward 
process. This all takes a minimum of three years. In other countries 
the same process takes half that time.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Is it any wonder that the mining companies I am familiar with, 
especially in the British Columbia area, have put so many of their 
resources into Chile and other countries where they have friendlier 
and more receptive governments?
<P>
	The old way of doing business was to assist companies by 
subsidizing them. Subsidies insulated companies from the market. 
In the case of flow through shares, in some cases they caused 
exploration to take place where that was costly, unnecessary, and 
unproductive. This is what the Department of Finance said in its 
report on the subject in October 1994.
<P>
	The new way of doing business is to encourage development in 
an environmentally sustainable way. That requires balance between 
our concern for the environment on the one hand and our desire and 
necessity to explore and develop our resources for the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	If sectors of the industry are suffering in Canada, it is not the 
fault of the federal government for not subsidizing it. The fault lies 
in a regulatory regime, at least partially, that needs streamlining 
and co-ordination between different federal and provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	The second thing we need, and I do not want to elaborate on this 
too much, is a tax regime in Canada that is competitive with other 
nations. We also need, and this is very important, to resolve our 
disagreements over land use and tenure. We need to resolve that 
with our aboriginal people so we can move forward and establish 
stable environmental standards, land use standards, and a tax 
regime that is predictable so that mining companies feel 
comfortable and confident of investing in our Canadian future.
<P>
	How many times have we heard industry say that if you just get 
off my back as far as taxes go, get out of my hair as far as 
regulations and unnecessary duplication go, I will create jobs and 
opportunities in this country that will make your head spin. We 
hear that time and again. They do not need or want a subsidy.
<P>
	I am surprised and I might almost say astonished that this 
particular motion would come from the member for Abitibi. Let me 
paraphrase what he says. He says he wants the federal government 
to pour money into subsidies for industry in Canada and in Quebec. 
I am surprised, because the member for Abitibi is a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois, which as we all know is a political party with only 
one purpose, and that is to destroy Canada as we know it by taking 
Quebec out of Confederation. It is even more astonishing since 
natural resources, by our own Constitution, is and should be in the 
purview of the provincial government. Not only that, but in the 
middle of his own campaign to destroy the federal government, the 
member stands up in the House and asks that the federal 
government subsidize more industry in Quebec.
<P>
	I hope the member understands that people from my riding are 
frustrated by this kind of behaviour. This is a good illustration of 
Quebec's separatist movement, which lives in a world of illusion, a 
fairy tale where one wants to enjoy the best of both worlds.
<P>
	The separatists have always been of two minds on the subject of 
independence. It reminds me of someone who wants to have his 
own place, his own car, his own life, but he wants his parents to pay 
for it.
<P>
	With a motion like the member has put forward, I wonder if the 
member is really a sovereignist at heart at all. If he really believed 
in independence he would be asking the federal government to get 
out of Quebec, not subsidize the industry there. Perhaps the 
member secretly depends on the family and he does not really want 
out of it; he just wants his own apartment.
<P>
	I believe that most Quebecers take a more mature view of life 
and of our country. They recognize that the Canadian house is big 
enough for the entire Canadian family to live together in happiness 
and prosperity.
<P>
	The Reform Party agrees with the member for Abitibi in calling 
for change. Change is necessary; we all recognize that. However, 
we are calling for a new Canada, not a separate nation of Quebec. 
We are calling for a new Canada, a Canada built on equality but a 
Canada with a smaller federal government role, not a larger one, 
where all regions can be satisfied with a less oppressive federal 
fiscal framework.
<P>
	I reiterate to the House and my constituents that I am anxious 
that Quebec remain an equal partner within Canada.
<P>
	Last spring I went down to Montreal. I caught one of the last 
games played in the old Montreal Forum. As we were wandering 
around in the old part of Montreal before the game and we were 
talking to people, they were very friendly. A couple of times people 
came up to me on the corner-I guess I obviously was looking for 
something at the time-and offered to help us out and give us 
directions and so on. I was very impressed. I  thought that was a 
typically Canadian thing to do. If you see somebody in trouble you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15069"> 15069 </A></B>
<P>
want to help out. In my travels and in talking to many people I have 
found that Canadians are basically the same everywhere.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The more I talk to francophones the more I realize they have the 
same goals and aspirations as people elsewhere in Canada. They 
want good jobs with good incomes, safe streets, a fair taxation 
system. They want less government bureaucracy in their lives. 
They want much the same things as people everywhere else. We 
share common values and interests. The language we speak is 
really of secondary importance to those major things.
<P>
	Language is a code. We can speak English or French. We can use 
Morse code or a computer language. We can do what we like in that 
area. It is just a method of communication. What is important is 
what we are communicating, the content of our communication, the 
core values we have regardless of the language we use.
<P>
	I believe that as Canadians we want to continue to communicate 
with one another. Quebecers have given their time and energy to 
building homes, industries, towns and cities that are among the best 
on the entire planet. During the world wars and in our peacekeeping 
duties they have spilled their own blood to carry Canadian values 
around the world. They see that Canada is the best place in the 
world in which to live. I am confident they are going to vote no on 
October 30.
<P>
	In closing, we do not support any motions that call for more 
subsidies. That is the old market distorting way of doing business. 
We would welcome a motion from the Bloc calling for a better 
balance between sustainability and development in Canada. That is 
supportable everywhere. Most of all, regardless of where we are in 
Canada, we invite Quebecers, including Bloc members, to join 
hands with Canadians, whether we are English Canadians, 
Japanese, Italian or of whatever descent to build a new and united 
Canada together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform member had a lot to say about the Bloc, but I just want 
to make a quick comment. He said that Quebecers are polite and 
that is true. We are extremely nice and polite and we know that.
<P>
	However, I do not agree with the member when he says that 
language is a secondary issue. Language is a reflection of one's 
culture on the North American continent, and it is certainly not a 
secondary issue for Quebecers.
<P>
	I cannot help but wonder: If language is a secondary issue for the 
member, that means he attaches little importance to us; 
consequently, why does he want us to remain part of Canada? The 
only true reason I can find is  of an economic nature. This is why 
we are important to western and atlantic provinces, and why they 
want us to remain part of Canada. I just figured out why they do not 
want us to become sovereign.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that natural resources are, for a 
future country like Quebec but also Canada, a very important 
economic tool.
<P>
	A country that has no natural resources or that does not pay 
proper attention to their development will, sooner or later, 
experience serious problems in the context of global competition.
<P>
	Of course, its economy will be seriously affected, but one must 
remember that a country's natural resources are an asset for the 
whole community, not only for some individuals or large 
corporations.
<P>
	Natural resources in both Quebec and in Canada belong to their 
respective communities. If they are developed for the well-being of 
the people, they are central to development.
<P>
	Not only do they create jobs, but they also greatly contribute to 
economic growth.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	When our raw materials are transformed here into finished 
products, they create a very important collective wealth. One must 
never forget that a job created in the natural resource sector has a 
multiplying effect on the whole economy, as long as we are not 
only raw material suppliers, as we have been too often in forestry. 
We ship wood from the Matapedia area to Montreal and Toronto, 
then finished wood products are shipped back to us.
<P>
	In the mining sector, the discovery of minable deposits, or 
exploration, is at the very beginning of this potential chain. But for 
that chain to be started, we should, as my colleague for Abitibi 
suggested, consider revitalizing investment in exploration in 
Canada, notably by providing for fiscal incentives, including 
flow-through shares. Quebec is a good example.
<P>
	To generate every possible benefit, natural resources 
development planning must be consistent and, surely, ongoing. It 
would be wrong to think that we can leave this to the private sector 
alone, as some trends of thought would have it. It is necessary for 
governments, through their tax system, and flow-through shares 
among other incentives, to foster investment in exploration. In 
Canada, over the past few decades, we have seen a clear decline in 
the exploration and the processing of our natural resources, 
particularly in mining. We are now making a fresh start. All the 
better.
<P>
	Several issues are at the root of the problems facing Quebec and 
all of Canada in this major sector of our economy. First and not the 
least is the constant fluctuation of the global markets, which is 
indeed a very sensitive issue. Sudden fluctuations of the world 
economy have greatly affected the development of our natural  
resources. When the prices of natural resources go up and down 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15070"> 15070 </A></B>
<P>
like in a roller coaster, massive investment in that industry does not 
seem very attractive.
<P>
	The other problem has to do, of course, with the general 
economic slowdown. When the demand is decreasing, exploration 
and transformation also slow down. Another important element is 
the inefficiency of exploration incentives. The current tax system is 
not in sync with the real objectives. We must change it, for example 
by providing flow-through shares.
<P>
	Most of the stakeholders in the mining industry we have met 
during the hearings of the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources agree that the current measures are not very efficient. 
Also, they do not meet their goal, which is to promote exploration 
and discovery of new deposits.
<P>
	Some stakeholders think that the current measures only reward 
the big corporations, who can unfortunately deduct part of their 
operating costs from their income tax. The inefficiency of current 
tax measures is only increased by all the red tape due to the federal 
government infringing upon an exclusively provincial area of 
jurisdiction, as enshrined in the constitution.
<P>
	Because of the lack of program co-ordination in this field as in 
many others, developers as well as producers waste a lot of time 
and energy. Having to go constantly from one level of government 
to the other to get authorizations, to ensure compliance with 
existing policies or to adjust to the different tax standards of each 
government, to try to understand and, especially, to make people 
understand is far from productive for businesses. This waste of 
time is reflected in substantial losses.
<P>
	In the Bloc Quebecois, we wish that once and for all the federal 
government would fully recognize the jurisdiction of Quebec and 
the other provinces over natural resources. We want Ottawa to give 
the provinces control over natural resources and to truly encourage 
investment in exploration through tax incentives such as the 
flow-through shares, for example, in co-operation with the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	I do not understand the federal government's attitude. Why is it 
trying so hard to take over resource management from Quebec and 
the other provinces? Why is it always sticking its nose in areas 
where it has no business? Why is it not working with the provinces 
instead of competing with them, and, moreover, using our money, 
our tax dollars to do so?
<P>
	Why is it not adjusting the federal tax system in co-operation 
with the provinces to make it more responsive to the real needs of 
the industry? This is what we want to know. Is it because, as certain 
federalist big guns have said, those of us from Quebec and the 
provinces are incapable of doing the work or simply of delivering?
<P>
	On the contrary, we, Quebecers, are perfectly capable of 
managing our own natural resources. Our social and political 
institutions have a long democratic tradition. Our people are well 
educated, and we can count on a multitude of workers capable of 
doing all the jobs in natural resource exploration and processing.
<P>
	We have very abundant natural resources. Over the years, 
Quebec has acquired the ability to act as it sees fit in organizing 
development, and its tax system strongly supports its industry.
<P>
	With the help of adjusted fiscal programs and so-called 
flow-through shares, Quebec has been able to further diversify its 
economy in areas such as culture, research and processing.
<P>
	Quebec has changed over the last thirty years, and we can no 
longer tolerate that our natural resources be practically given away, 
as was unfortunately the case in the past.
<P>
	Through our tax system, we have encouraged Quebecers to 
invest in their own province. The experience of the development of 
Northern Quebec has left indelible marks. Hopefully, we will never 
again see foreign industries shuut down towns and villages, and 
abandon entire regions. As Quebecers, our success in the area of 
natural resources certainly no longer depends on foreign investors 
or on federalism.
<P>
	On the contrary, our success is the result of our imagination, our 
initiative, our actions, our creativity, our decisions, our efforts and 
the desire of Quebecers to play an active role in their own 
economy.
<P>
	The tax measures introduced by successive Quebec governments 
have played a very important role, and all of Canada readily 
recognizes it.
<P>
	Moreover, these tax measures and our own successes have 
helped to reduce our dependency toward foreign investors. While 
in the rest of Canada, the federal government begged foreign 
investors to develop natural resources, we, in Quebec, took control 
of our destiny. At present, the French-speaking Quebecers control 
more than half of the industrial and commercial corporations in 
Quebec. This is remarkable. This is almost twice as much as 30 
years ago. In Canada, we see the opposite happening.
<P>
	During these 30 years, a growing number of Canadian owned 
companies have fallen into foreign investors hands. Any country 
that lets foreigners extract its natural resources is no longer a 
master in its own house.
<P>
	Finally, I know very well that all these requests I just made will 
not amount to much. Even if it would have us believe otherwise the 
present government is very centralizing.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15071"> 15071 </A></B>
<P>
	We of the Bloc Quebecois want our neighbour, Canada, to 
remain very strong, especially in the mining area, since it will be 
one of our economic partners after October 30.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, since no other member 
wants to speak and since the motion has not been declared a votable 
item, the hour provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until Monday at 11 a.m. I hope 
everyone has a good weekend.
