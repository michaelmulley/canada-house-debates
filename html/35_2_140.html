	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government's lack of political will in 
refusing to take positive action in its areas of jurisdiction to promote economic 
equality between women and men and cutting transfer payments to the provinces by 
$4.5 billion, including $1.3 billion to Quebec between 1996 and 1998; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, moreover, this House remind the government of the formal commitment it 
made on March 8, 1994, to take specific measures to improve the socio-economic 
status of women.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Laval East, each of us using 10 minutes. It is indeed a 
great pleasure for me to speak today on this motion. I would like to 
take this opportunity to say a few words about my vision of 
International Women's Day.
<P>
	Many hold the-in my opinion unfounded-belief that 
celebrating March 8 is unnecessary. Why a special day for women? 
I must say right off that this day is intended as a day of reflection. It 
is an opportunity for women of all backgrounds, walks of life and 
faiths to take stock and see not only how far we have come, but also 
how long a way we still have to go. This is both a day of celebration 
and a day for taking charge aimed at examining and improving the 
social, economic and professional status of women worldwide.
<P>
	Think that, not so long ago, women did not have the right to vote 
in Canada. But today, a number of us hold elected office at various 
levels of government. This is a step in the right direction, but there 
is still a long way to go.
<P>
	International Women's Day has its origins in women's demands 
for decent working conditions. The new realities  of the labour 
market, which are becoming the lot of a growing number of 
women, are best described by the words insecurity, instability, 
short term contracts and underpaid work.
<P>
	The social safety net that had ensured, so far, that women in both 
Quebec and Canada could keep their heads above water is under 
direct attack by the federal government, which, under the guise of 
restructuring, is in fact using social program funding to reduce its 
deficit. Thus, the government is the primary cause of increased 
poverty among women and children in Canada because, instead of 
closing tax loopholes, as requested time and time again in this 
House by the Bloc Quebecois over the past three years, the 
government chose to drastically reduce transfer payments to the 
provinces, restrict UI eligibility and cut benefits, not to mention 
downsizing, as it just did at Canada Post, by laying off an 
unprecedented number of employees, the majority of whom were 
women.
<P>
	I would like to quote a few statistics on women, poverty and 
employment. It is very important to acknowledge these statistics 
today, as this may be an annual review we are doing here. In 1994, 
70 per cent of all Canadians living in poverty were women or 
children; out of 4.8 million poor people, there were 2 million 
women and 1.3 million children. That is a lot of people. There are 
now 1.5 million children living in poverty, 200,000 more than 
when the Liberals took office. That is a clear setback.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	Of all the industrialized countries, Canada is the one where the 
proportion of women in low paying jobs is the highest, at 34.3 per 
cent, with the exception of Japan, which has a rate of 37.2 per cent.
<P>
	Let us look at more figures. Only 20 per cent of women have a 
full time job, throughout the year, for which they earn more than 
$30,000 per year, compared to 40 per cent of men.
<P>
	The vast majority of part time jobs are held by women. In 1994, 
69 per cent of all part time workers in Canada were women, a 
figure that has not varied much over the last two decades.
<P>
	Again in 1994, 1.6 million women, or 26 per cent of those who 
had a job, were part time workers, compared to only 9 per cent of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8766"> 8766 </A></B>
<P>
men holding a job. Moreover, an  increasing number of women are 
working part time because they cannot find a full time job.
<P>
	In 1994, over 500,000 women, that is 34 per cent of all women 
working part time, said they would like to have a full time job. The 
unemployment rate among certain groups of women is higher than 
the national average. For young women under 24 years of age, that 
rate stands at 15.6 per cent.
<P>
	Here are more figures. The majority of working women hold 
jobs that have traditionally been women's occupations. In 1994,60 per cent of all working women were teachers, nurses, or had a 
similar job in the health sector, were office workers, or were in 
sales and services. By comparison, 31 per cent of the working men 
had jobs in these areas.
<P>
	Statistics show that 57.3 per cent of single mothers with children 
under 18 are poor. Regardless of women's level of education, their 
earnings are lower than those of men. Even female university 
graduates working full time throughout the year only earned 75 per 
cent of what their male counterparts made in 1993.
<P>
	These statistics show that women are not moving forward, they 
are losing ground. Women are getting poorer year after year. 
Moreover, the number of jobs for women is decreasing. We also 
have to realize that, given the number of divorces and separations, 
there are more and more single mothers. These women find 
themselves in charge of a family, but without a job. Sure, they get 
support payments, but these are never enough to provide children 
with all they need for education, health, etc.
<P>
	We are therefore in the process of taking a net step backwards. It 
is unacceptable when we realize that today in 1997 after all the 
progress women have made, all the work done by women's groups, 
all the work done by unions, by all the groups working to advance 
the cause of women and develop job markets for women that, today 
in 1997, we are losing ground.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to remind you of the promises the 
Liberals made in the red book, and I will tell you what they were.
<P>
	The Liberals gave us universal health care, unemployment 
insurance, old age benefits, the guaranteed income supplement, the 
Canada Pension Plan, the Canada Assistance Plan, the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission and the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.
<P>
	The failure of the economic and social policies of the 
Conservatives is obvious: there are 1.6 million unemployed; 4.2 
million Canadians, including 1.2 million children, live in poverty; 
62 per cent of single mothers live under the poverty line, and their 
incomes are slipping.
<P>
	Since 1984, the Conservatives have systematically chipped away 
at the social safety net built up over the years.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	They have cut health care, and assistance to children, seniors and 
the unemployed by billions of dollars. They have encouraged the 
development of a two tier society that separates the rich and the 
poor, those with education and those without, with middle classes 
gradually disappearing. Most Canadians do not want this kind of 
country.
<P>
	It is well known that not nearly enough money is being spent on 
research into breast cancer, which affects one woman out of nine. 
Many single mothers would like to find work but, for lack of 
quality day care, must settle for welfare. They must rely on meagre 
welfare payments, food banks and inadequate housing. They 
cannot receive training or find jobs that would make them 
financially independent. If we look at the cuts made by the federal 
government in social housing alone, it is truly shocking.
<P>
	In conclusion, for I see I have used up all my time, I would like 
to mark this day. I would like to pay tribute to all the parliamentary 
women who are working today and who, I hope, will see, today, 
tomorrow and Sunday, in their various regions and fields of activity 
what remains to be done to advance the cause of women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for kicking off debate on this issue. I think it is a 
very important issue and there are some dimensions that I hope the 
member and other colleagues will raise in the debate because it is 
not just men and women and how they live in our country 
separately. The issue for me is how the family survives, men and 
women together raising children. Society as we know it would 
cease to exist without the family and without those children.
<P>
	A report from the Vanier Institute on the Family stated that there 
is one divorce for every two marriages in Canada, according to the 
latest statistics; a 50 per cent divorce rate in Canada.
<P>
	In addition, the member would know that 23 per cent of all 
families in Canada are lone parent families. I want to make sure the 
member hears this; lone parent families, not single mother 
families. That 23 per cent of lone parent families account for 46 per 
cent to 53 per cent, depending on the research, of children living in 
poverty.
<P>
	In my view, a significant portion of the member's argument has 
ignored the fact that the crisis of the family in Canada, particularly 
the breakdown of the traditional nuclear family, has been a major 
contributor to the poverty of women in Canada. Half the marriages 
break down and the vast majority of arrangements give custody of 
children to the women and in any family breakdown if  both 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8767"> 8767 </A></B>
<P>
parents' income stays the same that is going to result in poverty for 
no other reason other than there is a second residence and second 
living costs.
<P>
	Does the member not believe that the crisis of the family in 
Canada, the breakdown of the family, is a major consideration in 
terms of dealing with the issue of economic independence of 
women?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understood the Liberal member 
properly, he was telling me that women are to blame for divorce. 
Divorce is very common these days, and women and children are 
the ones who pay the price when there is a divorce.
<P>
	Who looks after the children? The women who become single 
parents. They often do not even have any support payments 
because the husbands disappear into the woodwork and they cannot 
manage to get any help from them in raising their children. I am not 
saying that everyone is in the same boat here, but there are many 
women who are forced to clothe and feed their children, finance 
their educations, help them get as far ahead in the world as 
possible. We see this every day in our ridings. And if there are 
divorces, this is a choice. A divorce is a choice made by a couple to 
live apart. People cannot be forced to live together.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	I have already spoken to my hon. colleague on this, because I 
was so angry at this idea of wanting to force people to stay together 
for the sake of the children. Children would not be any happier 
living with parents who detest each other, who would happily tear 
each other's eyes out, than living in a divorced family. It is far 
healthier for them to grow up with parents who, although divorced, 
are rebuilding their lives and see eye to eye about their education, 
their diet, their health and so on. Women's situation is, therefore, 
precarious. We need to open our eyes.
<P>
	I referred to social housing. The federal government has 
completely cut funding to social housing. Today, social housing is 
being cut back more and more, and the problem is being dumped 
onto the provinces. Today, we find women living in run-down and 
poorly heated housing. Is this any good for their health and the 
health of their children? Really, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Something has to be done somewhere, then. This government is 
responsible for some of the actions that have been taken in the past 
three and a half years, and today is the ideal time, perhaps, to wake 
up to reality and to make the necessary changes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
International Women's Day is celebrated annually in many ways. 
For women, it is a time to consider what they have achieved, which 
has been significant over the years, especially thanks to the battles 
they have fought.
<P>
	It is also a time to consider what remains to be done, and in this 
respect, the figures show that although women in our country now 
have equal rights, they still have a long way to go in terms of equal 
opportunities.
<P>
	Earlier, the hon. member for Laurentides mentioned a few 
statistics that were self-explanatory, and I think they bear repeating 
again and again. I am referring to the fact the battle is not won, that 
women are still poorer than men and more vulnerable when the 
economy falters, and that governments are letting this situation 
continue.
<P>
	These issues were again in the news this week when the Canada 
Labour Congress released a study that concluded that women's 
equality is a myth. According to the study released on Wednesday, 
only 20 per cent of Canadian and Quebec women have a full-time, 
steady job which pays about $30,000 annually, compared with40 per cent of the men. Of all industrialized countries in the OECD, 
Canada, after Japan, has the highest percentage of women in low 
paying jobs. Women have less than 20 per cent of the highest 
paying jobs and more than 70 per cent of the lowest paying jobs.
<P>
	The unemployment rate is incredibly high among many groups 
of women. Among young women under 24, it is 15.6 per cent. 
Among women who are members of a visible minority, 13.4 per 
cent. Among native women, 17.7 per cent. And among women with 
a disability, 16.6 per cent.
<P>
	In less than 20 years, the number of part-time female workers 
has increased 200 per cent. During this period, women represented 
70 per cent of the part-time labour force. More than one third of the 
women employed in part-time jobs would prefer to work full-time 
but can only find part-time employment. That is one of the reasons 
why they are severely penalized by employment insurance reform. 
So, one job out of ten is now temporary.
<P>
	The myth of women's equality is everywhere. Although 
women's demands for wage equity have a long history, there is still 
more talk than action in this respect. There is still a 26 per cent gap 
between the wages of a man and those of a woman, both working 
full-time.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	On her latest income tax return, Mrs. X will report an average 
income of $29,700 and Mr. X a salary of $40,600. Even with a 
college or university degree, women earning a good salary are on 
average paid 10 per cent less than their male counterparts.
<P>
	Women make up half the population, have the same democratic 
rights as men, and their contribution to political, social and 
economic life in Canada and Quebec is a recognized fact. However, 
although many women are actively involved in our society and are 
highly qualified, they are still under-represented in executive 
positions. This low representation of women in positions of 
authority may not only prevent a real understanding of  the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8768"> 8768 </A></B>
<P>
problems that specifically affect women in Quebec and Canada but 
it also deprives the institutions that wield this authority of a range 
of views and experience that would be a real asset to the way they 
conduct their business.
<P>
	Women may have succeeded in opening the doors to the 
corridors of power, but to achieve any kind of recognition, they 
must struggle to adjust to a political and organizational culture that 
evolved at a time when women were excluded. Furthermore, they 
must often be far more resourceful than their male colleagues to 
reconcile the various aspects of their lives.
<P>
	Economic equity is the key, in a society that calls itself 
egalitarian. Today's employment market for women is 
characterized by insecurity, instability, short term contracts and 
underpaid jobs.
<P>
	The social safety net that in the past helped Canadian and 
Quebec women manage, as my colleague for Laurentides 
mentioned, is now being sabotaged by the federal government on 
the excuse of eliminating the deficit. And the effect is greater 
poverty among women and children. We must not forget that one 
child in five in Canada lives in poverty.
<P>
	By choosing to reduce transfer payments to the provinces, by 
limiting access to unemployment insurance and lowering its 
benefits, the federal government is the one responsible for the 
unravelling of the social safety net.
<P>
	It was, however, the Liberal government that established the 
Canada assistance plan and made the commitment with the 
provinces at the time to cover the costs of health care, social 
assistance and higher education. It was the same Liberal 
government that broke all its election promises to not touch social 
programs-and this is verbatim from the red book-and decided to 
use the money set aside for social programs to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	Thus, between 1996 and 1998, the federal government will take 
$4.5 billion away from the provinces, including $1.3 billion from 
Quebec. During this time, the insecurity of the job market and the 
cuts to unemployment insurance will increase the welfare load of 
the provinces. In 1995, Quebec had a record number of households 
on the welfare rolls.
<P>
	When now, more than ever, women need income assistance 
between two jobs, the federal government is tightening its 
unemployment insurance eligibility criteria, thus making it less 
accessible to part time women workers.
<P>
	In the past, 300 hours worked entitled an individual to benefits. 
Now the figure is 910. The Council on the Status of Women pointed 
out that it is reasonable to assume that the first hour worked will 
not, in many cases, improve access to the plan.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Women will be paying into a plan they may never benefit from. 
Moreover, while the government is tightening criteria and 
shortening the benefit period, it is building up surpluses in the 
unemployment insurance fund that might reach a record $12 billion 
by 1998. We are told that these surpluses will be used to artificially 
lower the deficit instead of creating jobs.
<P>
	I would also like to say a couple of words about the Employment 
Equity Act passed in 1977 by this Parliament. The Liberal and 
Conservative governments in power since it was enacted have done 
everything in their power to stall its implementation. Despite the 
fact that the Employment Equity Act has been in force since 1977, 
some 80,000 civil servants, mostly women, have been waiting for 
Treasury Board to act on this problem.
<P>
	We could also mention the broken promise to create 150,000 day 
care places, the dismantling of the Advisory Council on the Status 
of Women, the cuts to funding for women's groups. Instead of 
helping the women and children in this country, the heritage 
minister is trying to make us believe that the Canadian flag can turn 
into pizzas in Canadian elementary schools. Whether we are 
Canadians or Quebecers, I do not believe that a flag is a good 
substitute for milk, fruit and vegetables.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to salute all the women in the riding of 
Laval East and the women's groups who are striving, with what 
little resources they have, to improve living conditions for women 
in Laval.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to commend the member for Laval East for her speech 
which was, as always, well documented, clear and soberly 
delivered.
<P>
	Even if tomorrow is International Women's Day, it is appropriate 
for some men to rise in this House to voice their support for the 
women's movement, for improved living conditions for women 
and for some aspects of this movement, this progression toward 
greater economic autonomy, equality and equity.
<P>
	For two years now, the efforts made in Quebec, under the 
stewardship of the Fédération des femmes du Québec, which 
coordinated the two Bread and Roses marches, have increased 
Quebecers' awareness of the plight of many women among them.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the tight economic situation and, as the member 
for Laval East reminded us, the non-application of legislation on 
employment equity in the public service, added to all the cuts that 
were made, created a situation where some women will have to 
wait longer than they normally should before they can enjoy equity.
<P>
	Among the measures which could improve the status of women, 
one is a greater presence in politics. I do not want to annoy my 
colleague from Laval East, but I would like her to tell us if she 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8769"> 8769 </A></B>
<P>
agrees that more women in  politics would be a solution, if 
stressing the importance of women's involvement in politics would 
improve things.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
for his question. Would it make a difference if there were more 
women in politics, in power and in decision making circles? I think 
it would. As I said earlier, women make up 50 per cent of the 
population. Men and women complement each other. There is what 
is often called in Latin the <I>animus</I> and the <I>anima</I>. This is an old 
theory which, I think, was developed by Teilhard de Chardin during 
the course of his work.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	So the <I>animus</I> and the <I>anima</I> complement each other. I do not 
want to turn this issue into a battle of the sexes, but I do think that 
the presence of women in politics must be considered from that 
perspective. Women bring with them 50 per cent of mankind's 
knowledge and experience. Their contribution is different from 
men's contribution, and this is why their presence in power and 
decision making circles is so important.
<P>
	I would like to come back to an something my colleague from 
Mississauga-South talked about a while ago because I feel 
compelled to respond to his comments. He talked about family 
policy and he talked about the fight against poverty. That is the 
problem with this government as it was with its predecessor: they 
confuse a comprehensive and consistent family policy with a 
policy to fight poverty. These are two completely different things. I 
will use the child tax benefit proposed by the government as an 
example.
<P>
	We know that the child tax benefit is part of a family policy. 
Right? Well, that is one thing. The government is using poverty as 
an excuse-
<P>
	Must I conclude my remarks, Mr. Speaker? It is very 
unfortunate. I would have liked to talk at length about the 
distinction that must be made between family policy, which should 
be under provincial jurisdiction-and Quebec has already 
developed such a policy-and a policy to fight poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion on 
women's economic autonomy that is currently before the House. I 
am pleased that my hon. colleague attaches such a high importance 
to the enhancement of women's economic autonomy, because there 
is still a great deal that we still must do. She is extremely right.
<P>
	Let us remember where women have come from. Women only 
got the vote federally in 1918. In Quebec, women only got the vote 
in 1940. Aboriginal women have had the vote only since 1969. 
Women were only considered persons in 1929. We have a long way 
to go.
<P>
	Some of the things that need to be done to ensure women taking 
their full place in society, economically, socially, politically and 
culturally are going to mean embarking on some very long term 
measures that will take time. Women have only just, in the later and 
middle part of this century, actually come into their own.
<P>
	Women's economic security and independence affect every 
single aspect of women's lives. Why? Because women are made up 
of all the things that contribute to their lives. If we talk about 
women's economic autonomy, we have to talk about the impact 
that women's poverty and women's dependence have on violence 
against women.
<P>
	We have to talk about the fact that 80 per cent of single parent 
families are headed by women. We need to talk about the diversity 
of women. We need to talk about the fact that many women face 
triple barriers, not just the barrier of their gender. Therefore, we 
cannot present a simplistic solution to women's economic 
autonomy. They must, necessarily, be comprehensive as they must 
cross every single segment of women's lives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As Secretary of State for the Status of Women, I am very proud 
of what our government has done to promote women's economic 
independence and equality between the sexes in general in Canada. 
Although there is still a lot to do, we are determined to advance the 
cause of the equality of women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, the government has taken an approach to women's 
equality that is multi-faceted and comprehensive. Its 
accomplishments are many and varied. In a little over three years it 
has moved forward on a wide range of issues of importance to 
women.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	While the federal government moves to strengthen employment 
equity, certain provinces are moving to cancel employment equity 
measures. It has moved to deficit reduction because a stable 
Canadian economy gives the ability to assist and to move forward 
with good social strategies to assist women.
<P>
	Firearms control, child support reform, Canada child tax benefit 
and job creation and growth are all things that must and will impact 
on women's economic autonomy. The government has moved on 
education and training, prenatal nutrition and women's health 
issues, because health is an economic resource. It has moved on 
youth employment because the young girl child will become the 
woman of tomorrow. Reproductive technologies, outlawing female 
genital mutilation, action on child poverty and more are all 
measures which the government has moved on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8770"> 8770 </A></B>
<P>
	All of these may seem unrelated but they have an impact on 
women's economic autonomy. The foundation  of women's 
equality must be built on a composite of positive actions which 
touch on all aspects of their lives. One issue interacts with another. 
The actions of one government department impacts on another. 
Policies must be shaped, which is what the government is doing 
with a careful eye to their full implications for all Canadians, no 
matter whether they are women or men, young or old, rich or poor, 
recent immigrants or long time Canadians.
<P>
	As Secretary of State for the Status of Women, I have focused 
my work therefore on three key priority areas: economic 
independence and autonomy for women, eliminating violence 
against women, and women's rights as human rights, with 
particular emphasis on the role of the disadvantaged.
<P>
	We have moved first and foremost to secure the future of 
Canada's social programs, many of which are vital to the economic 
well-being of women. We know that women's incomes do not only 
depend on paid work, they depend on transfers from governments 
and transfers from individuals such as alimony and child support. 
They depend on the amount of unpaid work that women do. And 
they also depend on whether women have children or not.
<P>
	There are fewer and fewer jobs for women which speaks to a 
discrimination that is rampant against women. That is why we have 
moved forward to deal with these issues with a short term and a 
very long term holistic strategy. The 73 cents that many women in 
full time jobs earn to the $1 that every man earns has to do with the 
fact that many women have children and that impacts on their 
ability to secure full time work.
<P>
	What has the government done? In this budget it has 
strengthened literacy programs because women need to be assisted 
to become literate. In this budget access to training and work has 
been improved. Slowly an infrastructure has been built over the 
past three years.
<P>
	Look at the EI system. Everyone has heard talk about the EI 
system. What has not been said is that over 270,000 women will 
have work insured for the very first time in their lives. The 
reinvestment of $800 million in employment benefits will help 
women to find jobs. Sixty-seven per cent of the people who receive 
family income are women. The average benefit for the single 
parent, given that 80 per cent of them are women, will be increased 
by 13 per cent.
<P>
	Seven hundred thousand women, including 495,000 who pay 
premiums today are going to have their premiums refunded under 
the EI benefit. We do not hear about these things. We also do not 
hear about the fact that under the new EI benefit women will now 
have choices, especially when we consider that women with 
children have problems in the workforce. With the new EI benefit, 
women will be allowed to make a choice to stay at home and look 
after their children for up to five  years and still have access under 
the employment insurance to go back to training.
<P>
	Labour market support. Look at the Employment Equity Act 
which has targeted women as a very high group in terms at looking 
at employment equity for women.
<P>
	The Canada student loans program, which gives grants to part 
time students, such as single women, will fund increased day care 
and tax credits to women in high school now. These things are all 
new. They may seem to be small things but when they are stacked 
one on top of the other, they become a holistic, long term, bit by bit 
infrastructure which can be built on to help women achieve 
economic autonomy.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Among our accomplishments, we might mention consolidation 
of the Employment Equity Act and a series of measures aimed at 
improving access to post-secondary education.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have now improved the ability of women to go into post 
graduate programs, specifically in science and mathematics, 
because these are where the new sustainable long term jobs will 
come from in the next century.
<P>
	These are some of the things we talk about. They are not 
grandiose gestures because centuries upon centuries of women's 
inequality cannot be fixed with one single move. It must be built 
with a strong, solid infrastructure.
<P>
	This is why we have looked at the issue of unpaid work. For the 
first time in the history of the country there have been questions 
about unpaid work in the census forms. They will define exactly 
how much unpaid work women do in terms of nurturing and care 
giving. They will look at how that is factored into national accounts 
so we can realize that unpaid work supports the economic 
structures of the country.
<P>
	We need to look at the child support programs. Many women 
who head single parent families do not have the ability to support 
their children properly. These children live in poverty. That is why 
scheduled to come into effect on May 1, 1997 will be the new child 
support payments act to ensure that women do not have to fight 
tooth and nail for every penny they receive to support their 
children. These children will finally get the support they need to 
help them get an education and to have the quality of life they need 
to become strong and secure adults.
<P>
	There is practically no dispute that the federal government has 
put its fiscal house in order. That meant spending restraints. We 
could not exempt transfers from the spending restraints because 
transfers make up 20 per cent of all federal funding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8771"> 8771 </A></B>
<P>
	We have been a lot tougher on ourselves than we have been on 
the provinces. Between 1993-94 and 1998-99 Quebec's transfer 
entitlements will decrease by 10.9 per cent. During that same 
period the federal government transfers will be reduced by 15 per 
cent. The government of Quebec knows very well that the 
reduction of budgetary deficits imposes difficult choices. The 
Quebec government also knows it must bear its share of the effort.
<P>
	Premier Bouchard made very clear that restraints involve tough 
choices when he said in the National Assembly on March 25, 1996: 
``To those who say not in my backyard I reply that there must be 
something in everyone's backyard''.
<P>
	Then there was Bernard Landry who told the National Assembly 
on December 9, 1996 that it must nevertheless be admitted there is 
a sense of responsibility that binds us to do our share to help get 
Canada out of a debt we helped create.
<P>
	In the current fiscal year federal transfers to provinces for health, 
post secondary education and other social programs will be $26.9 
billion. In addition, provinces like Quebec receive well over $8.5 
billion in equalization payments. Quebec is getting federal 
transfers of approximately $11 billion a year or 31 per cent of all 
transfers. Where that province chooses to spend its money will 
depend on the goodwill of the province and its commitment to 
women. If it chooses to spend the money on women then it will. It 
is the provinces' choice as to what they cut and not ours.
<P>
	For the provinces to be able to build some long term goals into 
their programs for the future of women and children, we have 
stabilized the transfers to a five-year program that in the last two 
years will see an increase. There will also be an $11 billion cash 
flow so the federal government can continue to keep a set of 
national standards to ensure that women have the social programs 
and the health care they need.
<P>
	We talk about women's economic well-being and the health of 
women. We have set up five centres of excellence for women's 
health across the country to deal specifically with helping to form 
good policies to assist women to be healthy so they can contribute 
to the economic growth of the country.
<P>
	This is what we mean when we talk about economic autonomy. 
We do not limit it to whether or not a women has a dollar in her 
pocket. Some of the things we have done in the last budget will 
assist about 1.4 million families to get more money in their 
pockets, and 2.5 million of them have children.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Women are the heads of households, the majority of whose 
children live in poverty. When we attach money to children who 
live in poverty we assist the well-being of women and their 
families. They are interdependent.
<P>
	It is important when we are talk about women's equality, 
Women's International Day and Women's International Week, to 
remember those who say we do not need to have programs, that we 
do not need to look at women as disadvantaged group, or that many 
women like aboriginal women, lesbians, disabled women and 
women of colour continue to be triply and doubly disadvantaged. If 
we do not understand that then there are those of us in the House 
who are out of touch with the real lives of women, who do not 
understand that women are the poor, that women are among the 
most illiterate and that women are the ones who need access to 
good training programs.
<P>
	As a Liberal government we realize it. We have specifically 
targeted women so that they have access to training and that 
because they have children they are able to find work within their 
homes, to be able to set up their own businesses. Since we have 
come into power women's enterprise centres have been targeting 
women, assisting them to get money to start their own businesses 
and assisting with work plans so their businesses can be successful. 
Over 46 per cent of new businesses are headed by women and they 
are the most successful businesses that have given women the 
choice to have economic independence.
<P>
	When we speak about women's economic independence and 
about violence against women, we speak to women and their 
human rights. One of my colleague's across the way talked about 
women in politics. Women make up over 50 per cent of the 
population. If we do not understand that getting women into 
political structures where they can play a part in decision making is 
simple democracy then we do not understand democracy. If we do 
not have appropriate representation from over 50 per cent of our 
population in decision making we do not factor in the reality of 
how the country is structured or the reality of the gender 
differences that make up the country.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance said that helping women to achieve 
their full potential was simply a matter of good common sense. If 
women make up over 50 per cent of the population they must have 
a key role to play in forming the important human resource 
development that is necessary. The Minister of Finance also said 
resources for the country in the 21st century would not lie in the 
ground on which we walk but would lie in the people who walk on 
it. Those people make up 50 per cent of our population. They are 
women. They are still disadvantaged. They are still not equal.
<P>
	The government has dedicated itself to ensuring that a strong 
infrastructure for the long term development and enhancement of 
women's economic equality is starting. We started it. We will 
continue to build it. It will be strong. In the 21st century we can be 
assured that, with many of the initiatives we have taken, women 
will be well on their way to fulfilling their place in Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to see that the minister realizes that much remains to 
be done for women, politically, socially and economically.
<P>
	But I would like to see, first of all, how much influence the 
minister has in cabinet. Her speech was very eloquent, very 
passionate, but is such a strong stand taken on the status of women, 
the issue of women and children, in cabinet meetings? What I 
would give to be a fly on the wall and see how much importance is 
given to these issues.
<P>
	I have a question for the minister. She mentioned a number of 
initiatives she feels the federal government has taken to improve 
the economic situation of women and, therefore, of children.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Does she realize that, by totally eliminating transfer payments 
for social housing, making billions of dollars in cuts and cutting 
10,000 jobs at Canada Post, the government is affecting a growing 
number of women, who end up on UI or welfare? Does she realize 
also that, by abolishing the Canadian Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women, the government has impeded the advancement of 
women?
<P>
	I would like her to elaborate a bit on this, because what we on 
this side of the House are noticing is that this government is tearing 
the social safety net to shreds. Promises are made that are not kept, 
except for cuts, cuts, and more cuts. They keep cutting transfer 
payments.
<P>
	She mentioned earlier that it was up to the provinces to decide 
where the money went, but let me tell you that, with no money 
coming in, it is almost impossible to make up for the shortfalls 
created by the federal government.
<P>
	I would like her comments on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will address the first question about my 
influence as Secretary of State for the Status of Women in cabinet.
<P>
	The issue of women's equality is too important to be left to 
personal influence. That is why the government has embarked on 
gender based analysis, a clear government tool to ensure that every 
policy, initiative and piece of legislation being considered by every 
federal department, institution, agency and crown corporation is 
looked at through the eyes of how it affects men and women.
<P>
	That is how much importance the government has placed on 
women's equality. It is too important to be left up to the influence 
of one person. We have written it into  a tool kit so that gender 
analysis is being done by every department on everything they do.
<P>
	The second question concerned transfer payments. It is a bit 
ironic that the Bloc Quebecois should be raising this issue and 
opposing measures to bring Canada's fiscal stability into order as 
the government has done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to remind the members of the Bloc Quebecois of 
what the PQ government did in Quebec. The PQ has reduced 
financial assistance to the poor while at the same time cutting the 
social programs intended for these people. They have also cut 
transfer payments to the municipalities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There will be questions 
and comments to the minister when we resume orders of the day 
later this day.

	Thanks to the joint efforts of eight municipalities, the 32nd

success of these games, as well as the athletes from all over the 
province who are taking part in the competitions that will conclude 
this weekend.
<P>
	However, I must also deplore the attempt made by the federal 
government to make political gains out of this event. Indeed, the 
government made its financial contribution conditional to the 
flooding of federal material promoting Canadian unity.
<P>
	Again, congratulations to the organizers and athletes of the 
Quebec Games, but shame on the federal Liberals for associating 
the performances of young Quebec athletes with the promotion of 
the Canadian identity.

	Radar Hill was named for its prominence during World War II

supported by local communities.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tomorrow is International Women's Day, an occasion for the 
Liberal government to take note on the report on women's work 
released this week by the Canadian Labour Congress. It revealed 
the sobering statistic that Canada has the second worst record 
among industrialized countries for the percentage of women in low 
wage employment.
<P>
	In exactly the same way we have seen with Canada's shameful 
record on child poverty, Canadians now have before them the 
evidence of the terrible social damage being inflicted on Canadian 
families by this Liberal government's economic policies.
<P>
	The Liberal cuts have made the situation worse for women, as 
some 64 per cent of the public sector jobs lost have been women's 
jobs. Think of the thousands of well paid jobs lost by nurses and 
other health professionals in the latest round of health care cuts in 
Ontario, cuts jointly sponsored by Mike Harris and the Prime 
Minister.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have often mentioned in this House the terrible genocide that took 
place in Rwanda. Over half a million people, mostly men, have 
been killed, and over 250,000 women were not only raped, but 
often mutilated and tortured.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It is important to condemn this situation, because women 
currently account for 70 per cent of the Rwandan population. Even 
more tragic is the fact that 60 per cent of these women are widows, 
because of the genocide, and cannot inherit their dead husbands' 
assets.
<P>
	Even though the international assistance to Rwanda in the last 
two years has totalled $2.5 billion, of which $75 million is from 
Canada, these women only received a meagre part of that amount.

situation, I wonder how we could possibly ignore such a large

<P>
	I have been asked by constituents what the actual increase in 
CPP premiums is to the average taxpayer.
<P>
	The truth is that the increase in CPP premiums, together with the 
reduction in EI premiums, will by the year 2006 result in an 
additional cost of little more than $125 annually, or 35 cents per 
day.

	Everyone wonders why Reform is making such a fuss over 
nothing if this is all it will cost to solve the problems with the CPP 
and put it back on strong financial footing.

<P>
	Women make up more than half the population, but they do not

countries do not even allow women to vote. In Canada, the 
proportion of women in the various legislatures varies between 15

Although there has been some improvement, a new electoral 
dynamic must be found that is more favourable to women.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada Labour Congress has just released a study on 
women's work.
<P>
	The study shows, using OECD statistics-as you know, the 
OECD represents major industrialized countries throughout the 
world-that Canada is the industrialized country with the highest 
percentage of women in low-paying jobs, after Japan. The report 
tells us that only 20 per cent of women have full-time jobs paying 
more than $30,000 annually. In other words, poverty has a gender. 
Poverty is female.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Does this 
government, which promised not to touch social programs, realize 
today that the consequences of its decisions are that millions of 
women are doomed to even greater poverty?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that question is exactly why this 
government has embarked on certain initiatives to deal with 
economic autonomy of women. It is precisely why we have started 
to build a strong infrastructure that will assist women to get 
sustainable jobs in today's economy and also in the information, 
technology and science economy of the 21st century.
<P>
	It is the beginning of every federal department's ensuring and 
looking at the sustainability of women's  equality and economic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8777"> 8777 </A></B>
<P>
equality with gender based analysis as one of the key and most 
important levers to help women in Canada to become economically 
autonomous.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is somewhat surprising, because as far as the 
infrastructure program is concerned, the main criticism from 
women's groups was that the program did not give any jobs to 
women. It had practically no impact on women because it was not 
even intended for women.
<P>
	So the answer was very surprising, but surprises seem to be the 
order of the day.
<P>
	The labour market situation is deteriorating. Today in particular, 
we see that the number of jobs is decreasing: 14,000 jobs were lost 
last month, while existing jobs are less dependable, do not last as 
long, and pay less, and women, who have 70 per cent of part-time 
jobs and 70 per cent of the lowest paying jobs, are bearing the brunt 
of this situation.
<P>
	Does the government agree that the term highway robbery 
applies to the way women have been affected by employment 
insurance reform which, in their case, has meant reduced access to 
unemployment insurance, reduced benefits and reduced benefit 
periods, at a time when the unemployment insurance fund has a 
record surplus of more than $5 billion a year?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would draw the attention of the 
hon. member to some of the very important initiatives that the 
government has taken since it came into power.
<P>
	In its strengthening of employment equity it has targeted women 
as a key group for employment equity strategy.
<P>
	Second, when we talk about the infrastructure program, I think 
the hon. member should know that some of our youth strategies are 
aimed at helping young women into non-traditional jobs like 
construction work, which will be part of the infrastructure 
program.
<P>
	Finally, the employment insurance bill changes ensure that 
women can now make choices. Women can get back into the 
workforce under EI five years after maternity leave and well over 
300,000 women will be able to get benefits for the first time in their 
lives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the hon. member that the government has 
targeted women, but the trouble is, it regularly misses the target, 
and when it scores a hit, it is for the wrong reason.
<P>
	I may remind you that Canada Labour Congress vice-president 
Nancy Rich said this week that, since the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage had resigned when the Liberals reneged on their promise 
to abolish the GST, today the whole cabinet should resign for 
reneging on the promises made in the red book and by the Prime 
Minister regarding social programs.
<P>
	Again, I want to ask the Acting Prime Minister how she thinks 
Canadian and Quebec women judge their government which, in 
spite of its promises, has savagely torn the social safety net they so 
badly need, since women and children represent more than 70 per 
cent of the poor in Canada, according to Statistics Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate.
<P>
	In the new employment insurance bill over 700,000 women, 
including 495,000 women who pay EI premiums today, will not 
have to pay EI premiums. That is a major breakthrough for women.
<P>
	Second, when we talk about cuts not benefiting women, the child 
benefit that has been put in place by the government will make a 
difference to women. Eighty per cent of single parents are women. 
Sixty-five per cent live in poverty. By targeting women with small 
children a lot of women are being helped.
<P>
	Child support benefits assist women to improve incomes to help 
them look after their children. Dealing with women's economic 
autonomy is not only dealing with the issue of employment 
because women depend on many other things to assist them in 
getting economic autonomy. We are addressing this in a 
comprehensive holistic way, not simply in a one shot linear 
unilateral way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very 
hard to listen to these words without anger, knowing that women 
were the hardest hit by the cuts to employment insurance and to 
social transfers.
<P>
	My question is for the Acting Prime Minister. The government 
has gazed into its crystal ball and predicted more than 300,000 jobs 
in 1997, but this morning's figures hardly support its enthusiasm. 
Instead of creating new jobs, Canada has lost 14,000 jobs since the 
beginning of the year. As we approach March 8, women have still 
less to celebrate, for 44,000 full time jobs have been lost since last 
month.
<P>
	How can the Acting Prime Minister explain that her government 
is still predicting such a rosy future, when the employment 
situation of women continues to deteriorate?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8778"> 8778 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the issue that my hon. 
colleague is talking about has to do with transfer payment cuts.
<P>
	I would like to draw the hon. member's attention to some 
comments made by Lucien Bouchard when he made it clear that he 
knows that restraints involve tough choices. He said in the National 
Assembly on March 25, 1996: ``For those who say not in my back 
yard I reply that there would be something in everyone's back 
yard''.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	In the current fiscal year, federal transfers to provinces for health 
and other social programs will still be $26.9 billion. In addition, 
equalization payments will top that up. Quebec is getting federal 
transfers of approximately $11 billion.
<P>
	How Quebec determines to place its emphasis and its priorities 
on what it does with its money is Quebec's business, and it should 
consider whether women are a priority.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
problem is that it is mostly women who pay the price.
<P>
	Since the end of 1994, or since the Liberal Government's 
reforms have come into full effect, the number of full time jobs for 
women has increased by only 10,000, whereas the number of part 
time jobs has risen by 140,000.
<P>
	How can the Acting Prime Minister deny such a deterioration in 
the employment situation, particularly for women?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member does not 
understand the full and holistic component of what is done for 
women's jobs.
<P>
	Many women cannot have sustainable full time jobs because 
they have children, a fact which statistics support. We are looking 
at how to assist women with children. One of the most important 
things to help women to get training for long term sustainable jobs 
is the new EI benefit where women can take five years off for 
maternity leave. Five years is a massive increase which will allow 
women to still go back and get training.
<P>
	We have talked about levering money into literacy programs so 
women can get into the job market. We have talked about levering 
money so women can have post-graduate training in sciences and 
math. Those are the things that create an infrastructure for women 
to build their economic autonomy.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENT">EMPLOYMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal-Tory years have been hard years for the one and a half 
million unemployed in Canada. StatsCan announced today that the 
unemployment rate for February was 9.7 per cent. That is the 77th 
straight month, or six and half years, that unemployment has been 
over 9 per cent. It is the worst string of job numbers since the Great 
Depression.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance, where are the jobs, jobs, jobs that 
the Liberals promised Canadians in the last election?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr Speaker, we are concerned about the February 
figures which the hon. member mentioned.
<P>
	I point out to him that the unemployment rate has not risen but 
has stayed the same. The trend over the the last four months has 
been strong job growth. If he had read this morning's papers he 
would have seen articles by a number of analysts who clearly stated 
that while this is disappointing, all the prospects for continued job 
growth are there.
<P>
	This morning's papers were full of indications of increased 
house starts, increased house resales, increased purchases, 
increases confidence. As private sector forecasters assert, those 
indicators will lead to 300,000 to 350,000 new jobs in the coming 
year when Canada will lead the industrialized countries in growth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, great 
words, but no jobs. I cannot believe the government is actually 
trying to justify an unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent.
<P>
	Let us look at the numbers: 38,000 full time jobs disappeared 
last month; 44,000 more women are out work; the lowest number 
of young people working in 20 years. What is more, CIBC Wood 
Gundy and Canadians who had given up looking for work say that 
the unemployment rate is up to 13.9 per cent.
<P>
	Why has the government broken its red book promise? Why 
have the Liberals failed completely and miserably to create growth 
and opportunity?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is simply untrue to leave the 
impression that the government does not care about employment. 
We care very deeply about it. Our strategies which are reflected in 
our budgets support that.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	First and foremost we have, as the hon. member and his 
colleagues have insisted we do, maintained the course on deficit 
reduction. That has kept interest rates low,  leading to investment. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8779"> 8779 </A></B>
<P>
That is going to translate into greater job growth this year. We are 
not stopping there and not sitting back.
<P>
	The hon. member represents a party whose approach to all these 
questions is simply cut taxes for their friends, sit back and wait for 
everything else to happen. Canadians want a government that takes 
action so not only is it acting on deficit reduction but it is investing 
in short term growth and providing immediate impetus for jobs 
through infrastructure, foreign trade, youth employment measures, 
unemployment insurance reforms, reform of the CPP. It is also 
investing in long term growth in jobs through the Canadian 
Foundation for Innovation, through higher education support for 
that and investing in a stronger society, something we care very 
much about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is another 
story of more talk and more taxes and fewer jobs. In Canada 1.5 
million people are unemployed, two million to three million 
underemployed, 800,000 moonlighting to make ends meet, the 
lowest number of young people working in 20 years, and one in 
four who are worried about losing their jobs. That is the Liberal job 
record.
<P>
	What is the Liberal answer to this crisis? A 73 per cent hike in 
payroll taxes that its own department is saying is going to kill even 
more jobs.
<P>
	With an unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent, with 1.5 million 
Canadians unemployed, why is the government introducing a73 per cent payroll tax hike that is going to kill more jobs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian people know which side 
of the House is talking and which side of the House is acting.
<P>
	On the question of the CPP contribution increase, it is somewhat 
irresponsible of the hon. member opposite to talk about something 
as a job killer when it is an investment in the public pension plan 
shared risk that all of us share to ensure a decent retirement, a 
foundation for retirement. It is contributions toward a fund that is 
invested for the benefit of the workers, the present retirees, the 
future retirees. It is something that we will continue to support and 
make sure is viable and sustainable.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	On October 4, 1995, the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor 
General gave Judge Lynn Ratushny the task of  examining the files 
of the various women who were sentenced for killing their abusive 
partner. The judge has just released her findings and concludes that 
four women should be freed, one should be given a lighter sentence 
and another should be given a new hearing before the court of 
appeal.
<P>
	When does the minister intend to implement the judge's 
recommendations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have received Judge Ratushny's preliminary report. It is being 
studied by a working group of officials in the Department of Justice 
and the Department of the Solicitor General. They are also 
consulting with the provincial attorneys general.
<P>
	Because this matter raises some rather novel juridical concepts 
we have to proceed with all due deliberate speed. I look forward to 
having a response from the Minister of Justice and myself before 
too long.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is perhaps important for the Solicitor General to take his 
time. This is a report he himself requested with his colleague in 
Justice.
<P>
	I would like to know at what point the women prisoners are 
likely to get out of prison, because you are going to act on the 
recommendations. How long will it take to examine the files? How 
long should these women expect to wait: a week, two weeks, six 
months? What hope are you giving them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have great respect for Judge Ratushny's work. I think she would 
be the last person to say that her report should be simply treated as 
something with a rubber stamp.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Instead, what is involved in her report is something quite novel 
and that is applying a ruling of a court to a trial in a decision of 
another court that took place quite a while before the judgment that 
has led to the study by Judge Ratushny.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, when we are talking about either 
asking for a new trial under section 690 of the code or using the 
royal prerogative of mercy, certainly we have to think carefully 
about the implications for the justice system. We also, in that 
connection, have to take into account the views of our provincial 
counterparts.
<P>
	We want to proceed with all due deliberate speed but we want to 
do it in the right way.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week I had 
occasion to visit two of the Ottawa hospitals that are slated to close, 
the Montfort and the Riverside.
<P>
	In the case of the Riverside, it is closing because the Liberal 
government chose to give its entire budget, $97 million, to a 
corporate buddy, Bombardier. How can the government possibly 
justify its choice of corporation subsidies over Canadian hospitals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite continues to make reference to the 
situation in the province of Ontario with regard to the decisions that 
the Ontario government and Premier Harris have made.
<P>
	I wish to quote for the hon. member a statement by the Minister 
of Finance on March 6, 1997:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In other words, he should understand that if hospitals are being closed in Ontario 
it is as a result of a political choice. Tax cuts are being made. I will not dispute them, 
but they are not the result of a reduction in transfers from the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe the health 
minister could then explain how Harris has cut the hospital beds in 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Alberta?
<P>
	These cuts are the direct responsibility of the Liberal 
government. Maybe the health minister should listen to what Dr. 
Tony Wade, president of the New Brunswick Medical Society, 
thinks about the Liberal's attack on health care. He stated: ``I don't 
need a dictionary to know that they spell abandonment''.
<P>
	Can the health minister tell Dr. Wade of New Brunswick why the 
Prison Art Foundation gets $100,000 that should go to the hospitals 
in New Brunswick? Explain that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again I thank the hon. member for the lob ball question.
<P>
	The hon. member should be aware of the situation in the great 
province of Alberta. I wish to quote again the federal Minister of 
Finance who said on March 6:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the same time the province of Alberta is declaring surpluses and cutting taxes. 
He cannot say that it is reductions in federal transfers when Alberta is cutting taxes 
and declaring surpluses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And at the same time it is closing down hospitals.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> My question is for the 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	The red book states on page 81, and I quote: ``It is well known, 
for example, that research into breast cancer, which afflicts one 
woman in nine, has been seriously underfunded.'' As a result of the 
parliamentary report on breast cancer, the Conservative 
government had committed significant investments for research on 
this issue, but the program is coming to an end in 1998.
<P>
	On the eve of International Women's Day, is the Liberal 
government able to tell us that it intends to renew for another five 
years its commitment to research on breast cancer in Canada, as did 
the Canadian Cancer Institute and the Canadian Cancer Society?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for the question because it is substantive 
and important to women all across the country.
<P>
	Earlier this week I met with a number of representatives from the 
Canadian foundation, the breast network association across the 
country, as well as other representatives to discuss with them their 
proposals and ways in which to work together in order to continue 
financing this initiative.
<P>
	We have also contributed $2.7 million over five years to the 
breast cancer information exchange pilot projects. The hon. 
member is aware that Canada and the United States had the first 
ever women's health forum whereby one of the clear priorities of 
Canada and the United States is to focus research on breast cancer.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that this a serious issue and that we are 
taking it very seriously.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
evaluation report states that research is often disconnected from 
reality and recommends that women who have survived breast 
cancer play a more active role in research.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Health intend to follow through with this 
recommendation by modifying the research funding criteria?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that point is very substantive and has been made to me. It deserves 
very serious consideration.
<P>
	I have asked my officials as well as the various funding bodies to 
examine that to accommodate what I believe is a very legitimate 
request made by the hon. member and by other members as well.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party is committed to publicly funded health 
care in Canada.
<P>
	I will speak very slowly so that the Minister of Health and 
members on the other side will understand real life examples of my 
experience in the emergency department.
<P>
	A young woman came in needing urgent dialysis. She could not 
get it because the hospital has had its funds cut. She went into 
cardiac arrest after three days and almost died. On an average night 
8 out of 13 hospital bays are filled with patients. There is no room 
in the hospital and the hospital does not have any money.
<P>
	Is the minister's version of better health care management to 
give $97 million to Bombardier or to give money to health care so 
that Canadians can get urgent treatment when they medically need 
it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not think any member on this side of the House would want to 
debate or argue the sincerity of the hon. member opposite, 
particularly in relation to his preamble.
<P>
	In <I>Hansard</I> in 1995 he said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let us allow the provinces to experiment with alternative funding models such as 
private clinics, private insurance and the like.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I know the hon. member is doing flip flops, huffing and puffing, 
but I suggest that he, his friend from Macleod and the leader of the 
Reform Party get their acts together and come to the floor of the 
House of Commons with a reasoned, well thought out health 
policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yes, let the provinces deal with health care but do not cut 
the legs out from under them.
<P>
	Why has the government chosen handouts over health care? 
Why has it chosen to give $97 million to Bombardier when patients 
are absorbing the $4 billion in health care cuts with their own flesh 
and blood and sometimes by their own lives?
<P>
	Will the minister tell patients and the hospitals how the 
government will provide urgent health care to Canadians when they 
medically need it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member underlines the significance in every substantive 
provincial and federal report by royal commissions and by 
quasi-royal commissions. The issues affecting health care are 
primarily under the jurisdiction of provincial governments as they 
relate to hospitals. It is not an issue of funding; it is an issue of 
management.
<P>
	What is the hon. member talking about? He is talking about 
management issues which are the sole responsibility of the 
different provinces.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Under the Liberal and Tory governments, the Treasury Board did 
all it could not to give women employees their due as far as pay 
equity was concerned. Showing an evident lack of good faith, the 
Treasury Board used all the stalling tactics it could find to postpone 
the day when it would have to meet its obligations and comply with 
the Human Rights Act on the issue of pay equity.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Why did the President of the Treasury Board insist on delaying 
equity, why did he spend millions of dollars on legal quibbling, 
refusing to give female government workers the money they were 
owed and perpetuating pay inequity within the federal public 
service?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately, my colleague echoes some of the myths that are 
being spread, especially by her colleagues, and that are 
diametrically opposed to reality.
<P>
	Not only did the federal government pass a law, in 1978, well 
before most of the provinces, stating-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> It was in 1977.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Check your dates. Not only did that legislation 
establish the principle of pay equity, but since then, we have spent 
more than $1 billion to implement that principle, to turn it into 
reality, and we have succeeded.
<P>
	We have even negotiated with some of the unions, with the 
professional employees, an agreement granting pay equity. Let me 
add that we are willing to implement pay equity. We have already 
indicated that we are ready to negotiate the pay equity issues.
<P>
	The unions chose to go before the courts. We are awaiting a court 
ruling. There is no doubt that we have established the principle, 
that we have put it in place and that we will continue to adhere to it, 
as we must.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
President of the Treasury Board spoke about myths.

	I could remind him of all the stalling tactics used by Treasury 
Board from 1990 to this day, simply to avoid implementing the 
legislation on pay equity. I have a list here and I could table that 
document. The President of the Treasury Board talked about 
hearings before the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which 
should render its decision shortly.

<P>
	Will the President of the Treasury Board commit humself to 
abiding by the decision of the commission and, this time, really 
implement the legislation as quickly as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
truth is that in this field the federal government provided leadership 
to the private sector and the provinces.
<P>
	I repeat, we have paid over a billion dollars since the legislation 
came into force to implement pay equity. Not only do we believe in 
pay equity, but we have negotiated agreements with a number of 
unions. Therefore, in those cases, the unions were in agreement 
with us. We negotiated agreements to implement pay equity.
<P>
	However, when demands reach $2 or $2.5 billion, you would 
expect any good government, especially if the process is flawed, to 
say the equity principle requires that we serve all taxpayers, not 
just the ones in the public service, and that is what we have done.
<P>
	I repeat, we are willing to negotiate with the unions and settle the 
issue, even before the court makes a decision.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport or his parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	According to the Transportation Safety Board rail tanker cars 
presently used to haul dangerous chemicals are vulnerable to 
breaking apart in accidents, putting people, communities and the 
environment at risk.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Transport proceed with the safety board's 
recommendations and ensure that tanker car standards are 
strengthened for the protection of the public?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Davenport asks an 
important question. I want him to take comfort in the fact that 
safety is and will always be Transport Canada's number one 
priority.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Even before the recommendations by the Transportation Safety 
Board, Transport Canada limited the carriage of 80 dangerous 
goods in the tanker cars the member is concerned about.
<P>
	With respect to the recommendation made by the TSB, Transport 
Canada has already eliminated two of sixteen dangerous goods and 
is doing a thorough examination of the remainder. Work is already 
in progress to upgrade the strength of the tanker cars.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
British Columbia has a law in place called the senatorial selection 
act which allows British Columbians to elect their own senators.
<P>
	B.C. Senator Len Marchand was to retire March 1. However now 
the Prime Minister has coaxed the senator to stay on until after the 
next federal election. Despite Marchand's postponed retirement, 
we can be sure that B.C. will have a vacancy in the Senate very 
shortly.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister allow British Columbians the 
opportunity to elect their next senator?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we all appreciate the tribute paid to Senator Len Marchand. I for 
one would like to see him serve the people of British Columbia and 
Canada in the Senate for a very long time.
<P>
	However, if he chooses to step down, I am sure the Prime 
Minister will be very careful about following his constitutional 
responsibilities to the utmost.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Glen 
Clark, the premier of British Columbia, indicated that he will back 
an elected senator. Where do we stand?
<P>
	The people of B.C. want to elect their next senator. The premier 
of B.C. says he will back electing the next senator. The B.C. 
senatorial selection act allows that to happen in law. The only 
person preventing British Columbians from electing their next 
senator is the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister recommend to the Governor General the 
individual chosen by the people of British Columbia to fill the next 
Senate vacancy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is one problem among others in the hon. member's 
suggestion. Once the senator is elected how does one bring the 
senator's term to an end? What if the people of British Columbia 
decide that the person they elect no longer has their confidence? 
The Reform scheme does not deal with that point at all.
<P>
	Furthermore Reform Party members, if I am not mistaken, 
rejected a package of constitutional reforms that called for an 
elected Senate. It is rather strange that today they are doing 
something exactly the opposite to what they followed when they 
had a chance to speak for constitutional reform. Who can take them 
seriously on this important subject?

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Spokepeople from the correctional service of Canada have 
announced the transfer of 47 women prisoners to men's 
penitentiaries. Yet, the Arbour commission concluded last year, 
with regard to similar events, that there was at least an appeance of 
oppression in incarcerating women in an institution that inevitably 
houses many sexual offenders.
<P>
	Since the correctional service just finished building five new 
penitentiaries for women, including one in Joliette, and in light of 
the conclusions of the Arbour report, how does the minister explain 
this service's decision?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it turns out that there is a small number of disruptive, high security 
women prisoners for whom the new regional women's prisons do 
not offer adequate facilities. Until a permanent solution to the issue 
is worked out the correctional service has decided to set up a 
limited number of special units for these women.
<P>
	They are in facilities originally intended for male prisoners, but 
it is my understanding these special units will be quite apart from 
male prisoners and will offer special services and programs for 
women of a high security nature, pending the working out of a 
more permanent solution.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what guarantee 
can the minister give that correctional services will take all the 
necessary steps to remedy the situation and to provide women 
prisoners with detention conditions that respect the spirit and intent 
of the Arbour commission's recommendations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are talking about a small number of women prisoners who are 
of a high security nature and have potentially disruptive tendencies. 
We are not talking about all women prisoners. We are talking about 
having them in special units where they receive the programming 
necessary to help them get back into normal society.
<P>
	In any event, as I have said, this is an interim step. It is not a 
permanent step. It is being supervised by the new deputy 
commissioner for women's corrections.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a 
conundrum in the finance department. Over and over and over 
officials in that department have said the Canada pension plan is a 
payroll tax. Yet yesterday the Minister of Finance said he received 
advice from that department to act quickly with the provinces so it 
would not appear to be a tax.
<P>
	Furthermore the department has stated on a number of occasions 
that payroll taxes kill jobs. Yet now we are being asked to believe 
the 70 per cent increase in CPP will create jobs. How does the 
Minister of Finance reconcile these 180 degree out of phase points 
of view?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not surprisingly the member opposite 
continues to confuse a number of different things.
<P>
	Under the government payroll taxes have been reduced. UI 
premiums have been reduced significantly putting $1.7 billion back 
into the economy.
<P>
	When he tries to roll in the CPP package it is really quite 
incredible. Canadians will not be fooled. What is going on with the 
CPP is a serious attempt, in conjunction with the provincial 
governments, to make that program sustainable so that it will be 
there for those who are retired and for those who will be retiring in 
the future. It is not killing jobs. It is saving for people's retirement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the conundrum 
continues. Over the last 30 years the Liberals and the Conservatives 
trusted members of the Department of Finance, or they deliberately 
distorted or whatever what members of the department were saying 
by saying the CPP plan as proposed was sustainable.
<P>
	Now suddenly it is not sustainable. How can that be reconciled? 
How can we reconcile that it is sustainable on one hand and 
Canadians were to believe? Now it is not and they are to pay 70 per 
cent more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, now I have a conundrum. If I can read 
between the lines the hon. member is saying that we should never 
look at a program over time and decide whether or not it should be 
changed.
<P>
	We have done that with the provinces. It is the responsible thing 
to do. Canadians told us to make sure the Canada pension plan was

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the President of the Treasury Board. On the eve of 
International Women's Day around the globe economic equality for 
women still remains an elusive goal.
<P>
	In Canada it has been over a decade that federal employees in 
female dominated groups have been seeking equal pay for work of 
equal value. Unfortunately many of them now believe the human 
rights tribunal has ruled and our government is refusing to 
implement the ruling.
<P>
	Would the President of the Treasury Board clarify the situation 
with the tribunal to make clear what our government is prepared to 
do to end pay discrimination and to give women the pay they 
deserve for the work they do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her question. She is well known for 
having defended the questions of pay equity and rights of women in 
the community and in Parliament, and she continues to do so.
<P>
	She should be proud of being in a party, in a government, that 
has done so much for pay equity and the full rights of women.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Not only have we been among the first to accept the principle but 
we have been the first to have paid over $1 billion in order to 
implement it. At present there is a case in front of the tribunal and 
in that case the pleading has stopped a few months ago. We except 
the judgment to be as soon as possible in the next few months.
<P>
	We have already solved the question with some unions and I am 
prepared to offer to the unions involved, if they want to get a 
settlement quickly rather than having to wait for the judgment in 
court, to tell them let us sit down at a table and negotiate the issues 
so we can have a quick judgment.

<P>
	According to labour force statistics released today, 44,000 full 
time jobs for women disappeared in January. Medical technicians, 
educators, clericals and other women's jobs in the public sector 
have led the cuts. This Liberal government cut 45,000 jobs and 
thousands more  were lost as a result of a $7 billion cut to health 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	Will the acting Prime Minister acknowledge that women's jobs 
have never been a priority for this government, or have the Liberals 
entirely written off women as productive workers in the economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting that hon. 
members across only seem to ask questions about women's 
equality and women's economic autonomy on International 
Women's Day. What happens to the rest of the year?
<P>
	We spent a whole year as a government dealing with issues of 
women's economic autonomy in terms of training, literacy and 
looking at women's transfer payments from their custodial parents 
for their children, sustainable training for women, bringing women 
into the real world where construction jobs are open to them. We 
spent every single day analysing in every single department 
through gender based analysis the issues of the reality of women's 
rights and how our government impacts on it.
<P>

to think about this on International Women's Day.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am indeed pleased to rise today to speak to this motion 
put forward by the Bloc which condemns the federal government's 
lack of political will in refusing to take positive action in its areas 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8786"> 8786 </A></B>
<P>
of jurisdiction to  promote economic equality between men and 
women, and so on.
<P>
	Today, as I speak to this motion, I would particularly like to 
dwell on the elements of the motion that deal with economic 
equality between men and women and the government's place in 
that.
<P>
	It certainly is a discussion that is appropriate for this, the day 
before International Women's Day, and in the period of 
International Women's Week.
<P>
	As I speak to this idea of economic equality between men and 
women, it is an issue that affects those in Quebec as well as in the 
rest of Canada. As I go forward, I want to address two issues. First, 
what has the government done on each of these parts of the 
question, and what has the government done specifically on the 
economics of this country? Second, what has the government done 
in terms of equality issues in this country?
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Lately the government came forward with its budget. This is a 
government that has been in power for the last three and a half 
years. I would like to put to this House that the Liberals are hiding 
the facts of their record within that time period.
<P>
	We now have in Canada record consumer debts. We have in 
Canada record personal bankruptcies. Today there are 1.5 million 
Canadians unemployed and 76 months straight of unemployment at 
over 9 per cent. This is the worst record since the depression.
<P>
	Today two to three million Canadians are underemployed. Today 
one in four Canadians is worried about losing their job. We have to 
show for the last three years over $100 billion more in debt and 
now we have a record $600 billion debt to pass on to our children as 
they come into the workforce. In this time, average family incomes 
have been cut by $3,000.
<P>
	Earlier today I heard Liberal MPs saying that it is up to 
Canadians who have had to make tough choices. There have been 
cutbacks. I want to talk about those in a minute.
<P>
	I hear Liberal MPs talking about tough choices to other 
Canadians while increasing payroll taxes by approximately 73 per 
cent and making the tough choice to maintain their own pensions. It 
is five times greater than what other Canadians can have. Is that 
making tough choices on that side of the House?
<P>
	Most of the deficit fighting this government has done has been 
on the backs of taxpayers with 36 tax increases since 1993. Most of 
the rest has been on the backs of the provinces with $7.5 billion 
reduction in transfer payments.
<P>
	About 92 per cent of the reduction in the deficit to this date has 
been a direct result in tax revenue increase. As I have mentioned, 
they are ready to kill more jobs with the CPP tax increase of 73 per 
cent.
<P>
	While with the transfer cuts they have cut funding to health and 
post-secondary education funding, the government will spend $4.2 
billion to subsidize its crown corporations like the CBC and 
Canada Post.
<P>
	This government's vision, the Liberal vision, is a country where 
average taxpayers send $10,200 to the federal government each 
year, and $3,400 of that every year from every taxpayer is to 
service the debt alone.
<P>
	The Liberal vision is a country where 7.3 million Canadians 
earning less than $30,000 pay 17 per cent of their incomes to the 
federal government.
<P>
	What has this government done in terms of economics? It has 
slashed transfer payments. It has made choices that have not been 
the priority of Canadians, like health care. It has increased our debt. 
It has made no commitment to deficit elimination and it has done 
poor service to Canadians.
<P>
	What has this government done on equality issues? I would like 
to spend most of my time, as other speakers have, on this area. 
Canada has taken a leadership role. I saw that firsthand at the UN 
Beijing conference. It has taken up the standard of gender equality 
along with other nations. With this gender equality stance, it has 
promoted the theme of equal outcome for men and women.
<P>
	The Reform Party looks at this theme and says equal outcome is 
not the issue. Individuals, regardless of who they are, should have 
equal opportunity in the job opportunities.
<P>
	Success in terms of gender thinking is measured by full 
workforce participation and economic independence and 
autonomy, as we have already heard from the secretary of state 
many times today.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	I ask, is this true equality? I say to the House that a person, 
whether male or female, who has equal protection under the law of 
the land and the equality of choice and opportunity in society: that 
is equality.
<P>
	If we look at the history of the women's movement there have 
been equality seekers, first in the fight for the right to vote, the 
opportunity to put their name on a ballot. There has been equality 
of entry into occupations. There have been pioneers throughout the 
years who have put forward arguments to put women in certain 
occupations. There has been equality for entry into positions of 
leadership. Women have been elected to the House who are helping 
to lead the country politically; there are women business leaders, in 
teaching and in the sciences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8787"> 8787 </A></B>
<P>
	The history of the women's movement is the fight for equal 
opportunity, for their place in society and they have done well. 
The history of the women's movement is the freedom to make 
economic and political choices according to their own desires and 
dreams. Women want freedom to make those choices. True 
feminism is a belief in women and in the choices and in the 
wisdom of the choices they will make. As I have travelled through 
Canada and through my own riding of Port Moody-Coquitlam 
my belief in that kind of feminism is strengthened by what I see. 
The majority of students graduating from university are women. 
They are taking positions of leadership with great success.
<P>
	More women than men are starting up their own businesses. 
Statistics show that the likelihood of their success is greater than 
that of their male counterparts. They have shown excellence in 
non-traditional roles. Yesterday I learned of an insurance company 
that in four of its six regions the top sales persons were women. 
There is also excellence in the traditional roles.
<P>
	The Liberals are out of touch with the real women, with their 
potential. In their very policies they deny women the respect for the 
abilities they possess.
<P>
	The greatest concern I see in gender analysis and equality 
philosophies is the rejection of diverse opinion. In gender analysis 
there is a blindness to constructive alternatives to ways of doing 
things in society. The main theme of gender analysis and policy 
making, as I saw in Beijing and I see in government policies, is that 
it drives always and ever to economic independence and autonomy 
for women. It drives to equal outcome and equal participation in 
the workforce. It would demand a social revolution, a remaking of 
society, and a mandate for people to follow in its dictated choices 
in order to do so.
<P>
	In the last 20 years we have been witness to the progress of this 
agenda. In the last 20 years the movement has been toward two 
working parents. Presently it is seven out of ten households, up 
from three out of ten. However, within that time the total household 
income is virtually the same.
<P>
	Seventy per cent of women are now in the workforce. In the last 
30 years divorce has increased 800 per cent. In fact, Canada has 
one of the highest divorce rates in developed countries. As we have 
heard, the tragedy of that is the poverty rate. It is greatest among 
the single mothers who are very often the product of those family 
break-ups. It is shown that the economic impact of divorce is the 
greatest on women.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Federal taxes of the average family, according to the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, November 1992, was $1,894 more in 1990 than in 1984. 
Recent statistics have told us that the after tax earnings of an 
average household have actually fallen by $3,000 since the 
government came to power. As  I have mentioned, 36 tax increases 
have been implemented by the federal government alone to help 
make that happen.
<P>
	These kinds of things happening in society have very real results. 
They are not just numbers. According to government statistics 
child poverty has increased by 40 per cent since 1989. Youth 
violent crime has doubled in the last nine years. Canada is among 
the highest in the world in youth suicides. Today we have less 
money because of cutbacks to direct toward needed programs for 
those who actually need government help because of debt servicing 
charges and wasteful government spending.
<P>
	In the last couple of days we have heard about government 
spending going toward a prison art foundation in New Brunswick 
of $100,000; $87 million to Bombardier; $300,000 to friends at the 
Shawinigan Industrial Centre. Are these the choices of the men and 
women in Canada? Is this compassion? Do these programs reflect 
the priorities of most women?
<P>
	Who sets the goal? Who defines the standard of success for 
women? Do most women define success as equal workforce 
participation? Or do most women define success for themselves, 
that of their friends and of their communities as safety in their 
streets, an opportunity to achieve for all Canadians, a government 
that can provide help for those who cannot achieve hope for their 
youth and for their children and strength in their homes. This is 
what most women and men define as success, not equal workforce 
participation.
<P>
	The government, as I mentioned, rejects diversity in its 
definition of gender equality. The government has chosen to follow 
a gender feminist philosophy. Quoting from the government's 
material: ``Status of Women works to ensure women's equality is 
integrated into all federal government legislation, policies, 
programs and initiatives'' .Women's equality is defined as 
autonomy and equal workforce participation. What is the price of 
that? The simple dollar price for the status of women in the main 
estimates is $17 million of tax funds every year plus $8 million 
more in grants both in 1996 and 1997, and that was tripled from the 
previous year, 1995-96.
<P>
	The price of the status of women policies goes far beyond the 
dollars that go into that program. I will quickly give three 
examples. First, the government's commitment is to women 
working. The finance minister in a letter refused to even consider 
tax change proposals that might be a disincentive for a spouse to 
work.
<P>
	I have with me today a letter from a constituent who supports the 
fresh start platform of our party which increases the spousal 
exemption from $5,380 to $7,900, thereby levelling the field for 
parents who choose to stay home to care for their children and 
extending the child care deduction of $5,000 to every preschool 
child, including children whose parents stay at home to care for 
them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8788"> 8788 </A></B>
<P>
	My constituent states: ``Before my child was born in 1994 I was 
employed as a social worker for the B.C. government. I saw the 
effect of parental absence from the home in young and teenage 
children and decided that to raise a child properly I needed to be 
in the home caring for my child. My husband and I have faced 
extreme financial hardship as a result of this decision but still feel 
that children and family are the most important factor in our 
lives''.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	She goes on to say: ``I hope that all women and men merely have 
a choice to be parents first, and to find this role to be of equal 
importance to a career''.
<P>
	The Liberal Party rejects Reform's proposal of a child care tax 
credit to all parents, and instead chooses to reward only those who 
put their children in receiptable day care.
<P>
	The government shows zero tolerance feminist style. It seems 
appropriate that I mention a Vancouver planning meeting at the the 
Vancouver status of women location which was held last 
November. I have the notice for that. It says: ``Come help organize 
for the 1997 International Women's Day event''. This meeting was 
held on November 19 at 7.30 p.m., at the Vancouver Status of 
Women, Grant Street, ``all women welcome''.
<P>
	Two women were refused entry at that meeting. They were 
identified by the people there as pro-lifers. Not only were they 
refused entry but there was attempt made to forcibly remove them. 
Police were called. By the time the altercation was finished, 
medical attention was required. Cameras were broken and bruises 
were received.
<P>
	The Vancouver police have recommended to the crown 
prosecutor that charges be laid because of this event at the 
Vancouver status of women location. The Vancouver status of 
women has received federal grants which total $917,000 since 
1984. When the Secretary of State for the Status of Women heard 
of this, she gave her apologies but replied in a statement that this 
was not in her backyard. This mind-set is in her backyard.
<P>
	Last year she made this statement: ``This government believes 
each and every individual, group and community in Canada must 
be treated equally and with respect''. Yet what has she done to 
address this very real event that occurred at the Vancouver status of 
women location which is connected with her department?
<P>
	Status of women and the gender equality thing is no equality of 
choice and no recognition of various sentiments or ideas of many 
women. It does not recognize the importance of parenting. It does 
not recognize the importance of other opinions.
<P>
	Another example of rejection of other opinions is what we saw 
lately in Bill C-41, a bill that spoke to child support and access. 
Like so much of what the Liberal government does, it referred to 
one side of the argument  and forgot that there are two players. In 
fact in Bill C-41, which dealt with divorce and child support, there 
are more players. There are the custodial and non-custodial parents 
and the children.
<P>
	This bill gave rights to the custodial parent, responsibilities to 
the non-custodial parent and basically left the ball there. Who will 
pay for unequal treatment? Who will pay for a bill that does not 
address the real needs of those who are involved in child support 
and access issues? Who will pay for the unequal treatment of 
Canadians in Bill C-41? Not only the non-custodial parent but the 
children involved in the process of a divorce procedure which will 
not serve their purposes.
<P>
	I will reiterate. We have a society that would like to recognize 
the uniqueness and the freedom to make choices for all Canadians. 
It is not equal workforce participation but things like safety on the 
streets, incentives to achieve, help for those who cannot, hope for 
our youth and strength in our homes which is where most 
Canadians feel the priorities of government should be.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was quite 
surprised by the comments of my colleague, the fact that she 
skipped away from the main subject matter, which is to recognize 
that there is a lot more work that still needs to be done in order to 
ensure there is equity in our society.
<P>
	Simply put, all she had to do is look at the latest Statistics 
Canada report which shows that women still earn less than their 
male counterparts. They earn only 73 per cent of what males earn.
<P>
	As well, there is a lot more work that needs to be done in 
particular for women with disabilities, women from visible 
minorities and aboriginal women. Opportunities for those women 
are still not there.
<P>
	I want to also indicate that my colleague did not take into 
account what this government did in terms of action taken, 
particularly in the area of the Employment Equity Act which 
recently was introduced by this government. How handy that 
Employment Equity Act is. It is incredible.
<P>
	On the occasion of International Women's Day, this new 
legislation would extend coverage to include federal public 
servants, agencies and commissions in ensuring that employment 
equities are a must. It would increase the legislative authority of 
the Canadian Human Rights Commission to initiate investigations 
of employment equity issues and subject federal contractors to 
mandatory compliance with the principles of the act.
<P>
	As well, I would like to inform my colleague in case she is not 
aware that a total of 350 large private sector employers, crown 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8789"> 8789 </A></B>
<P>
corporations and industries such as  banking, communications and 
transportation are covered by the legislation.
<P>
	Under the act, these organizations have to satisfy their 
obligations in terms of employment equity. For example, they have 
to conduct a workforce analysis to determine the degree of under 
representation of the designated groups, as I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	They have to review employment systems, policies and practices 
to define employment barriers to members of these groups. They 
have to prepare a short term plan, one to three years, with measures 
to remove any barriers, make reasonable accommodation and 
institute positive policies and practices by setting goals and 
timetables for hiring and promotion.
<P>
	Finally, they have to set longer term objectives and strategies to 
increase the overall representation of designated groups in their 
workplace.
<P>
	These are examples of what this government has done over the 
past three years in order to address employment inequities that 
exist in our society. These are some of the measures that this 
government has taken in order to ensure that women receive the 
treatment and equality they deserve and which they have earned 
and which is their right in our society.
<P>
	To that extent, my colleague made reference to the government 
initiatives on attacking child poverty. The government should be 
very proud of what it has done on the whole notion of child poverty 
and trying to deal with the question of child poverty.
<P>
	We will not cease to continue our work to ensure that children 
who need assistance and support will receive the support and 
assistance they need.
<P>
	Members opposite, particularly in the third party, were up on 
their feet opposing the vast majority of initiatives taken by this 
government in trying to address issues of equity, equality, fairness, 
support for people who need support and assistance.
<P>
	Now we stand up and talk about initiatives that the third party 
has proposed. Let us put them on the record. Let us examine some 
of those initiative. In fact, none of those initiatives will seriously 
and effectively deal with the issue of poverty, particularly child 
poverty.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I would like my colleague to tell me what her difficulties are 
with the latest federal government initiative dealing with child 
poverty, and specifically what part of the federal government's 
proposed legislation in dealing with child poverty does she 
disapprove of. How would she replace it and with what?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure where to start with what 
I have just heard. From employment equity to child poverty, this 
government's policies are abysmal. It has caused the very child 
poverty it is talking about. It used to take 40 hours a week to 
maintain a household on  an average wage. Now it takes over70 hours a week to maintain a household in this economy.
<P>
	How in the world can a single parent on an average salary not be 
in poverty with what this government has done to our Canadian 
families? Is it any surprise that single parents are in the highest 
percentage of poor people in this country? It is simply because they 
cannot survive on what this government has done in the 
marketplace.
<P>
	We have a policy that we brought forward that is very different in 
concept and philosophy to what the Liberal government has done. 
In our fresh start program we state that we must first reduce the size 
of government. We must go through government programs that 
have duplication and are wasteful. Let us take $87 million to 
Bombardier, for instance. That may be a good start. We have 
programs that give money to crown corporations which waste 
Canadian tax dollars. It is taken from programs that it wants to 
have and it is taken from the pockets of taxpayers.
<P>
	We must first reduce the size of government and then give tax 
relief to families. Our tax relief proposals will take 1.2 million 
Canadians off the tax rolls altogether. Right now, why should 
someone earning $30,000 a year pay any tax at all? We would take 
the vast majority of those same Canadians off the tax rolls 
altogether. That is how you help the poor. Do not tax their families 
and say we are helping the children. That is Liberal logic and 
makes no sense at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleague from Port Moody-Coquitlam for her 
comments and for what she has contributed to the debate. I would 
like her to comment on some observations I have made during this 
whole debate.
<P>
	I would like to quickly touch on three or four gifts that the 
Liberals have given to women in this country and their children. 
The first gift is that 50 cents of every $1 a working woman and man 
makes in this country goes to taxes in one form or another because 
of this Liberal government's contribution to that high rate of 
taxation. How can we expect families not to live in poverty if50 cents of every $1 that they earn is taken away in taxes in one 
form or another?
<P>
	This government's policies have created the very child poverty 
and family poverty it is now recognizing and pretending has 
suddenly appeared. It has appeared because of the misguided, 
reprehensible policy directed at reducing the economic power and 
stability of families.
<P>
	We look at the double digit unemployment that has hovered in 
that area for the last three years which includes women. We look at 
the $100 billion addition to our federal debt and the enormous 
amount of interest we have to pay in addition to the tax revenue we 
have just to pay the interest on that debt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8790"> 8790 </A></B>
<P>
	We also, of course, look at the latest statistics, another gift from 
this Liberal government, 44,000 women unemployed this month 
alone. That is the gift from this Liberal government to working 
women and their children. I wonder if my colleague would care 
to comment on some of those points.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, simply put, I think my colleague has 
addressed some of my concerns very well.
<P>
	The government that thinks it has the solutions to all Canadians 
rather than leaving those solutions and those choices in their hands 
is a government that is headed for disaster and is heading our 
country and our children into disaster.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the eve 
of International Women's Day, it is appropriate to take a look at the 
current situation. I would love to be able to tell you that I am 
pleased that progress has been made. Unfortunately, I cannot do so 
in reference to women, and the children for whom they are 
responsible, in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	In fact, the new unemployment figures released this morning 
reflect a situation that women have been experiencing for the last 
three years. Indeed, this morning we learned from Statistics 
Canada that 44,000 full time jobs were lost last month, while-and 
this is no compensation, far from it-14,000 part time jobs are said 
to have been created. The net loss for women is 30,000 jobs.
<P>
	It would be one thing if this was just a blip, just a bad month in a 
period during which the situation was improving for women, but it 
is not the case. Since this government came to office, in fact since 
one year after the beginning of its mandate, only 10,000 full time 
jobs have been created for women, compared to 140,000 part time 
jobs. The reality for women is that a large number of them are part 
time workers because they have no other option.
<P>
	In Quebec and in Canada, the majority of part time jobs are held 
by women. Also, the unemployment rate for certain groups of 
women is higher than the national average. We know that women 
are in jobs that have traditionally been reserved for them, and for 
which they are often paid less than the average salary for men.
<P>
	In 1993, women's earnings represented 75 per cent of the 
average salary for men, a proportion which remains basically the 
same year after year. Given these conditions, and knowing how 
hard it is to find full time jobs-with these being usually low 
paying occupations that pay less than men's occupations-one 
realizes the importance of social programs for women.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	But what have we seen since this government came to power? 
Not just an erosion, because ``erosion'' is a word suggesting slow 
breakdown; and ``illusion'' does not really describe the situation 
either. What we have seen is a radical decrease in the coverage 
provided by social programs to women and women with children.
<P>
	Whether it is employment insurance, the successor to 
unemployment insurance, slashed deeply by this government, or 
the equally radical decrease in social transfers that forced the 
Government of Quebec to cut social services, education and 
welfare, social programs have been very hard hit.
<P>
	I was struck by a passage in the finance minister's budget 
speech, enthusing how proud he was that Canada had gone from the 
bottom spot among the seven richest countries, the G-7, to the top. 
Why was he proud? Because of the fight to bring down the deficit. 
So Canada is congratulating itself because it is the most successful 
in bringing down the deficit.
<P>
	But I asked him the other day why he was content to be near the 
bottom, not this time of the richest countries, but of the 28 
developed countries in the OECD. Canada is bringing up the rear, 
with New Zealand and the United States. And this is on the basis of 
the 1990 figures, which do not take into account the radical cuts we 
have seen over the last three years.
<P>
	There is a widespread myth in this country that Canada's social 
programs are extremely generous. This is not the case. Compared 
to other developed countries, our social programs are anaemic. So 
when we see the Minister of Finance crowing because Canada now 
tops the list of countries that are making cuts in order to  lower their 
deficit, with no concern for the effects on women and children in 
particular, on families, on the most disadvantaged in society, when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8791"> 8791 </A></B>
<P>
Canada was already lagging behind in this social protection, there 
is cause not just for concern but for real distress.
<P>
	There is also the fact that many women are poor, not only women 
who are heads of single parent households, but also women who are 
in a relationship and who are obliged, because of the many cuts to 
the social programs, to invest more of their time in addition to the 
effort they put into looking for a job, even a part time one.
<P>
	What they find is that unemployment insurance is less accessible 
than it used to be, that the tax benefits for children the government 
promised will in fact increase by only $33 per child in poverty this 
year and that, as far as the rest is concerned, this election promise is 
just as empty as the promise of a national daycare service, for 
which not one single cent has been forthcoming.
<P>
	When we see the effect of the measures on the poor and the 
reduction in welfare because of cuts, the life of women who are 
heads of households and those who live with a partner, who may be 
just as poor or who is a part of the middle class, and they want to 
have children or are having a difficult time giving the child a 
reasonable education, we realize that the situation for women has 
deteriorated. It is distressing. It is worrisome. I have a hard time 
swallowing the government opposite's smugness in the face of the 
void that women are having to face.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Employment is hard to come by and it is poorly paid. 
Employment insurance is hard to get and available for a shorter 
time. Maternity leave is not so readily available, and welfare has 
been cut and is hard to obtain. I hope next year's status report is 
different.
<P>
	Count on us to be a vigilant and effective opposition. We will not 
let you out of our sight. The women we represent today have 
enormous needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
think all members would agree the economic autonomy of women 
is an important issue, not only to talk about but also to act on.
<P>
	I raise for the member's consideration another aspect of the 
consequences to women and to children. We talk in this place about 
child poverty. The member will know according to the Vanier 
Institute that 50 per cent of marriages break down in divorce. When 
we consider the breakdown of common law relationships which are 
not reported in those figures we could conclude the Canadian 
family is in crisis. We need to address family issues as part of a 
strategy to address the economic issues related to women.
<P>
	The reason for this is that children are involved in 60 per cent of 
divorces. The custody arrangements by the courts are basically 
automatic. Women are awarded the custody of the children. The 
courts and society as a whole have decided that women are in the 
best position to care for children.
<P>
	We know that 23 per cent of all families in Canada represent lone 
parent families. What is worse is that those 23 per cent of families 
account for 53 per cent of all children living in poverty.
<P>
	Would the member care to comment on whether she feels the 
Canadian family is in crisis and the role or the economic condition 
of women might be helped if we were to help find ways to make the 
Canadian family stronger?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I must say I am somewhat 
surprised by what the member opposite has just said. Tomorrow is 
International Women's Day and I would have liked him to address 
this issue for once. What concerns him is that so many marriages 
end up in divorce and that there are so many common law 
relationships.
<P>
	A caring society provides families, single families and couples 
alike, not only with emergency help but also with the means to 
meet their needs. Down through the centuries, the family has 
evolved, and if it is evolving now it is largely due to the fact that 
the industrial society has become post industrial and disruptive.
<P>
	It is not up to society or to the government to decide what 
constitutes a family, and to spare no effort to make sure it remains 
that way. In any event, even if it tried, the government would not 
succeed. What we have to expect is that society will evolve to 
adjust to changes, and that the elements therein will follow suit.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	I agree with those who say we must help couples, but we cannot 
prevent society from evolving. We could mention education too; 
and I agree. Obviously, since relationships are not forever, we 
should teach men and women to put the well being of children first. 
I did say men and women. But this will never be an excuse for not 
providing a minimum of help to find employment, get an 
education, and support women and children. This will never release 
society from providing the bare minimum.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on the hon. 
member's motion, which deals with the government's lack of 
action to improve women's living conditions.
<P>
	I want to put this issue in a global context and go back to the 
federal cuts and their harmful effects on health, social assistance, 
employment insurance, old age pensions-not to mention the 
forgotten promises made  regarding employment and health-be-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8792"> 8792 </A></B>
<P>
fore finally discussing the federal government's inaction regarding 
the problems women are facing, particularly violence, poverty and 
children.
<P>
	The federal government cannot merely appoint a Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women and think that women's problems are 
automatically going to be solved. In spite of the valiant efforts of 
the secretary of state, any government action to help women must 
get the support of all the ministers, particularly the Minister of 
Finance, otherwise it is doomed.
<P>
	Recently, we noticed problems in several departments, including 
national defence, where a woman, who might have become 
Canada's first woman to reach the rank of general, was forced to 
leave the military because her colleagues were giving her a hard 
time. Women know how hard it is to be a woman in a woman's 
world, and even more so in a man's world. When it comes to work, 
we all know that women must do more to find their place in the sun.
<P>
	I feel strongly that concerted action by the government is 
necessary to further the cause of women. What we see is that the 
government has unfortunately failed to deliver. It has not really 
undertaken any concerted action and has considerably reduced 
funding for various social programs that might have helped 
improve the cause of women in this country.
<P>
	Some cuts and their effects: there are still, theoretically and 
legally, one and a half years left in the Liberal government's 
mandate, and we are hearing a lot more about the likelihood of a 
spring election than about new programs to try to keep a few 
promises.
<P>
	Has the government kept its promises to protect and to promote 
the rights and the cause of women? Unfortunately not. Women 
were the first to be hit by the Liberal government's never-ending 
cuts in funding for health, social assistance, unemployment 
insurance and education, as well as by the announced reform of the 
pension plan.
<P>
	In the area of health, in 1995 the federal government announced 
a revolutionary new program: the Canada Social Transfer. What 
this program really boiled down to was $7 billion in cuts in 
transfers to the provinces for health, social welfare and education.
<P>
	These federal health cuts are coming at a time when the aging of 
the population requires an increase in resources aimed at seniors, 
such as home care. Older women will pay the cost of lowering the 
government's deficit.
<P>
	As for social assistance, tighter eligibility criteria for 
employment insurance and continued high unemployment have 
forced many women to go on welfare. In 1995, Quebec held the 
dubious record of 485,000 households receiving income security 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	As for employment insurance reform, which bases eligibility on 
the number of hours, not weeks, worked, this penalizes part time 
workers, and we must keep in mind that 70 per cent of these are 
women. These workers will now contribute to the system from the 
first hour worked, but will have little chance of accumulating 
sufficient hours to qualify for benefits if they lose their job.
<P>
	By depriving numerous women of a replacement income 
between jobs, while the unemployment insurance fund surplus will 
total $12 billion in 1988, the federal government is choosing to 
make women who are working, and women who are unemployed, 
foot the bill for part of its deficit reduction.
<P>
	As for seniors' pensions, the federal government plans to bring 
in a system for calculating pensions according to family income in 
the year 2001. The calculation of how much pension a woman will 
receive will, therefore, depend on her husband's income.
<P>
	This measure will mean less money for couples, but also less 
independence for women. After all the years of struggle to obtain 
the recognition of women as persons in their own right, seniors will 
be treated differently depending on how much their husband's 
income is.
<P>
	Yet, 44 per cent of women over the age of 65 are living below the 
poverty line, compared to 25 per cent of men. Why, then, reduce 
women's pensions?
<P>
	A few promises have been forgotten. On March 4, 1994, the 
government voted in favour of the Bloc Quebecois motion urging 
the government to recognize the principle of economic equality 
between women and men and to implement measures to guarantee 
equity in employment, wages and living conditions for women. But 
the federal government has never put its money where its mouth is, 
despite its great eloquence on the matter at the time.
<P>
	A federal pay equity bill was passed, in 1977 according to our 
sources, but in 1978 according to the minister's, and the 
government is dragging its feet unduly on its implementation. The 
Public Service Alliance estimates that women may be owed in 
excess of $2 billion.
<P>
	The federal government's inaction in the area of job creation 
affects women in particular for they are, more often than not, the 
ones in precarious, underpaid, temporary or part time jobs. Women 
hold 69 per cent of part time jobs, but not by choice, for 500,000 of 
them would like to have full time work. Only 20 per cent of women 
have a full time job which pays more than $30,000, compared to40 per cent of men. Women, whatever their level of education, earn 
less than men. Even female university graduates make only 75 per 
cent of the salary paid to their male colleagues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8793"> 8793 </A></B>
<P>
	In the health and employment sector, the Liberal government 
also failed to keep its promises. It considerably reduced transfers 
for health care and did nothing to create jobs, although in its red 
book, it said on page 81, and I quote: ``The social and economic 
experiences of women provide the context within which their 
health needs must be reviewed. Canadian women are poorer than 
Canadian men, and there is a clear link between poverty and poor 
health''.
<P>
	The government's inertia continues. The government has done 
nothing about certain major problems that affect women, including 
violence. Community agencies that provide support and 
counselling for women who are victims of domestic violence, as 
well as the shelters for women and children have been severely 
affected by federal cuts in community assistance. The very fact that 
this sector was not spared by the government proves that violence 
against women is not a priority concern for the Liberals.
<P>
	In 1994, 70 per cent of poor people in Canada were women or 
their children, which adds up to 2 million women and 1.3 million 
children, and under the Liberals, the situation continues to 
deteriorate. We now have 1,600,000 poor children, and the average 
family income dropped by about $1,000 between 1994 and 1995. 
The government, instead of taking vigorous steps to deal with this 
problem, has reduced transfers to the provinces for social 
assistance, plans to provide minimal amounts that would be barely 
enough to survive and suggested that disadvantaged citizens go 
begging in the streets.
<P>
	When the latest budget was brought down, the Minister of 
Finance realized all of sudden that child poverty was a problem. I 
would like to point out that to fight child poverty, we must first 
help families with employment policies, social security and 
community support.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Institute of Child Health calculated that the best 
way to improve the standard of living of our children would be to 
develop a national job creation strategy for adults who have to 
support a family. That is pretty obvious. To improve the 
circumstances of women and their children, the government should 
listen to the suggestions coming from the official opposition and 
many women's groups, and act on those suggestions, and act 
positively by creating jobs for women and stopping cuts in social 
programs. Although theorically and legally women have equal 
rights, only economic equality will make them truly equal. Then 
maybe we will no longer need March 8.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from the Bloc for her comments and concerns in this 
area. We all have a vested interest in the  whole question of the 
equitable standards that women live and work in.
<P>
	There are three women in my family whom I love very much. 
Two of them are working. They would like to see from government 
a greater reduction in the taxes they have to pay. They look at their 
paycheques and they would like to see more expendable income 
left for them to support their children and buy the goods and 
services they need. I believe every working woman in the country 
would like to see that. That is how to strengthen the economic 
stability of working women.
<P>
	What has happened? The government participated in taking50 cents in taxes in one form or another from every dollar a 
working woman earns. I think this is wrong.
<P>
	In addition, in the next six years or so working women will have 
to pay another 9 or 10 per cent on their Canada pension 
contributions. This is what is weakening the economic stability of 
working women. Over the last month these policies have resulted 
in 44,000 women becoming unemployed and their children living 
in poverty.
<P>
	When I hear the minister across the way speak as she did this 
morning about all the wonderful things the government is doing for 
women, I cannot help but fight the feeling and thoughts of 
hypocrisy that well up in my mind. It was reprehensible, pathetic 
rhetoric.
<P>
	The best way to help working women and the children living 
poverty is by examining the policies that led to the situation. What 
policies over the last two and a half decades led to child poverty 
and were recognized by the government?
<P>
	One child in five is supposedly living in poverty. If the child is 
living in poverty the family is living in poverty. How could we 
expect anything but that when the three levels of government are 
taking 50 cents from every dollar they earn? How can we expect 
anything but poverty for these women and their children?
<P>
	I listened very carefully to my colleague's comments. I would 
like her to address the policies of the government that have led to 
family and child poverty which the government recently 
recognized exists directly as a result of the policies of the 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
all too clear that the government opposite is arrogant and has a 
certain disdain for the people of Canada because of its absolute 
majority in the House. It may continue to think it has no opposition 
across from it. The papers continue to say that the opposition is not 
playing its role and that the government continues to do what it 
likes.

<P>
	There will be a Grand Prix Sunday, because negotiations went on 
all night and all morning to reach an agreement with the 
government, which did not want to lose face and change things.
<P>
	It is always the same with this government. It makes the policies 
it likes. It rises in this House to defend the health of children. We 
are not allowed to use the word that comes to mind. I have little 
time left and I do not want it taken away from me. To be able to 
claim to be protecting children's health, the government should 
have made fewer cuts. When it decided to cut transfer payments to 
the provinces, it decided to increase poverty. It would bust its 
britches with its own self importance and continue to make 
everyone poorer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
proud to rise in my place today to speak to the motion by the hon. 
member for Laurentides concerning the socioeconomic condition 
of women.
<P>
	In the course of the debate I hope the House will not lose sight of 
the government's role to help women support their families. The 
issue of how Canadians care for their families should not be 
separated from a discussion about the socioeconomic condition of 
women.
<P>
	I will outline how the government is moving on three fronts to 
improve the well-being of women who care for families. Maybe 
this will respond to the previous questioner's concerns. They are 
assessing the value of unpaid work, reforming the national child 
benefit system and ensuring that child support payments are made 
when a family breaks up.
<P>
	The first issue is the unpaid work many women perform. It 
includes housework, care of children and care of other dependants 
such as the elderly. Most of this work is done by women, two-thirds 
according to Statistics Canada. This unpaid work provides the 
foundation of society. It keep our families strong. It serves as the 
bedrock of the social order upon which our paid economy can be 
built. This unpaid work is extremely valuable to society.
<P>
	In 1994 Statistics Canada placed a monetary value on it of$285 billion. Even while it contributes so much to society and the 
economy, unpaid work often has a detrimental impact on the 
socioeconomic well-being of women. For many it means they do 
not have the choice of entering the workforce. For others it means 
their chances of advancing in their careers is limited. For some it 
means a double shift that can wear them out.
<P>
	We need a better understanding of the role unpaid work plays in 
helping us promote the equality of men and women. It would help 
Canadians rebalance the sharing of family responsibilities.
<P>
	The government has established an overriding, long term 
initiative to measure and value unpaid work. In 1996 we counted 
unpaid household work, child care and elder care for the first time 
in the census. We expect to see the results in 1998 and will add the 
information to the time use surveys and evaluation methods that 
have already been conducted.
<P>
	Our efforts are now being directed toward a framework for 
evaluating the policy implications of unpaid work. Part of this is 
being developed through joint research with other OECD countries. 
In the years ahead we will use the information to improve our 
initiatives and to promote the socioeconomic equality of women.
<P>
	While the government takes long term steps to promote better 
policy it has also taken immediate action to improve the 
socioeconomic impact of how women care for their families. 
Nowhere is that more important than in the case of child poverty, 
the second broad issue I will outline before the House.
<P>
	Children's poverty is intricately linked with women's poverty. 
Many children live in poverty because they are under the care of a 
lone parent. That parent is usually a women and that woman 
usually has to make ends meet for herself and her children with a 
low paying job or with the support of the social safety net.
<P>
	The government has moved on all these fronts. In the last budget 
the Minister of Finance introduced an historic initiative, the 
national child benefit, which will provide more money to families 
where lone parent mothers must care for children. It builds on the 
child support reform introduced last year.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Under the benefit system, a Canada child tax benefit worth $6 
billion will be in place by July 1998. That is one step in a two step 
process to create the new system.
<P>
	Every step involved in the working income supplement, which 
will increase in July 1997 from $500 per family to $605 for one 
child, $1,010 for two children and $330 for each additional child, is 
good news for low income families with children who want to get 
into the workforce.
<P>
	In July 1998, one year after we increased the working income 
supplement, we will combine it with a child tax benefit. Benefits 
will increase to all low income families in which the parents have 
paid work as well as those who receive social assistance.
<P>
	As a result of these measures, more than 1.4 million Canadian 
families will see an increase in federal child benefit payments by 
July 1998. That represents 2.5 million children. Many women will 
see their socio-economic condition improve and find themselves 
able to take better care of their families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8795"> 8795 </A></B>
<P>
	The third broad area where the government has moved to 
improve the socio-economic condition of women through family 
initiatives involves the support payments for children should a 
family break up.
<P>
	Recently this House passed child support legislation based on 
the premise that when parents separate or divorce, a child's 
standard of living should reflect the means of both parents. 
Children are a shared responsibility. Both parents have an 
obligation to support their children.
<P>
	The legislation changed the way that child support payments are 
taxed. Child support paid under a written agreement or court order 
made on or after May 1, 1997 will not be deductible to the payer or 
included in the income of the recipient for tax purposes. Therefore 
the new tax rules will apply to all new orders or agreements made 
on or after May 1, 1997.
<P>
	The legislation also introduced measures to complement 
provincial and territorial efforts to enforce court orders. As a result, 
in a province's effort to enforce a court order, federal licences can 
be suspended and federal pensions can be diverted.
<P>
	Federal data bases, including Revenue Canada's, can be used to 
track defaulters. Passports can be suspended if a debtor is in 
persistent arrears.
<P>
	We also introduced child support guidelines to make the system 
more predictable and offer a simpler means to update awards. They 
have three main elements: child support payment schedules, rules 
to adjust the award to reflect four types of special child related 
expenses, and rules to adjust the award in cases of undue hardship.
<P>
	Part of the reason for introducing these guidelines was to cut 
down on the legal costs of determining child support. Money that is 
spent on lawyers would be better spent to support these children.
<P>
	These changes in child support legislation were long overdue. 
Soon lone parents will begin to benefit from them. In many cases 
these parents will be women, many of whom must struggle to keep 
their children fed and clothed.
<P>
	The burden of caring for a family under these hardships adds an 
enormous strain to the health and well-being of these women. It is a 
burden that contributes greatly to the socio-economic inequalities 
that women face.
<P>
	This is International Women's Week. It is a time to rededicate 
ourselves to the challenge of creating socio-economic equality of 
women. We acknowledge that much remains to be done to advance 
women's equality.
<P>
	The advances must be an inclusive process that engages all 
sectors and individuals to make changes happen. Governments 
cannot do it alone, but this government under the Prime Minister 
has taken some  very important steps to help ensure that we will all 
get there together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech by my hon. colleague, for whom 
I have great respect and who has given considerable thought to 
social concerns in general.
<P>
	I would like her comments on the fact that, in Canada, one in five 
children still lives under the poverty line and the number keeps 
growing. I would like her comments on the 10,000 jobs cut at 
Canada Post, the majority of which were held by women.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to know what she thinks of the cuts in social 
housing made since this government took office, the fact that 
housing used to be subsidized but now government no longer 
spends a red cent on developing social housing. It has passed the 
buck to the provinces. Add to that cuts in transfer payments, which 
interfere with the provinces' capacity to maintain their own social 
safety net.
<P>
	As she pointed out earlier, initiatives like the child tax benefit 
were indeed put forward. But, for a single mother raising two or 
three children, an extra $800 per year is not enough, when the time 
comes to pay rent at the end of the month, pay telephone bills or the 
groceries, if she wants her children to be well fed. Without 
adequate housing, when cuts are made, there is less for health, 
food, and so on; that is where the money has to come from. I would 
like to know what the hon. member thinks about this.
<P>
	I sincerely believe that all the policies that have been put in place 
will never compensate for the lack of focus on the needs of women, 
and therefore children, because they are the ones looking after the 
children. I sincerely think that the provinces should get more, they 
should get their fair share. The provinces are not asking for 
handouts. They want what is supposed to be theirs, the transfer 
payments they are entitled to, and to be able to meet the needs of 
women and children, within their jurisdictions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from the Bloc 
Quebecois for her kind comments.
<P>
	I do not think any government in history has been as concerned 
about the lives of women as this government in trying to improve 
the lives of women and to decrease the amount of poverty among 
women and children.
<P>
	When the finance minister was preparing his budget every 
government department was asked to look at every issue where 
there was a proposed cutback or whatever it was with regard to 
gender equality and gender issues. It was one of the most important 
things a government could be concerned about. It is too important 
to leave to  one person, as the minister responsible for women's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8796"> 8796 </A></B>
<P>
issues said this morning. We have to draw in all government 
departments.
<P>
	Maybe the member from the Bloc Quebecois was not listening 
too carefully to me. I outlined many areas where this government is 
concerned with women's and children's issues and the poverty in 
this country.
<P>
	I have time to expand on a couple of them. When one in five 
lives under the poverty line that is not acceptable, I agree, but if she 
had listened to what I said there are many measures that we are 
putting in place to try to decrease that amount.
<P>
	With regard to transfers to the provinces I can only speak for the 
province of Ontario, the area I am most familiar with. In terms of 
transfers to the province of Ontario, and I assume it is the same 
with the province of Quebec, the federal government has decreased 
the transfers since 1993 to today by as little as $1.5 billion. That is 
less than what our government departments were asked to cut back. 
I think it is around 11 per cent. Each government department has 
been cut back by 15 per cent.
<P>
	Why would a premier of a province then initiate a tax benefit to 
the people of Ontario? Who does this tax benefit or tax cut go to? It 
goes to the wealthy in the province of Ontario. They are the ones 
who are benefiting. Who are the ones who are being hurt in the 
province of Ontario? It is the poor people who are not benefiting. In 
addition, why has the premier cut back in education and hospitals? 
He must come up with $4.5 billion to cover his tax cut in the 
province of Ontario.
<P>
	Let us not blame this on the federal government. It is not our 
fault. That is four times the amount of money that the federal 
government has cut in transfers to the provinces. It is about time to 
put the onus where the onus should be, back on the premier of the 
province of Ontario.
<P>
	With regard to the 10,000 jobs lost at Canada Post, I have to 
assume the member is referring to junk mail.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	It is my understanding that that those 10,000 jobs will be picked 
up in another area with regard to the private sector which will then 
be providing the same quality of service. I hope that will be the 
case.
<P>
	With regard to the cutbacks in social housing, it is not my 
understanding that there are cuts in social housing. We are working 
with the provinces to increase social housing in this province. In 
fact, we are very concerned about some of the aspects of what 
different provinces are doing. Again I cannot quote on Quebec, but 
I know that in Ontario there is talk about privatizing and we are 
very concerned about any effort to privatize social housing in 
Ontario.
<P>
	I hope I have responded to her concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to ask my hon. colleague a couple of questions 
specifically about gender analysis.
<P>
	I am aware that because of the fourth UN conference on women, 
to which Canada was a signatory, it was recommended that there be 
a review in every federal department. It was interesting to note that 
the hon. member suggested that it was going forward and was in 
place at the present time.
<P>
	We should review all legislation as to how it affects women in 
particular, which is called gender analysis, although I think the 
secretary of state would say it is men an women, but it specifically 
goes to issues dealing with women.
<P>
	I know my hon. colleague is very concerned with families in 
Canada and certainly realizes their importance. I would ask if she 
feels that a similar kind of review should take place as to how 
government policies affect families in Canada. Are they not as 
important an institution as any other in this country? Should there 
not be a similar kind of government activity addressing how 
government policy affects family units in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam.
<P>
	I addressed in my speech how the child tax benefit helps 
families. I outlined the different amounts of moneys. Maybe the 
member was not in her seat at the time but I would be delighted to 
repeat what I said.
<P>
	Through the working income supplement and the enriched 
Canada child tax benefit program, the 1997 budget will help to 
improve the assistance available to children in low income families 
who are the ones who most need help. This will be increased by 
$195 million in June 1997. This will provide a maximum 
supplement of $605 for the first child, $405 for the second and 
$330 for each additional child.
<P>
	If this is not a major benefit and a major expense that this 
government is putting forward to help children, families and moms 
and dads, then I cannot understand her question. This is a major 
effort on behalf of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just for the 
record, this has been a great day where we all had a chance to make 
some brief and some lengthy comments concerning International 
Women's Day. However, we certainly all recognize the fact that 
notwithstanding what every government has done over the years, a 
lot of work still needs to be done.
<P>
	As my colleague from the official opposition very eloquently put 
it, in Canada, the richest country on earth, where we still have over 
one in every five children living below the poverty line, it is clear 
that our work is not done.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8797"> 8797 </A></B>
<P>
	However, one could say that at least we know the task has not 
been completed.
<P>
	Over the past three years the government-it has only been in 
power for about three and a half years-has done a tremendous 
amount of things in order to address many of the concerns that were 
raised by my colleagues. It has taken a number of initiatives to 
restore confidence which was one of the most important elements 
and concerns that faced Canadians over the past nine years. That 
was done.
<P>
	The second initiative undertaken by the government was to put 
its house in order. I would suggest, and my colleagues would agree, 
that our house is in order. The deficit is controllable. It is below$19 billion. The economy has grown at an incredible rate, higher 
than any other country in the western hemisphere. Interest rates are 
low and inflation is low.
<P>
	The next move is to invest. I would suggest with the budget 
discussion that was initiated by the Minister of Finance the 
government is now moving toward investments. Before I sit down, 
I would suggest that with another mandate I am sure many of the 
concerns raised by my colleagues will be addressed.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider, in 
conjunction with the provinces, the active promotion and implementation of the 
Unified Family Court in order to emphasize mediation in family law issues, and to 
improve the administration of the interjurisdictional aspects of family law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I brought this motion forward because the landscape of family 
life in Canada is changing dramatically and radically. Many factors 
are involved in this change.
<P>
	Those factors range from changes in technology to the mobility 
of persons, changing expectations even within society. But I would 
put to this House that perhaps the most notable change of all has 
been the change in marital breakdown within society.
<P>
	Divorce in Canada is too important to be ignored. It is too 
important for government to step aside and let what is happening 
happen. The patchwork legislation such as Bill C-41 is simply not 
enough, so I am pleased again to bring forward some suggestions 
that are in the process and relate to this very important item of 
divorce.
<P>
	Divorce is under federal jurisdiction and was made so in the 
British North America Act in 1867. At that time divorce was 
granted only if it could be proven that one spouse committed 
adultery. The jurisdiction was shared between the federal 
Parliament that enacted the law and provincial legislatures that 
gave courts the authority to grant divorce.
<P>
	In 1968 the grounds for divorce were expanded to include 
marital breakdown and marital offences where breakdown was 
defined as such things as desertion, imprisonment and separation 
for at least three years. Marital offence was defined as physical or 
mental cruelty. It was quite a span of time from 1867 to 1968 
before any changes were made at all to the law.
<P>
	In 1985 the Divorce Act was opened again. It was amended so 
that marital breakdown was deemed the only ground for divorce. 
That was defined as separation of at least one year, adultery and/or 
physical or mental cruelty.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the no fault provision, that is 
separation for at least one year, was used in 91 per cent of the 
divorces in the first year after the passage of that bill in 1985.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Between 1965 and 1988, before the first change to the bill and 
after the second, Canada has the record of going from one of the 
lowest rates of divorce to one of the highest in the industrial 
countries. The latest statistics state that approximately one in every 
two marriages today ends in divorce, showing another increase.
<P>
	This eight fold increase in divorce since the changes in 1968 
underlines a fundamental shift in our understanding of the basic 
concepts of marriage, children, relationships and others. They 
reflect a change in things like social mobility, lower birth rates, 
equality rights and entry of women into the labour force.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8798"> 8798 </A></B>
<P>
	Even though divorce is rampant, it is true that seven out of ten 
Canadians remarry. Marriage is not forgotten. However, the 
process of divorce takes its toll.
<P>
	As a society our concern is the major effect of this process on 
children and, therefore, the social and economic effects that result 
from that.
<P>
	Children are our country's most valuable resource. Scientists 
have said that there are certain developmental and cognitive 
predictors we can look at to see how successful they will be and 
how they will contribute to society.
<P>
	Scientists have noted life changes that affect children and have 
listed and quantified them. Some of the life changes that have 
dramatic effects on children are negative economic circumstances, 
particularly of women after divorce; erratic or no contact with the 
non-custodial parent; ongoing parental conflict or less availability 
of the residential parent because that parent may have to work.
<P>
	In contrast, the top factors that work toward positive 
consequences in the event of divorce would be the extent to which 
parents resolve the conflict surrounding the divorce, the quality of 
the custodial relationship and the extent of not feeling rejected by 
the non-custodial parent. These all have positive effects on 
children.
<P>
	As the government looks at legislation relating to divorce it has a 
responsibility in these areas, not in just one or two of them because 
they all affect children, the products of the marriage, and all too 
often the victims of the divorce.
<P>
	The signs of stress from this epidemic are everywhere. Youth 
suicides are escalating, teen pregnancies are escalating, youth 
violent crimes doubled in the last few years. Even such things as 
academic achievement, which has been shown to relate specifically 
to the security of the child and the feeling of belonging, in recent 
days has shown to be lacking in Canadian standards.
<P>
	When I think back to what the government did in Bill C-41, I see 
it as a dismal failure. Bill C-41 will create renewed legal wrangling 
between custodial and non-custodial parents and that will work 
directly against the best interests of children.
<P>
	The Liberal government is out of touch with the realities faced 
by Canadian families in their homes and in the process of divorce. 
Bill C-41 essentially relegates the non-custodial parent to the role 
of a money machine. The guidelines lack any recognition or 
encouragement of special circumstances or commitments of time 
or resources unless it is above a 40 per cent access threshold. It 
encourages an all or nothing mindset as to whether someone is a 
custodial or non-custodial parent. The justice minister has claimed 
that this legislation is designed to reduce conflict. Because of this 
legislation, the battle lines will be drawn earlier and the battle will 
go on longer.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Other factors are that access to the non-custodial parent are 
ignored and the non-adversarial atmosphere that is recommended 
is ignored. The government is blind to the real needs of Canadians 
and has refused to consider support and access together, despite the 
testimony of many Canadians and experts.
<P>
	One thing the government can do is move in the direction of a 
valuable change to promote more aggressively something that 
came through in 1974 from the Law Reform Commission of 
Canada. This was a suggestion to establish a unified family court 
system across the country.
<P>
	Federal officials say that the government has supported the idea 
of a unified family court ever since the law commission issued this 
report. Yet 27 years later we have very little to show for it. In 1974, 
the Law Reform Commission said: ``In some provinces, as many as 
five different courts may handle family problems. Overlapping and 
fragmentation occurs in the areas of custody, wardship, adoption, 
maintenance and divorce. This not only leads to multiplication of 
effort, but can produce irreconcilable decisions''. Twenty-seven 
years later, this is still the case.
<P>
	The commission also said: ``The most distressing effect of the 
present state of affairs is the despair, confusion and frustration it 
causes to the participants''. I would add, to the children of the 
participants. Divorce and separation are traumatic enough without 
being made more difficult by the court system. Yet little has been 
done to remedy the situation.
<P>
	Shortly after the commission report in 1977, Ontario 
implemented a unified family court pilot project in Hamilton. In 
1978, Saskatchewan set up a unified family court. Today, 
Saskatchewan has a family court in three urban centres and Ontario 
has it in five. Also, Manitoba and Newfoundland provide province 
wide access to a unified family court. Previous debate in B.C. and 
Alberta about the implementation of a unified family court has 
collapsed.
<P>
	Twenty-three years after a commission report, we have a 
convoluted variety of family court systems with no visible national 
commitment to establish a nation wide family court. Meanwhile, 
those who are suffering from the lack of action are families, 
especially the children.
<P>
	Stronger leadership is needed from the federal government to 
encourage all the provinces to establish unified family courts for 
the sake of children.
<P>
	A unified family court, according to the Law Reform 
Commission, should have the authority over most family matters, 
including the formation of marriage, divorce, judicial separation 
and separation orders, alimony and maintenance, custody, access, 
adoption and child neglect. The commission recognized 
differences of opinion over such matters as interspousal or 
interfamilial torts and  contracts, guardianship of the property of 
minors in interspousal or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8799"> 8799 </A></B>
<P>
interfamilial offences of a criminal nature including, of course, 
family violence.
<P>
	A unified family court offers several clear advantages for 
litigants over the present system. First, it will eliminate the 
problem of overlapping and fragmentation in many present rulings 
along with the confusion and frustration litigants face with this 
state of affairs. It can also save time and money.
<P>
	As the Law Reform Commission said: ``Present systems cause 
duplication of effort by judges, lawyers, witnesses, court 
administrators and the parties themselves''. This naturally leads to 
increased costs.
<P>
	Consolidation of family law jurisdiction in a single court would 
reduce the cost of legal services to the litigants. Not only are initial 
costs lowered but future costs can be as well.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Hamilton unified family court said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you come back to the court, say, five years later to seek a variance on a ruling, 
you can apply for it in the unified family court through a motion, which is simpler 
and less costly than the usual application that is required in other courts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Hamilton unified family court has also implemented case 
management, a more efficient way of processing court cases. A 
case is assigned to one judge who is responsible for seeing it 
through to completion. He can deal with the various aspects of the 
case and while doing so develop a familiarity with the litigants and 
their problems which will help him to guide them through the 
process as quickly as is helpful to them.
<P>
	Further to these benefits is the commitment in unified family 
courts to consider the dynamics of family conflicts. Judges in a 
unified family court specialize in family disputes and therefore can 
more effectively work with them on a personal and individual 
basis. A judge having developed a familiarity with a case can often 
offer advice. Also the litigants are saved the confusion of having 
various judges involved in different aspects of their situation 
offering contradictory advice.
<P>
	Family court judges also look differently at situations than 
criminal court judges. For example, they are responsible to take 
into consideration the best interests of the child. In the case of a 
wayward child, if the judge knows the child is involved with social 
workers from within the same court he may well treat the case 
differently from one in which the provision of help for the child is 
less clearly defined.
<P>
	Unified family court can also facilitate more effectively the use 
of mediation, an alternative to the adversarial and more destructive 
litigation process. Mediation is becoming increasingly popular as 
people experience the benefits of this approach to conflict 
resolution.
<P>
	I will speak specifically to mediation. Last year the civil justice 
task force report by the Canadian Bar Association made strong 
recommendations for increased use of alternative dispute 
resolution instead of litigation to resolve civil cases. Noting the 
increased use of dispute resolution methods such as mediation in 
place of litigation that is already taking place, the Canadian Bar 
Association urged even more dedicated commitment to pursue that 
such methods be made.
<P>
	It recommended that every jurisdiction make available as part of 
the civil justice system opportunities for litigants to use 
non-binding dispute resolution processes. While it did not advocate 
mandatory mediation it did suggest the use of incentives to 
encourage litigants to use dispute resolution methods and to do so 
as early in the process as possible.
<P>
	The Ontario government has recently launched a pilot project 
that imposes mandatory mediation as the first stage in all civil 
disputes. Interestingly enough it has accepted family conflicts.
<P>
	Why do we want to stop and look at mediation in family 
disputes? The Canadian Bar Association did not go specifically to 
matters of family law, but the principles and recommendations 
made by the bar have also been used effectively to resolve family 
disputes and are being used to one degree or another in different 
jurisdictions in Canada.
<P>
	The main concern about family conflicts that led to their 
exemption from the mandatory mediation pilot project was that in 
some cases it could involve domestic violence and other power 
imbalances in family relationships that some say would 
disadvantage women in the mediation process. However all 
provinces have had quite a bit of experience with mediation already 
and screening systems can be implemented to filter domestic abuse 
cases out of the mediation channel.
<P>
	The Divorce Act already requires lawyers to make their clients 
aware they can pursue mediation in place of litigation and to 
different degrees provincial governments encourage the use of 
mediation.
<P>
	Let us consider mandatory mediation. The commitment to 
mediation in family disputes must be stronger than simply a 
suggestion. Extensive documentation already exists about the 
negative effects of divorce on children. The adversarial nature of 
litigation and common battles over child custody leave even more 
scars on these innocent victims.
<P>
	As the Canadian Bar Association stated, court trials should be 
seen as ``an option of the last resort''. Rather than mediation being 
an option within the hands of lawyers I suggest that lawyers 
become an option only if mediation becomes unworkable.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8800"> 8800 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Is mediation the entire answer? Should consideration be made 
for counselling as well? The idea of courses before divorce, 
premarital courses, marriage and parenting courses has some real 
validity. The government minimizes by neglect the implications in 
societal contribution of strong marriages and so ignores such 
suggestions. The government minimizes by neglect the devastating 
effect of marital breakdown on children.
<P>
	As usual government policy is working against families without 
these recognitions being in place. Financial incentives for 
counselling such as tax credits or at the very least a GST exemption 
for counselling services would be a step in the right direction.
<P>
	Whether we make mediation mandatory or simply offer strong 
incentives which make it or counselling a more appealing 
alternative in most cases, the federal government needs to urge 
each Canadian jurisdiction to take seriously the importance of 
providing Canadian families with a practical alternative to 
litigation.
<P>
	The Law Reform Commission of Canada report calls for reform 
in our court systems to aid families. The recent Canadian Bar 
Association task force suggests dispute resolution approaches that 
are already proving effective in resolving family disputes in some 
jurisdictions. The benefits of unified family court and mediation 
process offer families something that is not now there in the 
process.
<P>
	Due to the growing concern over family conflict with today's 
level of divorce, due to the non-partisan nature of concern for 
Canada's children and due to the recognition there is much that can 
be done to prove their lot in society the motion deserves more than 
just one hour of debate. I therefore ask for unanimous consent to 
make the motion votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the issue 
of a unified family court although it took a long time to get around 
to that in the hon. member's address. It occurred to me that perhaps 
she was trying to use Motion No. 147 as a way to go back over Bill 
C-41. It is interesting that would be the case.
<P>
	It is also interesting since we are so close to International 
Women's Day that the member would again promote an 
anti-feminist agenda which promotes the interest of the boys and 
not of women as the Reform Party usually does.
<P>
	She suggests the federal government has somehow failed in the 
area of unified family courts when these  courts virtually exist all 
over the country. We are talking about a court system that requires 
a lot of provincial co-operation. She should return to her own 
province and speak to them about the importance of unified family 
courts and of co-operating with us on that process.
<P>
	It is unfair to suggest the federal government has failed here. A 
simple reading of the Constitution by a child would indicate that 
the court system is the responsibility of the provincial government.
<P>
	Unified family courts as they exist now have provided a model 
of co-operation in the administration of justice. Governments, 
providers of professional and community services, the judiciary 
and the bar have all co-operated to establish these in some 
provinces. Unified family courts send a strong message of what can 
be accomplished through the development of partnerships and the 
sharing of ideas. The federal government is ready, willing and able 
to be at the table but not all provinces co-operate. The federal 
government has supported the establishment of unified family 
courts for over 20 years.
<P>
	It is interesting the hon. member would cite the 1974 Law 
Reform Commission of Canada report. When we recently 
reinstated the commission the Reform Party voted against it. In any 
event she is relying on their old work and I suppose we should be 
thankful for that.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Discussions followed shortly after that report with all 
governments. What we found out at that time is that all 
governments were concerned over the division of jurisdiction of 
family law matters between two and sometimes more levels of 
court.
<P>
	In some provinces as many as five different courts were handling 
family problems. There was overlapping, fragmentation and 
different judges for custody, wardship, adoption, child maintenance 
and divorce. This led to a multiplication of efforts but also 
sometimes to irreconcilable decisions. This complexity also had an 
effect on the ability of families to resolve their disputes quickly and 
at reasonable cost.
<P>
	An additional concern for governments was the provision of 
adequate support services for family litigants. It was agreed that 
intake services, including referral to community based professional 
services, was essential for the effective operation of a unified court. 
Family counselling and family life education programs were 
recommended by the Canadian Law Reform Commission and 
enforcement services were also recommended that could take on 
the responsibility for ensuring that court orders were respected.
<P>
	In Ontario those enforcement provisions have fallen apart 
because Ontario wants to put in a multi-billion dollar tax cut which 
results in their not having enough money for their enforcement 
proceedings. My office and the office of other Ontario MPs are 
receiving requests for assistance every day to enforce their orders. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8801"> 8801 </A></B>
<P>
The hon.  member might want to keep that in mind when she is 
talking about tax cuts.
<P>
	There was wide agreement in 1974 that these kinds of services 
were important in ensuring that those who sought help could get it 
in the form most appropriate to their needs. In July 1975 Prince 
Edward Island became the first province to create a unified family 
court. Then, in May 1976 a funding program administered by the 
Department of Justice, under which the federal government agreed 
to cost share the operation of unified family court initially for three 
years, was instituted. Four other provinces then participated, 
Ontario, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and New Brunswick.
<P>
	The first unified family court was in Hamilton-Wentworth, 
established in July 1977, 20 years ago. In August 1995 the family 
court became a separate branch of the Ontario Court general 
division and expanded to London, Barrie, Kingston and Napanee.
<P>
	Saskatchewan established a unified family court in December 
1978. In December 1994 those services which started in Saskatoon 
were expanded to Regina and Prince Albert.
<P>
	A unified family court in St. John's, Newfoundland was 
established in June 1979, providing services to St. John's and the 
surrounding area.
<P>
	New Brunswick established a unified family court in 1979. In 
September of that year a court was created to provide family 
services at Fredericton. In 1983 a family division of the Court of 
Queen's Bench in New Brunswick was established to provide those 
services province wide.
<P>
	Manitoba did not participate in the pilot projects but in 1983 it 
established a family division of its Court of Queen's Bench to serve 
greater Winnipeg.
<P>
	All these courts, including one in Nova Scotia which is now 
being established, have been set up with the co-operation and 
financial support of the federal government. A unified family court 
will be one of the options considered in discussions on court 
structure for the new territory of Nunavut.
<P>
	Progress on the creation of a nationwide system of family courts 
has proceeded at a steady pace. It has been aided since 1981 by the 
maintenance of a pool of judicial salaries, pre-authorized by 
Parliament, that can be used as the need arises to fill positions 
created by provinces and territories.
<P>
	With respect to the unified family courts and the structure and 
the need they fill, I would like to talk a bit about the philosophy 
behind the unified family court as it exists. It is to able families to 
resolve their differences to the greatest possible extent in a single 
forum. This can only be done if the courts are given both federal 
and provincial powers to deal with all aspects of family law. This is 
something the Reform Party seems to forget.
<P>
	Since a large part of family law, including divorce and custody, 
falls within federal jurisdiction, unified family courts have to be 
established at that level. This ensures that the single court concept, 
one stop shopping, is maintained. Unified courts de-emphasizes the 
adversarial approach normally associated with courts of law in 
favour of a more informal dispute resolution approach.
<P>
	Alternatives to legal resolutions are sought where practicable. A 
wide variety of professional and community services are made 
available to court users.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	This model is seen as a way of making the court system more 
accessible, less threatening and more responsive to the needs of 
family members. It has wide acceptance among the public, family 
support professionals and organizations as well as the legal 
profession.
<P>
	There has been high degree of co-operation between provincial 
and federal governments in the process of identifying women and 
men who are best suited to exercise the role of judge in these 
courts. There has been co-operation on funding. For example, when 
Ontario expanded its court in 1995 the federal government required 
that the salary savings realized from the federal government paying 
judges' salaries instead of the province be funnelled back into 
support services for the court.
<P>
	Nova Scotia is willing to accept or has at least suggested a 
similar arrangement to assist in the funding of its courts. The 
obvious benefits for both governments are that we take over the 
payment of judges' salaries and the province uses that money that it 
has saved and it does not have to find new money to pay for 
important services.
<P>
	All the things that my hon. friend is suggesting are going on, 
while the federal government then has the assurance that it requires 
that adequate funding will be made available to support the court 
once it is established.
<P>
	All governments are wrestling with the problem of maintaining 
court services in attempting to reduce overall costs. To suggest, 
though, that the federal government is not doing its share is quite 
unfair. The hon. member talks about case load management like it 
is something new.
<P>
	Case load management in Hamilton-Wentworth grew out of a 
system in Windsor, Ontario in the federally appointed court which 
was applied to family matters and other matters. All courts are 
working with this.
<P>
	Mandatory mediations, all the things that the hon. member is 
suggesting, exist. They may not be mandatory but they do exist. 
After all, I would suggest to the hon. member that it is up to the 
litigants, the people who are involved, to decide whether they want 
to slug it out in court or whether they want to go to mediation. It is 
not up to the hon. member who, I would suggest, is following  an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8802"> 8802 </A></B>
<P>
agenda which is more suitable to the support of men's rights than to 
the support of the rights of families.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's motion on the creation of a 
unified family court. After reading her motion and listening to her 
speech, I am convinced the hon. member's intentions are good.
<P>
	The Reform member surely has valid amendments to propose in 
order to deal with family breakups, the increasing number of 
divorces, and the problems experienced by children following their 
parents' divorce. However, creating a unified family court would 
not solve these problems.
<P>
	In fact, it would create another problem. Whenever a change is 
made to a system, particularly the judicial system, the objective 
must be to improve that system. I do not believe that creating a 
court which would overlap existing tribunals would improve the 
system.
<P>
	It must be understood that, in the current system, as the Liberal 
member pointed out, the majority of provinces already have their 
own family court. In Quebec, the Superior Court's family division 
deals with all family related issues.
<P>
	So, establishing a unified court over the structure already in 
place in some provinces would be interfering in areas over which 
the federal has no jurisdiction. My main objection to the motion is 
that, once again, it ignores the respective jurisdictions in this 
country called Canada. The government is deliberately imposing 
national standards, or a very federal view, on anything that moves 
in this country.
<P>
	I am sure the member means well, but I think she should have 
examined this issue more closely. There is no reason at this time to 
create such a court, which would merely duplicate what already 
exists.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	I will give you an example to show how it would create more 
problems than it would solve. I am thinking of the famous trial and 
appeal divisions of the federal court. This is a court specifically for 
cases involving the federal government, when each of the 
provinces is equipped to settle these differences.
<P>
	But no, the federal government felt the need to have a court with 
trial and appeal divisions in order to complicate Canada's judicial 
system. It would be exactly the same thing if it were to institute a 
federal unified family court.
<P>
	I think that if we look at what is being done in the provinces, and 
I will refer to Quebec because I practised there for at least eight 
years, I know that in the case of family law, which is handled by the 
Superior Court, there are weaknesses, but there are also some 
things that work very well.
<P>
	I think that, if we want to help soften the blow of a separation or 
a divorce on families, we should perhaps try to find a way of 
actually helping affected family members. In Quebec, one of the 
methods we have adopted is compulsory mediation.
<P>
	The hon. member says that the unified court would be able to do 
mediation, but here again, this is already being done in a number of 
provinces, including Quebec, which has compulsory mediation 
services. This means that individuals involved in a divorce or 
separation are invited to meet with professionals in this field to try 
and reach an amicable arrangement. We do not need the unified 
court to do this. I think we should let the provincial legislatures try 
to find the right way to deal with the problem of divorce.
<P>
	At the present time, there is no evidence that the system is not 
effective, so I suggest we let the system be and try and find ways to 
improve it. Let me give you another example to show why Quebec 
cannot consider having a unified family court, and I am referring to 
Bill C-41, a bill that was discussed by the two members who spoke 
earlier.
<P>
	According to this bill, and I may remind you that the Bloc 
Quebecois was against this kind of legislation since in Quebec we 
already had a support payment tax rate structure that could be 
either federal or provincial. The criteria were not the same, the 
amount was not the same, and some aspects were perhaps 
important to people in English Canada, while others were more 
important to Quebec, so that the party making the payments could 
negotiate on which basis support payments would be paid. He 
would opt for the tax rate that suited his particular case, and it 
could be either federal or provincial.
<P>
	Still on the same subject, if a unified family court is established 
in Canada, this will open the door to various interpretations, to 
decisions that might be at odds with a family policy developed in 
Quebec, for instance, by the National Assembly.
<P>
	Clearly such a motion exposes the real cost of centralizing 
federalism. Everything possible is to be directed toward Ottawa. 
The aim is to take over provincial jurisdictions as much as possible 
in order to reduce the power of provincial legislatures as much as 
possible.
<P>
	In Quebec City, they want as much of that as they can get. As 
regards the family, if Quebec wants a structured view of the 2000s, 
it will first have to recover all its powers in family matters, 
including divorce. The Quebec Civil Code contains a part that 
provides for recovering all facets of divorce proceedings, and we 
are waiting for the federal government to decide to withdraw from 
this area.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="8803"> 8803 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	You will understand that, with Quebec claiming more and more 
powers in this area, we cannot support the motion by the Reform 
member.
<P>
	I repeat, I am sure her intentions were good in moving this 
motion, but they will not take her to the objective she set with such 
a motion. The result would be duplication, overlap and higher 
administrative costs in an area of jurisdiction that is exclusively 
provincial.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite a severe cold it is a pleasure for me to rise today to 
speak to Motion No. 147 brought forward by my colleague from 
Port Moody-Coquitlam.
<P>
	This motion calls on the government to work together with the 
provinces to actively promote and implement unified family courts 
and to emphasize mediation of family law matters.
<P>
	It is a sad reality that in 1990 about 30 per cent of all marriages 
in Canada ended in divorce. In 1990 the average length of marriage 
was shorter than ever before.
<P>
	Out of all divorced and separated Canadians, 350,000 are 
parents. We know about the emotional toll that divorce and 
separation takes on adults, but the impact of family law battles on 
children is even more traumatic. It should be of great concern to 
everyone in this House.
<P>
	The system, as it stands now, does little to alleviate children's 
pain. The administration of family law is a mess. This country 
seems to have forgotten the value of parenting and the importance 
of preserving the child-parent relationship in the context of family 
break-up. Instead, we have an adversarial system that creates 
winners and losers. Inevitably those who have the most to lose are 
the children.
<P>
	The administration of family law in Canada as it exists today can 
be summed up in three words, inconvenience, confusion and 
frustration. We know that family conflicts are seldom cut and dry. 
They involve many different issues. The break-up of a marriage 
that involves children can lead to issues of child support, spousal 
support, custody and property division.
<P>
	In most provinces, people who are separating are forced to go to 
different courts for different issues that come up. Divorce, custody, 
access and support issues cross over federal and provincial 
jurisdictions and create a tangled web of red tape that 
inconveniences, confuses and frustrates.
<P>
	For example, in most provinces if a couple decides to split up but 
not divorce and they want to deal with custody, access or support 
issues, they must go to one court. Then, if they later decide to 
divorce, they must go to another court. Then there is enforcement, 
which is generally a provincial matter. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	When will the confusion end? Is the whole process not stressful 
enough without aggravating matters by this sort of nonsense? What 
kind of impact is this having on our children?
<P>
	I can say what kind of impact it is having. There are studies out 
there telling us that the emotional toll that long, protracted family 
law litigation has on our children is simply devastating.
<P>
	This psychological damage is the root of many of the social 
problems we are seeing today, youth crime, suicide and poverty. 
This raises serious concerns about the future social health of our 
country.
<P>
	Anyone who has ever been involved in any kind of lawsuit will 
say that litigation should be the last resort. It is not as though this is 
news to anyone either.
<P>
	In 1974 the Law Reform Commission of Canada reported that 
the main goals of government should be to encourage resolution of 
family matters without resorting to litigation and to lessen the 
confusion by vesting jurisdiction over all family law matters in 
single, unified family courts.
<P>
	Here we are 23 years later. The Liberal government has spent a 
good part of its mandate reviewing family law issues. Yet it still 
does not have it right. This government has done nothing to address 
this sad state of affairs.
<P>
	We are still left with an adversarial system that destroys any 
chance of ongoing healthy relationships after the smoke clears in 
the courtroom.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	While there are presently unified family courts in Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Ontario and Newfoundland, not all are province-wide 
and the matters they deal with vary from one province to another. 
Some provinces do not even have unified family courts. We heard 
earlier from the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair as she took us 
through the history of the present unified family court system, that 
it is working in some provinces and that we have made substantive 
progress.
<P>
	However, the question that must be asked and which has failed to 
be answered is why is it so slow to get this process in place across 
the country. Why is it taking so long? It is because it is a very low 
priority for this government.
<P>
	Equally troubling is the fact that nowhere in Canada is mediation 
mandated as the preferred method for resolving family law 
conflicts. When relationships end it is only natural for people to 
blame each other and feel a sense of hostility. But if these people 
can be assisted and encouraged to respect each other as loving 
caring parents, this can only be good for the children involved. This 
government owes the children at least that much.
<P>
	The advantages of mediation are undeniable. The financial cost 
is much less than litigation. Most family law conflicts can be 
resolved in five to ten one-hour  mediation sessions. Mediation 
costs an average of $100 to $150 per hour. Compare this with the 
<P>

<P>
millions of dollars pumped out to family lawyers each year to 
battle it out in court.
<P>
	Mediation can allow parents to work out amiable solutions to 
parenting and support issues without being forced to use their 
children as pawns. This is better for everyone involved. It has been 
shown that compromises that tie access and support issues together 
will not only be emotionally better for children but also financially 
better.
<P>
	Several studies have linked non-payment of support with the 
non-custodial parents' frustration at being deprived of participation 
in their children's lives. For example, a study in 1995 showed that 
79 per cent of non-custodial parents with access paid their support, 
while only 59 per cent of those without access paid.
<P>
	It makes good sense that people are more willing to go along 
with decisions they have made themselves than with decisions that 
have been imposed on them. But the Divorce Act takes a weak 
approach to this issue. All it does is require lawyers to inform their 
clients that mediation is available, hardly an encouragement. The 
Bill C-41 disaster does nothing to address these procedural failures 
or to help families on an emotional level either. It is just a 
piecemeal approach which does more for lawyers and judges than it 
does for average Canadians.
<P>
	The list of problems with Bill C-41 is endless but what concerns 
me most as a parent is the fact that this government has not even 
dealt with the suffering of children, children who are denied the 
right to enjoy relationships with both parents, not just the custodial 
parent. Divorce is meant to end the marriage bond, not the 
child-parent bond. It is disturbing to realize that in 1992 Canadian 
courts awarded sole custody to mothers approximately 72 per cent 
of the time, and yet joint custody was only awarded 16 per cent of 
the time.
<P>
	I do not know if the government understands the impact of this, 
but in the words of the Canadian Council for Co-parenting, there's 
no hurt like it. Kids need both parents and both parents need their 
kids.
<P>
	I offered a solution to this problem. In March 1996, I tabled Bill 
C-242 which would make joint custody automatic unless not in the 
child's best interests, as in cases of abuse. Psychologists have also 
offered a solution called joint custody mediation which has been 
used with success in some American states. I call on this 
government to look closely at these options because so far this 
government has missed the boat on this issue.
<P>
	Bill C-41 misses the boat by only dealing with outcomes, not 
with actual process, a process that is leaving deep emotional scars 
on anyone who has the misfortune of being involved in it. If this 
government were more concerned with the process and especially  
with what it is doing to this country's children, the social cost of 
divorce would not be what it is today.
<P>
	Canadians are looking for some real procedural reform here, 
reform that addresses the current jumble in the administration of 
family, reform that lets Canadians actively participate in the 
resolution of problems in a way that is best for all involved. That is 
why I urge all members to support this motion. It is time the House 
demanded some action from this government. It is time we called 
on this government to work together with the provinces to 
encourage and implement reforms to the administration of family 
law in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated as a 
votable item, the time provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business is now expired and the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being 2.20 p.m., this House stands adjourned until next 
Monday at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.19 p.m.)
