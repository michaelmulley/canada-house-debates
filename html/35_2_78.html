	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 34(1), I have the honour to present to the House in 
both official languages the report of the Canada-Europe 
Parliamentary Association on the fifth annual meeting of the 
parliamentary assembly of the OSCE, the Organization for Security 
and Co-operation in Europe, held in Stockholm, Sweden from July 
5 to July 9, 1996.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the honour 
to present in both official languages the report of the Canadian 
delegation to the seventh annual meeting of the Canada-Japan 
Interparliamentary Group which was held in Toronto, Montreal and 
Ottawa from September 1 to September 5, 1996, as well as the 
report of the executive committee meeting of the Asia-Pacific 
Parliamentary Forum held in Ottawa from September 6 to 
September 8, 1996.
<P>
	The Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly important in 
Canada. Japan is now our second largest trading partner. Asia has 
become Canada's second most important trading region.
<P>
	The recently completed seventh annual Canada-Japan meeting 
focused on our growing and harmonious bilateral relationship. 
Discussions focused on bilateral and multilateral co-operation in a 
rapidly changing world. Relations with our other Asia-Pacific 
neighbours are also changing.
<P>
	Canada will be hosting the fifth annual meeting of the 
Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in January in Vancouver. The 
executive committee of the APPF just held a highly successful and 
productive meeting here in Ottawa and approved the arrangements 
for the Vancouver meeting. We look forward to hosting this 
meeting and to kicking off Canada's year of Asia-Pacific.

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present to the House 
three petitions which focus on Canada's economy, signed by the 
residents of York North.
<P>
	The first petition draws the attention of the House to the 
government's red book commitment to reduce the deficit to 3 per 
cent of the GDP. The petitioners call upon Parliament to continue to 
keep its commitment to Canadians and pursue its deficit action so 
that the government will reach its revised deficit target of 2 per cent 
of GDP by 1997-98.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEECONOMY">THE ECONOMY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition draws to the attention of the House that in the past 
year alone short term interest rates have declined three percentage 
points. For the last two and a half years inflation has averaged less 
than 2 per cent and by 1997-98 the federal deficit will have been 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4900"> 4900 </A></B>
<P>
reduced by $25 billion. The petitioners further draw to the attention 
of the House that since the Liberal government took office, over 
600,000 jobs have been created.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament to work diligently 
to continue to maintain a healthy environment for jobs and 
economic growth.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESSES">SMALL BUSINESSES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
final petition draws to the attention of the House the important role 
that small businesses play in our economy. They have created over 
85 per cent of new jobs and account for almost 60 per cent of 
Canada's economic output.
<P>
	The petitioners further draw to the attention of the House that the 
government is improving the climate for small businesses by 
addressing the need for financing, reducing overlap and 
duplication, increasing access to the information highway and 
assisting their ventures into exports.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to continue to create a 
healthy environment for small businesses, to ensure they have the 
financing they need and to help them explore and capitalize on new 
opportunities.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
present two petitions today pursuant to Standing Order 36.
<P>
	These petitions implore Parliament to introduce legislation 
which would prohibit criminals from profiting in any way from the 
crimes which they have undertaken.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions today.
<P>
	The first one concerning taxation of the family comes from 
Calgary, Alberta. The petitioners would like to draw to the 
attention of the House that managing the family home and caring 
for preschool children is an honourable profession which has not 
been recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
choose to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.

	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems or impair one's ability. Specifically, fetal alcohol 
syndrome or other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for Minister of Justice)</B> moved that

Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment,

<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased today to speak in favour of the act to amend the Divorce 
Act and other acts. Before I get into the details of the amendments I 
would first like to provide a broader context for the changes.
<P>
	There is a yearning in Canada today to focus on what we have in 
common and to return to basic values. Canadians do have values in 
common. We have not prevailed for 130 years and produced one of 
the world's most prosperous and successful nations without a 
foundation of shared principles and beliefs. When we set aside the 
quarrels about jurisdiction and the forms of the federation, and 
when we focus on the features that define us as a nation, we will 
find that what is common to every province and to every region of 
Canada is our shared values.
<P>
	We are a society that is compassionate, tolerant and civil. We 
take pride in social programs that are intended to protect the most 
vulnerable. We care deeply about our commitment to sharing. 
These values are reflected in the way we treat our children.
<P>
	Canadians understand the importance of early intervention of 
safe and secure childhoods if we are to enable all individuals to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4901"> 4901 </A></B>
<P>
reach their full potential. Canadians also place a strong emphasis 
on the importance of individual responsibility while governments 
have a role in helping the most vulnerable. We also believe in 
people taking responsibility for themselves.
<P>
	How do these values relate to our strategy for child support? 
They require laws and policies that produce adequate and 
consistent child support levels, that respect fathers and mothers 
who make their payments and ensure that those who are obligated 
to pay actually do so. Viewed from that perspective, I suggest that 
the measures we have proposed in our child support strategy very 
much reflect the fundamental values that unite us.
<P>
	The starting point is that the nature of the Canadian family is 
changing. There are more single parent families today than ever. 
When families divide, there are two households to support and 
fewer resources to go around and too often the children suffer. Over 
the past 20 years families headed by an individual parent have 
doubled in number. There are almost one million such families in 
Canada. In 1990, 61 per cent of single parent families headed by 
women lived below the poverty line. This compares to just 10 per 
cent of two parent families with children.
<P>
	The steps we are taking to strengthen and improve Canada's 
child support system will not end child poverty, but we believe 
these steps will help. These measures derive their value from the 
shared principles on which they are based.
<P>
	The principle that children should be first in line. These reforms 
will put them there and keep them there. Child support is the first 
and most important obligation for parents.
<P>
	The principle that a child's standard of living, both before and 
after divorce, should reflect the means of both parents. These 
reforms make sure that it does. Children are a shared responsibility 
and a divorce does not change that.
<P>
	The principle that people in like circumstances should be treated 
in a like fashion. These reforms will ensure that they are. Both 
parents have an obligation to support their children based on their 
ability to pay.
<P>
	The strategy we have adopted has four interdependent elements. 
One, we are introducing child support guidelines to establish 
appropriate and consistent support levels, and to reduce the degree 
of conflict between separating parents. Two, we are changing the 
way child support payments are taxed to make things fairer and 
simpler. Three, we are enhancing federal and provincial 
enforcement measures targeting the wilful defaulters to ensure that 
payments are made in time and in full. Four, we are helping 
working poor families by doubling the level of the working income 
supplement of the federal  child tax benefit over the next two years. 
I would like to describe each of these initiatives in more detail.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	At the heart of this approach are the guidelines that will be used 
across Canada by the courts, by lawyers and by parents to establish 
appropriate levels of support payments for children. At present, 
courts determine child support levels on a case by case basis. The 
issue prolongs litigation and adds to the anguish of the parents. 
Some suggest that the system is based on the principle that every 
person deserves his or her decade in court. Not all judges take the 
same approach or have the same philosophy. As a result, levels 
vary greatly not just across Canada but even within provincial 
jurisdictions and even from family to family.
<P>
	The amount that is available to pay for a child's needs should not 
depend on which province one lives in, to which courtroom the 
case is assigned or which party has the more persuasive lawyer. 
The guidelines will establish without the need for trial the levels of 
child support to be paid according to the income of the person 
paying. The amounts are calculated by a formula that takes into 
account average expenditures on children at various income levels. 
As income levels increase or decrease so will the parents' 
contributions to the needs of the children, just as they would if the 
family had remained together.
<P>
	The guidelines are standard but they are also flexible. No two 
families are exactly alike. Exceptional expenses for children can be 
added, such as uninsured medical expenses and child care costs for 
preschoolers. A court can also change the amounts if undue 
hardship can be established.
<P>
	This approach has tremendous strengths. It is simple and it is 
standard. It ensures that support paying parents with the same level 
of income pay the same level of child support as other parents. It is 
also easy to use and in the end it is easy to understand. There will 
be less reasons for parents to argue about what is and what is not an 
appropriate level of support. This means less conflict, lower legal 
bills, reduced legal aid and diminished court costs. The result is 
that a lot of money which would be spent on lawyers in courts can 
be kept in the hands of the parents for the benefit of the children.
<P>
	The second pillar of our child support strategy is a change in the 
way child support payments are taxed. Currently child support 
payments are tax deductible for the payer and taxable to the 
recipient. That rule was put in place 54 years ago. After carefully 
considering all of the circumstances we have concluded that this 
approach is unfair and indeed outdated.
<P>
	To begin with in the present age it is understood that parents do 
not need an incentive or a reward in the tax system to encourage 
them to pay support for their children or that a general subsidy by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4902"> 4902 </A></B>
<P>
all taxpayers toward  families that are separated and divorced is not 
appropriate.
<P>
	In any event the subsidy works best where there is a large income 
spread between the mother and father which is less and less 
common. Shifting income patterns have brought their earnings 
closer together. Where a mother earns the same as or more than the 
support paying father, the present system actually penalizes her. 
That is the case in over one-third of all separated couples and that 
proportion is growing. Even when the incomes are different the 
subsidy only works if the court takes care in each case to make 
complex calculations to gross up the amount awarded to take tax 
into account. This does not always happen in every case. The result 
is the tax liability eats into the support award and the losers are the 
children.
<P>
	Furthermore custodial parents do not want to have to administer 
the tax system. They are the ones who now have to calculate the 
amount due and pay it on April 30 of each year whether the support 
payments arrive late during the year.
<P>
	More fundamentally, child support is not income for the parent 
but it is money intended for the children. It therefore should not be 
taxed in the hands of the recipient.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The reforms will change the system. We are adopting what is 
known as a no deduction, no inclusion system. That means support 
paying parents will not be able to deduct their payments from their 
total income and custodial parents will not be required to include it 
in theirs. This no deduction, no inclusion approach will not come 
into effect until May 1, 1997 and it will apply to all new awards 
made after that date. It will not apply after that date to existing 
awards unless the parties agree or unless the court directs that the 
change be made.
<P>
	We are waiting 14 months before making this change effective 
for very practical reasons. We want the tax change and the 
guidelines to become effective at the same time. That way if parties 
to existing orders want to change their tax treatment the new child 
support levels can be taken directly from the tables without the 
need for individual assessment in each case.
<P>
	We anticipate that the provinces will create complementary 
guidelines to cover child support levels in cases under provincial 
jurisdiction so that the systems are uniform. The 14 months will 
enable them to do that.
<P>
	Finally, the time will be used in planning for the transition. 
Ottawa has budgeted $50 million to help the provinces develop 
simple and effective systems for dealing with the many requests 
that may be made to varied existing orders once the changes 
become effective.
<P>
	In the coming months governments, courts, professionals and 
other stakeholders will work together  so that these cases are dealt 
with quickly and effectively. The current tax system has been in 
place for 50 years. I do not think it is unreasonable that we take 14 
months to achieve a complete reversal.
<P>
	Let me address the concerns that have been expressed by some 
fathers about these changes. First, parents who now have child 
support orders or agreements will not be forced into a new tax 
system. Both parents may decide for a number of reasons that their 
support agreement is working reasonably well and should be left 
alone.
<P>
	Second, let me encourage parents to examine the guidelines that 
we have now published and consider how they may apply to their 
situations. They are the result of many years of consultations across 
Canada and they take into account tax levels and average expenses 
for raising children. The guidelines have been tested not only with 
family lawyers but with fathers and mothers, both custodial and 
non-custodial parents.
<P>
	Third, there may be situations of undue hardship in which the 
payment in accordance with the guidelines would simply be 
unrealistic or unworkable. We recognize that cases of hardship do 
exist and the new process can accommodate those situations.
<P>
	Finally, we are committed to monitoring these guidelines and if 
necessary they will be adjusted. Let me restate that in evaluating 
amounts our eye will remain fixed on the welfare and needs of the 
children. I think we can all agree on this objective. Of course a fair 
child support system is more than just setting levels evenly and 
taxing them fairly. It is also a matter of ensuring that payments are 
made in full and on time. Enforcement is crucial.
<P>
	Let me make it clear that a great many parents who make their 
payments on time and in full deserve our continued respect. They 
take their responsibilities seriously and they follow through. There 
are some who cannot pay because of misfortune: they have lost 
their job, they have fallen ill. They must ask the court to relieve 
them of their responsibility that they cannot meet. However, there 
are also too many who are in wilful default.
<P>
	As of last September almost half of the cases registered with the 
Ontario family support plan involved child support orders where 
absolutely no money had been paid. On the remaining half, only 
one in four was fully paid.
<P>
	Wilful and chronic default by people who can pay but refuse to 
pay child support is simply unacceptable in this country. These are 
not just people who turn their backs on their sons and daughters, 
they are also walking away from their responsibility as citizens and 
because they cheat their children all other Canadians are obligated 
to take up the slack.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4903"> 4903 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The prime responsibility for enforcement of child support orders 
currently rests with the provinces. A lot has already been done by 
the provincial agencies but the Canadian government also has a 
role to play, a role of leadership in co-ordinating, encouraging and 
complementing the provincial efforts.
<P>
	The measures we are proposing will support and enhance the 
strategies of provincial and territorial governments. We want to 
work with them in a common cause. There is a list of measures that 
we will now take. Let me mention just a few of them.
<P>
	Federal legislation will authorize the suspension of federal 
licences and certificates such as passports in the cases of persistent 
default. It will allow access by the provinces to the database of 
Revenue Canada to help trace persistent defaulters. It will invest 
money and effort in upgrading computer systems to share 
information among provinces to co-ordinate their efforts.
<P>
	The fourth pillar in the child support strategy involves a measure 
that is intended to help working poor families whether they are 
separated or still living together. The Canadian government 
contributes to basic income security for children through a child 
tax benefit.
<P>
	One component of that benefit is the working income 
supplement which provides a non-taxable benefit to supplement the 
employment earnings of families with net incomes below $25,900. 
At present, the maximum amount that is payable under the working 
income supplement is $500 per family each year. Over the next two 
years the Canadian government will double that supplement to 
$1,000 per family each year.
<P>
	The revenue derived from ending the deduction on child support 
payments will be used to fund the increase in the working income 
supplement. The result will be that over the next five years over $1 
billion of additional revenue will be put into the hands of about 
700,000 low income families in the labour force. About one-third 
of them will be lone parent families.
<P>
	The advantages of this strategy are obvious. The increased 
working income supplement is tax free and will go right to the 
bottom line for families that need dollars for their children. This 
supplement is distributed fairly, benefiting children of separated 
families and families that remain intact. And the working income 
supplement is targeted to those most in need.
<P>
	What will make these reforms work well is that they will work 
together. Guidelines will ensure consistent awards at appropriate 
levels with diminished conflict and expense.
<P>
	A tax rule that reflects the social conditions and values of 1942 
will be changed to conform to current needs and trends. Effective 
tools will enhance enforcement so that good people who make their 
payments will know that  those in wilful default will be pursued. 
Every dollar of increased revenue that Ottawa derives from the tax 
change will be ploughed directly back into a system for the benefit 
of children in low income working families.
<P>
	I invite the support of members of the House and their 
involvement in making this strategy succeed. Working together, 
Canadians can put children first. The government will put children 
first. It will put responsibility fairly on the shoulders of parents and 
and make our system of child support one of which we can all be 
proud.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-41, a bill which addresses various 
aspects of child support payments. Its objective is a praiseworthy 
one: to improve the situation of the children of divorced parents.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	On top of the emotional and psychological effects of divorce, the 
vast majority of these children have to deal with another kind of 
effect, which has an unfortunate impact on their daily lives. As you 
may have guessed, I am referring to the sometimes drastic drop in 
their standard of living.
<P>
	A brief presented two years ago by the now defunct Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women described the situation 
of mothers with custody, and how despair, emotional exhaustion 
and other family problems, such as custody arrangements, spousal 
abuse and child abuse, impact on the negotiation of child support. 
Sometimes these women accept lower amounts just to see the end 
of it, just to avoid continual confrontations, and this of course 
results in lower financial resources for them and their children.
<P>
	If there is one area in which governments can, and must, act 
directly, it is the area of children's and parents' living conditions. 
In introducing last March's budget, the government unveiled its 
action plan for child support.
<P>
	This plan had four components: removing child support from the 
tax system, creating and approving federal guidelines, 
implementing measures to ensure that support is paid in full and on 
time, and increasing the Working Income Supplement under the 
Child Tax Benefit.
<P>
	This announcement followed on the Minister of Justice's 
announcement in November 1994 that his guideline project would 
enable the government to save $1.5 billion yearly in social 
assistance payments, if 80 per cent of parents in arrears with child 
support were to start paying. It can be seen, then, that the federal 
government had two things in mind: improving the children's 
situation and saving itself considerable amounts of money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4904"> 4904 </A></B>
<P>
	This government intervention is one of a set of actions taken 
by all levels of government in order to try to solve one of the most 
endemic of the problems experienced in our society, whether in 
Canada or in Quebec: the impoverishment of women and children.
<P>
	Last year, Quebec passed legislation to ensure that, as soon as 
child support is awarded, a mechanism is put in place by which 
court orders for child support are automatically recorded by the 
clerk of the superior court in which the case is heard. Under the 
system, those not earning a regular salary are required to deposit as 
security the equivalent of three months' support payments. In the 
case of wage earners, payments are deducted at source.
<P>
	These measures are aimed at simplifying the payment of support 
for children and the custodial parent. Similar measures have been 
adopted in other Canadian provinces. For instance, a universal and 
compulsory system for the automatic deduction of support 
payments also exists in Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick. In 
other words, the provincial governments have already taken certain 
steps within their own jurisdictions to improve the financial 
situation of women and children.
<P>
	The bill tabled by the federal government today is intended to 
complement action taken by other governments in the fight against 
poverty. Divorce is obviously a fact of life in Quebec and Canadian 
society. In Quebec, however, the phenomenon has become more 
widespread than anywhere else, with nearly 50 per cent of 
marriages ending in divorce.
<P>
	In 1990, there were 78,152 divorce judgments in Canada, 
leading to 48,525 judgments on child custody, while about 44 per 
cent of judgments on family matters involved an order for support 
payments. In 1989 alone, 83 per cent of all these judgments were 
the result of an agreement between the spouses. We all know what 
the situation is like when such agreements are made, so it is clear 
how the existence of a grid would have a considerable impact on 
the negotiating process.
<P>
	It is also true that in Quebec, the vast majority of those who 
receive child support payments-98 per cent in 1988 and 77 per 
cent in 1990-are women. This is to explain why, in my speech, I 
refer to the custodial parent in the feminine. I hope my colleagues 
understand I certainly have no intention of downplaying the fact 
that the remaining 20 per cent of custodial parents are men.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The statistics are very clear: two thirds of divorced women with 
three children live below the poverty line. When the mother is poor, 
her children are poor, since, as I just said, 80 per cent of the 
children live with the mother. This comes as no surprise. We are all 
familiar with this fact.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the decision is made with the 
consent of both spouses. And I would also like to remind this 
House of the impact of single parenthood on women and children. 
A link has been established between poverty among women, 
especially those with children, and marital breakdown. As I 
mentioned earlier, single parent families headed by women are, as 
a group, most exposed to poverty in Canada.
<P>
	According to research done by the staff of the Library of 
Parliament, authors of studies on child support payments in Canada 
have found that on average, such payments do not cover even half 
of the actual expenditures involved and usually the custodial parent 
has to absorb the difference. And people wonder why women are 
poor, especially when we know that, on average, their income is 
only two thirds of the man's income. The wage gap between the 
sexes is particularly significant here. My point is that women who 
have to raise their children alone are carrying an unfair share of the 
burden.
<P>
	For further insight, here are more figures. As we know, after a 
separation, the standard of living of women and their children 
drops by 27 per cent to 37 per cent according to statistics, while the 
standard of living of men invariably increases between 4 per cent 
and 30 per cent. But the issue must also be analyzed in light of the 
fact that women see their standard of living drop by 27 per cent to 
37 per cent.
<P>
	This situation brought the former Canadian Advisory Council on 
the Status of Women to write, in March 1994, and to repeat until its 
untimely abolition, which I deplore, that: ``Taking into account the 
greater responsibilities assumed by the mother receiving child 
support, the difference in men's and women's ability to pay 
because of the difference in their earning power and the limits that 
raising children imposes on the earning power of the mother who 
assumes custody, the tax policy should first of all take into 
consideration the situation of the mother''.
<P>
	The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women was not 
the only one to come to that conclusion. If I may, I would like to 
quote from an article written in 1994 by the Honourable Claire 
L'Heureux-Dubé, Supreme Court justice, in the magazine <I>Femmes 
et Droit</I>. This article was about the myths society and the courts 
face when dealing with child support.
<P>
	It showed that, according to a study done by the Department of 
Justice in 1990, the standard of living of 59 per cent of the women 
and children in the study dropped, after divorce, below the poverty 
line, while the percentage was 46 per cent if child support was 
included in the calculation of their income.
<P>
	Therefore, when child support is paid, 50 per cent of women still 
live below the poverty line. It is absolutely terrible. Yet, this is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4905"> 4905 </A></B>
<P>
supposedly an improvement, since the data for 1988 showed that 
the income of two-thirds of divorced women was under the poverty 
level. If we  exclude the support payments, this proportion came to 
74 percent.
<P>
	Further on, the judge wrote: ``The popular belief that men are 
generally overburdened by unreasonable support payments orders 
to women who use them to buy themselves luxuries and small 
incidentals is false, for two reasons. It stems from the false premise 
that women, in particular those who stayed at home when they 
lived with their husband, always, or at least easily, become 
economically independent after divorce. [-]This belief ignores a 
number of facts, both real and inescapable. Following a divorce, 
child custody is almost always given to the mother, and this by 
mutual agreement in 80 per cent of cases.''
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, according to the judge, the belief that the 
ex-spouses find themselves in similar situations after the divorce 
does not take into account the every day realities to which the 
custodial parent is confronted. Yet, the economic difficulties are 
worsened by the responsibilities inherent to child custody.
<P>
	I read on: ``For the great majority of custodial parents, this 
responsibility leads to a proportional reduction in economic 
choices after divorce. Thus, the ex-wife will have more difficulty in 
overcoming her limited ability to make a living when entering the 
job market after years of not working at all, or very little. Unlike 
her husband, she will be restricted in her economic choices because 
she will have to choose a home close to schools, she will not be 
able to work late at night because of her family responsibilities and 
she will have to stay home if a child is sick. She also must choose a 
safe neighbourhood for children, not too close to a busy street and 
having green spaces where children have at least a place to play 
safely. The other parent, on the other hand, does not have these 
restraints. He is free to live wherever he wishes and to work the 
hours he wants. He has more disposable income. For these reasons, 
the real cost of child care is rarely if ever accurately reflected in the 
amount of money allocated as support payments.''
<P>
	Madam Justice Dubé also says, in her article on the myths 
society and the courts must face: ``Despite the facts surrounding 
the custody of a child, there is a popular and persistent myth that 
raising a child is not expensive. In consequence, some think that 
the amounts sought as support payments are extravagant, if not 
totally beyond reason. This is not true, of course, since the parent 
having the custody of the child is most of the time neglecting 
personal needs in favour of the child. These beliefs also influence 
those who make support payments. It will be easier for him to make 
excuses for not paying if he does not believe this money is really 
needed. Such assumptions and beliefs have really tragic 
consequences, considering that the number of Canadian children 
living under the poverty line is ever increasing''.
<P>
	Therefore we will be analyzing Bill C-41, or at least its most 
important features, in terms of its impact on women and children.
<P>
	The bill deals with two of the four elements in the federal 
government's planned child support initiative: the establishment of 
a framework to develop and apply child support guidelines, and the 
strengthening of ways to collect child support payments.
<P>
	To start with, I will mention the aspects of the bill I find positive. 
First, the establishment of a framework for the use of child support 
guidelines: the Bloc Quebecois agrees with this concept. However 
such a framework raises a few questions I will deal with later.
<P>
	Then, the bill differentiates between child support and spousal 
support. In my view, this is beneficial as it will help dispel the kind 
of myths Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé mentioned. Moreover, 
this differentiation will put the child-who should be the main 
focus of any protection or help measure-at the centre of court 
decisions.
<P>
	With regard to proposed provisions to enhance enforcement 
measures, adding Revenue Canada to the list of federal 
departments whose data banks can be searched to locate defaulters 
is a step in the right direction, as is the creation of a scheme for the 
denial of certain documents, such as passports, driver licences, and 
the like. Access to federal civil servants' pension benefits and 
seafarers' wages will be made easier to ensure payment of child 
support arrears.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Naturally, any measure giving back to children the money 
required for their support deserves our endorsement. I would also 
like to mention the broadening of the definition of the word 
``child'' to include young persons 16 to 18 years old and students. I 
think this measure better depicts the reality of modern families and 
that it will help many children and young adults to start their life on 
the right foot.
<P>
	Finally, again in the best interest of children, I agree that priority 
should be given to the needs of children when both child support 
and spousal support are requested. I think children's needs must 
have preeminence at all times and in all legislation. That is 
necessary for our collective future.
<P>
	Those are the elements of the bill that we should support. 
However, other elements raise questions or prompt less positive 
reactions. I will mention only one that seems the most important to 
me. Afterwards, I will propose other amendments as the bill 
evolves and I am sure my colleagues will refer this morning to 
other aspects of the bill I will not have time to address.
<P>
	As far as negative aspects are concerned, the discretionary power 
is the most unacceptable one in my opinion; it could even turn the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4906"> 4906 </A></B>
<P>
enforcement of guidelines  into a nightmare. I will quote clause 4 
of the bill, which deals with the discretionary power accorded 
cabinet. It states clearly, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(5) The Governor in Council may, by order, designate a province for the purposes 
of the definition ``applicable guidelines''-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think there is a problem here and not a minor one.
<P>
	How can a government encourage provincial governments to 
develop and adopt their own guidelines and, at the same time, give 
itself the unfettered discretionary power to decide if the guidelines 
adopted by a province will replace its own federal guidelines in that 
province? It is like saying: ``I am telling you to pass your own 
legislation, but I warn you that it is I who will ultimately decide 
whether or not I will impose my own legislation because I do not 
like yours''. There is a rather ambiguous message there.
<P>
	This behaviour leads us to wonder about the real intentions of 
this government. Will it really let the provinces decide for 
themselves what is good for their people or will it, once again, 
interfere insidiously and impose its standards and its policies? I 
wonder.
<P>
	I invite the government to reflect on the words of its Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who was speaking highly, only 
yesterday, of the virtues of decentralization and who was 
comparing centralization to something to be fought at all cost. For 
once I can tell you I agree with the minister.
<P>
	To those who could think the issue is trivial, I would say it is 
nothing of the sort. This issue is crucial because, in practice, 
parents and children could find themselves very much with two 
systems of rules that would be applied in the same court of justice, 
by the same judges, to the same people, according to whether they 
choose to divorce or to separate. That is crazy.
<P>
	Thus, if the government decided not to recognize the guidelines 
adopted by the provinces for cases of separation or for common law 
spouses no longer living together, federal guidelines would apply 
in the case of a divorce, because divorce comes under federal 
jurisdiction. Let us imagine the scenario. There is a whole 
distinction to make there.
<P>
	Mr. Justice X, in a divorce cause, awards Mrs. A support 
payments of $1,000 a month for her children. The same judge, 30 
minutes later, in the same hearing room, awards Mrs. B, in a 
separation cause, a $1,500 support payment for her children. The 
two women and their children could be neighbours, could be in the 
same financial situation and would find themselves with totally 
different judgments because the same grid was not used.
<P>
	This is totally wrong, and I would invite the government to 
reflect on this and to take some concrete action. If it says to the 
provinces: ``We give you the choice'', it should not come along 
with its own standards.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	I should point out that this scenario is quite plausible precisely 
because of clause 4 in the bill.
<P>
	It would give the federal government a fine opportunity to once 
and for all show off its highly touted flexibility, which exists only 
in the minds of some of our Liberal colleagues.
<P>
	We ask that the discretionary power provided for in clause 4 be 
eliminated and that, as soon as a province meets the criteria set out 
in the new clause 26.1, its own divorce guidelines apply within its 
territory, as dictated by common sense and respect.
<P>
	This issue was considered by a federal-provincial-territorial 
committee whose report proposed three alternatives to the very 
concrete problem raised by the distribution of powers, whereby one 
formula could be used for divorces and another one for private 
cases. The government opted for a single formula within a single 
territory, and we totally agree. Now we just have to make sure it 
does not undo with one hand what it is proposing to do with the 
other.
<P>
	I would now like to move on to the guidelines section in the bill. 
For some years now, lawyers and legal experts have agreed on the 
lack of uniformity and the arbitrary way support payments are 
determined.
<P>
	We know that the decisions relating to child support orders are 
left to the judges' discretion and vulnerable to all kinds of 
manipulations by one or both spouses in assessing their ability to 
pay. There is now a total lack of uniformity in the amounts granted.
<P>
	According to one study, child support payments are already 
inadequate when they are set, and the situation gets worse with 
inflation and as the children grow up and their financial needs 
increase. In fact, many people working in the judicial system are 
calling for the standardization of child support payments.
<P>
	This bill proposes the adoption of a grid, which is a step in the 
right direction. The federal-provincial-territorial family law 
committee on child support came to the same conclusion in its 
report, saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The committee believes that adopting a child support setting formula will help 
parents, lawyers and judges negotiate and set fair and consistent support payments 
and bring parents to take responsibility more readily for their children. By 
eliminating a major source of conflict when families break up, this formula may also 
foster a positive relationship between family members, and particularly between the 
child and the non-custodial parent. It may also reduce not only the legal costs to the 
parents but also the legal aid costs, court costs and costs to execute orders, which are 
borne by the government''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Conseil du statut de la femme agrees. In a notification filed 
merely a month ago as part of the Quebec government consultation 
process, the council pointed out other benefits a support setting 
formula may  have, including: the value to parents of an objective 
tool by which agreements better tailored to their needs can more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4907"> 4907 </A></B>
<P>
easily be reached; the sense of security this tool will give women in 
their negotiations with their former spouses; the use by the court of 
an objective tool, making the decision making process easier to 
foresee; and, finally, the educational value of such a tool for 
non-custodial parents regarding the adequacy of support payments 
and their use by the custodial parent.
<P>
	It seems that the majority of stakeholders agree with the 
recommendations made by the committee and so do we.
<P>
	Some lawyers have concerns however about how these rules will 
be used by the courts. In Prince Edward Island, where the 
guidelines adopted by the government are more generous than 
those proposed by the federal government, there are complaints 
about judges regarding the guidelines as a ceiling. In American 
states where similar guidelines were adopted, judicial discretion 
has all but disappeared.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	But this judicial discretion seems to cut both ways, and its 
pitfalls were revealed under the deduction-taxation system.
<P>
	In its presentation to the task force on the tax treatment of child 
support, in July 1994, the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status 
of Women wrote about the impact of taxation of child support:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have contradictory evidence concerning the increase in and the extent of child 
support payments, and there is very little information to indicate that what is not paid 
out in taxes is being used for child support. Some family law practitioners say they 
always allow for the taxes to be paid, but there is a basic difference between 
emphasizing tax consequences and ensuring that child support payments fully reflect 
the increase. Other family law practitioners point out that, even after considering all 
the tax consequences, the amount finally awarded does not reflect the increase 
because, suddenly, the sky is seen to be the limit. The judge acts instinctively and 
declares that ``in fact, things do not cost that much-or amounts awarded are not 
usually so high'', and he ends up reducing the child support payment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	However, a standard grid of payment levels would solve the 
problem to a great extent.
<P>
	Another issue raised by lawyers is the concern that, if the amount 
of child support increases, more and more fathers will ask for 
custody of their children, which will mean legal expenses for the 
mothers. Finally, some judges fear that the number of deadbeat 
fathers will rise.
<P>
	In short, even if the principle of a single grid of payment levels 
appears to be a possible solution, we will have to be watchful and 
closely monitor its use by the courts.
<P>
	This view is shared by the chair of the family law division of the 
Canadian Bar Association, who believes that, in order to be 
effective, the guidelines must be flexible enough to take into 
account variations in the cost of living from province to province 
and from city to city, as well as the specific needs of certain 
children.
<P>
	A lawyer who has his own private practice summarized this view 
quite well in an article published in the <I>Law Times</I>. The lawyer 
concluded that the benefits were greater than the drawbacks. The 
main benefit, according to the lawyer, was consistency. 
Consistency means that the outcome is predictable and, when we 
have that, there is no need to go before the court. The lawyer noted 
that, in the United States, lawyers practising in states where there 
are guidelines find that fewer couples ask for temporary measures, 
which saves them thousands of dollars while also reducing the 
workload of the courts.
<P>
	Therefore, we support the principle of guidelines that would 
apply to the majority of cases. However, we have some concerns 
about the draft version of the grid of payment levels released in 
June.
<P>
	Based on the information available to us, the federal grid is 
based on the notion of equality. This means that someone with an 
income of X dollars will pay Y dollars, regardless of the income of 
the custodial parent. Therefore, the parent liable for financial 
support will know what contribution will be sought by simply 
looking at the line corresponding to his income on the grid, 
regardless of the income of the parent who will get the payment, 
since it does not come into play. Moreover, the federal and 
provincial taxes are taken into account in this grid, but all 
government transfers specific to a province are excluded.
<P>
	Quebec is about to introduce this fall a bill that includes 
guidelines of its own. Last August, a parliamentary committee met 
for three days to hear witnesses' comments on the grid the 
provincial government is suggesting to determine the support 
payments. More studies are being made to make the proposal under 
consideration even better.
<P>
	The Quebec grid was drawn up by taking into account the rights 
and responsibilities of parents under Quebec civil law. First of all, 
both parents' revenues are added up in order to set the contribution 
level, and then, the percentage to be paid by each parent is figured 
out according to the needs of the child. The Quebec grid is also 
based on the whole Quebec system, including taxation and 
government transfers.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Obviously, the basis of payment determination is fundamentally 
different, and an in-depth study would improve it in order to 
maximise the positive impact on the financial situation of children.
<P>
	Since the Quebec policy is based on a much more extensive set 
of data and takes into account all family and social policies in the 
province, this is all the more reason for the federal government to 
recognize the guidelines provinces have worked out for their 
population. Let us  hope that, this time, the federal government will 
listen to and respect the will of the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4908"> 4908 </A></B>
<P>
	Before I conclude these remarks, I would like to raise a problem 
that is fairly common in border areas. The problem involves former 
spouses living in different provinces who might be tempted, in 
order to save money, to move into the province whose rules are 
most advantageous to them.
<P>
	The proposed regulations provide, in section 3(4)<I>a</I>), that the grid 
to be applied would be that of the paying parent's usual place of 
residence.
<P>
	I call on the justice minister to review this provision and amend 
it so that the criterion is the child's place of residence, as requested 
by Quebec. We feel that direction would be more beneficial to a 
vast majority of children.
<P>
	I see that my time is almost up; I will therefore conclude by 
stressing that the official opposition supports the principles set out 
in Bill C-41, but that it has strong reservations about the 
appropriateness of the discretionary power the government is 
reserving for itself and about certain enforcement provisions.
<P>
	Meanwhile, we reiterate our invitation to the government to 
show some flexibility for once and to leave to provinces an 
important role in an area, the family, that, in the final analysis, is 
within their jurisdiction, except for divorce.
<P>
	We also call on the justice minister to introduce immediately 
legislation to implement the two other parts of the reform, so that 
the citizens know exactly in what direction the government is 
leading them and, most of all, at what cost to them and to the state.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to thank you for recognizing me today in 
this debate. It is an honour for me to speak first. I have been asked 
by my party to lead off on this second reading debate.
<P>
	We recognize with Bill C-41 that the government is addressing a 
much needed part of our society in that there are support payments 
which are in serious arrears. In British Columbia, my home 
province, there are serious arrears and persistent arrears in some 
cases. We must deal with the issue and this bill is welcome in that 
sense.
<P>
	There are a lot of divorces in which the non-custodial parent is 
working very hard, is making the support payments and is trying to 
keep in touch with his previous family. I say ``his'' because nine 
times out of ten the non-custodial parent is usually male in our 
society.
<P>
	I feel that the bill addresses a very important concern; however, I 
have several reservations regarding it.
<P>
	In the 1996 budget the government addressed a strategy to 
change the Canadian child support system, including the 
introduction of guidelines to establish child support awards in 
divorce cases. Legislation implementing key components of the 
strategy was tabled in the House of Commons on May 30, 1996. 
Both the guidelines and the new tax rules for child support are 
scheduled to come into effect on May 1, 1997.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a bill which will amend the Divorce Act and other 
acts in order to establish a federal system of aid for the payment of 
child support or spousal maintenance.
<P>
	The bill will alter four statutes in order to do these four things. 
First, it will establish federal guidelines for child support. As I 
stated before, that is needed.
<P>
	Second, Revenue Canada data bases will be open for searches in 
the case of payment default. This may cause all sorts of problems 
arising from the questions of privacy and confidentiality. These are 
some considerations we have to look at.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Third is the denial of passports and certain licences to 
individuals whose support payments are in arrears. In doing so, in 
denying those passports or licences, there will be a garnishee 
notice. The intent of this bill, as I understand it, is that the notice of 
intent to garnishee will no longer be there. That is a major concern. 
Why? We recognize that sometimes if a person receives a notice of 
intent, they then can be long gone if their intent is to never pay the 
support payments.
<P>
	However, suppose the person is working out of the country, 
suppose they are off on the oil rigs somewhere in Iran and that 
notice of garnishee does not get to them within the 30 days. 
Suppose there is an affidavit that does not have correct information 
on it. We know that happens often in the legal system. Then they 
are at an extreme disadvantage. That is another problem.
<P>
	The fourth is that it would provide for the garnishment and 
attachment of federal public service pensions and the wages of 
individuals working at sea.
<P>
	The acts involved in Bill C-41 besides the Divorce Act are the 
Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, the 
Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and the 
Canada Shipping Act.
<P>
	Speakers for the government on this bill have already indicated 
that it does establish a grid of payment levels for child support as 
well as creating a number of enforcement mechanisms which can 
be brought into place should default occur. That is all it does.
<P>
	It does not deal with the deductibility of support payments from 
income tax. It does not establish a system of required mediation. It 
does not improve access issues for non-custodial parents or dare I 
say for grandparents, and it does not address the issue of redress for 
the parent who pays child support but is denied access by the 
custodial parent without just cause.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4909"> 4909 </A></B>
<P>
	These are only some of the matters that are important issues 
in family law today that this bill neglects to address. If Bill C-41 
does not deal with the most controversial aspects of child support 
announced in the 1996 federal budget, namely income tax payment 
and deductions, and it does not deal with access to children or any 
of the other issues relevant to family law reform, why has this 
government called this Bill C-41 a comprehensive strategy to 
improve the child support system?
<P>
	Comprehensive means all encompassing. This bill is a piecemeal 
approach at best for amending the Divorce Act. When I say 
comprehensive, I am referring to a working draft of federal child 
support guidelines issued in June 1996 by the Department of 
Justice where it states in the 1996 budget that the government 
announced a comprehensive strategy to improve the Canadian 
child support system, including the introduction of guidelines, et 
cetera. I have a problem with that because I do not see this as being 
comprehensive.
<P>
	Canadians need a comprehensive approach. The focus of such 
comprehensive reform would be changes that benefit the children 
of divorce. We are talking here about children. As I have spoken 
about before in this House, when I talk about grandparent rights or 
any rights in the family, it is the children I am always concerned 
about.
<P>
	A comprehensive approach would include compulsory 
mediation as a first step in the divorce process rather than going 
straight to court. A comprehensive approach would include access 
provisions that are enforceable. It would also include the elements 
of easier access for grandchildren to their grandparents. As well, 
the bill should include the tax payments and deductions announced 
in the budget.
<P>
	I find the Liberal government's rationale odd when a reason 
given to me by the minister for his failure to support my 
grandparents bill in committee was that he would be doing a 
comprehensive family law review of the Divorce Act. Hence at 
some later date the grandchild-grandparent relationship would be 
dealt with, unfortunately though, far too late for many of our 
grandparents.
<P>
	Yet this minister is in favour of a piecemeal approach to child 
support. Is Bill C-41 a comprehensive reform? No, of course it is 
not. It is a typical Liberal knee-jerk reaction to part of the problem. 
As always, when someone deals only with part of the problem they 
deal with the easy part first, the part that will not get them into any 
trouble. This is the Liberal philosophy. Play it safe, do not stick 
your neck out. There must be an election around the corner.
<P>
	Playing it safe and delivering only half a loaf will not work in the 
case of family reform. There are pressing issues and they should be 
addressed together in one bill.
<P>
	Dealing specifically with Bill C-41, we have some major 
concerns. We do not believe the bill takes an even handed approach 
to the issue of child support.
<P>
	We are here to represent all Canadians, both men and women. 
This bill is decidedly biased against the male parent. There is very 
definitely a lack of equality for both parents. We all know that the 
much larger group paying child support are men. This bill does 
nothing to assure them of access rights.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	There is nothing to address the issues of mediation which are so 
necessary if couples are going to live apart but still maintain the 
best interests of their children uppermost in their minds. I 
understand there is provision on the books at the present time that 
asks divorce lawyers to attempt mediation prior to going into the 
divorce court. I am told it is a half hearted measure at best and few 
attempt it seriously.
<P>
	That is why I was interested to read of the Edmonton pilot 
project which requires people to take a six hour course before they 
can start action over child access or custody. The free two night 
seminar gives general information on topics such as the impact of 
divorce on children, how to reduce a conflict and ways to negotiate 
settlements without going to court.
<P>
	Alberta justice minister Brian Evans said the program is 
intended to help children and to save the courts time and money: 
``If you have an agreement right off the bat and the parties are 
amicable and the children are well taken care of, there is no 
intention of forcing this upon people. There is some flexibility. The 
focus of the program is on minimizing the impact of divorce on 
children and avoiding future problems with the law. If they are 
damaged psychologically and emotionally there is a very good 
chance they are going to get into our criminal justice system''.
<P>
	The article goes on to say Alberta is the second province after 
Saskatchewan to introduce such a program. Manitoba is 
considering a similar move.
<P>
	There is no similar program in B.C. according to Diane Bell of 
the family law section of the Canadian Bar Association in B.C: ``It 
would be nice if it was available. If this free was around I think 
lawyers would use it''.
<P>
	The Edmonton program is a year long pilot project that could be 
expanded to the rest of the province. The departments of justice and 
social services are implementing it. Mr. Gronow, a justice official, 
said that 1,200 couples in the Edmonton area will go through the 
course each year because they cannot settle disputes over child 
custody or access. The parent who wants to take this issue to court 
will have to prove he or she has taken the course.
<P>
	I have to pat the people in Edmonton on the back because I think 
what they are addressing is the real issue.  First, no child support 
payment system is going to work if people are not willing to go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4910"> 4910 </A></B>
<P>
along with it. It is realistic because it deals with the actual facts. If 
we look at the fact that realistically we are going to address the 
needs of the child and the ability of the father to pay and that both 
parents who are getting divorced are involved in that mediation, 
then the reality is they are going to come up with something that is 
workable. I think that is what Edmonton has addressed and rightly 
so.
<P>
	What the article is telling us is that there is a need for such 
programs. Divorce is a major happening in our country and we had 
better deal with it in a positive manner. I believe we cannot over 
emphasize our commitment to children. To invest in a child is to 
invest in the country.
<P>
	Bill C-41 gives authority to the governor in council, the cabinet, 
to set the payment grid for child support and for spousal support 
but does not clearly indicate that judges may vary the grid if 
warranted by the circumstances. I think it would be all too easy for 
a judge in this case to just go with the grid because it will probably 
result in fewer appeals.
<P>
	Therefore everything meaningful and important in this bill will 
be implemented by the order in council, and so parliamentarians 
will not have the opportunity to review or to comment on the child 
support payment grid.
<P>
	Reform has difficulties with this mechanism. We always have 
difficulty when this government tries to bypass Parliament in an 
attempt to legislation through the use of regulation. This grid 
should be referred to a committee of this House for study before it 
has legal affect.
<P>
	Given my recent experiences with the House of Commons 
justice committee I doubt whether that would be the appropriate 
forum. However, some committee of this House, hopefully one on 
which members are sympathetic to the problem of family break-up, 
should review these guidelines.
<P>
	Clause 2 of the bill which amends section 15 of the Divorce Act 
recognizes that a judge in both child and spousal award situations 
may look at agreements made between the parties, ability to pay 
and matters which would be of benefit to the children. First the 
judge is to take into consideration the guidelines, which is the grid 
established under this bill.
<P>
	I think the drafters here have it backwards. The judge should 
look first at agreements reached between the parties and only when 
the parties cannot agree look at the grid. As well the judge should 
look at the ability to pay. If we are looking seriously at mediation 
before divorce, as Alberta is, then the parents have already worked 
out an agreement which will work for them.
<P>
	There will be no need to put extra stress on a couple who are 
already in a stressful situation. We have plenty of evidence of large 
awards of support and maintenance which bear no relation to the 
spouses ability to pay. No matter the consequences, we run into 
problems of the payment.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> took a realistic look at this problem. In the 
article ``Getting tough with deadbeat dads won't solve the 
problem'', the writer states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Deadbeat dads stand only slightly below tobacco companies in the modern 
compendium of villainy. Governments across North America compete to devise the 
toughest schemes to extract child support money from these men. Give the prize for 
harshness to Tory Ontario. Beginning this January 1, Ontario fathers who fail to pay 
court imposed child support obligation will lose their drivers' licenses, will see their 
credit ratings stripped away, and will soon hear the pounding of the debt collector's 
fist on their front door.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So, can Ontario's single mothers soon look forward to a big bump in their 
incomes? Hardly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even those men lucky enough to have full time employment are averaging only 
about $40,000 a year, according to Statistics Canada. But a father who moves away 
from his children must still pay taxes. He must still eat and put some sort of roof over 
his head. It's still against the law for him to appear in public naked and he must 
somehow get to work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A single man earning $40,000 faces income taxes of more than $15,000 in 
Ontario, even after the first Harris tax cut. Grant him a frugal $1,500 per year for 
food, and another $6,000 a year for a cheap apartment. Budget $1,500 to finance, 
insure and operate a car, and $1,000 for shoes and clothes. Toss in $2,000 more for 
laundry, electricity, toothpaste, a telephone to call the kids he is supporting, the 
occasional haircut and a few other meagre incidentals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In other words, provided that this man is willing to devote every discretionary 
dollar to their lives, and provided too that he never remarries and never fathers any 
more children, we might be able to squeeze as much as $10,000 a year of child 
support out of him. If we fail to make him live like a monk, if we permit him to form 
a new family, then the money available will rapidly tumble to a thousand or two a 
year. And that's not going to do very much good is it?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's the truth that the whole deadbeat dad discussion evades. The reason 
women and children usually suffer economically after the break of a family is not 
that some man is selfishly or punitively withholding money from them, although of 
course some men do. The reason women and children suffer is that the typical wage 
earner does not earn enough to support two households. Neither for that matter does 
the comparatively affluent wage earner, one of the ten per cent of Canadian workers 
who grosses above $50,000 a year-''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wish to ask for the 
co-operation of the House that we might all be able to hear each 
other's interventions. When the time comes for questions or 
comments, I will certainly facilitate those to the extent I am able to.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No matter how onerous the child support decrees against these men may be, no 
matter how diligently governments enforce these decrees, for reasons of basic 
economics and arithmetic, divorce and unwed motherhood will inevitably mean </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4911"> 4911 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>economic catastrophe for the people involved. If anything, tougher child support 
rules are likely to exacerbate the catastrophe especially among the poor.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is not that I did not hear the comments at the side, however 
rudely said. What it does say is that the members opposite are 
trying to point out, and perhaps rightly so, that usually the mothers 
have a very difficult time. Yes they do. But that does not mean that 
we should put our heads in the sand and pretend their is economic 
prosperity out there. There is not.
<P>
	I do not want to see families falling apart even further than they 
do after divorce. A divorce does not mean a family has to fall apart. 
People who use common sense can encourage the father, which is 
usually the non-custodial parent, to continue visiting and to let his 
children know he still loves them and cares for them. But we 
cannot hammer them into the ground and then say come on, be a 
good family person. You have to use your head. For many years 
those paying the support and the parents who are receiving the 
support have had a lot of problems. I am personally well aware of 
it. But that does not mean that I stop thinking or stop facing reality.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	In these economic times the Liberal government should certainly 
look at the 10 per cent unemployment level. We cannot punish 
people. We have to offer encouragement. That is what we must do 
when we are making laws.
<P>
	If we have moved to no fault divorce, which I believe we have, at 
least let us be consistent in awarding child support maintenance 
and not use this to punish the non-custodial spouse. There is no big 
bad guy out there and no one on a white charger either.
<P>
	We also have concerns with clauses of the bill which allow the 
government to suspend licences and passports in order to achieve 
payment of support arrears. I recognize that in these instances of 
persistent arrears we should be careful. By suspending a licence or 
a passport we may be putting someone's ability to earn a livelihood 
in jeopardy. It does not help to make it so difficult that someone 
may end up out of a job. Then they cannot make any payments or 
help anybody, least of all their children.
<P>
	If the ability to earn a living is jeopardized then there will be no 
money at all to pay child support. It is a lose-lose situation. We 
must also keep in mind the revocation of a passport may place such 
a person in jeopardy if he or she travels or works outside of Canada. 
This international law aspect of the revocation of a passport should 
be explored.
<P>
	I hope these clauses will be examined closely in committee. We 
will be considering amendments which lengthen the period of 
notice under clause 22 of the bill  which amends section 67(4) of 
the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act.
<P>
	What also distresses me about this bill is the fact that it does not 
address the issue of access, especially the access of grandparents to 
grandchildren.
<P>
	Finally the media is starting to pick up on that major issue in our 
society, giving Canadian children access to their families, which 
also includes grandparents.
<P>
	We are told to wait for a comprehensive review of the Divorce 
Act. I put it to the Minister of Justice today that a number of 
grandparents do not have much time left.
<P>
	Let us agree on one thing. There are no good guys, no bad guys 
in divorce. The term no fault divorce recognizes that. How do we 
establish fairness and equal responsibility and access rights that 
recognize that parents divorce and children do not? I am talking in 
general terms here because we are all aware that there are parents 
who should never have been parents. Some are irresponsible and 
not supportive. But the average parent, divorced or not, cares about 
his or her children, loves them, wants them with them and wants to 
help them. This is a major reason why mediation before divorce 
and before child custody and access is decided is necessary.
<P>
	What am I really saying? It is the children who are the real 
victims of divorce. They need a loving, caring family. As a teacher 
for over 30 years, I can tell the House that all children are affected 
by divorce. However, divorce does happen and will continue to 
happen. So what can we do as a country? We all must remember 
that the family is our most basic unit in society.
<P>
	Unfortunately in today's world over 50 per cent of marriages end 
in divorce. Unfortunately in the case of divorce, which is what this 
bill deals with, it is most often the case that children are the last to 
be considered. This in spite of the fact that the courts and our laws 
use the phrase ``in the best interests of the child''. In fact, in most 
cases it really comes down to the best interests of the custodial 
parent.
<P>
	We know from heavy documentation in the United States, which 
keeps records of trends in divorce, that generally the practice was 
in the best interests of the custodial parent. The child and the rest of 
the immediate family are seldom considered.
<P>
	The House knows that I have been concerned about our Canadian 
grandchildren and I have spoken of the crisis after divorce when 
many grandchildren no longer see or visit with their grandparents. 
Perhaps I see families in a different light than other members of the 
House. It seems to me that just because a divorce takes place does 
not mean that a child or children of that marriage no longer have a 
father or a mother. A divorce should not make those children any 
less deserving of maintaining family ties. It would be more 
difficult, perhaps, but also more necessary.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4912"> 4912 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	If we want a strong, healthy society then we must be concerned 
with all families, divorced or not. We must ensure that children are 
encouraged to maintain access to their whole family. Children need 
to know they are loved by both parents, regardless of the divorce 
and by both sets of grandparents. Child support or a lack of it is a 
major problem but I feel the government by treating it as a one 
sided issue is not going to help the issue but rather exasperate it.
<P>
	I want to say at this time that I will be making some amendments 
because obviously there are some current concerns which I have 
already raised pertaining to this and I hope those amendments will 
be taken seriously by the government.
<P>
	In closing I would like to point out an American book, Ladies' 
Home Journal. A business woman, Rebecca Morrick, was a parent 
who suffered from lack of support payments. They did not come to 
her on time and so she started her own collection agency. She said: 
``I understand the anger and frustration of the women who come to 
me. I know what it is like when a support cheque doesn't come or a 
child's birthday is ignored. I know how it feels to hunt for pocket 
change just to buy a gallon of milk. Believe me, I've been there''.
<P>
	Then she talks about her work and how successful she has been 
in finding, as she calls them, deadbeat fathers. That is not a very 
nice term but it does probably describe the situation. She said: ``It 
takes me about six months to start collecting money from deadbeat 
dads and I do most of my leg work by computer. In the end a client 
can make out quite well. Even if the support award is relatively 
small, the ex can be made to pay his or her spouse the compound 
interest that would be accrued over the years of non-payment. Not 
surprisingly, finding fathers on the run is my speciality. In a case I 
am closing now, my largest one ever, I tracked down a deadbeat dad 
who owed more than $200,000. He had been ordered to pay my 
client $300 a month to support their daughter back in 1979 but he 
skipped town without paying a cent.
<P>
	``His wife Moranda hadn't tried very hard to find him, thinking 
that he would never earn enough to make the payments anyway. 
Years later, however, Moranda learned that her ex had become a 
successful songwriter for a country music star. We found him in 
Nashville, had him served by the court and we are in the process of 
seizing his royalty cheques, some of which amount to more than 
$30,000''.
<P>
	She is talking about those that she has had that are successful. 
What she is saying is there are very serious issues of non-support. 
She sees them all the time and tries to rectify the situation with a 
certain amount of success. She mentions too that the bureaucracy 
often gets in the way and that happens in Canada too. It gets in the 
way too often and sometimes our workers in the social field are 
overworked and cannot address all the concerns.
<P>
	What I want to point out is that here is a woman who has gone 
through the situation, who works with it every day, who sees the 
worst scenarios, but is she biased like the member opposite? Does 
she only push one side of the question, like the member opposite? 
Or does she deal, and this is what-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I just wonder if 
the hon. member could clarify when she says ``biased like the 
member opposite'' to which of the members opposite she is 
referring. The member for Scarborough-Rouge River-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would submit to the House 
that respectfully the member is engaging in debate and does not 
have a point of order. I will resume debate with the hon. member 
for Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Liberals do like to be heard.
<P>
	This is very pertinent to the last part. I want to point out, after the 
interruption, that this again is a woman who deals with this every 
day of her life, the worst scenarios in lack of child support.
<P>
	This is what she said: ``When I first went into the business I tried 
to be cool and objective, a real hard-boiled detective, but it just 
wasn't my style. As a result I often find myself getting emotionally 
involved in my cases and giving my clients personal advice. My 
favourite cases are those in which my work helps to reunite a 
family. Some fathers are actually relieved when I find them. They 
miss their children and are eager for a fresh start.
<P>
	``Take the case of Joe and Sally. Joe, tired of being turned away 
every time he wanted to visit their children, stopped paying child 
support and Sally refused to let him visit until he started sending 
the cheques again. To end this bitter standoff I drew up a 
modification to the child support decree stipulating that the 
payments and visits were to resume immediately. Sally, still 
distrustful of Joe, was reluctant to sign the agreement but I warned 
her I would drop her case if she didn't. Finally she gave in. Both the 
cheques and the visits have been helping ever since.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	``Helping women get the support they deserve is immensely 
satisfying. However, helping fathers like Joe make amends to their 
families makes me feel that my profession is really worthwhile. 
Fatherhood can and should be more than just a monthly cheque not 
just a wallet. My work has taught me that a child whose daddy 
disappears is never quite the same''. As a teacher for over 30 years, 
I can second that.
<P>
	Now that I am coming to the end of my speech, I must again say 
that no one understands any more than I do, having personal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4913"> 4913 </A></B>
<P>
experience, the very serious issue with which we are dealing. If we 
do not start caring about everybody, if we do not start putting 
children first and trying to help families, then we are going to see 
more and more separation, divorce and lack of support payments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House is presently 
operating under Standing Order 74 which entitles the first three 
speakers to a maximum of 40 minutes and are not subject to 
questions or comments. The next five hours of debate will include 
20-minute interventions subject to 10 minutes of questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I commence 
my remarks I want to pay tribute to the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam and her advocacy for grandparents. I may not 
agree with the legislation she has put forward, but I certainly agree 
with the spirit and intent of her advocacy.
<P>
	I also want to take a line from her comments just now when she 
said, in conclusion, that if we do not care about everybody and 
particularly children we are going to be in trouble. That is 
refreshing and, I know from that member, a true statement of her 
feelings. It is also refreshing to hear it from the Reform benches.
<P>
	However, the best way to put this is that there is place for 
everything legislatively and everything in its place. While I 
understand the member's frustration, given her advocacy on the 
question of access to grandparents in a post-divorce world, this bill 
does not deal with access. Access is something separate which may 
have to be dealt with at another time. This bill deals specifically 
with corollary relief and the situation faced by, for the most part, 
mothers attempting to deal with their financial lives in a 
post-divorce situation.
<P>
	Sometimes to explain why amendments are taken in the manner 
in which they are taken and why the government decides to act in 
the way in which it decides to act, particularly in these 
circumstances, it becomes necessary to talk about the real world.
<P>
	While I applaud the hon. member, I think there is a touch of 
naivety in the comments. This is not, particularly when we talk 
about post-divorce families, the best of all possible worlds. Indeed, 
for those of us who have long experience in the realm of family 
law, the post-divorce world is survivable for those people who have 
gone through it only if the legislation is strong enough to ensure 
behaviour that allows survival.
<P>
	This is not a world to be looked at with rose coloured glasses. 
Post-divorce for a number of years and sometimes many years can 
be described best as a page out of hell for the people who are 
involved in it.
<P>
	I would like to correct a mistake in statistics that I am sure the 
hon. member did not mean to make. The divorce rate in Canada is 
not 50 per cent, thank God. The divorce rate fluctuates somewhere 
between 3 and 3.9 in 10. This is not terrific but it is not as bad as 50 
per cent. Maybe it should be at 50 per cent given some of the  
things that happen in marriages that still stay together. 
Nevertheless, just in the interest of accuracy, the divorce rate is 
somewhere between 3 or 3.9 out of 10.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Source?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> The source is Statistics Canada. If the hon. member 
wants to get into sources he may be a little sorry.
<P>
	One of the things I want to say with regard to the hon. member's 
comments is that we have to be very careful in attempting to draw a 
correlation between the children of divorce and participation in the 
criminal justice system. If the hon. member has sources for that 
kind of allegation we would be very interested to hear them on this 
side of the House. Given the fact that divorce rates are high, I 
believe we would be seeing an increase in the crime rate, as 
opposed to a decrease, which is what we are in fact seeing.
<P>
	However, for all the goodwill that came from that speech and 
which comes from the hon. member opposite with respect to this 
matter, there is a naivety which needs to be corrected.
<P>
	As I said before, the post-divorce world is not the best of all 
possible worlds. People get divorced because, in general, they have 
come to the end of their tether in a relationship which is the most 
personal and intimate relationship people have on this earth. When 
the emotional response turns from one pole to another, the reaction 
and the fallout can be horrifying, not just for the husband and wife 
who are going through the divorce, but clearly, as the hon. member 
has noted, for the children.
<P>
	Every piece of legislation in this country that relates to children 
in any way, whether it is the Divorce Act or provincial legislation 
on maintenance, custody, or whatever, has in it somewhere the 
phrase ``the best interests of the child are paramount''. One of the 
tragedies of our country is that we have still not learned, whether as 
legislators, as lawyers or as jurists, how to truly implement that 
phrase. If the parents, the people most directly concerned and the 
people who allegedly should care the most for the best interests of 
the child cannot do it, it becomes insane to suspect that anyone else 
can do it.
<P>
	In the post-divorce world children are going to be traumatized. 
As legislators we have to bring in legislation which will minimize 
the trauma and maximize the benefit. No one has ever suggested, 
nor should anyone suggest, that solutions which come from the 
legislature will be a panacea. It is not possible.
<P>
	When I started to practise law in 1978 the rate of child support 
and maintenance payments which were not enforced was over 90 
per cent. Eighteen years ago over 90 per cent of support payments 
in this country were unenforceable. Since that time we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4914"> 4914 </A></B>
<P>
improved. I do not know the statistics today, but I believe we are 
fluctuating in the area of 60 per cent. That is still unacceptable.
<P>
	One of the things which I saw time and again as a family lawyer, 
acting for women who were attempting to enforce child support 
payments, was what I would refer to as the brow-beaten syndrome. 
They had come to the point where it was not worth it. The child 
support payments would be late, if they came at all. The process in 
the family court or even, from time to time, under a divorce decree 
in the Supreme Court, meant that those women took time off work. 
They worked themselves up into an emotional state. For most 
people, appearing as a witness in court, particularly in an area as 
sensitive as one which involves both the financial state of the 
individual and the state of their personal relationships, causes great 
stress.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Time and again a client would call to say that the support 
payment had not come in again and I would say we will go to 
family court and we will do this. Then she would say: ``No, to hell 
with it. I cannot be bothered anymore, it is not worth it, I would 
rather do without than put up with all of this''.
<P>
	This legislation, which relates to settlement agreements, is being 
brought forward in an attempt to alleviate that kind of problem. It is 
also being brought forward because whether hon. members 
opposite like it or not, on divorce the woman's standard of living 
falls considerably and the man's rises. Do you want statistics on 
this? Just check. I will bet that you could even check with some of 
the hon. members opposite who might know about it. There is no 
question that women across the board do not have the same access 
to money, to jobs, to promotion, et cetera, as men. It is a fact of life.
<P>
	Second, if the woman is paying tax on top of this money and is in 
a lower category to begin with, she is going to get hit with a bigger 
bite. This is another thing that this legislation is here to do 
something about.
<P>
	The whole thing, however, comes down to the recommendations 
that are being given to judges and those who are going to hammer 
out the settlements either in the courts or in mediation ahead of 
time. Spot news for the third party, mediation has been in place for 
quite a long time and it works. That is probably the reason we are 
down to around 60 per cent on enforcement of maintenance orders. 
However, that is still not good enough.
<P>
	This problem will not be solved by saying that fathers who do 
not pay or parents who do not pay are just misguided. They are not 
just misguided, some of them do not want to pay. They just 
absolutely do not want to sign that cheque. Enforcement is and 
continues to be a problem. Again, this legislation is aimed at 
addressing some of those problems and alleviating them.
<P>
	This is not a world where mothers and fathers are going to 
reunite after they have broken up. That kind of thing happens in the 
odd movie that is released at Christmas time and tragically in the 
minds of many children of divorce, but it does not happen in 
reality. Let us not go on talking about how we can heal the personal 
relationship and wasting our energies there, which is no place for 
the legislator at any rate, and talk about how we can ensure that the 
financial burdens and the financial problems are at least taken care 
of in such a way that children and single parents have some small 
chance of making their lives a little bit better than they have been.
<P>
	I am sure there are other areas in our society and other 
professionals and other people who can work on the emotional 
reconstruction that may be possible in a limited number of cases. 
That is not our job just as it is not our job in this legislation to deal 
with the question of access. Our job is to deal with the question of 
amendments that will handle corollary relief under the Divorce 
Act. That is what we do.
<P>
	A number of questions were brought up by the hon. member 
opposite that relate purely and simply to matters within provincial 
jurisdiction. It is all very well for people to question jurisdiction. 
Jurisdiction matters. Certain things fall within the provincial 
purview and other things fall within the federal purview. This is 
something that falls within the federal purview. It is something that 
we can do. It is something that we are doing.
<P>
	It is something that has been long overdue. It was given its 
impetus by the Federal Court's decision in the Thibaudeau case. It 
was given its impetus by the hon. member for Nepean who came 
forward and championed this cause from the beginning. It is 
something that I am proud to stand here today and support.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech made by the hon. member opposite 
and I must say that she used some very noteworthy examples. The 
principle of the bill in itself is acceptable because its first priority is 
the welfare of the child.
<P>
	However, I would like the hon. member to answer a question I 
have about the principle of the divorce guidelines set by the federal 
government, which contradict the guidelines on separations set by 
some provinces, including Quebec.
<P>
	We know that, by order in council, the government could decide 
not to authorize-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Clancy:</B> In separation cases.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Yes, in the guidelines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4915"> 4915 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell us why the government 
in such cases does not allow the provinces to set the appropriate 
guidelines. This is a another telling example of 
non-decentralization. A Liberal member said centralizing 
federalism is like an irresistible urge.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to tell us how, through an order in 
council, the federal government can, in some cases, choose to 
ignore provincial guidelines. This goes to show, once again, how 
inefficient the government is. There is no willingness to 
decentralize and let the provinces deal with their own areas of 
jurisdiction. How is it that the hon. member does not see this 
negative side of the bill?
<P>
	I acknowledge that the government has come up with some good 
provisions to improve the standard of living for children and 
women. I think we agree on that, but I disagree again on the 
guidelines issue, because the government will not let the provincial 
governments set their own guidelines. It is a bit like having a court 
make one decision about a divorce case in one room and, thirty 
minutes later, on a separation case this time, make a completely 
different decision, because the federal government does one thing 
and the provinces another.
<P>
	The provinces should be able to set their own guidelines. I am 
worried that we might be granting something not within our giving, 
as members of this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Quebec for her intervention and for her comments. In this 
particular case I really do not want to sound patronizing. Let me 
begin by making an obvious statement. I am not familiar with the 
specific laws within the province of Quebec to which she refers. I 
am however very familiar with the juxtaposition, if you will, of 
federal and provincial law in this area.
<P>
	The fact is it relates to some degree to what I said in my closing 
remarks about jurisdiction and this may have been the translation 
because I was listening to the translation. The translator used the 
word allow. The hon. member, although not a lawyer, knows it is 
not a question of the federal government allowing the provincial 
government. These are clearly defined areas of jurisdiction, one 
within the provincial area and one within the federal area.
<P>
	The Divorce Act is within the federal jurisdiction and is really 
the only area per se whereby the federal government gets involved 
in the legal ramifications of marriage breakdown. There are other 
areas in which marriages are terminated not by divorce which are 
provincial.
<P>
	I can only again say to the hon. member it is not at all a question 
of decentralization. Indeed I remember some years ago at a 
constitutional conference with federal and provincial members, 
including at the time the late Premier Lévesque, who was willing to 
agree to throw all family law to the provinces. This engendered a 
huge and negative reaction from bar societies and lawyers right 
across the country, including lawyers from the province of Quebec, 
some of whom may even be members of the Bloc or the PQ.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	To be quite serious, the guidelines, and as I said, I am not 
familiar with the Quebec guidelines per se but I imagine they 
cannot be all that different from what may not be solid guidelines 
in other provinces, but the traditions, those habits or areas that 
define mediation and pretrial settlements in divorce and marriage 
breakdown. Most judges in Quebec and in the other provinces of 
Canada attempt to get as best a handle on the matter and they also 
attempt-and this is the phrase I brought up before-to consider 
the best interests of the child.
<P>
	I do not think there is anything in the federal guidelines that will 
unduly hamper anything in the provincial guidelines. The federal 
guidelines are good guidelines. They reflect, in my estimation and 
in my knowledge of what is happening in other provinces, much the 
same ideas, much the same theories, much the same goals and 
aims.
<P>
	If there is something under the civil code in Quebec that is 
utterly at war with the guidelines at the federal level, I would 
personally be very surprised and I would imagine that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice would be 
interested in knowing what those were and perhaps looking at 
them. But it is most unlikely that these would in actuality conflict.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in her 
presentation the hon. member referred to the best interests of the 
child and the fact that this legislation in her opinion would fulfil the 
best interests or look out for the concerns of the child.
<P>
	The most important thing a child can have is two loving parents. 
Could she comment on the fact that this legislation does nothing to 
deal with the access of the non-custodial parent? Could this be a 
huge gap in the legislation?
<P>
	The Divorce Act is rarely opened. It should be dealt with in a 
much more thorough way than this. Could the hon. member 
comment?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have been asked this 
question. I know my hon. friend asks it in the best of faith and I will 
answer very seriously.
<P>
	Of course the optimum, the ideal for a child is to have two loving 
parents. I look at my own experience. The first seven years of my 
life were as idyllic as any child could have, and then my father 
died. It was a tragedy no one could have foreseen. My mother 
carried on in an admirable way. I was very lucky and grew up in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4916"> 4916 </A></B>
<P>
very  loving home. The wonderful creature you see before you is a 
product of that.
<P>
	One of the things my mother used to say to me at times when the 
loss of my father became a great burden was: ``You know Mary, 
there are many worse things that could happen to you than having 
your father die''. That is very true. I think the hon. member knows 
that as well.
<P>
	It would be wonderful if we could legislate two loving parents 
for every child. It would be possibly the greatest thing we could do, 
but we know we cannot do that. We know there are parents who 
neglect their children; there are parents who abuse their children; 
there are parents who behave in the most ghastly and horrible ways 
to their children, betraying the love and the trust in ways that make 
legislators like us, all Canadians and all people of goodwill on this 
earth cry out for justice.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	I said earlier in my comments that there are things legislators can 
do and there are things we cannot do. We cannot legislate two 
loving parents for every child. We can only attempt to make the 
situation as good as possible.
<P>
	To get to the technical question of access, it is in the Divorce 
Act. I am not sure what the hon. member wants to do with it. If he is 
referring to those who have standing to apply for access, that is 
another question, but access is dealt with in the Divorce Act. If he 
is referring to the private members' bill of the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, I already said that I support her spirit and the 
intent. I do not happen to support the particular mode she took to 
implement it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-41, which is before us, is a good illustration of the 
fact that policies do not necessarily respond to people's demands as 
quickly as one could wish.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is intended to solve a problem known to many a 
single-parent family. Members know that, in most cases, women-in 
perhaps as much as 99 per cent of the cases-and ultimately 
children-in every single case-have to live with it. There has 
been a lot of unfairness.
<P>
	Women's and community groups as well as many individual men 
and women have long been asking first the Conservative 
government, and then the Liberal government since 1993, to amend 
support legislation. There was clearly a consensus although some 
non-custodial fathers, naturally, viewed this unfavourably. But as 
the objective was to improve the children's lot, I think everybody 
recognized that there was a problem.
<P>
	It took a legendary court case to bring the government to really 
do something. It took a courageous woman to confront the 
government on this important issue. I am referring to the 
Thibaudeau case, which is known to everybody.
<P>
	Mrs. Thibaudeau had the support of a lot of people, including, 
although I do not want to brag, the support of the official 
opposition from the very beginning. A Liberal member said earlier 
that his party had supported from the beginning the amendments 
proposed in Bill C-41 but, from the moment we became the official 
opposition, we were the ones who, clearly, asked the government 
questions on this particular issue.
<P>
	Members will recall how often, in the House, the Bloc member 
for Québec asked the justice minister to introduce legislation to 
split the cost of raising children between both parents. Or the hon. 
member for Temiscamingue who said this in May 1995: ``Thus, it 
is imperative that the government act right now to answer women's 
expectations''.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for 
Québec, among others, for her persistence and perseverance in this 
difficult matter. In spite of all the different preconceptions and 
factors to be taken into account, she did an excellent job. This is 
why the opposition parties joined forces to have the rules changed.
<P>
	I would also like to thank the member for Témiscamingue, who 
was our critic for National Revenue at the time. He explained very 
clearly the financial implications. Because of his explanations, all 
the members of the Bloc agreed on this issue.
<P>
	However, almost a year late, the government and the minister 
have at last introduced the reform the Bloc Quebecois has been 
calling for for so long.
<P>
	In the 1996 Budget, for the first time, the federal government 
finally unveiled the new child support payments system. As 
members will recall, there were four sections. The first established 
that child support payments will no longer be deductible for the 
custodial parent, but for the non-custodial parent. Second, the 
maximum working income supplement included in the federal tax 
benefits for children will be doubled. Third, guidelines will be 
drawn up for calculating support payments. Fourth, new measures 
enhancing the enforcement of child support will also be announced.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	If Bill C-41, which amends the Divorce Act, the Family Orders 
and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, some provisions of 
the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act as well as 
other related acts, is adopted, it will implement two of the four 
elements I mentioned earlier. I will cover these elements in greater 
detail later.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4917"> 4917 </A></B>
<P>
	According to the bill before us, the Divorce Act will be 
amended to create a framework for the use of the child support 
payment determination guidelines. Such guidelines would replace 
the discretionary power of the courts and would be adopted 
through regulations.
<P>
	The other aspect changed by Bill C-41 concerns enforcement. 
Specifically, the bill would amend the Family Orders and 
Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act to add Revenue Canada 
to the list of federal departments whose data banks could be 
searched to find individuals who have been delinquent in paying 
child or spousal support.
<P>
	The changes create a new mechanism to deny certain licences or 
benefits to individuals who regularly neglect to pay support. The 
rest of the new legislation will be put in place through a budget 
implementation act which will probably be introduced in the fall.
<P>
	When we examine those two aspects of Bill C-41, we realize that 
the first one, that is to say the guidelines, is the most important. I 
have heard all kinds of things in this House, and it is worth taking a 
few minutes to talk about the guidelines and to explain to members 
who might not know what is going on in other provinces regarding 
these guidelines, because the province of Quebec does have such 
guidelines.
<P>
	Bill C-41 will establish guidelines that will prevail even though 
some provinces have already adopted their own guidelines. To 
respond more specifically to the member for Halifax, who said she 
did not know what the guidelines were in Quebec, I think it is worth 
taking a few minutes to examine these provincial guidelines as well 
as the federal ones.
<P>
	Here are some details about the criteria used to establish the 
guidelines. I invite the members opposite to listen very carefully, 
especially the member for Halifax. She must listen to understand 
what is going on.
<P>
	The Quebec model is based on the actual cost of the child. An 
estimation is made of what the child needs. It could not be more 
accurate. However, the federal model is based on a partial 
equalization of living standards. According to that model, a 
five-year old child generally needs so much. But one child may 
need more than another child depending on his or her family's 
standard of living. Therefore, we can see right from the first 
criterion that it is not completely true to reality.
<P>
	A second element concerning the Quebec model is that it is 
based on the ability to pay of both parents. Is that not perfectly 
normal? The financial responsibility for the children is shared 
between both parents on a pro rata basis depending on their 
resources. Again, it could not be more accurate. How has the 
federal government, which thinks it knows everything there is to 
know on the subject, gone about it? The federal model is based on 
the premise that both parents have the same income. Nothing could 
be further from reality.
<P>
	In some cases, both parents do have the same income. It is 
possible. However, in some fields, women earn 30 per cent less 
than men. The premise used by the federal government may be 
based on the ideal situation, but, again, it is not true to reality. 
According to what my colleague said, even for work of equal value, 
women earn 30 per cent less than men. Therefore, if you take two 
engineers, there is a difference right off the bat, so the federal 
government is wrong on all counts.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Third, the Quebec model does not include, either implicitly or 
explicitly, an amount for the custodial parent. The federal 
government takes the opposite approach. Its model implicitly 
includes an amount for the custodial parent.
<P>
	A fourth element of the Quebec model is harmonization with 
Quebec income security and taxation programs. Is this the right 
approach? The federal government does not seem to think so, 
because its model is not harmonized with Quebec programs.
<P>
	Another point is that, in Quebec, the proportion of child 
expenses decreases with income. In the federal approach, child 
expenses remain constant. Finally, in Quebec, the non-custodial 
parent receiving income security payments is not required to pay 
support. Under the federal model, the non-custodial parent 
receiving income security could be called on to pay support.
<P>
	I have just provided the member for Halifax, who said she 
doubted that there were large differences between the Quebec and 
federal models, with all the proof necessary to show that there 
indeed are. She can take that to her caucus and try to convince the 
Minister of Justice that he is on the wrong track in wishing to 
impose certain federal standards, the same system for all the 
provinces.
<P>
	This is yet another example of how in Quebec-because I am an 
MP from Quebec, not because I am a Quebecer-we do things 
differently. This is proof again that we are a distinct society. Even 
in a bill that, all in all, has nothing to do with the Constitution, we 
see that Quebecers do things differently.
<P>
	I think this would perhaps have been a good opportunity for the 
federal government to have a clause specifically recognizing the 
distinct character of Quebec with regard to the family and giving it 
full jurisdiction in this area. It was time to do so. The Prime 
Minister of Canada boasts that he recognizes the distinct character 
of Quebec. It was time to prove it in a bill that, in my view, is 
extremely important for the family, which is, after all, at the very 
basis of Quebec society.
<P>
	That being said, although the Bloc Quebecois initially applauded 
the minister's reform concerning guidelines to determine the 
amount of support payments, we voiced several reservations with 
respect to the implementation of these federal guidelines in the 
province.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4918"> 4918 </A></B>
<P>
	Upon reading Bill C-41 and after comparing the Quebec model 
and the federal model concerning these guidelines, it is clear our 
fears have been confirmed, since thanks to Bill C-41, we will have 
two entirely different systems.
<P>
	I think the points I just made for the benefit of the hon. member 
for Halifax could be used by other Liberal members to contend 
with the demon of centralization, as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said so eloquently. I think they have 
enough facts to prevent the minister's demon of centralization from 
becoming active and to backtrack, face the facts and decentralize as 
we hope they will.
<P>
	The first part of Bill C-41 deals with quite a few items, and I will 
run through them very quickly. What I am going to say is very 
legalistic but I think we should spend some time on these items, 
considering that legislators must mean what they say. This is a rule 
of law that has been cited quite often. I think that when Parliament 
adopts a bill of this kind, the meaning of every word is extremely 
important.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	If a provincial government decides to set certain guidelines for 
its province, such guidelines will take precedence over the federal 
guidelines, provided the governor in council designates, by order, 
the provincial guidelines as the applicable guidelines. Here I am 
referring to subclause 1(4) which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council may, by order, designate a province for the purposes of 
the definition ``applicable guidelines'' in subsection (1)-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	``May'', Mr. Speaker. And right away, you will understand that 
the Bloc Quebecois cannot go along with this ``may''. Obviously, 
this should read ``shall'', ``the Governor in Council shall, by 
order-''. We do not to leave the governor in council any choice, 
any discretion to decide whether or not the guidelines of a province 
must take precedence over the federal guidelines.
<P>
	If the province takes the initiative, if a province bothers to 
establish guidelines in an area as important as this one, I think the 
governor in council has no choice and shall, by order, designate 
that province as the province whose guidelines will apply.
<P>
	According to the bill, provinces must therefore meet the criteria 
set out by the federal government in clause 26.1 if their guidelines 
are to be accepted as applicable. Thus, the federal government 
reserves absolute discretionary power to accept, or not to accept, 
the order according to sub-section (4).
<P>
	Once again, we can see the usual federal paternalism at work 
here, always wanting to have power over provincial governments' 
social policies. Every time, the federal Big Brother places the 
provinces in a situation of guardianship, insisting on imposing its 
views on the provinces, without any concern for adapting to 
specific situations in various regions of Canada.
<P>
	As well, rejection of a province's guidelines would lead to the 
absurd situation of having the provincial payment grid apply when 
the parents separate, while the federal one would kick in when they 
divorce, since the federal level has precedence in matters of 
divorce.
<P>
	We would see people legislation shopping with the blessings of 
the Minister of Justice in Ottawa. If we adopt the bill as it stands, it 
will enable lawyers and those involved in a family case to ask: 
which is better for me, separation or divorce? The only 
consideration I have is the following-even though I am a man 
myself, I think I can say that men often see certain things from the 
financial point of view, which may not be the case of women 
caught in a very emotional situation and the lawyers will be 
involved in this. If the lawyer is on the ball at all, and can influence 
or try to influence his client, and he or she succeeds in influencing 
the opposing lawyer-who may well be a woman, as women often 
choose other women to represent them, which is their choice and 
there is nothing wrong with that-well then, after negotiation, after 
the lawyers sort out the various points that may influence their 
choice, the client may opt for divorce rather than separation, 
because the federal guidelines are perhaps less generous than the 
provincial.
<P>
	We will really start to see legislation shopping, and I believe 
that, if there is one area in which that must be prevented, it is in 
family law, for the objective is, as I have stated at the start of my 
speech, the protection and welfare of the children involved.
<P>
	Finally, the federal government uses the place of residence of the 
debtor, the person paying the support, to determine which 
guidelines are applicable. I have another difference for the hon. 
member for Halifax: the Quebec government considers the child's 
residence, a criterion that is much more consistent with the 
principles outlined in several court orders that the child's interest 
must prevail over everything else.
<P>
	The rules applied by one province may be much more in line 
with the child's situation than those of the debtor province. This 
goes without saying. Does the Minister of Justice not think that all 
children have the same value, whatever their parents' status may 
be, whether it is a separation or a divorce case?
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I do not know what the minister's answer is, but I can tell you 
right now that, in the eyes of the Bloc Quebecois, whatever their 
parents' status is, all children have the same value, and we should 
ensure that child support payments are as generous as possible so 
that the children are as comfortable as possible in this rather 
difficult situation.
<P>
	Let me give you another example. According to the current 
federal and provincial regulations, if the amounts  set by federal 
regulations are lower, after everything is taken into account, 
Quebecers would pay less in child support if they lived in Ontario. 
What is preventing Quebecers paying child support who are 
starting to feel the heat from moving to Ontario, thus reducing their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4919"> 4919 </A></B>
<P>
payments under section 1(3)(<I>a</I>)? What is preventing someone like 
that from moving to avoid his financial obligations or to pay as 
little as possible? Nothing. Even if we look at the minister's notes, 
the draft guidelines clearly allow this way of getting around one's 
financial obligations.
<P>
	This lack of uniformity between provinces, combined with the 
number of courts issuing child support orders, the many 
overlapping federal and provincial laws, and the regional 
disparities in the cost of living, results in financial instability for 
separated and divorced families. We will not reach our goal unless 
we make the necessary amendments to this bill.
<P>
	Obviously, it would make much more sense to let each province 
choose the model for determining support payments that suits its 
needs and let each decide terms of implementing the rules 
governing their determination in keeping with provincial social 
security, tax and family policy.
<P>
	The area of the family is not something that can be pulled out of 
a hat and dealt with like that. It is more intricate. The area of the 
family is an extremely important area, and with the examples I 
gave, with the Quebec model, the federal model, I am sure that the 
House of Commons has understood that the province-Quebec in 
the example I gave, but I am sure that other provinces also have 
terms already established-is closer to the people, knows about 
such family-related problems as income and allowances of all 
sorts. The provincial government is in a better position to recognize 
family needs. The federal government should therefore withdraw 
from this area and give full jurisdiction to the provinces.
<P>
	Since you are signalling to me that my time is running out, I will 
say briefly that the opposition supports the second part of Bill 
C-41.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a brief comment and a question for the member. The issue of the 
family has come up often in the debate. It is an issue that interests 
me a great deal in the work I do in this place.
<P>
	Members know very well that when the family is strong, good 
things happen. We are talking about legislation that deals with the 
situation when the family breaks down.
<P>
	The Thibaudeau case has been raised. The member knows that 
the change vis-à-vis the Thibaudeau case actually put parents who 
separate on the same footing as families have always been. The 
change represents fairness  and equity. I am glad the member and 
all speakers always begin their comments with the statement that 
the child's interests should come first. I heartily agree.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	My question has to do with scheduling. The member, in making 
the statement that the child's interests should come first, 
commented on the situation in Quebec where the schedules are not 
based on both parents being deemed equal. A formula is used to 
determine the amount to be paid. He describes the federal proposal 
for scheduling as somehow showing both parents are equal.
<P>
	If the member would look at it carefully he would find that the 
chart treats the determination of benefits payable with regard to 
child support on the basis of what the needs of the child are and 
meets the criteria which he himself lined up.
<P>
	Could the member please explain how the Quebec schedule 
provides a different or a better approach to support benefits?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I were wrong, but when I 
read Bill C-41 and the draft guidelines on child support, prepared in 
June 1996 by the Department of Justice, I am forced to conclude 
that, unfortunately, I am right. Having to say this in the House is no 
fun, but I am right.
<P>
	The federal model is based on the assumption that both parents 
have the same income. It is of course not always the case. Why 
presume that both parents have the same income? The judges 
dealing with divorce proceedings will base their decision on this 
assumption. If these guidelines are passed as they stand, judges 
will have no discretion to decide whether the children are entitled 
to support and, if so, to determine the amount of such support.
<P>
	I mentioned that, in Quebec, the National Assembly is about to 
pass guidelines that will be based on the ability to pay of both 
parents. If one parent earns $200,000 while the other one has never 
worked, or earns only $25,000 or $30,000 a year, a judge should not 
rule that the children will receive X dollars in support and that each 
parent will contribute half of the amount. It goes without saying 
that the father who earns $200,000 will have to pay more than the 
mother who earns $20,000 or $25,000 per year.
<P>
	I wish I were wrong. Perhaps the hon. member is aware of some 
discussions within the Liberal caucus that lead him to believe that 
the minister will make some changes to the guidelines, and that he 
will lean toward the Quebec approach rather than the one he is 
currently advocating. In the meantime, when I read Bill C-41 and 
the draft guidelines of the justice minister, I come to the conclusion 
that the federal model is unfortunately disconnected from reality.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak in the House on the second reading of Bill C-41, 
an act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and 
Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, Attachment and Pension 
Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act. My comments will 
outline the key elements of the federal government's child support 
strategy encompassed by the amendments to these acts.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	At the heart of these reforms is the principle that children should 
be a prime consideration in the unhappy circumstances of marriage 
breakdown. Child support is the first obligation of parents and it 
also of prime importance to us as legislators in the House, at least 
on this side of the House. The approach and changes announced in 
May are designed so that Canadian children will definitely benefit.
<P>
	The government is changing the way child support payments are 
taxed. I am pleased to see the government fulfil its commitment to 
do this.
<P>
	It was in 1994 in the House that I put forward a motion which 
read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income Tax 
Act so that the child support payments are no longer considered taxable income for 
their recipients.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That motion was passed unanimously by the House. This served 
as an indicator to the government that it was time to rethink a 
taxation policy that was introduced in 1942 and which no longer 
reflected the reality of single parents, primarily working mothers in 
the 1990s.
<P>
	Canada will be moving to a system known as no deduction, no 
inclusion. The new rules will apply to orders or agreements made 
on or after May 1, 1997. Child support paid under a court order 
made before May 1997 will continue to be deductible to the payer 
and included as taxable income to the recipient until the support 
payment is varied by the court or the parties agree in writing, or the 
payer and recipient jointly sign and produce a form with Revenue 
Canada indicating that the new tax treatment should apply to the 
face value of their existing support order.
<P>
	The government is introducing child support guidelines to make 
child support awards fairer and more consistent and to reduce the 
degree of conflict between separating parents. The guidelines will 
be used across Canada by the courts and by lawyers, judges and 
parents to establish appropriate support payments.
<P>
	The guidelines have three main parts. First, payment schedules 
are presented in tables like tax tables that show the basic amount of 
support from a non-custodial parent according to the number of 
children or the income of the support paying parent.
<P>
	Custodial parents also contribute a similar share of his or her 
income to the needs of the children by virtue of the fact that the 
children will share in the resources of the parent with whom they 
live because their standards of living are inseparable. As the 
income of both parents increase or decrease so will their individual 
contributions to the needs of their children.
<P>
	Second, the scheduled amounts can be adjusted to recognize 
individual family circumstances. There are four categories of 
special expenses that can be added to the scheduled amount, if they 
are reasonable and necessary, in light of the needs of the children 
and the means of the parents, including child care costs for 
preschool children and uninsured medical costs.
<P>
	The guidelines also allow a court to alter the award in the rare 
circumstance that it would cause undue hardship to either parent or 
to the child.
<P>
	Third, the government is enhancing federal and provincial 
enforcement measures. The enforcement of child support is mainly 
a provincial and territorial responsibility. The measures the 
government is proposing complement provincial and territorial 
enforcement efforts already in place. The government is targeting, 
in particular, persistent defaulters. Some of the enforcement 
measures include a national public awareness campaign, a federal 
licence suspension initiative, more aggressive collection of out of 
province orders, improved federal tracing services, improved 
federal pension diversions, improvements to computer systems 
connecting federal, provincial and territorial enforcement services, 
and a new federal support enforcement director.
<P>
	Research will continue into developing new strategies for 
enforcement of child support debts and into identifying why so 
many non-custodial parents default.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Fourth, as the purpose of these reforms is to help children, the 
federal government will reinvest its anticipated revenue gains from 
the new tax rules in measures to benefit children. The government 
will fund a doubling of the working income supplement of the 
federal child tax benefit from a maximum of $500 per year to 
$1,000 per year. The working income supplement provides a 
non-taxable benefit to supplement the employment earnings of 
families with earnings of at least $3,750 and net incomes below 
$25,921.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe the reforms that I have presented meet 
the long overdue need for reform in the way Canada ensures 
support for children following family breakdown. The reforms will 
put children first. They will put responsibility fairly on the 
shoulders of the parents and will move Canada's child support 
system into the nineties.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-41 today, an act to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4921"> 4921 </A></B>
<P>
amend the Divorce Act, the Famil Orders and Agreements 
Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and 
Pension Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act.
<P>
	In contrast to what the hon. member for Halifax said earlier, she 
made the statement that governments cannot legislate loving 
families. I would like to put to this place today that in fact 
governments can legislate things that will destroy loving families 
through the very policies they put forward.
<P>
	Government and the laws that are made can and do have a 
profound effect on those institutions that are the bedrock strength 
of our society. Integrity for instance, the most important single 
quality for any individual or nation, is born and thrives in the 
bosom of the examples and the conversations in the homes of this 
nation.
<P>
	A healthy family is a place of nurture and growth for those 
qualities most essential for the success of individuals and nations. 
Within the walls of our nation's homes we learn to find our security 
and the acceptance and the unmasked behaviour of our family. We 
learn about ourselves through the interaction and sometimes blunt 
appraisals of those who know us best. We learn to wait and to 
compromise. We may hone our debating skills or even our 
self-defence techniques on our siblings, or we may find the value of 
that same brother or sister as a loyal ally on the far side of the 
school yard or on the mean street corner.
<P>
	We answer to one another. We share responsibility in small and 
larger tasks. We see the value of shared love and caring, of 
complementary but equally valuable tasks as mother, father and 
children working together. We acknowledge the growing potential 
of family members. With greater freedom comes the greater 
acceptance of accountability to family, to society and to ourselves.
<P>
	We face the consequences of undone tasks. We learn right from 
wrong. We share the benefit of a common purse. We grow in the 
knowledge of the stories of the past, the guidelines of custom and 
culture and carry those gifts forward to share with our children.
<P>
	Sadly, the picture of the nurturing caring family is becoming less 
and less of a reality in Canada. It in fact has become the chief 
victim of our unfolding times and defective government policy. 
Divorce rates have increased 15-fold since the 1950s. It is 
projected that more than half of our young people will spend at 
least part of their growing up years in a single parent family.
<P>
	Family break-up is a recipe for trouble for our youth. Many seek 
community outside their own homes with between 100,000 and 
200,000 Canadian youth now homeless by choice. According to a 
UNICEF 1995 report, Canada has one of the highest teen suicide 
rates in the world. Since 1960 the rate has quadrupled to where 
almost 12 out of 100,000 of our young people, mostly boys, choose 
to put an end to their own future. ``There is a mountain of scientific 
evidence showing that when families disintegrate children often 
end up with intellectual, physical and emotional scars that persist 
for life'', points out social scientist Karl Zinmeister.
<P>
	The failure of the justice system under the Liberals is also a 
threat to families. Canadian families are victims of a justice system 
that is more concerned about the rights of the criminals including 
violent offenders than about law-abiding citizens.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	As part of the criminal justice system but within the walls of our 
homes is the issue of domestic violence. Domestic violence needs 
desperately to be addressed but not simply through a gender biased 
lens that prevents an accurate assessment and real solutions to the 
problems that exist. The Young Offenders Act does not take child 
crime seriously and, coupled with other legislation that weakens 
the role of parents in their children's lives, prevents parents from 
effectively tackling some of the criminal influences in their 
children.
<P>
	What effects are there on the economic front? A Fraser Institute 
study demonstrated that the average family of four pays 46 per cent 
of its income on taxes. The same study found that taxes on the 
average Canadian family have risen 1,167 per cent since 1961. That 
number takes on greater significance when we find that real family 
income has actually decreased since 1988. Real income has 
actually been eroded by successive Conservative and Liberal 
government tax and spend policies.
<P>
	A recent StatsCan report stated that since 1989, after tax family 
income has fallen 6.5 per cent, bringing it to the same level as at the 
end of the recession of the early 1980s. That income to maintain a 
household, it should be noted, now takes almost twice the number 
of paid hours it did 20 years ago.
<P>
	This runaway economic policy has remoulded the 
neighbourhoods of our nation. In 1986 only 12 per cent of 
Canadian households were made up of one person in the workforce 
and a spouse full time at home.
<P>
	The stresses are multiplied many times over for the single parent 
family. The precious commodity of time for communication or 
simple renewal is rare indeed, and the natural ally of a caring and 
understanding alternate adult is missing. Also of crucial 
importance is that money most often is too scarce. More than half 
of Canadians living in poverty are single parents and the 
overwhelming majority of these are women. However, because of 
debt levels and continuing government spending and the flawed 
appreciation of the importance of family, these patterns will 
continue to be the raw truth for our children and, unless something 
is done, for our children's children.
<P>
	The Liberals like to talk about wanting to put the best interests of 
the child first in their legislation. It has become a common refrain 
from that side of the House. Yet as usual, the actions of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4922"> 4922 </A></B>
<P>
government do not bear up under scrutiny when compared to its 
claims to be considering the child's best interests.
<P>
	One would think that addressing an issue such as child support 
and marriage dissolution would be one of the best places to help a 
person focus most accurately on the issues of children and their 
best interests. However, again the Liberals are mired in their 
misguided concepts of the role of governments. They refuse to 
realize that the best interest of the child is a family that is supported 
and encouraged as the most important institution in society. Let me 
ask the Liberals some questions about their version of the best 
interest of the child.
<P>
	Is the best interest of children shown in policy that passively sits 
back assuming that the present nature and rates of divorce are there 
without attempting to discover why and then attempt to do 
something substantive about it?
<P>
	Is the best interest of children served in making institutional day 
care facilities more prevalent at a price that puts further economic 
burdens on families leading then to a greater use of those facilities 
as a second parent goes out to work just to make ends meet?
<P>
	Is the best interest of children served by universal social 
programs that the government cannot afford instead of targeting 
those programs to those, particularly children, who are in 
legitimate need?
<P>
	Is the best interest of the child served by stripping authority from 
parents so that they cannot effectively raise their own children?
<P>
	Put simply, the most profound destructive force on families 
today is tax and spend, intrusive and divisive family policies that 
emanate from Liberal policy makers today.
<P>
	The Divorce Act which we are talking about today which 
originally granted federal jurisdiction over matters relating to 
divorce has been re-opened twice before, once in 1968 when no 
fault divorce was established and in 1982 to institute further 
changes. For the sake of speed through courts and presumably less 
acrimony for the sake of children, all accountability for actions of 
either side was removed except in decisions relating to child 
custody.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	It is significant that it is the very matters relating to children 
which still remain the most divisive and sadly, with this legislation 
that will not change. The full ramifications of the changes to the 
Divorce Act in the past or those which are before us today will 
probably never be quantified.
<P>
	Opening the act up as we are again today however, with the 
records of social devastation that are before us, must demand that 
the government look seriously at its responsibility and all the 
realities of our present situation. The kind of tinkering and 
ideologically based approach that is being suggested in Bill C-41 
reflects a bankruptcy of thought and conscience.
<P>
	The bill addresses the issue of enforcement of support payments. 
I applaud both the recognition of that need and the attempt to look 
at real enforcement procedures. Legally binding decisions should 
have that force of law for the sake of all those who are involved. It 
would be nice if this mindset of enforcement would extend more 
generally to the protection of law-abiding citizens in a wider 
criminal justice system but we will leave that debate for another 
day.
<P>
	Custodial parents do need protection in law for the rights that are 
granted to them in law. However, the government is using a one 
sided, gender biased approach which increases the commitment to 
enforce support payments but says absolutely nothing about the 
importance or the enforcement of child access agreements, 
something which is of equal importance to the child involved.
<P>
	There are two parents in any divorce involving children. There is 
usually the custodial and the non-custodial parent, yet the proposed 
changes do not show the same respect for non-custodial parents. 
Both parents have responsibilities and both parents have rights.
<P>
	The courts overwhelmingly make men the non-custodial parent. 
Sixty per cent of families living in poverty today are headed by 
men. Financial pressures, including high levels of taxation, have a 
powerful and destructive impact on the cohesiveness of those 
families. Men are involved. So are women. Yet the present system 
makes recourse difficult for the men who want to dispute a judge's 
support or access ruling.
<P>
	Personally, there have been men in my office who have gone 
bankrupt. Some of them have told me they are contemplating 
suicide because their lives have been ruined by endless court 
battles launched to gain access to their children without avail. How 
does Bill C-41 address their concerns?
<P>
	There is no commitment in the bill to enforce child access. 
Neither is there equality in the system in other areas. For example, 
Bill C-41 proposes to give the custodial parent access to the income 
information of their former spouse for three years. That is a radical 
departure from accepted principles of privacy. If consideration of 
those kinds of exceptions are being put into place, the same 
provisions should be there for both parents, for both sides of the 
divorce equation.
<P>
	Divorce hurts children. The pain experienced by children of 
divorce takes many forms. In addition to the many costs to society, 
there are of course the economic stresses which I mentioned earlier. 
One of the significant reasons for the financial problems is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4923"> 4923 </A></B>
<P>
simple fact that it costs much more to maintain two households 
than it does to maintain one.
<P>
	I find it strange. The government claims to be concerned about 
child poverty. That has been a dominant theme which we have seen 
in this government. However, the government cannot be taken 
seriously if it ignores the much greater risk of poverty that exists as 
a natural result of divorce.
<P>
	The economic difficulty comes a distant second in importance to 
the emotional trauma of divorce for children. Divorce is a very 
difficult experience for older children let alone the younger ones. 
The pain is dramatically multiplied by acrimonious legal 
proceedings which are further complicated by lawyers trained in 
adversarial methods which pit one spouse against the other.
<P>
	In 1970 the Law Reform Commission of Canada released a 
major study on family law which argued that adversarial 
proceedings in divorce actions should be eliminated. The primary 
reason for this change is the detrimental effect it had on children.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Here we are 26 years later, and what have successive Liberal and 
PC governments done during this time? We have a win-lose 
approach to divorce settlements that involves legal wrangling from 
beginning to end both in the courts and in lawyers' offices.
<P>
	We have an adversarial system that constantly succeeds in only 
one thing, destroying the relationship between the two combatants. 
It is designed to hinder the possibility of maintaining an ongoing 
relationship subsequent to the divorce that would be of benefit to 
the children. And what does the Liberal government, the 
government that claims to be family friendly and child centred, 
propose to remedy this situation? Absolutely nothing.
<P>
	Here in Bill C-41 the government has its best opportunity yet to 
initiate substantive and constructive change. What is it offering as a 
solution? Absolutely nothing.
<P>
	The Liberals are content to pursue their half measure, one sided, 
pat answer approach for an opportunity for real substantive change 
to this critical legislation. The government has dismissed 
completely the importance of the overall process. To the 
government the answer is simply enforcement and an inflexible 
payment schedule.
<P>
	Recently a marriage counsellor was in my office. As one who is 
on the frontlines of dealing with marriage difficulties, he expressed 
serious concern over the present situation. He confirmed that there 
is no prevention component in the present process dealing with 
partners concerning divorce.
<P>
	We have a government that advocates crime prevention, that 
pushes for greater health. Why in the world is there no interest in 
reforming the divorce process with a preventive component? Does 
the government ignore and discourage counsellors in the present 
situation? There is a determined lack of recognition of their value 
as front end prevention people to this crushing social problem. In 
addition, the government even charges the famous GST on their 
services.
<P>
	So who does the government victimize? Family breakups hit 
poor families the hardest, and that makes situations that are already 
difficult worse by divorce.
<P>
	I was talking to a local family lawyer in Coquitlam not long ago. 
He has spent 25 years in the practice of law. In his experience 
within family law he remembers only a handful of cases that 
actually avoided going through with full divorce after coming 
through his office.
<P>
	The present system feeds conflict. The present system adds fuel 
to the fire. The present system breeds anger and suspicion between 
the partners, and the victim is the child.
<P>
	However, there is an alternative, one that will help the legislative 
process and thus help the families involved. Presently the process 
of separation, spousal and child support, divorce and property 
division crosses provincial and federal jurisdictions.
<P>
	The child support decision is decided in a federal court, whereas 
the enforcement is generally a provincial matter. For the sake of 
those involved, this issue must be addressed. First, I would propose 
the concept of a unified family court, a place where all matters 
related to family breakup can be addressed under one roof. 
Accordingly, the many facets of decision making can be brought 
together in a fairer, broader context so that equity and enforcement 
can be better applied.
<P>
	Such a concept was introduced in B.C. with excellent results. It 
is time the federal government recognized the need for such a 
system and also showed leadership in making that happen.
<P>
	The second issue was advanced not only by the Reform Party of 
Canada but recently by the Canadian Bar Association: the necessity 
of the process of mediation. Mandatory mediation through a 
unified family court is a cornerstone of an effective process for 
addressing divorce.
<P>
	An effective system would make mediation mandatory in 
situations involving children. It would demonstrate itself as a 
process that facilitates solutions, not as the present system does, 
facilitating destruction.
<P>
	The goal of mediation is to arrive at a solution that is mutually 
acceptable and mutually respected. This process has the potential 
to dramatically reduce the number of win-lose situations that leave 
at least one party victimized by the process.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4924"> 4924 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	This individual personalized approach to divorce proceedings is 
impossible in the present adversarial, one size fits all type of 
approach the federal government is putting forward.
<P>
	In conclusion, we need to think of the best interests of the child. 
Children come into this world with two parents. The decision that 
goes toward that child must embody more than simple numbers, 
values and dollar figures.
<P>
	A child is more than the money that the parents bring in. It is 
composed of the genes, the extended family history, the ancestry 
and values of that family.
<P>
	The government, with this legislation, owes an apology to the 
whole population because we are all stronger if families are valued 
and nurtured.
<P>
	I cannot support the bill which is totally blind to the real 
opportunity we have before us for strengthening the foundation of 
society and rather would simply look at a small slice of the total 
picture.
<P>
	The value of families and children needs recognition in 
government policy. I challenge the government respectfully to 
recognize that this is but a small beginning that it has proposed and 
that the crisis of family disintegration is far too great to let wait any 
longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a brief comment and question to the member. The question is about 
the access issue.
<P>
	The member mentioned a couple of themes. She has been very 
consistent in the House. There is the issue of domestic violence. As 
the member will know, the latest report of the Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse in 1995 attributed 50 per cent of domestic 
violence to misuse of alcohol.
<P>
	Second, the Canada-U.S. forum on women's health that was held 
in Ottawa in June 1996 also identified a cost associated with 
domestic violence at $4.2 billion a year. The member is quite right. 
There are some initiatives that probably are beyond the scope and 
purview of this legislation in terms of dealing in a preventive way 
rather than a reactive way to the problem after it is there.
<P>
	At the Mississauga Crime Prevention Association annual 
meeting I met a delegation of people. There were men who came 
who had access orders. They did not have custody. They had a big 
problem.
<P>
	I would ask the member whether her experience is that the 
problem is not with this legislation. The access orders are in place 
and are fairly granted. It is the enforcement of the access orders 
that is the real problem, which is under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
intervention. On his comments about domestic violence,  I would 
agree that if we do not look at prevention at the root causes of these 
things, we do not do justice to the solutions we find.
<P>
	I certainly feel that not only do we need a more sure and 
effective criminal justice system, we need to look at the root 
causes. I would agree that the issue of alcohol is very intertwined 
with what is happening in society in those cases. That does need to 
be looked at. I challenge the member to go forward with his 
initiatives and the government in recognizing his initiatives in that 
area.
<P>
	Second, the question was on the issue of access. It is interesting 
that the member brought this up. Again, I was in discussion with a 
lawyer. Because this issue is so important to me, I tried to get input 
from various sources.
<P>
	I am not sure if every province is the same. In my province of 
British Columbia there is implemented quite an effective technique 
of child support enforcement. It has created a whole section of 
personnel to put that enforcement into place.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	A comment was made to me by this knowledgeable friend, a 
lawyer, that the same structure, in fact the same offices, could be 
used to make sure there is enforcement for access. The same 
individuals who make enforcement happen for support could make 
enforcement happen for access and could check the compliance to 
the court order. Both are court ordered. Both are legal 
requirements.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my speech, both parents have rights. Both 
parents have responsibilities. The present situation only enforces 
the right of one parent and the responsibilities of the other. Surely if 
the federal government can intrude or take the initiative to have 
guidelines that in fact overtake a provincial enforcement-as our 
Bloc friend has suggested, the guidelines for support are in their 
case and in most cases provincial jurisdiction-if the federal 
government because of its interest in this can take initiatives in that 
direction, initiatives in the enforcement of support, why can it not 
take initiatives in the enforcement of access and direction to the 
provinces?
<P>
	Certainly if one is up for discussion, the rest should be as well. 
We have two parents, we have rights and responsibilities of each. 
To be fair, to be just, governments should act for all citizens in this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, from 
here on, official opposition members will be sharing their time.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to Bill C-41 now before us. It has two 
faces: the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River sees it 
as a panacea, the answer to all ills, while our colleague, the 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, who just spoke, views it as a 
step backward, not forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4925"> 4925 </A></B>
<P>
	The reality probably lies somewhere in between. There are some 
improvements, undoubtedly, but there are also serious 
shortcomings. It all depends on how you look at the bill.
<P>
	Members will recall that the first federal Divorce Act only goes 
back to 1968. For our younger colleagues, 1968 is a generation ago, 
it is almost another century. For me, it was the year I was still at the 
court house and I remember the first times this act was applied.
<P>
	Before 1968, the provinces had jurisdiction in matters of divorce 
and only two provinces had no divorce legislation: Newfoundland 
and Quebec. The legislation was made uniform in 1968. The act 
was amended in 1985 and we are now living with the 1985 Divorce 
Act, which, as these things go in Canada, took effect from June 1, 
1986. There is always a time lag between the passage of legislation 
and the date it takes effect.
<P>
	The wish to now set parameters for determining the amount of 
support payments, is, in my view, a positive feature in the idea of 
how things should work presented by the member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River. It would be much simpler to have a judge 
determine the amount to be awarded for a child's needs than to 
continue with the method that has been in use since 1968 of 
producing the well known lists of children's needs.
<P>
	My hon. friend and colleague, the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, who is himself a lawyer, has 
probably on a number of occasions in his career submitted lists of 
children's needs in court. When the lists submitted by the 
respondents are compared, you find that they add up to almost 238 
per cent of the child's real needs.
<P>
	The language used in the proceedings is inflammatory, 
something we must try to get away from. We must reduce the 
involvement of the courts, and this is one of the positive ways we 
can achieve this, by setting parameters, developing grids, from 
which we can undoubtedly deviate in exceptional circumstances, 
but which will at least serve as basic guides. So much the better if 
we can keep all or some of these problems from reaching court. It is 
not the ideal place to resolve them.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Those who spoke before me mentioned that the child must be at 
the center of all decisions made in a divorce. That is a principle on 
which everyone agrees, except perhaps for those who go before the 
courts, in many cases, and use the child not as a person to be 
protected but as a bargaining chip in the divorce if not an 
instrument of blackmail. One parent says: ``If my support 
payments were not so high, perhaps I could afford to take the child 
more often'' or ``I will see her less often in other circumstances'', 
whatever.
<P>
	It is dramatic when a little boy or a little girl becomes a 
bargaining tool in court, when they should be protected. In that 
sense, it was a good thing to establish payment  grids, parameters to 
determine how much should be paid in support.
<P>
	It is also an improvement over previous legislation, the act of 
1968 and the act of 1985, in that those who must pay support can 
now be located and forced to pay. Society should not have to pay 
for those who default on their support payments.
<P>
	It is great that defaulters can be located and forced to pay, that 
there will be better access to information that can be searched to 
identify and locate these individuals or their employers and that, in 
other cases, instalments will have to be paid in guarantee. I do not 
think that we can disagree with such improvements over the 1968 
and the 1985 legislation.
<P>
	But these acts all have a basic deficiency. This basic deficiency 
about the Divorce Act, 1968 and the Divorce Act, 1985 was the fact 
that divorce become commonplace. As divorce became trivial, so 
did family policy. Under our Divorce Act, solicitors are only 
required to inform their clients that a mediation system exists. The 
parties are under no obligation to submit to any form of 
conciliation or mediation which, in many cases, would preclude the 
adversarial process and the adrenaline rush it causes on both sides 
of the barricade, and this is an appropriate word to describe the 
situation in this case.
<P>
	If, like in some American states such as California and Michigan 
for instance, before divorce procedures can proceed further, 
appointments with social workers and psychologists were 
mandatory, I think this would be another step in the right direction.
<P>
	It is clear that we miss the point every time we amend the 
Divorce Act without taking onto account the fact that there is, first 
and foremost, a family reality, a family unit to that needs to be 
protected, and parents find themselves without options.
<P>
	Help comes their way after the fact, when it is too late to do any 
good. People seldom reconcile after battling against one another in 
court in an adversarial process. Experience shows that the doorstep 
of the court house is not the place where reconciliation takes place.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes, the divorce decree does not put an 
end to the marriage. It merely testifies that the marriage is dead, 
stating that nothing is working between the spouses. Something 
should be done at a much earlier stage.
<P>
	In this regard, we are poorly equipped because-it always come 
back to this-our famous 1867 Constitution, the British North 
America Act, divided powers between the federal government and 
the provinces. Thus, under subsection 91(26) of the British North 
America Act, marriage and divorce matters come under federal 
jurisdiction while, under subsection 92(12), the solemnization of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4926"> 4926 </A></B>
<P>
marriage and, under subsection 92(13),  property and civil rights all 
come under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	How can we have a standard policy when we have legislators 
setting their policies in different places? Quebec has long 
demanded a standard family policy to be set by a single 
jurisdiction. And it had done so.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Bill 89 passed by the Quebec National Assembly in 1981 even 
contained divorce provisions, an integrated policy they have never 
been able to implement because they never got the powers back. 
The famous 1982 patriation of the Constitution has made it 
impossible to amend the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Quebec's civil code being one of the criteria for recognizing 
Quebec as a distinct society, according to the minister, Bill C-110 
passed by this House supposedly recognized Quebec as a distinct 
society and thus it should have recognized Quebec's primacy or its 
exclusive jurisdiction over marriage and divorce matters whatever 
the solemnization and background may be. But all these 
considerations are not mentioned when this bill was introduced, 
just as they were not mentioned in Bill C-110, which is not worth 
much more than the paper it is printed on.
<P>
	This is unfortunate if not regrettable because, under Bill C-41 as 
it now stands, some provinces will end up with provincial payment 
grids that will have to be approved by the governor in council, 
while other provinces will not set their own grids so that the federal 
grids will rightfully apply. There is no real standard policy. Why 
should the payment grids now being finalized by Quebec not be 
recognized?
<P>
	I simply suggest that the bill should be amended in committee in 
light of the fact that some provinces already have their own 
payment grids. In the eyes of the federal legislator, these grids may 
not be sufficient, but it is not up to the federal legislator to judge 
what provincial legislators are doing. It is up to the voters in each 
province.
<P>
	If the voters in New Brunswick are not happy with what their 
provincial politicians are doing with regard to family law, they only 
have to vote for a new government; the same goes for every other 
province and for us as federal legislators.
<P>
	Since we are now sharing our time, let me close by saying that 
we will support Bill C-41 in principle for the reasons listed by my 
colleagues, the hon. member for Québec and the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm. We will work on improving this bill in 
committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was one comment that perked up my ears with 
regard to recovering those powers related to  divorce. When did 
Quebec ever have those powers under Confederation?
<P>
	Second, the hon. member should be telling Quebecers that the 
Reform Party, if it were the government, could deliver those kinds 
of things to Quebecers in a looser and more flexible Confederation, 
and that separation is not the answer for Quebecers to achieve their 
aspirations in social policy. There are other ways to negotiate, to 
opt in to a better arrangement.
<P>
	I wanted to comment on those two points. The hon. member is 
talking about looking back to another day when Quebec had those 
powers. When did Quebec in Confederation have those powers of 
divorce? As an alternative for looking at future social policy the 
hon. member ought to be telling Quebecers that there is a way 
besides separation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to reply to the comment made 
by the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby, who asked 
the right question. However the problem goes back to 1867, when it 
was decided to have a horse with two heads. It was decided then 
that some powers, such as the solemnization of marriage, would 
come under the jurisdiction of the provinces, while others, such as 
divorce proceedings, would be federal matters.
<P>
	Couples living in Canada are subject to specific rules. When 
things go bad between them, should they have to deal with two 
different sets of laws? Should they have to deal with different 
courts? The whole system would be a lot simpler if only one level 
heard all the issues relating to family law, instead of having judges 
from various courts intervening in the process.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This would be one way of streamlining the process. Even if we 
take into account the assumptions made by the hon. member and 
assume that the current federal system will not change and that the 
issue of sovereignty will be set aside, letting the provinces look 
after the administration of local justice would still be an 
improvement.
<P>
	Who is in a better position than the provinces to implement the 
policies relating to family law? I submit that this power should be 
given back to the provinces or, to be more accurate, that it should 
have been left to the provinces in 1867 and never have become a 
federal matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, often it is posed that if we get back to it, separation is 
really the answer. If the member is talking about one house dealing 
with matrimonial matters and family law, we have the opportunity 
now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4927"> 4927 </A></B>
<P>
	All the provinces have to do is simply establish a unified family 
court. I have had assurances from the justice minister's department 
that it is prepared to appoint judges who could fit into a unified 
situation so that the provinces would have all their appropriate 
support workers to emphasize mediation under one house. One 
might call this a one-stop shop where both the provincial powers 
and the federal jurisdiction of a provincially appointed judge and 
a judge appointed by the federal government who has inherent 
jurisdiction could also be in this one building.
<P>
	That experiment has been going on now for some 20 years in 
various jurisdictions within Canada. There is real opportunity to 
make Confederation work and deliver exactly what he is talking 
about. We do have those situations in Canada. It is only up to the 
province to just simply assign the money and get on with it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not need the delegation of 
federal powers to the provinces, we do not need the federal 
government to have its programs administered by the provinces. 
What we need is a vesting of power. This means that a government 
gives up a field of jurisdiction to another one, and that such process 
is enshrined in the Constitution.
<P>
	There is a major difference between the hon. member's vision, 
which I respect even though I do not share it, and that of the Bloc 
Quebecois, to the effect that these powers must be recovered by the 
provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was listening to the debate. My wife and I will be 
attending a couple of weddings in the next couple of weeks. We 
attended weddings over the summer, as I am sure many members 
present and many Canadians watching did. As we are talking about 
amendments to the Divorce Act, running through everyone's mind 
are weddings that they have recently attended or perhaps a wedding 
of their children or of a niece or a nephew. Many of us at our stage 
in life are going through this. It seems they come in batches.
<P>
	I was struck by the fact that maybe we are closing the barn door 
after the horse has already escaped. Perhaps we should be 
discussing a new marriage act. Perhaps, as many of us have said to 
others or to ourselves in admonition, it should be a whole heck of a 
lot harder to get married. Perhaps we are putting our emphasis in 
the wrong place.
<P>
	As we look at our society, as other speakers before me have very 
rightly pointed out, the foundation of our society is built around 
family. If we look at families or at particular societies such as 
religious or ethnic societies which place a very strong value on 
family, on commitment and on the responsibility to comes from  
that, we find that the divorce rate is substantially lower than it is 
among the general population.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	I am not standing before the House and Canadians pontificating 
from a holier than thou perspective. I stand here as a person with 
considerable experience in these matters, having been twice 
divorced. My mother was divorced. Carrying on a long line of 
family history, my grandmother was divorced in 1932 in Alberta. 
That was not a small feat in those days.
<P>
	I have said many times than it is better to be from a broken home 
than in one. However, I do not in any way diminish or denigrate the 
importance of family and how much better it is for children to be 
raised within a strong and supportive family. There is nothing more 
important in a child's life. Having said that, we know statistically a 
good percentage, perhaps even a majority, of marriages are going 
to end unhappily in divorce. The product of that unhappy 
circumstance will be children who will suffer in varying degrees 
from the effects of the divorce. Some children, depending on the 
maturity, wisdom and good faith of their parents, will suffer 
significantly less and, in fact, may benefit.
<P>
	From time to time as members of Parliament we deal with 
constituents who come to us because there is nowhere else to go. 
Many of these people are single parents who are struggling to 
support a family. Some are non-custodial parents who feel 
grievously wronged because although they have lived up to every 
aspect of their agreement, they find themselves not able to be with 
their children. This legislation does not address that. In my 
opinion, that is a grievous error.
<P>
	When we delve into the reasons for which families break up or 
why we have such acrimony over visitation, very often that is 
driven by retribution. Very often it is the chicken or the egg. If the 
non-custodial parent pays support regularly, he or she will get 
visitation rights regularly. In my experience, the amount of money 
that is awarded to the custodial parent is perhaps not as important 
as the consistency of receiving that money. It is important, but it is 
not nearly as important as the custodial parent being able to depend 
religiously on receiving that money every month.
<P>
	That brings me to my perspective on this particular debate. I 
come to this perspective from the position of having paid 
maintenance payments virtually all of my adult life. There has not 
been a month that I have not made maintenance payments for as 
long as I can remember. Having made those payments, I was able to 
subtract from my income, which was generally speaking higher 
than my ex-spouse's income, the amount that I paid in support and 
my ex-wife paid the tax on it. This created a fairly big problem for 
her at the end of the year. She did not pay tax on it when she 
received it and the net result was that at the end of the year she had 
a tax bill she had to pay.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4928"> 4928 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I discussed the matter with her and asked what she thought was 
the best way to handle it. Should it be taxable for her, should it be 
taxable for me or should we split it in the middle? We decided the 
best way to do it was to arrive at whatever the payment was going 
to be and I would pay tax on half and she would pay tax on half.
<P>
	That is not what is going to happen with this bill. The 
non-custodial parent will be paying the tax and the receiving parent 
will not be paying the tax. It will not affect maintenance 
agreements that are already in effect. I am sure that the courts will 
take into account who will be paying the tax when they make their 
judgments.
<P>
	This legislation envisions a grid. The grid is a schedule of the 
amount of maintenance payments per child that will be paid to the 
custodial parent, usually the wife, based on the income of the 
non-custodial parent or generally speaking the husband. That is not 
necessarily a bad idea. However, it does not allow for judicial 
discretion. In my experience, very often family break-ups come as 
a direct result of financial pressures. When the family breaks up 
there is not a whole lot of money to go around anyway. Very often 
the father pays support to a family where the custodial parent, the 
wife, has remarried and has a standard of living far beyond 
anything that the ex-husband has.
<P>
	These things are not black and white. We tend to make these 
laws based on our experience with the extremes. Very often the 
extremes are horrid. The fact is that if a husband is not going to 
make support payments, no amount of legislation in the world is 
going to force him to do it. He has to do it because he accepts the 
responsibility and it is the right thing to do.
<P>
	I guess this is where our society has kind of become unglued. 
When a couple makes the decision to get a divorce, when did it 
become their right to absolve themselves of the responsibilities that 
were incurred in the marriage and they brought children into the 
world? When, because I decided to be divorced, did it become 
someone else's responsibility to be financially responsible for my 
children? If I am divorced, for whatever reason, and I cannot afford 
to look after the financial responsibilities that I incurred of my own 
free will in my first marriage, it does not give me the right to take 
on new responsibilities in a subsequent marriage and then claim 
poverty and say: ``I can't afford to look after my first 
responsibilities because I have taken on a second batch of 
responsibilities''.
<P>
	When we make decisions we have to be big enough to accept the 
responsibilities that come with those decisions. We are not saying 
not to do it but are saying: ``Having made the decision, for 
goodness sake, be big enough to live up to the responsibilities that 
you have''.
<P>
	I would suggest that because the receiving spouse is depending 
on the maintenance payments, it is entirely appropriate that the 
government, representing all of the people, take whatever steps are 
prudent to enforce maintenance payments. We understand that 
maintenance payments are legislated federally and are enforced 
provincially. It has to be done with a foundation of fairness. If 
someone is going to have his or her wages garnisheed, certainly 
notice should be given. I do not know about other folks, but as an 
employer when I saw a garnishee notice coming for anyone who 
worked for me, it raised an eyebrow.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	What happens if the person who is on the receiving end of the 
garnishee is living up to the obligations but is involved in some sort 
of a messy dispute?
<P>
	Not all lawyers get up in the morning and ask, ``how can we do 
the right thing?'' It is possible that some of them do not have a clue 
because they did not do their homework. Some of them might 
decide they are going to make life miserable for someone and do 
not use due diligence before they issue a garnishee notice. The 
notion of being able to garnishee without notice is wrong.
<P>
	Similarly, I have real difficulty with the ability to go back into 
tax records subsequent to a divorce. In my view the only reason for 
this could be in order to try to have the amount of maintenance 
payment increased.
<P>
	When people decide to divorce, it seems to me that should be 
that. Each spouse should know the income of both spouses to 
determine what fair support should be. After that has been 
concluded, why should either party have the right to open the 
closed files five years down the road? It does not make sense to me.
<P>
	Some of the criticisms of this bill, both constructive and positive 
and negative criticism, are that it takes the judicial discretion out of 
the awarding of payments. It does not necessarily consider the 
ability of the non-custodial parent to make the payments that have 
been determined, nor does it take into consideration the financial 
circumstances of the custodial parent.
<P>
	Although the vast majority of divorces end with the female being 
the custodial parent, it is possible that the husband is the injured 
party in the case. It is possible that the female who ends up with 
custody is also the one who initiates the divorce. There are 
circumstances where in such situations the female goes from one 
marriage almost directly into another. I know of some that have 
resulted in the wives not having any negative financial 
consequences whatsoever. However, the ex-husband has been out 
of house, home and hearth in order to support the new marriage.
<P>
	I am really nervous about setting arbitrary rules that do not allow 
for judicial discretion. That is why we have divorces that go before 
judges.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4929"> 4929 </A></B>
<P>
	Another concern about the guidelines is this. Are they to be a 
ceiling or a floor? What about the situation where a parent is 
capable of paying a lot more?
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Third is the notion of reopening cases which have already been 
closed.
<P>
	In 1977 Betty Jane Wylie, author of <I>Beginnings: a book for 
widows</I>, wrote that in the dim dark dark days before antiseptics 
women often died in childbirth and it was not uncommon for a man 
to outlive two or three wives. A man can still have two or three 
wives today but it is because of a thing called divorce. It is a lot 
more messy and a lot more expensive. There is absolutely no 
question it is far more expensive to get a divorce than it is to tough 
it out.
<P>
	I will conclude my comments in the debate with the notion that it 
is perhaps much more important for us as a society to put our 
emphasis on the marriage and making it more difficult to get 
married rather than making it easier to get a divorce. Sometimes, 
and I speak from personal experience, the tougher thing to do is to 
work through the problems and tough it out. Therefore, the notion 
of a unified family court, the notion of arbitration and mediation 
and a proactive effort would be a very worthwhile exercise for 
Parliament to consider.
<P>
	As the great Canadian Charlie Farquharson said, statistically two 
out of five marriages end in divorce; the rest of us stick it out until 
the bitter end. Therein might be a pearl of wisdom all of us might 
learn from. As we discuss the ramifications of divorce and family 
law on children, there is absolutely no question that those 
Canadians who are able to tough it out to the bitter end are probably 
going to find that what they have done for their family will pay 
great rewards in the long run.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member referred to a joke which with all due respect I do not share. 
Toughing out a marriage unfortunately is an attitude which has 
become far too prevalent in our society. The member well knows 
that when a couple splits up one thing is true, and that is that a 
second residence will be necessary. In the absence of any changes, 
the income levels of those two people, in terms of their 
accumulated revenues and the costs going out, are going to 
deteriorate. In fact, as a result of divorce many families live in 
poverty.
<P>
	My question has to do with squaring the member's statement. I 
thought I detected some contradiction in his statements. He 
described his own unfortunate circumstance and I am sorry to hear 
that he has been divorced twice, but he said that we have to be big 
enough to accept our responsibilities and tough it out. I did not hear 
the member comment on the impact on the children and whether or 
not there were circumstances where even if the relationship had 
deteriorated that it was important enough, especially during the 
early years of a child's life, that the member should have been big 
enough to live up to his responsibilities which he undertook in his 
marriage vows.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a very fair statement. When I 
made the comment about living up to responsibilities, I was talking 
about living up to the financial responsibilities. It is absolutely 
essential that once we have accepted our responsibility for making 
maintenance payments for our children, it is our responsibility.
<P>
	The member opposite did not point out that I said often it is 
better for a child to be from a broken home than in one. That is 
exactly the case. I do not think there is any question there are 
families that are able to stick through it. Obviously, had I been able 
to for whatever reason, but because I did not do it does not make it 
right.
<P>
	Statistically, the point I made was that when we look at the 
consequences of divorce, when we look at the consequences of 
family breakdown and single parenting as a direct consequence of 
divorce, it is fairly evident that families that do not suffer the 
consequences of that, for whatever reason whether it is alcohol or 
some other reason, are probably going to stand a better chance than 
families that do. It is self-evident.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
appreciate the candidness with which the member for Edmonton 
Southwest expressed his comments. It is an issue most of us will 
deal with. I too would like to reflect a little on a personal note. A 
very personal friend of mine and his spouse are going through the 
trials and tribulations of a possible breakdown.
<P>
	Given what the member has said in terms of suggesting that this 
bill might expedite the possibility of bringing about divorce or not 
providing an adequate remedy, I seem to get the impression at least 
from my constituents and many others who solicit all members of 
this House of Commons that the judicial system tends to lean more 
toward the interests of the female custodial parent as opposed to the 
male custodial parent.
<P>
	Could the member clarify for me and for this House what his real 
objections are? There seems to be a contradiction in his statement 
in terms of suggesting that the legislation would not allow the 
judicial process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, this legislation and the 
application of a grid for suggested payment guidelines was, as I 
said earlier in the budget debate, a fairly responsible and good step. 
The reason is that it sets out an amount whereby the custodial 
parent can expect to receive approximately that amount for each 
child.
<P>
	Where I said that in my opinion it was perhaps weak was that we 
still must have judicial discretion. This has to be part of any 
payment that is made. It is very likely that while judicial discretion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4930"> 4930 </A></B>
<P>
is allowed in the bill, in other  jurisdictions where a grid is in place, 
the grid has taken precedence over judicial discretion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member for 
Lévis, I am pleased to take part in this debate. As a man, I felt it 
was my duty to do so, because anything to do with child support is 
wrongly seen as being a subject that is primarily of interest to 
women.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	This is based on the fact that, in reality, unfortunately, it is 
women who, as things now stand, more often find themselves 
responsible for families after a divorce.
<P>
	I can understand the Reform Party member for Edmonton 
Southwest, who is one of the more moderate members of his party 
in many respects, including social issues. Nonetheless, I am not 
happy to hear him say that it would be better to tough it out than to 
get divorced. Toughing it out means, in certain cases, for many 
women and children, and perhaps for men too, putting up with 
intolerable suffering.
<P>
	There is one statistic we cannot ignore. In 1990, in Canada, there 
were 78,152 divorces, and there are undoubtedly more now. 
Naturally, these divorces involve men and women, so if we 
multiply this number by two, we see that they affect 150,000 men 
and women. Furthermore, if we presume an average of two or more 
children per family, we are looking at 300,000 children affected by 
these divorces in Canada, and that is just for that particular year. It 
is not cumulative. Therefore, there were so many instances of 
divorce that affected 300,000 people in 1990, and probably 300,000 
people and up were affected in 1991, and the numbers continue to 
rise.
<P>
	We also know that an overwhelming majority, 98 per cent in 
1988, of those receiving child support payments were women. The 
percentage is lower today, but it is still very high. That is why I say 
that I, as a man, and the men that I represent, should also be 
concerned about the situation. We can, however, have different 
points of view, depending on the party line and depending on the 
objectives of the various parties concerned.
<P>
	I am a former member of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development and a current member of the Standing 
Committee on Health, together with the hon. member for 
Mississauga-South. We both know how important the first years of 
life are and how economic and social conditions may have a 
subsequent effect on health and also create problems, I was going 
to say with respect to delinquency, but also for a person's social and 
individual development.
<P>
	Ideally, and I am sure we all agree, everyone would have a father 
and mother who stay with their children until they reach the age of 
majority or even beyond that and who pay for their education. That 
is the ideal situation we would all wish for.
<P>
	However, there is one factor we cannot ignore and I am referring 
to those 78,152 divorces that occurred in 1990. This does not 
include people living common law, who separate without first 
having been married and who have children. That is why when last 
year I saw the Minister of Justice table his plan, and we even saw a 
glimmer of hope in the last federal budget, something that had 
changed following the Thibodeau judgment. Basically, the 
well-known debate on deduction of support payments was no 
longer about considering one parent or the other, but about what 
was best for the children.
<P>
	Twenty per cent of the children in this country live below the 
poverty line, and the vast majority are in single parent families.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	We can say quite confidently that most of the time, in 80 per cent 
of the cases, these families are headed by women. That is a fact. I 
must say I am particularly sensitive to the situation of these 
mothers. In the final instance, children will suffer if we do not deal 
with the problem in the best possible way. And they will suffer for a 
long time.
<P>
	If the economic situation gets worse, with all the psychological 
and other stress this entails, and this goes on for a number of years, 
the impact on the children can be catastrophic. Sometimes I hear 
members of this House, especially members of the Reform Party, 
say that the rate of juvenile delinquency is terrible, the crime rate is 
terrible and what is happening in our society is terrible. People 
often say they do not feel safe any more. I am willing to believe 
that, but we must try and understand how this happens.
<P>
	Certain megastudies, which take into account the results of every 
possible analysis have discovered that these problems are often due 
to socio-economic problems that affect children when they are 
young and are not even aware of what is going on in the world. 
Stress is not always transmitted in an explicit and verbal way. It 
may be expressed through family tension, bickering, the tension 
that may exist between spouses, whether they are living together or 
not.
<P>
	When spouses take legal action against each other, that affects 
the children. I am not saying this is so in all cases because some 
couples divorce amicably. Some men meet their responsibilities 
properly.
<P>
	We are not accusing those who are acting properly. But there is 
one social fact the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest ought to 
understand: regrettably, a good proportion of people do not meet 
their responsibilities toward their children properly, and most of 
these are fathers. Sometimes they may feel that since they did not 
obtain custody, or joint custody, they are justified in making their 
ex-wives suffer without realizing that the ones suffering the most 
are their children. And that is intolerable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4931"> 4931 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not want to sound too critical. Let me take a different 
approach, since I feel that it is important for this debate to be held. 
It is important for we men to shoulder our responsibility, just as 
women responsible for single-parent families must. We must be 
aware that single parents need our help, be they women or men.
<P>
	Recently, I attended a function of a single parent association in 
my riding. It was celebrating its 15th anniversary. There was a time 
when no men were seen in such associations, but I could see that 
now there are. Men are also heads of single parent households, and 
they find that incredibly difficult, as indeed it is.
<P>
	I do not want to get into details of the private lives of the people 
here in this House, but I am sure that some here are single parents. 
Their duties here demand a lot of their time, and they may not have 
as much time as they would like to devote to their children, who 
may well have complaints about this.
<P>
	I know that similar discussions go on in other professions, where 
there are also heavy responsibilities, where much is demanded of 
single parents, not just financially, but the financial aspect is a very 
important one, and ends up being intolerable. As I have already 
said, 20 per cent of the children in Canada, a country said to have 
one of the best standards of living in the world, 20 per cent of 
Canadian or Quebec children, are living below the poverty line.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Among the leading causes of this poverty is the situation of 
single-parent families and people not fulfilling their 
responsibilities properly.
<P>
	While agreeing with the objective pursued by the minister and 
finding relatively few faults with his bill, I cannot help but notice 
that the bill shifts away from the strategy announced last spring. 
We, in the Bloc Quebecois, were afraid there would be 
discrepancies in the bill or that some of the provisions might be 
harmful.
<P>
	Speaking as a former member of the human resources 
committee, I also notice through all this, good intentions and all, 
the excessively paternalistic attitude of the federal government in 
this area. I am also speaking as a Quebecer. Since last year, we have 
had in Quebec a scheme providing for all the conditions regarding 
support payments, including provision for support payments to be 
automatically be collected from spouses who are in default. It is 
complicated. It is all new and already there are growing pains. The 
scheme is still in its infancy.
<P>
	The strange thing is-I can hear you from here, saying: ``Here 
goes the Bloc, the official opposition, again with their line'', but 
spouses who do not fulfil their obligations are in fact not honouring 
their marriage contract or commitments. And in wanting to 
interfere in this area, the federal government is interfering in an 
area of provincial jurisdiction. Let me elaborate.
<P>
	Marriage comes under the jurisdiction of the provinces, while 
divorce is a federal matter. There are also those who are not 
married. When they separate, it is not a divorce. These people form 
a different group and they are not in any way subject to this bill, 
which only deals with the issue of divorce. However, the fact is 
that, in Canada and in Quebec, more and more people are involved 
in common-law relationships.
<P>
	Again, the paradox with the current federal system is that people 
get married under the laws of the province but divorce under 
federal laws. This is somewhat odd, but such is the situation right 
now.
<P>
	In this area, the federal government displays a committed, 
pervasive and embarrassing paternalistic attitude, as it does in the 
education and health sectors. In this area, as in the other two which 
I just mentioned, the federal government introduces guidelines in a 
bill, presents the whole package to the provinces and tells them: 
``Sure, you can get involved in this, but provided you do this, that 
and the other thing. If you do not accept our guidelines, then we are 
sorry but the federal system will prevail as regards the issue of 
divorce, because it comes under federal jurisdiction''.
<P>
	This creates a strange situation. For example, if a married couple 
with two children divorces, the federal legislation will prevail. 
However, the same situation involving common-law spouses 
whose children have the same financial needs will be dealt with 
under provincial law.
<P>
	Given all the differences in treatment that can take place, I ask 
you: Is this a fair and balanced situation that will promote 
consistent social development? This is one of the flaws of the 
federal system. We have no choice but to say it again: the federal 
government, the federal ``big brother'' feels compelled to get 
involved, with its not so subtle approach, in issues that come under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	When one province does not agree, it is punished, it is not 
entitled to the benefits of the federal system, or, when there are no 
benefits, the federal government carries the day.
<P>
	That, therefore, is the opposition's opinion of this bill. I hope 
that debate goes well. It is possible that the Liberal government, 
which has the majority, will decide not to make any concessions or 
compromises, but that would not be conducive to harmony. At the 
outset, I hope that government representatives agree to the 
compromises that will be proposed by official opposition members, 
who are trying to make a constructive contribution, because these 
are situations affecting human beings, individuals on whom the 
decisions made will have important social repercussions, 
particularly for children, and therefore for everyone's future.

<P>
	I know that the member for Mississauga South is a sensitive 
man. He sits with me on the Standing Committee on Health. As 
I know the influence he has over his colleagues, I challenge him 
to try to convince them to think about the health of children, given 
that we want to see more harmonious relations between men and 
women who have responsibilities with respect to children, and, 
although there has been a softening of their position, to convince 
them to be receptive to the compromises we are proposing.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, we may have time for a 
30-second question and a one-minute answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a brief comment and a question. The comment has to do with 
common law relationships. The member commented about how 
prevalent this is in our society.
<P>
	The member might be interested in studying some research 
about the incidence of family violence in families and those living 
common law. I think he will find that the incidence of family 
violence is more prevalent in common law relationships.
<P>
	My question has to do with prevention versus dealing with the 
problems after they happen. The member says Quebec has a good 
system in that it garnishees or takes away the payments so that 
orders can be enforced. The member spent all this time talking 
about how to deal with the problem after the problem exists.
<P>
	I want to ask the member whether he does not think that a system 
like the one they have in some of the states in the United States, 
where couples with problems are required to take a 12-week 
program as a reality check before contemplating divorce, should 
occur before divorces are granted in Quebec or Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not very familiar with the 
American system the hon. member is referring to. Frankly, when I 
do not know a subject very well, I do not usually talk about it 
because I am not convincing. And when I am not convinced 
myself, I am even less convincing.
<P>
	Having said that, I have not closed my mind to this idea. We will 
consider it together. The hon. member for Québec sitting in front of 
me is our critic on the status of women. If this is a good idea, she 
will surely give us some advice after thoroughly reviewing the 
issue. So we will have to wait for that.
<P>
	One last thing. I do not know what it is like elsewhere, but in 
Quebec, for example, CLSCs, local community health centres, or 
private organizations provide services to attempt reconciliation 
before a couple separates; they try to help the spouses patch things 
up while looking after the children's best interest. There is a long 
tradition  associated with this. Things do not always go smoothly 
because there are unfortunately cases of extreme violence in which 
people even manage to kill their former spouses, which is 
deplorable.
<P>
	Finally, Reformers often talk about criminals on the streets, 
dangerous offenders who make people feel unsafe, but 85 per cent 
of crimes are committed by people who are oftentimes very close, 
like family members, and who are often former spouses. The hon. 
member talks about prevention. I pay close attention to this and I 
will support any measure he may propose when-

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
subpoenas are not issued on a whim and politicians are not above 
the law. We are all citizens of this country called Canada. The rule 
of law is fundamental to our democracy. Therefore, it is essential 
that we as Canada's lawmakers be subject to the laws passed by this 
Parliament.
<P>
	A Saskatchewan court is calling upon the deputy leader of the 
Conservatives in the Senate to testify on corruption charges in the 
Devine government where he was second in command. He is 
avoiding court by invoking a little used privilege of MPs and 
senators that excuses them from answering a subpoena for 40 days 
before or after a session as well as during a session.
<P>
	In avoiding the court order, the Tories' deputy leader is 
breaching Canadians' trust in a place where trust should be raised 
to the highest level. The Senate remains an anachronism yet it has 
continued to be supported by this Prime Minister.
<P>
	The actions of the Tories' deputy leader has tarnished the image

dreary by years of uncritically accepting corporate Canada's 
pathetic platitudes about what Canada needs, we see the political 
pendulum start to come back in 1996.
<P>
	From the provincial byelection in Halifax-Fairview where the

Hamilton East where we came second getting more votes than the 
Tories and Reformers put together, to the re-election of the NDP in

rejecting what the right-wing Liberals, Tories and Reformers have

Speaker, on behalf of the taxpayers of Canada I would like to thank 
the governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and 
Yukon for their constitutional challenge of the Liberal 
government's flawed national firearms registration system.
<P>
	Last week the provincial justice ministers argued publicly that 
the registration of rifles and shotguns will not be effective in 
reducing crime; that gun registration does nothing to reduce crimes 
involving firearms or smuggling; that gun registration is an 
inappropriate use of scarce resources right across the country. They 
said that the federal government has repeatedly failed to produce 
evidence of a correlation between a firearms registry and reduction 
in crime. They said it is time to target criminals who use weapons 
to commit crimes, not penalize law-abiding citizens under the 
guise of gun registration.
<P>
	If this court challenge is successful, then the hundreds of 
millions saved will be able to be redirected to fighting real crime 
and real criminals by putting more police officers in our

	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all Canadians understand and appreciate that law, order 
and respect for the individual are important components in a free 
and democratic society. I believe Canadians would react very 
strongly to anyone or anything that would threaten our quality of 
life which is based on, among other things, our respect for law and 
order.
<P>
	It is true that not all laws are popular with all Canadians. 
However, by respecting these laws we guarantee order in our 
society. Anyone who intentionally encourages defiance or 
disrespect for these laws would be acting irresponsibly and should 
be denounced.
<P>
	Last month the Reform member for Yorkton-Melville visited 
my riding of Souris-Moose Mountain in order to advise people 
not to respect Bill C-68. I find this action irresponsible and now 
wonder if the leader of the Reform Party agrees with the member 
that it is not necessary to respect the law. If not, he should say so.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFERENCETOTHESUPREMECOURT">REFERENCE TO THE SUPREME COURT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has just realized that he is unable to 
<P>
keep the referendum promises he made to Quebecers, and is 
therefore hoping to gain time by seeking the Supreme Court's 
opinion on the question of Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that a reference to the Supreme 
Court will take 12 to 18 months, until after the next federal 
election, and that this will gain him enough time to be able to 
appear before voters without having kept his promises, using the 
excuse that he is waiting on this opinion?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I must say that, in December, the House of 
Commons voted in favour of a distinct society, and I hope that the 
National Assembly will follow suit as rapidly as possible.
<P>
	Here, the government has assumed its responsibilities and voted 
in favour of a distinct society. We also promised that we were not 
going to amend the Constitution without the consent of Quebec. 
Parliament assumed its responsibilities in the month of December, 
and we passed a bill giving a regional veto in Canada, which means 
Quebec has a veto. But the Constitution cannot be amended without 
the approval of the government of Quebec.
<P>
	So, if the Leader of the Opposition wants changes, let him tell 
head office to pass a resolution on distinct society, and accept the 
veto which they are being offered and which the government of 
Quebec is turning down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister can talk about the distinct society 
resolution, but the best proof that this resolution of the House of 
Commons is not worth the paper it is written on is that at no time 
has the government asked the Supreme Court to consider it in the 
opinion it is going to give the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	If the Prime Minister believes in what he is doing, there is still 
time to ask the Supreme Court judges to consider the resolution 
passed in the House of Commons recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society. Let him do it.
<P>
	Will he at least admit that not only will the reference to the 
Supreme Court gain him time, but that also, in his mind, it will 
allow preparations to be made for a possible federal intervention in 
Quebec's next referendum, an intervention that would otherwise be 
viewed as completely unacceptable by Quebecers, and that the 
Prime Minister wants the Supreme Court to pave the way for?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition voted against the distinct 
society resolution. In addition, the bill was passed by the 
Parliament of Canada and challenged by no one. A reference is not 
possible.
<P>
	Furthermore, in the throne speech, we proposed a series of 
adjustments to the federation, including our withdrawal frommany areas. We offered the provinces a new manpower agreement, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4937"> 4937 </A></B>
<P>
which the minister is in the process of negotiating with the 
provinces.
<P>
	We said that we were not going to use our spending authority 
without the consent of five provinces. We spoke about a series of 
things to change the federation. Since February, once again, the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois want to keep the status 
quo, while we are in favour of change in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is absolutely astonishing to hear the Prime Minister say 
that he did not mention the House of Commons resolution before 
the Supreme Court because the Leader of the Opposition voted 
against it. I had no idea I was so powerful. I would remind the 
Prime Minister that this was not a bill, but a resolution of the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	With respect to the Supreme Court's opinion, the government is 
using this reference to create a false sense of security in the rest of 
Canada, telling people not to worry because it will be a powerful 
tool against sovereignty. In Quebec, he says that it will not stand in 
the way of sovereignty, but will merely provide a legal framework.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that his reference to the Supreme 
Court not only gains him time and allows him to pave the way, but 
that it also allows him to change his tune, depending on whether he 
is in Quebec or in the rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I speak in the House of Commons every day. Through the 
House of Commons, I am heard across Canada, both in Quebec and 
in the rest of the country.
<P>
	When the hon. Leader of the Opposition says that this was just a 
resolution, here again he is demonstrating his failure to understand 
the facts. We passed a bill on the right of veto. It is a bill, not a 
resolution. It is a bill and the member voted against a bill giving 
Quebec the right of veto with regard to any changes to the 
Constitution.
<P>
	Speaking about promises, we are in our twelfth day of question 
period and the Leader of the Opposition said in <I>Le Devoir</I> not very 
long ago: ``When we go back, the priority will be on the problems 
our people are experiencing, particularly in Montreal and in 
Quebec. We will be talking about jobs, about the economy. We 
have suggestions to make''. 
<P>
	Because he is unable to attack us on our economic policies, all 
the Leader of the Opposition can talk about is the Constitution.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. In his <I>Le 
Canada et le Québec après le référendum: explications d'une 
quasi-défaite</I>, written  when he was an academic, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs accused the Prime Minister of having 
contributed to the sovereignist cause and of having lacked clarity in 
his promises during the last referendum. To quote him: ``Ironically, 
these promises made in desperation probably did not help the No 
cause. On the contrary, the contradictions within the No camp, and 
the lack of clarity in the promises, probably convinced voters to 
vote Yes.''
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Since the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs stated yesterday 
that he was proud that, since entering politics, he has never had to 
back down from anything he wrote as a university professor, does 
he still maintain that severe judgment of the man who is now his 
leader?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have never blamed the Prime Minister for the 
referendum victory by the No. I have simply said that the promises 
made came too late to have a positive impact on the vote.
<P>
	That is why prompt action is necessary. That is why it is 
important to clarify things rapidly, and not to let the separatist 
camp exploit the confusion, and we are going to clarify a number of 
things.
<P>
	It is, for example, incorrect to say that this federation is 
centralized. It is one of the most decentralized possible. It is 
incorrect to say that Quebecers do not have a share in this 
confederation. This is one of the most generous federations there 
is, and it is wrong to say that this federation cannot change. We 
shall improve it by working with all of our partners who believe in 
Canada. It is wrong to spread a whole pack of falsehoods, as the 
opposition and the independentist movement are constantly doing, 
and we are going to clarify things as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in that 
same book, the minister wrote that the Liberals ought perhaps, and 
again I quote: ``to consider the opinion of the leader of the Reform 
Party by passing a law clarifying the conditions under which a 
province can separate from Canada.''
<P>
	The Minister having stated yesterday in this House that he denies 
absolutely nothing in what he has written, are we to understand that 
his thoughts are the same today, that the government ought to 
follow the plan of the Reform leader, and that consequently he is 
giving his blessing to the holy alliance of Liberals and Reformers 
against Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what Quebecers see is certainly all of the efforts being 
expended to cloud the issue.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4938"> 4938 </A></B>
<P>
	The opposition is well aware that confusion can help it win out,

bring Quebecers and other Canadians to a reconciliation and will 
reinforce the solidarity that joins them, rather than breaking it 
down. They are aware of this, and that is why they fear the 
undertaking we have begun.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the military justice system was brought under a cloud 
because of the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	Last night CBC reported another example of the apparent failure 
of the military justice system under this Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	Commander Dean Marsaw was court martialled and found guilty 
of verbal and physical misconduct. However, transcripts and videos 
of the investigations show the witnesses being badgered, called 
liars and being accused of not co-operating. Before Marsaw can be 
dismissed from the forces the minister must confirm the dismissal.
<P>
	Will the minister show some support for the morale in the forces 
and immediately suspend the dismissal of Commander Marsaw?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the 
hon. member shows his absolute contempt for due process in the 
Canadian justice system.
<P>
	We have a case here of a court martial. I cannot talk about the 
details but the individual concerned has the right to appeal to the 
court martial appeal court. That court is composed of three civilian 
justices, usually of the Federal Court of Canada or the superior 
courts of the provinces.
<P>
	I think the hon. member would serve the cause of justice well if 
he would let the process take its course, allow the individual to 
make up his own mind as to what to do and not to second guess 
once again individual cases on the floor of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, why will this minister not show some competence and 
just do what is right for once?
<P>
	The minister refuses to act on what appears to be a gross 
injustice. Time and time again we keep coming across instances 
where the military justice system goes on a witch hunt. Corporal 
Pernelle is being court martialled for telling the truth to the 
Somalia inquiry. Dean Marsaw has already been found guilty and is 
about to be kicked out of the forces. The whole investigation has 
been called into question.
<P>
	To restore the integrity of the investigation of Commander 
Marsaw, will the minister bring the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police in to conduct an investigation into the botched 
investigation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member admits to coming to certain conclusions based on 
appearances from some television program.
<P>
	The fact is we see clearly once again that Reform Party justice is 
vigilante justice, and that is not Canadian justice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister forgets that he himself this past summer 
suggested that the military justice system needs to be reviewed. 
The military justice system is in shambles under this minister.
<P>
	There are double standards applied. General Boyle got special 
treatment when he was interviewed and he was handled with kid 
gloves. In Commander Marsaw's case witnesses were grilled and 
accused of lying. It appears that Marsaw was railroaded and the 
justice system has failed him.
<P>
	It is time for a complete overhaul of the judge advocate general's 
office. This is the only way to avoid repeats of events like 
Marsaw's case.
<P>
	To restore morale in the Canadian Armed Forces and to 
demonstrate leadership, will the minister commit to an immediate 
overhaul of the justice system in the military?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> The hon. member knows that 
I have said we are reviewing all procedures and practices at 
national defence and one of them will be the military justice 
system. I hope Parliament will take part in that review and I hope 
the hon. member will make some reasoned and informed 
comments instead of the ones that he has been making.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about shambles. The only thing that is in 
shambles is the Reform Party of Canada. Day after day its members 
come here and they castigate people in the military. They reflect 
upon the judicial process, the commission on Somalia. They have 
nothing to say on national unity, nothing on the economy, nothing 
on agriculture, nothing on social justice, nothing on pension

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance said in his budget speech that 
when new and significant savings were realized with respect to 
unemployment insurance, it would be possible to reduce premiums 
even further, and he would make sure that this happened. Well, this 
morning we are told that the minister is seriously considering 
raising the unemployment insurance surplus to $15 billion.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. Why does the 
minister want to accumulate a surplus of $15 billion in the 
unemployment insurance fund instead of reducing premiums, when 
he himself said that a reduction of seven cents would create 40,000 
jobs over two years and that he would be able to reduce this payroll 
tax to a significant extent?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the report to which the hon. member is referring is a report by the 
chief actuary of the Department of Human Resources 
Development, who prepared a study that found that if we want to 
accumulate a surplus in the account, to avoid going through what 
the last government did, we would need a surplus of between ten 
and fifteen billion dollars.
<P>
	That being said, I would like to point out to the hon. member that 
when we came to power, the previous government had intended to 
raise unemployment insurance premiums to $3.30. We froze them 
at $3.07 and then reduced them to $3 and reduced them again last 
year to $2.95. Last year, we reduced premiums by $1.8 billion, 
which saved taxpayers money on unemployment insurance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Liberal government came to power, it 
deliberately increased unemployment insurance premiums. It was 
the first thing it did as far as economic policy was concerned.
<P>
	We are accused of not asking a whole lot of questions about jobs. 
I accuse the government of never having an answer on the subject. 
The Minister of Finance is more concerned about his millionaires 
than about the unemployed.
<P>
	Here is my question, and I expect a reply. Does the minister 
realize that by wanting to accumulate a surplus of $15 billion in the 
unemployment insurance fund and by refusing to reduce premiums 
for employers and employees, he has deliberately ordered a tax of 
$15 billion on employment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
repeat, the report to which the hon. member referred was drafted by 
an actuary, by an expert who said: ``If you want a surplus, it will 
take from ten to fifteen billion dollars''.
<P>
	Now the hon. member is talking about jobs. Since we came to 
power, more than three quarter of a million new jobs were created 
by Canadians. At the beginning of the year, more than 200,000 new 
jobs were created by this government. During the month of August, 
more than 82,000 jobs were created by Canadians. Yesterday, we 
saw that Canada's economic growth is not only very strong but that 
the IMF says that next year, Canada will have the strongest 
economic growth rate of any G7 country. Canadians are doing very 
well, thank you!

Speaker, for many years, the official opposition has been accusing 
the government of favouring the carrier Canadian at the expense of 
Air Canada, which employs 7,000 people in Quebec. We are not the 
only ones to say so. Last week, the international executive officer 
of Cathay Pacific Airlines, the main carrier in Hong Kong, stated: 
``There is a lot of politics behind this decision-I think that Canada 
is trying not to put too much pressure on Canadian International''.

realize that, by favouring Canadian over Air Canada, he is 
contributing to the loss of jobs in Quebec? Why do they keep 
undermining Air Canada and favouring Canadian?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is the one who is somewhat mixed up. 
He forgets that both Canadian International and Air Canada are in 
competition with Cathay Pacific. He quotes a Cathay Pacific 
spokesman who was quite happy to give that information because 
of course he knows full well it serves his interest and not the 
interest of the Canadian airlines.
<P>
	Asking Cathay Pacific what to do with the Canadian airlines on 
the Pacific is bit like asking a crocodile where to go swimming in 
the river. It is not a very bright move.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of jobs, we are not trying to reduce the 
number of flights. Unlike the Bloc Quebecois who think this is a 
zero sum game, what one must gain the other must lose, we are 
trying to expand air traffic.
<P>
	The new air traffic routes that have been established, including 
open skies with the United States, incidentally the world's largest 
international market, have created  1,000 jobs for Air Canada, 700 
for Canadian International and in addition, there is-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. members to please make 
their questions and answers shorter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to ask a crocodile to look after swimmers is like asking a 
friend of Canadian to be Minister of Transport.
<P>
	If the minister will not talk about Cathay Pacific Airlines, let me 
put this question to him. Air Canada itself complained, the 
chamber of commerce complained, all the stakeholders in Quebec 
complained. Did the Minister of Transport hear away out west 
about what was going on in Quebec with Air Canada and about all 
the complaints regarding his actions in the area of air traffic?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has conveniently forgotten that this big 
expansion in air traffic, generated by the government over the last 
three years, directly results in jobs throughout the country, 
particularly in Quebec with Air Canada's head office in Montreal 
and where Bombardier makes the RJ jet, for which there is, I 
believe, some 60 orders outstanding at the present time.
<P>
	The hon. member forgets that our policy of expansion of air 
travel dramatically improves the situation. I have to assure him that 
we want to maintain the policy of choice for the Canadian public. 
In addition, we do not want to give in to the demands of the Bloc 
Quebecois and Air Canada to destroy a system that we have set up 
so carefully over the years and which is so much to the advantage

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is clear to 
anyone who understands the circumstances that Judge Reed's fear 
is a direct result of the justice minister's failure to exercise his 
authority to protect the judicial independence of the courts.

	The minister should have immediately suspended Ted Thompson 
and launched a complaint against his senior official as well as 
Chief Justice Julius Isaac with the Canadian Judicial Council for 
their unprecedented interference into the independence of a sitting

take an hour or two out from spreading fear in order to look at the 
facts of this case. When he does so, he would discover that some 
months ago I appointed the former chief justice of Ontario, the 
Hon. Charles Dubin, a person whose experience and integrity in 
such matters is beyond question, to look into all of the 
circumstances surrounding the incident referred to by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	That report was received and made public in August. It made 
clear that the Department of Justice well understands the 
importance of judicial independence and acts every day on its 
principles.
<P>
	The Hon. Mr. Dubin also made recommendations concerning 
Mr. Thompson and as a result of the report, as the hon. member 
well knows, Ted Thompson voluntarily relinquished the position he 
held.

there was no interference by the Department of Justice with the

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last week, federal officials met with the mayors of the towns in 
Quebec's asbestos-producing region and the main stakeholders in 
this sector. During this meeting, no federal official was able to 
specify what financial support the government could provide to 
fight the French decision.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister waiting for to financially support 
Quebec's strategy to defend the safe use of chrysotile asbestos?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week I made representations to the 
European Union and also to the French government with respect to 
the matter of asbestos. Rather than a total ban, we are suggesting 
that they look at controlled, safe uses of asbestos. There are some 
that are not, but there are some that are. I think the health minister 
and the Department of Health could verify that.
<P>
	We have offered to send experts to France to assist them in the 
use of asbestos that can be done safely. We believe that there are 
some controlled circumstances where it can be used safely. We 
want to help them in that regard to ensure that the industry survives 
in Quebec and continues to provide employment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would have liked an answer from the Prime Minister himself since 
this issue affects 2,000 jobs in my region. Furthermore, it is the 
Prime Minister himself who should be holding talks with the 
French President.
<P>
	Since the World Health Organization recently pointed out the 
risks associated with the use of asbestos, will the government 
finally wake up and take vigorous action to promote within this 
organization the safe use of asbestos, as provided for in Directive 
161 adopted by the WHO in Geneva?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are as concerned about this employment as 
anybody in Quebec is. We want to make sure that these jobs 
remain. We want to make sure that controlled and safe uses of this 
substance continue to be allowed in the countries to which we are 
exporting.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said in the House in the last week or so that 
he was quite willing to make representations, as indeed is my 
colleague, the Minister of Health. All of us are concerned about 
this matter. We are doing our utmost to make sure we maintain that 
industry.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
justice minister had the power to fire Ted Thompson and he refused 
to do it. Is it any wonder that Canadians are fed up with our system, 
the government and the justice minister?
<P>
	Now three alleged war criminals are walking free because the 
justice minister, through his senior lawyer, Ted Thompson, tried to 
make a backroom deal with a Federal Court judge.
<P>
	Today Madam Justice Barbara Reed's letter to the Toronto <I>Star</I> 
clearly has brought the entire Federal Court system into disrepute, 
thereby unduly influencing three deportation cases against alleged 
war criminals now living in Canada.
<P>
	Will the justice minister directly refer these cases against the 
suspected criminals to the Supreme Court of Canada for a decision, 
yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that question is a shocking mixture 
of misunderstanding and misstatement. It is absolutely shocking.
<P>
	We took the trouble to have a person of unquestioned reputation 
look carefully through all the facts of this matter. When the Hon. 
Mr. Dubin reported in August he did not say there were grounds for 
firing Ted Thompson. What did the former chief justice of Ontario 
conclude? Unlike my hon. friend, he took the trouble to look 
through all the facts carefully, speak to the people involved, 
examine the documents and consider them carefully in accordance 
with appropriate principles. He concluded that there was no basis to 
fire Ted Thompson. It was his recommendation that Mr. Thompson 
should  not continue in his present role and Mr. Thompson, as a 
result, resigned voluntarily.
<P>
	The report speaks for itself. It establishes that the Department of 
Justice well understands the principles of judicial independence. 
My friend should educate himself before asking the next question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
is shocking is the fact that this minister cannot even clean up his 
department.
<P>
	War criminals are walking free in Canada today because the 
justice minister refuses to honour the principle that judges and 
courts must be free of interference from politicians and 
bureaucrats. This is not the first time the justice minister has 
crossed the line which separates the courts and politicians.
<P>
	Why does the minister not do the right thing, pack up his bags 
and go home?
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a better idea. I will send my

<P>
	Yesterday, a coalition of 130 organizations asked the Prime

Although the health minister's predecessor promised last 
December that a bill regulating tobacco products would be

immediately table a tobacco bill?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the hon. member for the question. The subject 
matter has received some public attention in the last number of 
weeks.
<P>
	I wish to share with the House that, since we issued the blueprint 
in November 1995, there have been over 2,300 different 
submissions from Canadians from different regions of the country.
<P>
	We are in the process of examining our proposals as they relate 
to the charter to make sure that we are not back in court as we were 
on a previous occasion with the legislation. When we do come 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the minister justify the fact that, while his department is spending 
millions of dollars on an anti-smoking campaign, the Minister of 
Agriculture is subsidizing research on tobacco production in 
Ontario?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that 
the vast majority of funding that is provided by the Department of 
Agriculture with respect to tobacco is related to agronomic matters 
and is highly focused on alternatives to tobacco production so that 
tobacco producers may find ways to diversify away from a 
dependence on this crop.

Politics is tipping the scales of justice.
<P>
	The RCMP, while investigating a Quebec senator and her 
daughter suggested that she be charged with fraud. All Canadians 
are supposed to receive the same treatment, but it appears that 
some are more delicate than others.
<P>
	Why did the justice minister not prosecute the senator for 
defrauding the Government of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> I am standing here wondering if we put them all 
together, do we come up with a sensible question? I do not think 
even then we can do it.
<P>
	In the case to which my hon. friend has referred, we have to 
distinguish between law on the one hand and politics on the other.
<P>
	Let us talk about law for 30 seconds. For law we have a very 
competent prosecutor, a lawyer in the Montreal office, who looked 
at the facts, applied the usual criteria and decided that no 
prosecution should be brought based on legal principles. It was 
taken to his superior who reviewed the same facts and came to the 
same conclusion. That is law. That is the way the system should 
work.
<P>
	Now let us look at politics. That is politics, a man who does not 
know the facts, does not know the law and comes to the floor of this 
House with that outrageous question and tries to make short term 
political hay. That is politics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the sad 
part of all the rhetoric that is coming from that side of the House is 
the fear that Canadians have because these social engineers are not 
in justice. They do not know anything about it.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	This senator, the deputy chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Social Affairs, made a speech on UI. She knows the rules. Why is it 
that the rules apply to every ordinary Canadian whether they are 
ignorant of the law or not, but do not apply to a politician or a 
senator if it was not for social engineering by this minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only thing that is frightening at 
the moment is the hon. member.
<P>
	I think what we should do here is remember that we are talking 
about a legal system which functioned properly in this case; 
responsible people applied the correct criteria and produced the 
appropriate response. All of the huffing, puffing and carrying on is 
not going to change either the legal principles or the facts of the 
case.

according to a briefing note, some $45 million of funds budgeted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4944"> 4944 </A></B>
<P>
for youth programs and still has not established a promised $20 
million program to help youth repay their student loans.
<P>
	When will this Liberal government finally show some leadership 
and come up with a solid strategy to attack youth unemployment in 
this country? How many more young people must be added to the 
unemployment rolls before this government finally takes action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have already advised hon. 
members that the budget that was allocated for youth employment 
had a couple of components to it. One was directed specifically to 
students who are still in academic institutions or returning to them 
in the fall. We did that over the summer, doubling the amount of 
money that was available.
<P>
	With respect to the amount the hon. member is referring to, the 
$45 million, when this money was allocated in the spring we were 
aware that a lot of young people in this country are not in academic 
institutions. They require a different kind of assistance in order to 
find jobs in a very difficult environment.
<P>
	We understand the member's commitment to youth 
employment. I hope he will understand that we wanted to make 
sure we were doing the right thing for those students who do not fit 
into the traditional strategies of the past where we were simply 
looking at them during the summer.

period. I did not say what the member alleged.
<P>
	In point of fact, it was the opposite. I did not tell anyone to break 
the law. I clearly said that Bill C-68 should be repealed so that 
people do not have to pay for or comply with useless legislation. 
When asked directly, I did not dodge the question but said that I 
will obey the law. We must work hard to repeal Bill C-68-

to his question is no, there is not a question of privilege. Then 
again, being the frail human that I am, please, as I have done in the 
past, seek the good counsel of our table officers. They are all here 
at our service.

	The House resumed from September 24 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to amend the Prisons and 
Reformatories Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot say that I am particularly pleased to rise today to 
speak to Bill C-53. In fact, I am quite astounded that such a bill has 
made it this far in the House of Commons.
<P>
	On the one, hand members are debating bills which concern 
tougher sentencing, stricter parole legislation and capital 
punishment for criminals because that is what Canadians are 
demanding. On the other hand, the Liberals have brought forward 
this proposal out of left field which makes it easier for prisoners to 
get out of jail on temporary absences.
<P>
	The weaknesses of the justice system in our country are 
becoming more and more evident to the majority of Canadians and 
quite frankly they want something done about it. Seventy per cent 
of Canadians want first degree, cold blooded murderers sentenced 
to death. They do not want killers or any criminal let out on parole 
before completing their sentences and they certainly do not want it 
made easier for a criminal to get a temporary absence or a longer 
temporary absence from prison.
<P>
	I will guarantee that if members asked most Canadians they 
would tell them that they do not think convicted criminals need to 
spend more of their sentences outside jail walls. They would 
simply ask what for. That is what I want to know. What for?
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general attempted to 
answer this in the House last week. He claims this bill will allow 
provincial prisoners leave for a specified period of time with or 
without an escort for medical, humanitarian or rehabilitative 
purposes, all in an effort to help offenders reintegrate into the 
community.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	He continues his justification of Bill C-53 by telling us we have 
nothing to be concerned with. After all, these are not hardened 
criminals but only the ones who are serving sentences of less than 
two years.
<P>
	I would like to know if the hon. parliamentary secretary has ever 
heard of deterrence or even justice. Does he realize that many of 
those convicted of sexual assault receive such ridiculously short 
sentences? Are their victims going to be reassured when the hon. 
member tells them they have nothing to worry about,  that their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4947"> 4947 </A></B>
<P>
attackers are not a threat and deserve a helping hand in rejoining 
those very same victims in the community? Is concern for the 
convicted felon's reintegration supposed to comfort the victim 
when she bumps into him in the neighbourhood grocery store?
<P>
	The length of the sentence or even the offence is irrelevant in this 
case. The truth of the matter is the Liberals are showing their 
blatant disregard for the courts by encouraging legislation that 
circumvents the decisions of judges and juries.
<P>
	As we are aware, they are particularly attached to section 745 of 
the Criminal Code which allows murderers the opportunity to have 
their sentences reviewed after serving only 15 years. The Liberals 
have steadfastly refused to listen to Canadians who are demanding 
the repeal of section 745. So I suppose it only follows that the 
Liberals would be fond of having more criminals out on more 
temporary absences.
<P>
	Why listen to the judges or juries that understand the 
circumstances behind a conviction and have chosen to send these 
criminals to jail for a specified period of time? There are many 
reasons why I believe the Liberals introduced this legislation. And 
while the reasons are valid, I submit the solution is not.
<P>
	Like most every breathing individual in this country, the Liberals 
actually do recognize that there is a crisis in our justice system. 
They are being told by citizens and organizations across the 
country that violent crime is increasing, that people do not feel safe 
on the street or in their homes. They also know that Canadians want 
longer and more strict sentences for criminals. We all know this.
<P>
	So why is this government introducing such ludicrous legislation 
contrary to all of the concerns I have just mentioned? Is it because 
it is also aware that there is severe overcrowding and financial 
constraints in prison systems across the country? Do the Liberals 
imagine they should make space available by letting criminals go 
free?
<P>
	Of course this logic directly opposes the reduction of 
overcrowding in the prison system. What would really reduce the 
number of criminals sitting in jails at the taxpayer expense is 
deterrence. Deterrence is what the justice system is based on.
<P>
	I am not saying that rehabilitation should be discounted but it 
should not be the focal point of all our correctional programs. 
There is a direct correlation between prison overcrowding and the 
leniency of parole and temporary absence programs.
<P>
	How is it that prisons are straining their capacities when 
according to Statistics Canada 80 per cent of the 154,000 people 
under the care of the correctional system were out on some form of 
community supervision in 1994? There was also a 40 per cent 
increase in the number of people out on probation between 1990 
and 1994.
<P>
	These two opposing trends, overcrowding and a greater number 
of parolees, are rather ironic indeed but make perfect sense unless 
you are a Liberal who believes that pampering prisoners will bring 
an end to crime. Their idea of rehabilitation is to provide those 
inside with all the amenities those on the outside have to work for.
<P>
	The point is a prime reason why people commit crimes is there is 
no element of deterrence left in our justice system. When someone 
in our society does something wrong they must pay the price, and 
in this case that means prison time. What sort of deterrence is 
reinforced through increased temporary absences or early parole?
<P>
	It is unfortunate for the Liberals but fortunate for Canadians that 
the Reform Party can offer better solutions to remedy our justice 
system than lenient parole and absences.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	I note in <I>Hansard</I> of September 23 that the member for Kingston 
and the Islands spoke on sentencing reform. He said: ``The jail term 
is what the public looks at as the measure of punishment. I suggest 
that we have to change that. I invite hon. members opposite to think 
of changing it and look at alternative measures''.
<P>
	Reformers have suggested alternatives to the present justice 
system for three long years. It is just that members on the other side 
seem to be deaf not only to Reformers' alternatives but the wishes 
of Canadians as well.
<P>
	We now know that the Liberal alternative of indulging and 
rehabilitating criminals is only resulting in more crime and 
overcrowded prisons. It has been estimated that the total cost of 
criminal acts to Canadian society is $46 billion a year. It costs 
around $10 billion just for law enforcement, prisons and courts. 
The cost of legal aid has been skyrocketing. There has to be a better 
way.
<P>
	I believe we need to focus on two separate issues: prevention, 
and deterrence. Prevention must begin at home early in life. 
Preschoolers must be taught right from wrong. Society must do 
everything possible to provide the best possible environment for 
youngsters but there must be respect for the consequences of 
wrongdoing as well.
<P>
	Reformers believe that individuals as well as governments must 
be held accountable and responsible for their actions. As an 
alternative, how about reinstating capital punishment as an 
alternative to life imprisonment? For the record let me be very 
clear about this. I am speaking about the death penalty for first 
degree, premeditated, cold-blooded murder. I am speaking about 
appropriate punishment for the likes of Clifford Olson, Paul 
Bernardo and Karla Homolka.
<P>
	As an alternative, how about that four letter word ``work''? I do 
not mean whenever the convict feels like it, I mean a mandatory 
requirement. A big part of the problem we have in society today-I 
stress that some  believe they do not have to work-is this new age 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4948"> 4948 </A></B>
<P>
philosophy which seems to be reinforced even in our nation's jails. 
In our parents and grandparents' times the work ethic was simple, 
work or starve.
<P>
	Prisoners should be required to work a minimum number of 
hours per week. If they are sick they should have to make up their 
hours later. If they are unfit, work should be found for them 
commensurable with their capabilities, but they should work.
<P>
	As an alternative, why not bush camps? You will note I did not 
specify boot camps, Mr. Speaker. However, once again I am 
speaking of a structured, highly disciplined work environment. I 
believe this is particularly appropriate in the case of young 
offenders. Last weekend when I was home and attending a meeting 
in my riding an elderly gentleman made a suggestion to me about 
how we can help the young people to become more disciplined. He 
was suggesting mandatory military service. I have heard this many 
times from a number of people and I am sure other colleagues in 
this House have heard this as well.
<P>
	Canadians and Reformers have been suggesting alternatives to 
the present system whereas the Liberals want to pamper those who 
break our laws, call them rehabilitated, then parole them only to 
see them reoffend. This kid glove approach is not what Canadians 
are demanding. Canadians want to see criminals held responsible. 
They want punishment that fits the severity of the crime. They want 
consequences for criminal acts that provide real deterrents.
<P>
	Sitting out the coldest winter months in idleness in a warm 
environment with all amenities provided at taxpayer expense is no 
deterrent. An example fresh in my mind was visiting the new 
provincial correctional facility in Prince George. It is quite a nice 
facility with all the amenities for a convict's use.
<P>
	We are looking at another example of piecemeal legislation by 
the Liberals. What is driving their confused and disjointed actions? 
I submit that first and foremost the Liberals are thinking about the 
next election. It is fast approaching and they have been sitting 
around doing nothing except celebrating their good fortune for the 
past three years.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians have begun to ask what the government has done to 
improve the economy, our society, our justice system. Suddenly the 
Liberals are scurrying to pass quick fix legislation so they can tell 
Canadians that they did do something. They are hitting all the hot 
buttons concerning homosexual rights, crime and child support. 
The issue of child support was debated just this morning.
<P>
	In another example of piecemeal legislation, the Liberals 
propose getting tough in enforcing child support payments without 
understanding the issue. The entire system of child custody laws 
and the Divorce Act must be  reviewed and corrected by legislation 
but the Liberals are going for the shallow, quick fix approach that 
they think will be enough to appease the voters in the next election.
<P>
	The proposed legislation we are debating right now is another 
example. The disarray and inefficiencies in our justice system, in 
conjunction with rising crime, is now and will be a major issue for 
Canadians during the next election campaign.
<P>
	The Liberals will go to the voters rhyming off their justice 
legislation such as Bill C-53 and Bill C-45. They do not care if this 
legislation completely ignores the changes that Canadians want. 
What is important to the Liberal campaign strategy is that they can 
say they did something, no matter how irrelevant and destructive or 
how vaguely related to crime and justice.
<P>
	It is not good enough for the Reform Party and it is certainly not 
good enough for Canadians. They expect and they deserve better. 
This country needs fundamental changes to its justice system to 
help people feel safer, to recognize the rights of victims and to state 
loud and clear that criminal activity is not acceptable in our society.
<P>
	I can assure members that Bill C-53 will not do that. It will do 
the exact opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to advise the Chair that I will be splitting my 
time with the hon. member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	Before I give my comments on the legislative initiatives 
proposed in this bill, I want to make clear to my constituents that 
the Prisons and Reformatories Act only applies to persons 
sentenced for a federal offence and are being held in a provincial 
correctional facility. This would mean any convict sentenced to 
less than two years.
<P>
	On the surface, the measures proposed in Bill C-53 seem to 
make sense. Apparently the new provisions have been requested by 
the provinces and territories. I have not had a chance to check with 
any of the provincial ministers about the measures the federal 
government has proposed, however I trust that the Standing 
Committee on Justice will do this during the clause by clause 
review of the bill. I hope the Liberals will allow the committee to 
do its job. Its previous record is not very good.
<P>
	As I worked my way through the bill, I noted some obvious 
omissions. I do not know whether these were by design or by 
bureaucratic oversight. Before I could give my wholehearted 
support for Bill C-53, a number of amendments would have to be 
made.
<P>
	Let me explain. Clause 2 of the bill, which amends section 7 of 
the act, states that the purpose of the temporary absence programs 
would be to contribute to the maintenance of a just and peaceful 
and safe society by facilitating the rehabilitation of offenders and 
their reintegration into the community as law-abiding citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4949"> 4949 </A></B>
<P>
	If I had been given the job of writing this bill, the stated purpose 
of temporary absence programs would go something like this. To 
reward convicts who have served the majority of their sentences 
in an exemplary fashion, to demonstrate to other prisoners the 
value of good behaviour and the fairness of the merit release 
process, to permit offenders to participate in work programs or 
get a job in order to make restitution to their victims, to 
compensate the state for the costs of their incarceration and, 
ultimately, to deter them from committing crimes in the future.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	It is refreshing, I will admit, to see a government bill that started 
out by including a statement of principles. This is the first thing I 
look for because if the government does not get the principles right, 
then the resulting legislative measures will never be right.
<P>
	The first thing I noticed was the absence, and hopefully it is just 
a temporary absence, of the most important principle, namely that 
the protection of society is to be of paramount consideration in the 
determination of any case. Why was that paramount principle 
omitted? The government included such a principle in the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act. Why is it missing from 
the Prison and Reformatories Act?
<P>
	Even the legislative summary prepared by the law and 
government division of the research branch of the Library of 
Parliament states: ``This bill seems to give less importance to the 
protection of society than does the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act''. That is a serious deficiency.
<P>
	I have dealt with the most important missing principle. I would 
like to note some other deficiencies in the other principles in Bill 
C-53. As it is currently worded, the second principle states that: 
``All available information relevant to the case be taken into 
account''. Here is the key question. What does the government 
mean by all available information? Does it include victim impact 
statements? Does it give victims the right to be heard at any review 
to consider release of an inmate under the temporary absence 
program? If it does not, it should.
<P>
	I also recommend that the bill include a definition of the term all 
available information and a list of the types of information that 
should be taken into account by the designated authority during any 
review process.
<P>
	The third principle states that prisoners be provided with 
relevant information, reasons for decisions and access to the review 
of decisions. Does this mean that only prisoners are to be provided 
with relevant information? If the Liberal government is as 
concerned about the victims' rights as it says it is, then why are 
they not included in this principle?
<P>
	I know that the fourth principle says that the designated authority 
may provide for the timely exchange of relevant information with 
other participants in the criminal justice system and make general 
information about temporary absence programs and policies 
available to prisoners, victims and the public.
<P>
	However, I am sure even Liberals will agree that the victims' 
rights are at least as important as the right of prisoners. If so, then 
the third principle must be amended to read, and I quote what 
should be in there: ``That prisoners and their victims be provided 
with relevant information, reasons for decisions and access to the 
review of decisions''. Unless that is included I cannot support the 
bill.
<P>
	I also have some concerns about the new power being given in 
this bill to the provinces, that is, the power to appoint any person or 
any organization as a designated authority. If Bill C-53 is passed 
into law, then any person or any organization so designated by the 
province would be responsible for authorizing temporary absences 
for prisoners in that province.
<P>
	In the current legislation the province has the power to appoint 
an officer to make decisions regarding temporary absences. At 
least an officer paid by the government can be held accountable. 
How can the government hold any person or any organization 
accountable? That is a key question.
<P>
	Citizens are already concerned about the lack of accountability 
in the corrections system. Citizens are attacked, injured, robbed, 
maimed, murdered by convicts out on temporary release and no 
one is to blame. The new victim is not even allowed to sue the 
government for its mistake. This a concern for me as well, not just 
my constituents.
<P>
	I recommend that the wording of the current act be retained. At 
least if the designated authority is an officer, then some form of 
direct accountability can be guaranteed. If the designated authority 
is a sentencing circle or some do gooder or some prisoners rights 
society, then how will accountability be guaranteed by the 
government? Canadians are asking for more accountability, not 
less. This bill is moving in the wrong direction. This is a serious 
flaw.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The next section deals with the reasons for the so-called 
designated authority to authorize a temporary absence. The reasons 
do not list the most important reason for a temporary absence. That 
should be, and I hope that this quotation will go into the bill, to 
participate in work programs, to make restitution to their victims 
and to compensate the state for the cost of their incarceration and 
ultimately to deter them from committing other crimes in the 
future. That is common sense. That ought to be in there. It is a 
serious flaw that it is not included.
<P>
	Finally, there should be a section in this bill which deals 
specifically with the accountability and liability of the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4950"> 4950 </A></B>
<P>
and the designated authority if a convict  they let out on temporary 
absence commits another crime.
<P>
	I do not need to remind members on this side of the House, but 
maybe the Liberal members on the other side need a little reminder. 
Daniel Gingras was on a temporary escorted absence to the West 
Edmonton Mall when he escaped, subsequently killing and raping 
several citizens.
<P>
	I understand that dangerous criminals like Gingras should not be 
held in provincial institutions. In this job I have come to realize 
that a lot of things happen that just do not make sense. Therefore I 
think it is absolutely essential that victim rights come before 
prisoner rights and that the protection of society come before the 
rights of a prisoner to temporary release.
<P>
	There is only one way I know to put these principles first, give 
Canadians the right to sue the government for its mistakes. If given 
this right to sue the government for injuries and damages caused by 
its mistakes I guarantee there would be a lot fewer mistakes.
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill looks good on the surface but we need to 
go beyond impression and make sure we get it all right. It must 
promote responsibility and accountability. It must give victims 
more rights than criminals.
<P>
	The Liberals always say they listen and they want constructive 
suggestions. I hope they are listening and will take these 
constructive suggestions into account. I hope the proper 
amendments will be made so that I can support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to indicate how pleased I am to speak to Bill C-53. The 
protection of criminals obviously seems to be very important to 
this government. It seems like every time we pick up a bill that is 
presented to this House there is something in there regarding what 
can we do for the prisoners, what can we do for the convicts, what 
can we do for the criminals.
<P>
	As we search through the document it just gives a person a clear 
reason why it is difficult to support these bills. It places the 
rehabilitation and the reintegration of criminals way ahead of the 
protection of society; in bill after bill.
<P>
	The Liberal government under this social engineer we call the 
justice minister might be able to convince some people that it is 
doing a wonderful job. When we look at the things that have been 
put in place we see actually what is happening. Maybe the people 
across the way can explain to me why we have criminals, rapists 
and all other types of criminals being bailed out, being released on 
passes, who are given alternative measures to crime.
<P>
	However, we have a hard working farmer who raises a crop, who 
tries to sell it to get as much money as he can. He breaks the law. 
He sold his own produce against the  law. We are going to lock him 
up and boy, we do not talk about release there or bail or anything. 
That violent grain producer is not going to get a temporary pass or a 
leave of absence. That is the Liberal mentality.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	However, on the same day this farmer was sentenced in court, 
there was fellow who went to a farm and burned up tractors and a 
couple of trucks, stole a truck, beat some dogs to death and 
ravished the farm house and, guess what, he is going to receive an 
alternative measure. He is not going to have to go to jail.
<P>
	We keep picking these things up. This reminds me of Mr. 
Gingras from Edmonton. He had a birthday. It was felt that 
something should be done for him to get him out of prison because 
he had been a pretty good boy. Two more people are dead because 
of the Liberal philosophy and the Liberal way of doing things. 
However, those things happen and nobody has to be accountable.
<P>
	When they come up with a bill like this that is going to provide 
different things, why do they not write some accountability into it? 
Why do they not take the time to say that this is what they are going 
to do and if they fail or make a miscue or if they err, they as the 
government will hold themselves accountable to the people of 
Canada? If they do not repeal section 745 maybe they should make 
a new law which says they will be responsible if they release a 
killer in 15 years and he kills someone. The Liberals will not dare 
do that. They do not want to put their necks in any noose. But they 
do not mind jeopardizing the safety of all Canadians by making 
decisions that make absolutely no sense.
<P>
	Right in my own community today a rapist who was charged on 
three counts was picked up by breakfast and bailed out by noon. Yet 
we have a grain farmer who sold his crop and received more money 
than what the wheat board could have got for him and we are going 
to lock him up and sock it to him and he will not get any bail. This 
is Liberal philosophy, a lot of bunk. Social engineering.
<P>
	This justice minister ought to be back on Bay Street where he 
belongs. That is what he knows best. He does not know anything 
about law and order and the protection of people.
<P>
	All we ask for when legislation comes down, all any of us want 
and all any Canadian would like to see is a little focus on the 
victims of crime. Every time we pick up legislation, and Bill C-53 
is no different, it just is not there.
<P>
	The Liberals put legislation out and ask us to support it because 
if we do not we are not much help to anyone. They tell us they are 
trying to accomplish something here. They have to get these guys 
out of jail and get them back on the street. They say we have to 
rehabilitate them if we are going to do anything about crime, 
regardless of  the fact that crime has increased drastically in the last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4951"> 4951 </A></B>
<P>
15 years. It is mostly because of Liberal feel good, fuzzy 
philosophy that is not working.
<P>
	The Liberals do not have brains enough or will not open their 
eyes to understand that it is not working. They do not understand 
why we have thousands of Canadians across Canada who are in 
groups like Victims of Violence, CAVEAT, CRY, all kinds of 
victims across the country organizing. Do members know why they 
organize? Because this government is failing the people of Canada. 
They have to organize to try to wake up these guys on that side of 
the House to say it is not working.
<P>
	Let us talk about the good old gun control legislation, the one 
that is specifically designed to go after the law-abiding person. 
They are also going after the law-abiding person. They say ``we are 
going to do something about smuggling''. Yes, I guess we did. 
Look what we have done about smugglers. We caught a grain 
farmer selling grain across the line as the boats with drugs, 
refugees, guns and all the other crap they are smuggling into this 
country just go and go and nothing is being done.
<P>
	I am sorry, but when we pick Bill C-53, like all the other bills I 
have seen, this fuzzy, feel good attitude is not cutting it with the 
Canadian people. One of these days they are going to wake up. 
When they go to the polls, maybe people like the justice minister, 
this social engineer, will realize they have made a mistake and do 
not care enough about the Canadian people. I would vote against 
this right now if I had the chance simply because it ignores the 
victims of crime. It is time to quit ignoring them.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	In his diatribe he mentioned that every piece of legislation put 
forward by this government protected the rights of anybody except 
that of society, or words to that effect. I do have a question with a 
number of parts that I would like to ask him.
<P>
	I would like to know how these things protect criminals and 
ignore society. How can increased sentences for young offenders 
who commit violent crimes help criminals and not society? How 
can a new mandatory five year sentence for those convicted of 
using violence to force children into prostitution be helping 
criminals and not helping society?
<P>
	How is the classification of first degree murder to any murder 
committed while stalking helping criminals and is not helping 
society? How is increased sentences helping criminals and not 
helping society? How is the fact that we have provided the basis 
upon which police can serve warrants on suspects to take samples 
of DNA helping criminals and not helping society? I would like to 
know how our outlawing of the so-called drunken defence is 
helping criminals and not helping society.
<P>
	The government's agenda, the government's record on criminal 
issues is one of protection for Canadian society, one of recognizing 
the need to protect the rights of victims. We have done a good job 
on the criminal justice system in this country and the member 
opposite is absolutely wrong in suggesting that our legislation 
helps only criminals, not society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I call it tinkering. I call it tinker, 
tinker, tinker. That is what you do with your laws.
<P>
	The member is saying the government has done this and that, yet 
is it going to kill section 745 as the Canadian people want? No, it is 
not. It is still going to let killers out in 15 years. Is that looking after 
the interests of society? I think not.
<P>
	There is bail set for violent offenders right on the same day as 
they are arrested. It is possible through this government. Is that 
protecting society? Oh, there are a few little tinker spots the 
Liberals have put in the Young Offenders Act. Mr. Tinkerbell, the 
social minister, whom we call the justice minister, has fixed a little 
spot here and a little spot there. It sort of reminds me of when my 
mother used to put a little sugar into medicine so I could drink it.
<P>
	There is not enough sugar in this to even look at it. The member 
across the way failed to address this particular bill. I will try to get

thousands of Canadians who are joining organizations to fight the

job. They are called victims. The hon. member ought to hear them, 
to meet a few and maybe they will wake up over there. Once they 
do wake up maybe they will listen to what the Canadian people 
want instead of this warm and fuzzy Liberal baloney.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-41, 
an act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and 
Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment, 
Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
resume debate on Bill C-41, I will explain a bit about the bill. It is 
an act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and 
Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment, 
Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping 
Act.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-41 is first, to establish federal guidelines 
for child support; second, to open Revenue Canada databases to 
searches in cases of payment default; third, to deny passports and 
certain licences to individuals whose support payments are in 
persistent arrears; fourth, to provide for the garnishment and 
attachment of federal public service pensions and wages of 
individuals working at sea.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in today's world, between 40 and 50 per cent of 
marriages end in divorce. Even more unfortunate is the fact that 
when a divorce occurs, children are often the last to be considered.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that our courts and our laws use the phrase in 
the best interests of the child, all too often the outcome is actually 
what is in the best interests of the custodial parent. We need to 
change this situation to ensure that the outcome ends up being what 
is in the best interest of the child.
<P>
	Many non-custodial parents either do not pay their child support 
payments or are in arrears. Since non-payment of support hurts the 
children and the families, this situation must be remedied by some 
type of penalty for the offender. Bill C-41 addresses this situation. 
The non-payment of fair child support should not be tolerated.
<P>
	Last year the Reform caucus called for nationwide guidelines 
and for increased enforcement of maintenance orders. This bill 
addresses these two issues. However, like many other pieces of 
legislation introduced by the government, Bill C-41 only goes part 
way. The bill represents a piecemeal approach to amending the 
Divorce Act. Once more the Liberals have given Canadians only 
part of the loaf, not the whole loaf.
<P>
	While the Liberal government has continually stressed the need 
for comprehensive family law reform, the bill once again only 
deals with one small part of this large problem. Canadians need a 
comprehensive approach which benefits the children of divorce.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly about what I believe a 
comprehensive approach to amending the Divorce Act would 
include. First, it would include compulsory mediation as a first step 
in the divorce process rather than going straight to the courts.
<P>
	In a court battle, parents through their lawyers and often 
encouraged by their lawyers so often attack each other in 
adversarial combat over who gets the property and who gets the 
children. Eventually, neither parent wins the battle. Inevitably the 
lawyers are the only winners in these cases. In too many cases the 
children are the big losers. Mediation would lessen the bitterness of 
divorce as both sides attempt to compromise. Most parents truly 
want to do what is best for the children but emotions get in the way 
in adversarial combat such as we see through the court system.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	With mediation, parents are encouraged to put bitterness aside to 
do what is in their children's best interest. The result is often a less 
hostile relationship between the parents. A good relationship 
between the parents is essential since children exist through and 
thrive on the relationship that exists between their father and their 
mother. Even after divorce, the well-being of a child is directly 
related to the continued shared responsibility of the two parents for 
their child.
<P>
	This morning, some members opposite said that having two 
parents is idyllic. I am not talking about an ideal situation. I am 
talking about the best possible situation under a very difficult 
divorce procedure.
<P>
	The second element that I believe should be included in 
comprehensive reform is the access of grandparents to 
grandchildren. Children need to know that they are loved by both 
sets of grandparents, regardless of the divorce.
<P>
	One of my constituents sent me a copy of her letter to the 
Minister of Justice in which she stated: ``I am a victim of your 
indifference to the rights of grandparents. Your rock solid image 
has been eroded by your unwillingness to uphold the very 
principles you pretend to stand for. You have shot down the 
inherent rights of innocent children to have and to know their 
immediate families. You have disregarded the voices of countless 
grandparents who have personally experienced the pain caused by 
the flaws in our present justice system''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4953"> 4953 </A></B>
<P>
	That is from a constituent to whom I talked on several occasions 
and who, unfortunately, I could not assure that there would be 
something done in this place that would improve her situation.
<P>
	What is said by the experts in this area? I quote Jim Gladstone, 
an associate professor of social work at McMaster University who 
has studied the relationship between grandmothers and 
grandchildren after divorce. He said: ``A grandparent can offer a 
grandchild sanctuary from divorce materially and emotionally. The 
grandparent's role is especially important considering the child's 
parent is likely preoccupied with his or her own healing''.
<P>
	Not only my constituent but the so-called experts in this area 
stress the importance of grandparents having access to their 
grandchildren. Common sense also says that. Children whose 
parents are divorced are no less deserving of maintaining family 
ties. In fact, during these difficult times, children need even more 
to have these ties maintained.
<P>
	A third factor to be considered in a comprehensive approach to 
amending the Divorce Act would also include access provisions 
that are enforceable. In talking about enforcing access, I would like 
to speak about a situation that happened to me over the last year 
and a half or so. It happened without one knowing what the other 
was doing. I had both the mother and the father in a divorce case 
come to me with their grievances which were quite different.
<P>
	First the mother came. She was the custodial parent. Her concern 
was that she was having an extremely difficult time in paying what 
was necessary to raise her children. Part of the reason was that the 
non-custodial parent, the father, was not making child support 
payments. As I listened to her, I could see the difficulty, the stress 
that she was under. I could see also the less than friendly way that 
she talked about the non-custodial parent and the fact that he was 
not paying support. My heart went out to her. She was in a very 
difficult situation and in fact it was very difficult even for me to 
hear what was happening. I could not understand how the 
non-custodial parent, the father, would withhold child support 
payments.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Then it happened. I do not believe the father had any idea that the 
mother had been to see me. Some time later the father came to me 
with his concerns. He was torn apart because he had been denied 
access to his children even though the court had granted access. 
The mother, the custodial parent, had denied access even though 
the court had said that it was a requirement of the divorce 
settlement. I heard the other side. This father, who so desperately 
wanted to be in touch with his children, had withheld support 
payments because he so desperately wanted the access that he was 
being denied.
<P>
	It is clear that the government, dealing with legislation on child 
support, should not only look at one part of this issue. It is critical 
that it also consider the issue of access. It has been completely 
ignored in this legislation. Once again, it is piecemeal legislation 
when comprehensive legislation is needed. That really makes this 
legislation of very little value.
<P>
	The issue of access by the non-custodial parent is crucial, as the 
example which I used pointed out. As I said before, children exist 
through and thrive on the relationship that exists between a father 
and a mother. I would like to add that children also thrive on the 
relationship that they have with each parent individually. These 
relationships need to be continually strengthened as the child grows 
and matures. This is every bit as important in a situation where the 
parents are separated by divorce and where both parents do not 
have continual access to the children.
<P>
	The relationship between the children and both parents is the 
fundamental building block of our society. It is how values and 
culture are protected and transferred from one generation to the 
next. The maintenance of these ties is crucial not only to the child's 
development but to the social stability of our society. It is that 
fundamental.
<P>
	Family ties have a profound impact on our economy, culture and 
social structure. I do not think we can overstate the importance of 
these family ties.
<P>
	It is therefore just as important that children whose parents are 
divorced continue to have access to both parents unless the courts 
have determined that there is some substantial particular reason 
that one or both parents should be denied access.
<P>
	Unfortunately Bill C-41 does not deal with the problem of the 
lack of fairness in enforcing maintenance orders. I am getting back 
to maintenance orders and away from access. One of the major 
flaws with the bill is that Bill C-41 does not deal with the problem 
of the lack of fairness in enforcing maintenance orders.
<P>
	On April 5, 1995 the Reform caucus approved an issue statement 
on child support, payment and taxation. It called for nationwide 
guidelines and for increased enforcement of maintenance orders. 
As I previously mentioned, this bill provides for both these points 
to some extent. However, the Reform Party stressed that provisions 
must be fair. The child support issue is not simply a woman's issue. 
It is a family issue.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	While Bill C-41 imposes and enforces support obligations on 
non-custodial parents, it does nothing to ensure that custodial 
parents meet their obligations for example on visitation rights. That 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	Many non-custodial parents who do not make payments refuse to 
do so because they are denied access  to their children. It is not 
uncommon. This denial of access produces anger and weakens the 
ties between the non-custodial parents and their children. I know 
that with improved access many more non-custodial parents would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4954"> 4954 </A></B>
<P>
meet their obligations in full. This in fact has been verified by 
people with considerable experience in tracking down 
non-custodial parents for non-payment of child support. My 
colleague, the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam, this morning 
documented that very well. It is clear that most parents do want to 
do what is best for their children.
<P>
	Besides these issues, there are other issues which were ignored 
by the legislation which I will not go into in detail.
<P>
	The process of putting the legislation in place through order in 
council is typical of the government. It happens all the time. It is a 
non-democratic process which I have spoken of before so I will not 
get into it at length now.
<P>
	Another concern about the legislation is that it could invade the 
privacy of the non-custodial parent. The bill makes data banks at 
Revenue Canada available to be searched for information regarding 
addresses and possible payment sources but does not provide 
protection for other information in Revenue Canada files. That is a 
concern under the present system and it will be even more of a 
concern when this legislation passes.
<P>
	There is the issue of revoking passports. Bill C-41 contains 
clauses which allow for the revocation of a passport of a person 
who is in default in their child support payments. The revocation 
places such a person in jeopardy if he or she must travel outside 
Canada with their employment. How can a person earn money and 
meet child support payments if they are being denied access to their 
place of employment?
<P>
	A constituent of mine spoke of the problems which he had and 
how much more serious the problems would be because of this bill. 
He went to work outside the country. He could not get a job in 
Canada and could not afford to make the payments but he could 
with the job outside Canada. He was concerned that the legislation 
would completely cut off child support payments.
<P>
	By opposing the bill, the Reform Party is not supporting people 
who do not pay child support. Clearly that is not our intent. The 
problem is that Bill C-41 lacks meaningful substance and in 
particular it lacks fairness.
<P>
	What Canadians need is a comprehensive approach which 
focuses on change which benefits the children of divorce. By 
opposing the bill the Reform Party is attempting to force the 
government to adopt a comprehensive reform of the Divorce Act so 
that matters such as compulsory arbitration and access are also 
included. With respect to child support, as in all government 
decisions, Reform believes that the well-being of the family should 
be the top priority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to take the opportunity to speak on Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement 
Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension 
Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act, at second reading.
<P>
	Throughout most of the debate today the commentary has been 
more on family values than it has been on the substance of the bill. 
The last speaker raised some interesting points about the bill, about 
whether or not it goes far enough in certain aspects. There are 
aspects such as the garnishee without notice, the ability to open up 
the support arrangements and of course the grid for the 
determination of support payments. The member spoke about the 
issues of fairness and the need for change in the Divorce Act.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	In listening to the debate I was saddened that so many members 
talked about the demise and breakdown of the traditional Canadian 
family. They tended to talk casually and lightly about the situation 
of divorce and family breakdown and how prevalent common law 
relationships were. There was very little support in this place for 
the traditional Canadian family. I was a little concerned that maybe 
Canadians were wondering if there was anybody in this place who 
was speaking on behalf of the family. I want to make a few 
comments about the family.
<P>
	When I first came to the House of Commons and joined the 
Standing Committee on Health, one of the reports we received was 
on the strategy of our health care system. One of the most 
significant statements that was made in that report from Health 
Canada was that we spend approximately 75 per cent of our health 
budget on curative measures for problems and only 25 per cent on 
prevention. The issue of prevention versus dealing with the 
problem after it occurs is applicable in the case of this bill and 
many other items that come before the House.
<P>
	I can recall giving a speech in this place on Bill C-10, the 
borrowing authority legislation. It was just after the Thibaudeau 
decision had come down. There was a lot of talk at the time about 
the family and about issues relating to family breakdown. That was 
the first time I rose in the House to give a speech without notes. I 
know many members have experienced the hesitation to speak 
from their hearts on what they believe. We have prepared texts and 
members will stand in their places and sometimes read canned 
speeches. I think that night I spoke because I really believed in 
something and in my own heart and mind I knew what I was talking 
about. I can remember a particular quote from that speech. It was 
that if the family were strong, the deficit would be gone. It is a little 
bit of a cliche.
<P>
	Having heard all of the debate from time to time in the House 
about the family, there is no question in my mind that there is 
something terribly, terribly wrong taking  place in our society. The 
respect for the family continues to erode. The respect for families 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4955"> 4955 </A></B>
<P>
who choose to provide care for their children in the home is no 
longer there. When we talk about bills like this one dealing with 
divorce and enforcement of support orders and access orders, it is 
about things that we can do to take care of something that has gone 
terribly wrong.
<P>
	This morning a member rose to say that according to Statistics 
Canada anywhere from 3 to 3.9 marriages out of 10 end in divorce. 
That is 30 to 39 per cent of family breakdowns end up in divorce. 
The member also went on to say that maybe it should be 50 per cent 
because of what she sees in the family. It really got to me and 
saddened me that there was someone in this place who actually 
thought there should be more divorce to take care of family 
problems. It seemed like an ironic solution to a problem and it 
caused me some concern.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Strong families make strong countries, there is no doubt in my 
mind. Although this bill has to deal with certain aspects where 
families have in fact broken down, it is important to have fair rules 
to ensure that the needs of the children involved in those family 
breakdowns are paramount in terms of the rules of care for them. 
There must be no compromise in terms of that priority.
<P>
	There is a lot of talk in this place about child poverty, how 
terrible it is and that we have to do something to solve the issue of 
child poverty. All members will know that if a couple with children 
decide to break up, assuming there are no other changes in their 
economic circumstances, one significant thing will change: when 
two people living together decide for whatever reason to live apart, 
there will be the cost of a second residence.
<P>
	Residences cost most families about 30 per cent of their 
disposable income. We are all aware there are certain levels of 
principal residences one can acquire, but even a simple apartment 
could cost even in this city $500, $600 or $700 a month. Who in 
this place could absorb that additional cost with no change in their 
family income, or at least the incomes of two people who have split 
up?
<P>
	There are undoubtedly cases where family breakdown is a direct 
cause of child poverty because quite simply there is not enough 
income for those two people to support an additional residence. We 
cannot get blood out of a stone. There is no amount of legislation, 
court enforcement or coercion that could be imposed to make more 
economic means available for the care of those children.
<P>
	We are fighting a losing battle on child poverty if we do not win 
the battle with the family. The family that stays together, the 
strong, basic economic unit of our society, is the solution to child 
poverty. I honestly believe that.
<P>
	Child poverty is a function of social decay. We have the means 
and we have the right.
<P>
	Earlier today a member rose in his place and said that we have to 
be big enough and tough enough to tough out our responsibilities to 
our children even when the marriage is having some difficulties. 
Today it seems it is just too acceptable and far too easy for people 
to get a divorce in our society. There is no respect for the family.
<P>
	If we think it through, there is no question that a strong, healthy 
family in our society is less of a burden and a cost to our social 
programs, our criminal justice system, our health system and the 
productivity of our businesses than families which break down. 
There is no question about that.
<P>
	We are losing the battle on child poverty. We will lose the battle 
on child poverty and make no progress on it whatsoever if we do 
not first make some progress with regard to the family.
<P>
	We have had far too many casual comments in this place about 
the state of the family, the prevalence of divorce and the prevalence 
of common law relationships. We have to reaffirm the social value 
system we have in this country.
<P>
	Our income tax system was originally structured to recognize the 
fact that families play a predominant role within our society. There 
were various deductions and family allowance. There were all 
kinds of provisions to ensure that the family had the flexibility and 
the options to provide the kind of care to children and to relieve the 
stress and pressures on families so that things such as divorce and 
separation would not occur as often.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	But as we had changes in the mechanics of the Income Tax Act, 
things have changed to the point that it discriminates against 
families. Members will know, I present a petition almost every day 
about managing the family home and caring for preschool children 
being an honourable profession which has not been recognized for 
its value to our society.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act discriminates against families that choose 
to stay together. It discriminates against families that choose to 
provide for their children and be responsible, to tough it out in 
those tough times.
<P>
	This summer I had a great opportunity to reflect on my own life. 
My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in August. 
We sat together. We went through the albums. We talked to our 
children. One has moved out and has a job. One is away at 
university and the other attends high school.
<P>
	We did take the opportunity to get together and talk about what 
has happened in our family. We concluded that family is memories, 
making memories. Family is making sure you are with your family 
members in good times as well as bad. Lord knows we have all had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4956"> 4956 </A></B>
<P>
our  problems. Lord knows we have the ability to tough them out. 
But it is far too easy to say no.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, in many states of the United States-it might 
even be a federal requirement-before someone can even have a 
divorce there is a requirement that they go through some sort of 12 
week program. It is almost like a reality check for couples who are 
contemplating divorce. It is that reality check that says to them did 
you know that if you do this, here are the economic implications; if 
you do this, here are the implications to your child, to your 
lifestyle, to visitation, to access, to support payments. Your entire 
life is going to be affected, and that is the least of it.
<P>
	Everybody in this House agrees that family breakdowns with 
children involved affect no one greater than the children 
themselves. That is the issue here.
<P>
	Social assistance for single parent families accounts for, subject 
to check, about 80 per cent of the income of those families. That 
means it is hard to defend the situation that family breakdown is 
somehow a solution to something. In fact, it is going from one 
problem probably to a more serious problem.
<P>
	I am not naive. I understand things like spousal abuse. I was a 
board member of Interim Place, our shelter for battered wives, for 
five years. I know about spousal abuse. I know about abusive 
relationships and child abuse and I know the best thing to happen in 
most cases is for that marriage to stop.
<P>
	It is our responsibility to make sure the custodial parent and 
those children are properly taken care of regardless of the impact to 
the at fault party, as it were. If we have an aggressor in the 
relationship who is the source of the problem and causes that 
family to break down, that is the party who must bear the 
responsibility for their actions.
<P>
	It really comes down to a principle and a value that is extremely 
important to our society, that we must start again to be responsible 
for our actions and our inactions.
<P>
	The issue of spousal abuse is a very important one to me. I spent 
a lot of time in my former life working in a shelter as a treasurer to 
raise money. We tried to understand the problem. One of the things 
I found as a man in that situation was that I was not often accepted 
by some women who were advocates on behalf of other abused 
women. It appears that there is this bias on behalf of some that all 
men are bad.
<P>
	It was very difficult for me to be on that board. It took two years 
before the others even asked me what I thought about certain 
situations. But I learned a lot and I learned a lot when I drafted the 
bill on health warning labels on the containers of alcoholic 
beverages. My research, which was based on the 1995 report of the 
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, showed that 50 per cent of 
family violence in our society is caused directly or indirectly by the 
misuse of alcohol.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	In the summer there was a bilateral forum on women's health in 
Canada and the United States. One of the facts that came out of this 
was that spousal abuse in our society in Canada costs us some $4.2 
billion.
<P>
	When we get a situation like that we have to ask ourselves 
whether there is something we can do, where are the other things. I 
think I hear that from members in the House that we have to do 
more. I do not think the more that we can do is within the context of 
this bill. It certainly does make the argument that we have to look 
for better ways to prevent problems from occurring, to be 
proactive, to intervene and do whatever it takes to make sure our 
families, our friends, our acquaintances do not become tragic 
statistics. That is a value that I have. That is a value that I think 
many members have in this place.
<P>
	I heard a member say that common law relationships are more 
prevalent now and everything is fine. One of the things I do know is 
that if we look at the incidence of spousal abuse in common law 
relationships versus married couples, a two to one ratio, almost 66 
per cent, of family abuse situations occur in common law 
relationships. We have to ask ourselves the rhetorical question why. 
Is there a reason? We have to look at those things.
<P>
	When this place has the opportunity, I hope all hon. members 
will remember this premise or strategy about prevention versus 
dealing with problems after we have them.
<P>
	We have situations raised by hon. members in this place which 
have identified, even though it is outside of the context and the 
scope of this bill, that we do have problems that we can deal with. I 
hope all hon. members if they care will do what they can to make 
sure that family breakdown, divorce and the need to have stronger 
laws to support enforcement, garnishees, support payments and 
access rights will not be as large a priority as it is in this place 
today.

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DIVORCEACT">DIVORCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
Reform Party members could stop talking, perhaps we could debate 
this bill.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on Bill C-41 regarding child support.
<P>
	As all the members of this House know, the safety, well-being 
and health of our children should always come first. As a single 
parent of two myself, I am qualified to speak on the issue being 
debated today.
<P>
	We must realize that things have changed considerably these 
past few years and that more and more couples divorce; it is a fact 
of life. I heard my hon. colleague from Mississauga South talk 
about divorce as if it were inevitable. Personally, I think it is a 
choice you make.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	When two people can no longer live together, they are better off 
separating than continuing to live under the same roof and putting 
their children through hell. True, there are more divorces but 
divorce is a free choice made by the man, the woman or both 
partners. They decide to go their separate ways for their own good 
and also for the good of their children. This is 1996, not 1930. This 
is my personal opinion, but I think that a number of my colleagues 
may share my views.
<P>
	We must accept that life has changed a great deal. Divorce 
already comes as a terrible shock to children. No argument there. 
Some children even take full responsibility for their parents' 
decision. They feel responsible for the divorce, which makes their 
lives terribly difficult.
<P>
	If, on top of that, these children do not have all the resources 
they need to grow up in a healthy environment, they end up in the 
kind of situations we are all familiar with. Juvenile delinquency has 
reached enormous proportions. The parent, who is generally a 
woman, does not have enough money and, as a result, she may 
suffer from depression and make her children's lives miserable.
<P>
	I have seen cases that were totally unacceptable. One mother of 
three in my riding found herself without money before Christmas. 
She was looking for ways to give them presents, to feed them 
during the holiday season. Such situations occur when the former 
spouses decide they do not have time to pay child support, because 
they are too busy or because they are travelling. This is a terrible 
situation.
<P>
	I have seen many such cases. One December 24 in my riding, I 
had to go looking for resources for a mother and her four children 
as she needed milk, bread and other staples. Her former husband 
had decided that he would not pay child support, but he had gone to 
Florida. He saw nothing wrong with this. It is not always like this 
but in many cases, this is the reality. One must be able to deal with 
these situations.
<P>
	I think that all parents have a primary obligation to support their 
children financially. Last year, Quebec passed legislation to ensure 
that, as soon as child support is awarded, the court orders for child 
support are automatically recorded by the clerk of the superior 
court in which the case is heard. In the case of workers not earning 
regular salaries, the program requires the deposit of a guarantee 
equivalent to three months' support. In the case of salaried 
workers, a deduction is made on their pay cheque. These measures 
aim to make child support more accessible.
<P>
	Let me quote an article published in <I>Le Droit</I>, on February 6, 
1995, and which concerns Quebec. The minister responsible for the 
status of women, Jeanne Blackburn, did not wait long to introduce 
a bill at the National Assembly whereby child support will be 
directly deducted from the pay cheques of former spouses. This 
will not happen next year or in six months, but this April. This 
measure has nothing to do with feminism, machismo or sexism: it 
has to do with elementary justice and plain common sense.
<P>
	Only 45 per cent of former spouses-let us not forget that, eight 
times out of ten, men are the ones who have to pay support-are 
considered to properly fulfil their obligations. As for the other 55 
per cent, it is estimated that they represent about 25,000 deadbeat 
fathers.
<P>
	When there is a divorce, more often than not, the mother gets 
custody of the children. The mother's hard life becomes miserable 
when her former spouse does not pay support, or only does so on an 
haphazard basis. Why do so many men become irresponsible, 
considering that most of them are perfectly able to pay? According 
to Quebec's council on the status of women, it is primarily for 
personal reasons. The person providing support lacks interest in a 
family life he is not involved in; he ignores, or wants to ignore, the 
reasons why support was awarded; in addition to the deep feeling 
of resentment generated by the divorce, there is a very tenacious 
grudge, which is partly due to the conditions applying to visiting 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The automatic collection system is still the most effective way. 
One of the advantages is that the person owed money does not have 
resort to the government's collection service. Although the latter is 
generally reliable, few women use it: in 1993, fewer than 6 per cent 
of those owed money used this service. Why? There are probably 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4958"> 4958 </A></B>
<P>
many reasons. However, fear of retaliation by an ex-spouse, 
especially if he is violent, is certainly a  factor. The bill will make 
life easier for women who live in poverty and fear.
<P>
	Predictable feelings of frustration and anger may arise among 
those who are forcibly reminded of their responsibilities. These are 
self-centred individuals who, although they know they are wrong, 
want to punish their ex-spouse. They tend to forget that in 94 per 
cent of these cases, children are the only ones to benefit from the 
support system. And besides, they could hardly demonstrate their 
disagreement by demonstrating with placards and the rest: they 
would merely attract the opprobrium of 88 per cent of the 
population. That is the percentage of respondents to a poll who 
spoke in favour of the bill.
<P>
	The new provisions will not be sufficient to catch all individuals 
who default on their payments. But they will increase the 
effectiveness of a system which women were afraid to use. Besides, 
the new legislation should modify the behaviour of these new 
debtors. This change in course is not revolutionary at all: three 
other provinces in Canada, including Ontario, have also introduced 
a deduction at source system.
<P>
	The reason this bill has become so urgent is above all because of 
the children. It will give thousands of children a chance to have 
better health, better food and, in a word, receive all the necessities 
of which they are deprived. Too many children live on the margins 
of society in sometimes sordid conditions. Without being a 
cure-all, the new legislation should improve their situation.
<P>
	This is the provincial legislation we have in Quebec.
<P>
	I have another report here which appeared in <I>La pauvreté des 
enfants au Canada</I>, and I would like to read a few excerpts.
<P>
	It says here that the number of poor children has increased 55 per 
cent. A record number of children in Canada, 1.47 million, live 
below the poverty line. Today, more than one child out of five lives 
in a poor family. [-]
<P>
	[-]With a poverty rate of 60.8 per cent, children in single parent 
families are four times as likely to be poor as children in families 
with two parents. [-]
<P>
	[-]In more than 70 per cent of the cases, women become single 
parents as a result of separation or the decease of their spouse.
<P>
	The number of children living in families that need social 
assistance has increased 69 per cent.
<P>
	More than 1.1 million children live in families that at some time 
or other in 1994 needed social assistance. The increase of 69 per 
cent since 1989 can be explained by higher unemployment rates 
and an increase in the number of poor workers. The number of 
families with an income below $40,000 per year has increased by 
26 per cent.
<P>
	Looking at all that, and saying ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' does nothing 
for the cause of the children, who are again paying the price.
<P>
	We are therefore in agreement with the principle of the bill, but 
again existing provincial legislation must be taken into account, in 
Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick among others.
<P>
	The federal government has brought in this bill in order to, if I 
may put it that way, complement the actions of other governments 
in the battle against poverty.
<P>
	In 1990, there were 78,152 divorce decrees in Canada, which 
gave rise to 48,525 judgments concerning child custody. In 1988, 
98 per cent of those receiving child support payments were women. 
Two thirds of divorced women with three children live below the 
poverty line. One child in five does not have enough to eat. I could 
go on and on.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I have said we are in agreement with the substance of this bill, 
but-and I must emphasize this, and hope I have time to do 
so-there are some negative aspects to it as well. I feel this needs 
to be pointed out. There ought to be amendments made to it, if we 
can reach agreement with the government. It might be worthwhile 
to have an act which, one day, just for once, would work for 
everyone. But of course I doubt that is possible.
<P>
	First of all, if a provincial government decides to put guidelines 
in place for its province, these would take precedence over the 
federal ones only if the governor-in-council designates by order 
that the provincial guidelines are the applicable guidelines.
<P>
	Subclause 1(4) reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council may, by order, designate a province for the purposes of 
the definition of ``applicable guidelines'' in subsection (1)-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What I wish to point out here is that ``may'' ought to be changed 
to ``shall''. When the word may is used, this does not mean it is 
absolute, whereas when an order is involved, there is a notion of 
``shall'', or an obligation, if you prefer.
<P>
	The provinces therefore will have to meet the criteria designated 
by the federal government in clause 26.1, if their guidelines are to 
be accepted as the applicable guidelines. In this way, the 
government retains an absolute discretionary power as to the 
acceptance or non-acceptance of the order. Once again, the usual 
paternalism of the federal government is evident. Great care must 
be taken here.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I said, the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour 
of this bill at second reading. However, some major amendments 
are required to bring the bill in line with what they call flexible 
federalism, as usual, and with existing provincial legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4959"> 4959 </A></B>
<P>
	Any overlap between a federal law on child support and existing 
provincial legislation would penalize women, children and 
families because we will end up fighting over whether it is a 
federal or a provincial jurisdiction. This will create confusion.
<P>
	I would like to close on this and say that I am happy to see that 
the federal government has taken such an important initiative. As I 
said earlier, if we can come up with amendments that satisfy all the 
parties in this House, we may be taking a big step for the future of 
our children and women, as well as their safety and everyone's 
well-being.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member made a statement that this is 1996 and not the 1930s. With 
that statement, notwithstanding her other comments, she 
summarily dismissed the family as the basic unit of society. We are 
changed. Get with it. Divorce is a regular thing, no big problem.
<P>
	People in this place should know in this place, in the gallery and 
who are watching the debates on their televisions that there are 
more members in this place who honour, respect and need the 
family than that member has demonstrated in her speech. Strong 
families make strong countries and the member should not be 
dismissing the family in this place.
<P>
	My question has to do with another statement the member made. 
That was her assertion that in Quebec the payments grid, the 
formula, goes a long way to solving the problem of child poverty. 
The member will well know that if two people making a certain 
level of income separate and continue to have the same level of 
income, their economic circumstances are deteriorated for one 
reason and one reason alone. Two people living apart need a second 
residence, a very expensive proposition in terms of the utilization 
of disposable income.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	How does the member rationalize that somehow any formula to 
distribute the income of two people is going to improve the 
situation of children when another major liability has been 
assumed by those two people for the rest of their lives?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, there must be a bad connection with 
the hon. member for Mississauga South's interpretation channel or 
something because I never said that divorce was normal. It is 
however an integral part of our culture. It is part of our reality 
nowadays.
<P>
	Should parents be forced to stay together in this day and age 
because they have children or because it makes economic sense? 
What about their feelings? What about those who are really 
incompatible? What about women battered by their husbands? 
Should they be told: ``You must not leave, stay with your husband, 
you will be better  off''? Come on, Mr. Speaker, let us get real here. 
In real life, people go through divorces, and no one in this House 
has the right to pass judgement on a divorce case. Divorce is a 
decision made by two individuals, and I respect that decision. I did 
say that we had a frightening high divorce rate, but we are in 1996, 
not in 1930.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that the hon. member for Mississauga 
South has been married for 25 years and that he is happy with his 
children. That is great, and I congratulate him on that because this 
really is a rarity today. There is a growing number of single-parent 
families. Changes should be made to this bill. And I am convinced 
that, if we come to an agreement, this bill will go a long way to 
reassure our children, and women in particular, since they are the 
ones who are home with the kids and have to provide for them after 
a divorce. They have to go to their ex-husband and beg for money 
to support the kids.
<P>
	Having children is a decision we make, a decision parents make 
together.
<P>
	I am sorry the hon. member misheard what I said. Perhaps there 
was a problem with his interpretation channel, but divorce is a fact 
of life today and we have to live with it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, again I concede to the member that 
family violence is a situation which in the majority of cases the 
property course is probably for charges to be laid and for the 
relationship to stop because no one should be subject to that kind of 
abuse. I am very familiar with that.
<P>
	The member asked what about emotion; a friend said they split 
up because the love went out of their marriage. Yet the member 
also said as a result of family breakdown there are children who do 
not have enough food to eat.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member very directly, what is more 
important to the member. Is it the equality of emotion in the 
marriage or the food in the mouth of a child? It cannot be both 
ways. The member must make a choice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for 
Mississauga South is really lost today. He definitely has a 
comprehension problem. I am not here to preach. We are here to 
discuss concrete issues; we are talking about family, about women 
with children. Sure, feelings are important for couples. They are 
important because they affect the whole family, particularly 
children. When a woman is abused in a home, children often are 
abused too and the family lives in a violent environment day after 
day.
<P>
	The hon. member says we will put a stop to this, no problem. 
These things are not so easy to stop. Do you know a woman who 
relishes the idea of getting beat up  every day? To be sure some 
choices and decisions will have to be made. I do not understand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4960"> 4960 </A></B>
<P>
why the hon. member almost sounds like he is opposed to this bill 
from his own government. There is something wrong somewhere.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to Bill C-41, which addresses some of the issues surrounding 
divorce and child support payments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me. The Chair forgot to do 
something which was supposed to be done before five o'clock. Will 
he permit me to read something that has to be put directly?
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka, 
Justice; the hon. member for St. Boniface, French language 
communities; the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden, Gasoline 
pricing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to 
Bill C-41, a bill which addresses some of the issues surrounding 
divorce and child support payments.
<P>
	I listened with interest as the member for Mississauga South 
spoke with some eloquence and certainly directly from the heart 
about how important the basic family and family values are to him, 
which I appreciate very much. However, he represents a party that 
is in the majority in this House and is able to do something about 
reinforcing family values and indeed they are the building block of 
society.
<P>
	There are things that are not covered in this bill such as the way 
the Income Tax Act discriminates against married couples. The 
very high tax burden discriminates against couples in that a second 
job is no longer a choice but a necessity. We think that is a deterrent 
to keeping families together. Also, of course, there is the failure to 
recognize the very important role that one of the partners would 
play in staying home to look after the children.
<P>
	Therefore, while I acknowledge and appreciate his support of the 
family, it is a voice in the wilderness and the views are not shared 
by the majority of the people on that side. He even made reference 
to the fact that in debate today a member rose and suggested that 
the divorce rate perhaps should be even higher. What he did not 
mention is that the comment came from a member of his party and 
certainly did not come from my party.
<P>
	I believe it is important to recognize that whenever we address 
this issue we are dealing with a great personal  tragedy. It only 
becomes necessary to discuss child support when divorce is 
occurring. A broken marriage is one of the most painful situations 
in life that people must go through.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Bill C-41 is only one small step when what is 
required is a major overhaul of government policy with respect to 
families. Federal tinkering with this largely provincial area of 
jurisdiction may satisfy some vocal special interest groups, but the 
proposed changes will not deal with the root problem of family 
breakdown.
<P>
	We have identified some specific problems with this bill which 
we believe should be addressed before this legislation is given 
approval. It is clear that all parents want what is best for the 
children. Even though their marriage is falling apart, the child's 
best interest remains central to the parents. It is therefore extremely 
important for us as legislators to understand the emotional impact 
and do our best to remove unnecessary tension and aggravation 
from the legal system.
<P>
	This is one reason why the Reform Party has expressed its 
support for developing the concept of a unified family court. 
Rather than having to visit two and even three different courts in 
the course of divorce proceedings, all family law matters would be 
dealt with in one court with a greater emphasis on mediation.
<P>
	We believe that in these difficult situations the law should be a 
servant to the parties and not a further frustration. Unfortunately, 
the minister has not even begun to address this important aspect of 
family law.
<P>
	A troubling aspect of Bill C-41 is its insistence on rigid payment 
levels for support. A full year in advance of this bill, the Reform 
Party recommended the publication of guidelines for support. We 
said that Statistics Canada could be relied on to provide basic data 
about the average cost of raising children in the cities, towns and 
rural areas. Judges and interested parties could then use the data as 
a benchmark or starting point in their negotiations for support 
awards.
<P>
	We believe the federal government should keep out of provincial 
jurisdiction and continue to allow judges the right to make the final 
decision about awards based on the long established legal 
principles of demonstrated need and ability to pay.
<P>
	The justice minister's Bill C-41 imposes a made in Ottawa 
formula without giving judges the ability to serve just awards. The 
formula is inflexible and fails to take into account the differing 
needs of different families.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	Just one example of where the formula falls short is that it fails 
to account for direct expenditures made by non-custodial parents 
on their children. These include transportation, food, 
accommodation and entertainment on access days. The minister's 
formula and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4961"> 4961 </A></B>
<P>
many bureaucrats fail to recognize these considerations, a judge 
would not.
<P>
	Children need both their parents. The jurisdiction for custody, 
access and support is a provincial jurisdiction. Under Bill C-41, 
however, the federal government is going to assist the courts in 
matters of information gathering and enforcement of court orders 
for support.
<P>
	Although we endorse this initiative, we believe it is important 
for the legislation to reflect that assistance in the area of access in 
custody as well. When parents use the children as tools against 
each other, the biggest losers are the children. It is vital for our 
legislation to reflect a concern for the access of a child to the love 
of both parents, not just the money of both parents.
<P>
	We have said that we oppose this bill because of its failure to 
deal with significant aspects of the results of divorce. More 
disturbing than this is the complete lack of response to the deeper 
social problems of divorce and family break-up that have caused 
the need for us to deal with the child support issue. These 
underlying issues have been aggravated by well meaning but faulty 
government policies stretching back decades.
<P>
	Progressive taxes that discourage hard work and high taxes that 
lower real family income are an impediment to financially stable 
families. Day care subsidies restrict the choice parents have when it 
comes to child care. Tax credits that discriminate against stay at 
home parents, including the expanded working income supplement 
proposed as part of these measures, are examples of government 
making choices for parents but not always in the best interests of 
the child.
<P>
	The government has affirmed other relations as equivalent to 
marriage, even granting some of them taxpayer funding in the form 
of benefits. This new policy has demeaned the special status that 
marriage should enjoy in society.
<P>
	The government has opened the borders further to the 
importation of increasingly graphic and violent obscene materials, 
materials that demean persons and relationships and strip them of 
their dignity. Our cultural institutions, many of them taxpayer 
funded, teach a false stereotype of love and marriage as being 
purely physical relationships. It is no wonder that so many of our 
young people have such difficulty in making a success of 
relationships because relationships require so much more.
<P>
	Reformers believe in lower, flatter and fairer taxes. We believe 
in supporting marriage as a special institution and as the best place 
to raise children. We believe in subsidizing parents, not day care 
centres, and we believe in a civil society where activities, 
behaviour and material that undermines strong families are 
restrained or prohibited.
<P>
	Leadership in society on this issue is sorely lacking. I cannot 
remember the last time we heard a member of the  federal cabinet 
get up and extol the virtues of marriage and family and the vital 
importance of parents in bringing up the next generation. They 
have spent a lot of time talking about the value of other types of 
relationships, but not one word about marriage.
<P>
	During the past year I have had the honour and privilege of 
attending many 50th wedding anniversaries. The end of the second 
world war was in 1946 and those brave young Canadians who 
returned were getting married and starting a new life. Through hard 
work and perseverance they managed to develop a successful 
relationship that should be a model for our young people. We can 
all learn a great deal from the love and commitment these couples 
demonstrated one to another.
<P>
	Perhaps for a few there is no possible alterative to divorce, but 
for many others the worth of marriage has been so devalued by our 
modern throwaway society that divorce has appeared to become an 
easy and reasonable option. All too often, however, those most 
important damaged by this newly casual option are the children.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	If we believe in the value of strong families, then we need strong 
leadership to stand for what we know to be right. Over the past 
three years I have heard many members of this House talk about 
child poverty. Today I stand to agree with them. There is a massive 
problem with child poverty in Canada.
<P>
	It is not, as some claim, an economic problem. In fact our society 
is quite wealthy. There is no need for even the lowest income 
families to do without the basic necessities. The child poverty I am 
talking about is the emotional and spiritual poverty that a child of 
divorced parents suffers. With only one parent at a time children of 
divorce suffer from a love deficit.
<P>
	This is borne out by the myriad studies which prove conclusively 
how much harder life is for these youngsters. Children of divorce 
have an increased likelihood of failing or dropping out of school, 
using drugs, committing crimes, suffering depression, mental 
illness and suicide and having interpersonal relationship problems, 
including a greater likelihood of divorce and family violence 
themselves.
<P>
	Child support needs to be about more than just financial 
payments. It is about meeting all the needs of children including 
their need for both parents' love and attention.
<P>
	Reformers are exercising leadership on the child poverty issue 
by attacking the root of the problem: family breakdown. If the 
Liberal government and the justice minister think that the Canadian 
people do not care about this basic problem, that Canadians only 
want to apply a band-aid solution like Bill C-41 to one of the 
symptoms of the problem, they had better think again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4962"> 4962 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians care about families. They care about child poverty. 
They care about their neighbourhoods and communities. What 
they do not care for is impersonal big government, its high taxes 
and the social manipulation and interference it brings.
<P>
	More programs and more spending are not the solution to this 
problem. Exercising leadership and making the necessary 
legislative changes are part of the solution. I ask all members to 
join me in opposing Bill C-41.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my colleague for his presentation on this issue.
<P>
	I have a question. We heard a little earlier today from a member 
of the governing party bragging about the number of justice bills 
that the government has brought before the House. In this area of 
reforming the Divorce Act what we were looking for was some 
substantial, comprehensive legislation which dealt with a wide 
range of issues. All we have had is piecemeal legislation which 
deals with only one aspect. I would like to ask the hon. member to 
comment on that.
<P>
	As well, the member for Halifax was suggesting that the divorce 
rate should be higher than it probably is, if more people would give 
up on marriages which they should give up on. Then we had the 
member from Mississauga saying that there should be much more 
substantial change in this area. Yet those members are all from the 
governing side.
<P>
	The government has the power to make the changes that are 
being recommended and not just to tinker with so many different 
bills which really do so little. I would like the hon. member to 
comment on that also.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague from Vegreville for the question.
<P>
	What is demonstrated in this bill is a lack of commitment on the 
part of the government to deal with the real issue of divorce and 
family breakdown. Like so many bills, it is a halfway measure, 
trying to walk down the middle of the road and be all things to all 
people. The tragedy of course is in the failure to deal with the root 
problem.
<P>
	We had on the floor today in excess of 100 of our Olympic 
athletes. Those athletes are living testimonials to commitment and 
dedication in what they have done to overcome obstacles to make 
them the very best in the world. The commitment and dedication 
which was demonstrated on the floor of the House today by those 
Canadian athletes is what is missing across the aisle in government 
members. They should show the same commitment and dedication 
to the basic family unit and the important role it plays in this great 
country of ours. Sadly it is lacking and I wish we could instil it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are debating Bill C-41. The title of the act is rather long and boring. 
It is an act to amend four other acts. The real purpose of the bill is 
to deal with the enforcement of child support, to ensure that 
non-custodial parents continue to support their children financially.
<P>
	The main provisions of the bill are to set guidelines for child 
support so there is more certainty and uniformity in the manner in 
which child support awards are handed down. New access to 
Revenue Canada databases will be granted in order to search for 
and locate defaulting parents. The bill will allow public service 
pension benefits to be garnisheed. Finally, the bill provides for the 
withdrawal of federal licences. Federal licences are defined so as to 
include passports.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to give some teeth to the legislation and 
to provide greater certainty that parents who are ordered to support 
their children financially do so.
<P>
	Those are the four main points about which we are talking today 
and I would like to address them. However, Mr. Speaker, I do not 
believe I have the time to get into those four provisions, so with 
your permission perhaps I could speak to them tomorrow. This is a 
sensitive matter. We are dealing with children, families, divorce 
and all the difficulties which that entails. We need to be very 
balanced and careful when we talk about these issues. I will 
certainly attempt to do that tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary North will 
have the floor tomorrow when we return to this matter.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RETURNTOCANADAOFKARIMNOAH">RETURN TO CANADA OF KARIM NOAH</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Canadian government should bring all 
appropriate political pressure to bear on the government of Egypt to ensure the 
immediate return to Canada of Karim Noah, son of Mrs. Micheline Tremblay, a 
resident in the riding of Rosemont, who was abducted illegally, on January 17, 1993, 
by his father, Mr. Moustafa Nouh, and taken illicitly to Egypt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, since my name is Tremblay as well, I 
would like to say right away, for the benefit of my colleagues and 
all those who are listening, that Mrs. Micheline Tremblay is not in 
any way related to me.
<P>
	She is, however, a resident of the riding of Rosemont, and the 
reason I presented this motion on February 28 this year and the 
reason why we are having this debate today is that I hope to 
convince the Canadian government to provide some real support 
for what a mother, Mrs. Tremblay, is doing, a mother who has been 
fighting for almost four years to find her son and get him back to 
Canada.
<P>
	Mrs. Tremblay earnestly hopes that the Canadian government 
will intervene politically, because she is convinced that the legal 
action she has taken and has continued to take in Egypt will not be 
enough to bring her son back.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The fact is that her ex-spouse, Mr. Moustafa Nouh, by abducting 
his child and taking him to Egypt, has simultaneously violated the 
Canadian Criminal Code, the Quebec Civil Code, the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and The Hague 
Convention on International Child Abduction.
<P>
	Despite these patent violations of the law, Mrs. Tremblay has 
been unable to see her son again for more than three years, her 
ex-spouse was not arrested and the Canadian government has said 
repeatedly that it could not intervene in this case. Incredible but 
true, and I am convinced that the people who are listening will find 
it hard to believe and wonder how a country like Canada can let its 
laws and the rights of its citizens be trampled in this way.
<P>
	I am also sure they wonder how a country like Egypt can agree to 
be a safe haven for a child abductor, a place where the law cannot 
reach him.
<P>
	In fact, this can be largely explained by the legal context of the 
relations between Egypt and Canada with respect to this kind of 
situation and by the lack of political will on the part of both 
governments to change the situation.
<P>
	Let me explain the legal context in a few words. I will then get 
back to the urgent need for the political will to do something in this 
case.
<P>
	The ex-spouse of Mrs. Micheline Tremblay, Mr. Nouh, is a 
Canadian citizen of Egyptian origin. In fact, he is both a Canadian 
and an Egyptian citizen. When in Egypt, he is treated like an 
Egyptian citizen, which provides him double immunity against the 
charges brought against him: first of all, immunity against criminal 
charges, because Canada has not signed an extradition treaty 
against Egypt. Under the circumstances, the police find themselves 
virtually incapable of arresting the accused. Let us examine those 
circumstances.
<P>
	After an investigation into the circumstances of the kidnapping 
of Karim on January 17, 1993, criminal charges were laid against 
the father, Moustafa Nouh, in Canada. A warrant for his arrest was 
issued, and the Canadian police asked Interpol to co-operate with 
them. This standard procedure does not, however, necessarily lead 
to an active search for the accused. The bulk of the work has to be 
done by the local police force, in this case the Montreal Urban 
Community force, which called for the co-operation of other police 
forces when there were any real clues.
<P>
	Yet, since there is no extradition treaty between Egypt and 
Canada, it is impossible for the Canadian police to bring the 
accused to justice when he is in Egypt. Moustafa Nouh must, 
therefore, be identified and arrested when he is in another country, 
one with which Canada had an extradition treaty.
<P>
	The investigation leading to such an arrest is a very long and 
difficult one, because it involves a knowledge of the international 
movements of the accused. The whole thing has to be done without 
the co-operation of the Egyptian authorities.
<P>
	It is easy to understand how, in these conditions, Moustafa Nouh 
is still free to move around with total impunity in Egypt, and 
probably in other countries as well, despite the criminal charges 
brought against him in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4966"> 4966 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, Mr. Nouh is also immune from the laws of Quebec and 
Canada in another respect, namely the legal custody order. Child 
custody matters come under civil law, in this case Quebec's civil 
law, and the same goes for every country.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	But there is an international convention to honour custody orders 
whenever a child is taken illegally away by one of the parents. This 
convention provides for the child's immediate return to his or her 
usual place of residence and recognizes that the courts in that 
location have jurisdiction over all legal custody matters.
<P>
	Egypt has not signed the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects 
of International Child Abduction, and Canada has not yet 
compensated for this by negotiating a bilateral agreement with 
Egypt. Even though Egypt has not signed this international 
convention, some countries, including France, have an agreement 
with Egypt and all French nationals are covered by this treaty.
<P>
	This is what the Canadian government should do. This is what 
the Canadian government has promised to do on several occasions. 
They tell us they are trying to do so but we are still waiting and in 
the meantime people like Micheline Tremblay still have to deal 
with these tragic situations.
<P>
	If Egypt had signed the international convention or if Canada 
simply had a bilateral agreement with Egypt, proceedings would 
have been fairly simple and inexpensive as well as speedy. In fact, 
Karim would have been returned to his mother in Canada after a 
few weeks, because Moustafa Nouh would have been required to 
assert his custody rights in Canada in accordance with the laws of 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this is not what happened. Mrs. Tremblay found 
herself in an absurd situation in that the police were unable to arrest 
the kidnapper for lack of an extradition treaty with Egypt while the 
Canadian government said it could do nothing because it had 
signed no treaty or convention with Egypt.
<P>
	All they could do was suggest to Mrs. Tremblay that she try on 
her own to assert her rights before the Egyptian courts in 
accordance with Egyptian laws. It must be pointed out that such 
proceedings entail substantial legal and travel costs as the mother 
has to travel to Egypt every time she must appear before the court 
and there is no financial support program for the victims.
<P>
	Fortunately, Mrs. Tremblay's co-workers at the National Bank in 
Montreal organized a fundraiser so she could initiate legal 
proceedings. But this is a long and expensive battle that no one can 
take on alone.
<P>
	On the other hand, Egypt is a Muslim country whose laws and 
customs are very different from ours, which makes it almost 
impossible, in Karim's case, to obtain an order to have him 
returned to Canada. Let me give you an example to illustrate this.
<P>
	Since Karim is a boy and his father is a Muslim, under Egyptian 
law, the child must be raised in the Muslim faith. Ms. Tremblay's 
son Karim was baptised in the Catholic faith, which is a serious 
breach under Egyptian law. That is why her lawyer suggested she 
should try to have her son's baptism annulled: to increase her 
chances of convincing a court in Egypt to give her custody of her 
son.
<P>
	You can imagine that there are many more customs and 
considerations like this one that make it almost impossible to get 
Karim back without infringing in any way Egyptian law.
<P>
	While realizing that laws, customs and religions may vary from 
country to country, and we respect that, we must understand that 
what we have here is a situation where a Canadian child was born 
to a Canadian couple and this child grew up in a setting governed 
by Canadian and Quebec laws until he was kidnapped and taken to 
his father's country of origin.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	The law is clear, and international conventions are clear. If the 
father wants to return to his country of origin, he may assert the 
rights he has over the child before the courts in Quebec and 
Canada. In this case, having committed an illegal act on two 
counts, the father ends up in Egypt with the child, and the mother is 
the one who has to go over there to argue her case before Egyptian 
courts. In fact, it is exactly the opposite of what should be, and all 
this government finds to say is that it cannot interfere.
<P>
	You know as well as I and everyone who is listening that this is 
absurd and just not true.
<P>
	Mrs. Tremblay is hoping for a political intervention and we 
support her efforts. To date, more than 2,000 citizens of Rosemont 
have signed a petition to express their support.
<P>
	In recent years, Canada has taken pride in the fact that it has 
made a number of decisions to ensure children a better future. As 
recently as last week, the Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed his 
satisfaction at Canada's action in support of children, at the 51st 
UN general assembly.
<P>
	We want to give the minister a small opportunity to follow up on 
his nice speeches. We are convinced he can act and we want him to 
act now.
<P>
	Our belief that the Canadian government can act was greatly 
reinforced last June. In fact, today's debate could have taken place 
on June 12. However, since we mentioned that the debate would 
then take place while Mrs. Tremblay was in Egypt, the powers that 
be got their act together for the first time in three and a half years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4967"> 4967 </A></B>
<P>
	On June 11, I received a telegram asking that the debate be 
postponed. For the first time, Mrs. Tremblay was able to see her 
child for a few hours, in the presence of the father. The powers 
that be had taken action.
<P>
	But if we are holding this debate today, it is because the powers 
that be have stopped taking action. The initial co-operation is 
totally inadequate to settle the issue quickly. After initial progress, 
there were no other developments. This is why we will continue to 
ask people to sign the petition and to exert political pressure.
<P>
	We want the Canadian government to act quickly to patriate 
Karim and to sign a convention to avoid other such cases.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by paying tribute to the courage and the 
determination of the mother, Micheline Tremblay, who has been 
fighting for four years to be reunited with her son. I do hope she 
will inspire all of us to show solidarity and to urge this government 
to take action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to thank the member for Rosemont for moving this 
motion and this debate on the abduction of the son of Mrs. 
Micheline Tremblay. I would like to begin by saying that the 
government shares the member's frustration, as well as the distress 
of Mrs. Tremblay, who has been trying for so long to see her son 
again.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs has been unrelenting in its 
efforts since February 4, 1993 when Madame Tremblay advised us 
of the abduction of her son. Karim Noah is the son of Madame 
Micheline Tremblay and Mr. Moustafa Nouh. He was abducted by 
his father to Egypt in early 1993. At the time, Madame Tremblay 
and Mr. Nouh were separated from their common law relationship 
and had agreed to joint custody of their son who was born on June 
14, 1989. Following the abduction, a Canada-wide and then an 
international arrest warrant was issued for Mr. Nouh.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After her son was abducted, Mrs. Tremblay made the first of 
many trips to Egypt, and instituted legal proceedings to have her 
right to custody recognized by the Egyptian courts. Throughout this 
undertaking, she was assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and staff of the Canadian embassy in Cairo.
<P>
	She was unfortunately unsuccessful in having her right to 
custody recognized by the Egyptian courts, but finally obtained 
visiting rights, already a considerable achievement. Thanks to the 
many efforts of the Canadian embassy in Cairo, and the 
co-operation of Egyptian authorities, the child's location was 
finally confirmed and Mrs. Tremblay was able to visit her son last 
June 18.
<P>
	Interpol Egypt, moved by this mother's plight, spared no effort 
to find Karim and co-operated closely with embassy staff so that 
Mrs. Tremblay could visit her son in complete safety.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government through the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and the Canadian embassy in Cairo have been 
directly involved in assisting Madame Tremblay in her efforts to 
have her son returned. We are committed to continuing with our 
support and assistance.
<P>
	Over the years of this matter we have made numerous 
representations to the Egyptian authorities. Our embassy in Cairo 
follows every possible aspect of Karim's well-being. It is always 
available to the father and holds ongoing meetings with both the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Interpol Egypt with a view to 
reaching a solution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are a number of tragic cases similar to the abduction of 
Karim Noah by his father, cases where a child born in Canada is 
abducted and then taken abroad in contravention of Canadian laws 
and without the agreement of one of the custodial parents. This is 
an important international problem, which adds to the suffering 
caused by the breakdown of the family and the separation. It affects 
numerous countries.
<P>
	Canada is a leading country in the search for a solution. it 
saddens me that our efforts and the efforts of all the other interested 
countries have not resulted in a satisfactory solution. The 
government is determined to pursue its efforts, not only to support 
Mrs. Tremblay, but also to put in place a mechanism that will help 
us to settle all the other similar cases.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The international community has provided a partial answer. For 
some abducted children that answer can be found in the provisions 
of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International 
Child Abduction. This treaty was negotiated in the early 1980s and 
was based on a proposal by Canada. Since then it has been ratified 
by more than 40 countries, including Canada.
<P>
	The treaty in essence provides for the prompt return of a child 
who has been wrongfully removed or retained from his country of 
habitual residence in breach of rights of custody. It has proven an 
excellent vehicle for many parents who have faced situations like 
those faced by Madame Tremblay.
<P>
	The success of the Hague convention is limited by the fact that 
only about 42 countries have ratified it. Canada along with other 
countries regularly seeks to encourage other countries to sign but 
progress has been slow. This is mainly due to the fact that many 
countries have difficulty in accepting and implementing the basic  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4968"> 4968 </A></B>
<P>
requirements of the treaty due to cultural, religious and legal 
differences.
<P>
	Egypt is not a signatory and therefore the treaty is not available 
to assist in child abductions such as that of Karim Noah. The 
former Minister of Foreign Affairs as well as the current minister 
have been well aware of the problem with the treaty in respect of 
Egypt as well as the personal tragedy of Madame Tremblay.
<P>
	I am happy to report that the Egyptian authorities shared our 
view that it is a matter requiring urgent action. It was subsequently 
agreed to enter into discussions to see if an arrangement could be 
established to deal with cases such as that of Karim Noah as well as 
other consular problems.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	A Canadian delegation visited Cairo in March 1996. We are 
hopeful that an arrangement can be finalized in the near future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is determined to conclude effective 
co-operation agreements that will make it possible to settle cases of 
international child abduction. I must add that it is an issue with 
complex legal, social and religious overtones.
<P>
	Mrs. Tremblay has remained steadfast in her efforts to have her 
right to the custody of her child recognized by the Egyptian 
authorities. We are all sorry that this has not been possible. I can 
assure the members, particularly the member for Rosemont, that 
we are still determined to assist and support Mrs. Tremblay. I can 
only hope that our efforts will bear fruit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
also speak to Motion No. 169 which deals with the abduction of a 
young Canadian from Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member for Rosemont is asking the Canadian 
government to bring the appropriate political pressure to bear on 
the Government of Egypt to ensure the immediate return to Canada 
of Karim Noah who was abducted illegally on January 17, as we 
have heard.
<P>
	I would first like to note my respect for the hon. member's 
obvious concern for one of his constituents. I congratulate his 
efforts to represent his constituent in the House.
<P>
	Child abduction is a serious and complicated matter in Canada, 
as it is in many other countries of the world. Canada has been a 
good example to the rest of the world in matters like this, one in 
which we have consistently showed our concern for the rights of 
children.
<P>
	It is especially noteworthy that Canada played a leading role in 
drafting the process of the convention of rights of children and in 
convening the 1990 world summit for children.
<P>
	Canada is also a member of The Hague convention on the civil 
aspects of international child abduction. This convention was 
created out of the desire to protect children internationally from the 
harmful effects of wrongful removal and to establish a procedure to 
ensure their prompt return to their habitual state of residence.
<P>
	This convention was adopted by the 14th session of The Hague 
conference. The convention sets ground rules for dealing with child 
abduction cases, both when the harbouring nation is a signatory of 
the convention and for those cases when the harbouring nation is 
not a signatory.
<P>
	In this case the harbouring nation is Egypt, which has neither 
signed nor ratified this convention. In cases such as this one, when 
the harbouring state has not ratified the convention, the Department 
of Foreign Affairs can provide some assistance, as has already been 
done in this case.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke 
with his Egyptian counterpart in November 1995. We have been 
updated regarding the progress that is occurring there.
<P>
	Unfortunately because Egypt has not ratified The Hague 
convention, this case is governed by domestic law in Egypt. 
Therefore the Egyptian government is not solely responsible for the 
resolution of this case and the Egyptian courts will also have to 
become involved.
<P>
	The authorities in Canada have also become involved by issuing 
a warrant for the father's arrest and ensuring the mother receives 
aid from the missing children's registry. While this is not a lot of 
help to the mother desperately seeking the return of her son, I have 
been informed that the role of the federal government in abduction 
cases is rather limited.
<P>
	Family law falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Canadian provinces, therefore it is the provincial authorities that 
deal with the hands on work related to The Hague convention and 
associated child abduction cases.
<P>
	I am sure all members in this House would urge the province of 
Quebec, along with the federal government, to work as diligently 
as possible to secure the return of this child.
<P>
	Generally the federal government only acts as a conduit between 
foreign authorities and Canadian provincial authorities. The federal 
government does play a significant role along with the Canadian 
Department of Justice in liaising with the provinces regarding the 
access of new states to The Hague convention. Mostly it assists in 
general matters requiring liaison between foreign governments and 
those provinces.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian government assisted in this way when the 
Department of Foreign Affairs contacted the  Egyptian minister. 
This was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4969"> 4969 </A></B>
<P>
the appropriate political action outlined by The Hague convention. 
Therefore while the motion of the hon. member for Rosemount 
clearly shows his desire to help his constituent, I would hope the 
Canadian government has done and is doing and will continue to do 
everything to help move the case forward.
<P>
	Because family law falls under the jurisdiction of the provinces 
there is not much more that the Canadian government can do, 
according to my research of this case. However, due diligence is 
required.
<P>
	While the Canadian government is restricted in its dealings with 
this specific abduction case, I would argue that we can become 
more involved with the broader issue of international child 
abduction.
<P>
	We can start by persuading other nations to ratify the Hague 
convention using whatever pressure we may have, through aid or 
other things, to put pressure on countries to sign. For those states 
that were members of the 14th session of the conference on private 
international law, the convention enters into force between them 
and the other member states as soon as they deposit their 
instruments of ratification with the ministry of foreign affairs in the 
Netherlands.
<P>
	There are currently six member states at this conference that 
have failed to ratify the convention. One of these is Egypt, the 
harbouring state in this case.
<P>
	Those states that were not members of the 14th session can also 
be persuaded to ratify the convention. Once they register their 
ascension with the foreign affairs ministry in the Netherlands their 
ascension will have effect with the contracting states and they will 
be quickly accepted.
<P>
	Once on board, the convention aids in the return of wrongfully 
abducted children by setting up the formalities between the 
harbouring state and the initial resident state of the child. Under 
The Hague convention these two states co-operate with each other 
and promote co-operation among the competent authorities in their 
respective states to secure the prompt return of the children. The 
convention also outlines the appropriate measures to be taken by 
both states.
<P>
	The more nations that ratify this convention, the better the 
co-operation will be among nations in abduction cases, allowing 
for the speedy return of abducted children. This is an area in which 
the Canadian government can get more involved and can put more 
pressure on governments.
<P>
	Too often we do not tie things like this to aid programs, to 
co-operative programs. I think it is time we started to do that. This 
is a serious problem not just for this one child but for many parents 
throughout this country and others. The Canadian government can 
also help end international child abduction by encouraging  the use 
of a preventive method promoted by the convention.
<P>
	The new ease with which people can move around the globe has 
caused an increase in international child abduction. Therefore the 
use of preventive methods must be increased. Ultimately 
prevention is the only true way to combat this rising phenomenon.
<P>
	While the motion's purpose seems to have already been partly 
played out, the role of the Canadian government in dealing with 
international abduction cases has not. I challenge the government 
to increase its involvement in the issues of child abduction by 
encouraging states like Egypt to ratify The Hague convention and 
by promoting the preventative methods highlighted by that 
convention.
<P>
	Again I point out that we write off debts for countries like Egypt. 
Maybe we should tie some other requirements before we do that 
sort of thing. I believe we can pull some strings so that we will not 
have to deal with cases like this in the House.
<P>
	Being a parent, I can understand the terrible pain the parent is 
going through and I certainly sympathize with her.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to join with my colleagues to address what I 
would call a tragic question. As a mother I can empathize with this 
mother and her specific situation in this case.
<P>
	My hon. colleagues have addressed some of the issues and I will 
also. Child abductions are difficult enough to resolve when they 
occur within Canada, but when they occur outside our borders in 
other countries it is doubly so.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	When they involve other countries and other cultures the 
problems multiply. Because each international child abduction is 
unique, the approach taken must vary from case to case. What has 
to be done in one case may be the very thing to be avoided in 
another.
<P>
	We will continue our efforts to engage other countries in finding 
solutions either by encouraging them to sign on to The Hague 
convention on the civil aspects of child abduction or, when they are 
unwilling, to seek other agreements of a bilateral nature to 
safeguard the best interests of children everywhere.
<P>
	The Hague convention, which we heard a great deal about from 
previous speakers, and the United Nations convention on the rights 
of the child serve as our base from which to work for greater 
understanding and a more complete international response to this 
painful problem.
<P>
	We must use our reputation as a country in the forefront of the 
battle for children's rights to save children from the deprivation 
and isolation that is the result of these criminal acts. This necessi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4970"> 4970 </A></B>
<P>
tates our closest attention to both the individual child and the 
problem as a whole.
<P>
	At the same time, we must use our increasingly sophisticated 
communication systems and networks of relations to more quickly 
locate such children. We must verify their well-being and enter into 
informed negotiations with the other parents and country of 
residence. I understand in this case we are proceeding to do just 
that.
<P>
	Important, the government strongly believes that in addition to 
trying to cope with abductions once they occur, we must ensure that 
Canadians are well informed about these cases and that every effort 
is made to prevent them from occurring.
<P>
	The Departments of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
co-operate closely, as we heard from the parliamentary secretary, 
with non-governmental organizations dedicated to dealing with this 
problem, including provincial social service agencies, legal and 
police authorities, the RCMP's missing children's registry, Canada 
customs and Citizenship and Immigration Canada in order to 
provide advice and guidance to parents facing the possibility of the 
abduction of a child to another country.
<P>
	As a contribution to that effort, the Department of Foreign 
Affairs has just published a manual on the subject for parents and 
involved professionals. It is being distributed now. It is an excellent 
document and copies will be made available to members of 
Parliament. As members will note, it provides comprehensive 
information, guidance and advice for parents and we are hopeful 
that it will be of help in dealing with this very tragic problem.
<P>
	Karim Noah is both a real person and a symbol. As a child, he is 
separated from his mother at an age when this should not happen. 
His mother is to be commended for the dedication and zeal with 
which she has sought to have him returned to Canada. As a symbol, 
Karim is a beacon for all of us to continue the action necessary to 
deal with this international social dilemma.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member for Rosemont and indeed all 
members that the Departments of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade will always be there to assist parents such as Mrs. Tremblay. 
Equally, the Department of Foreign Affairs will redouble its efforts 
for agreements with more countries that would provide for a more 
effective way to deal with these tragedies.
<P>
	Therefore I join with other members in thinking at this moment 
of Mrs. Tremblay and the difficult situation that we all face.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
pleased to accept the opportunity to speak today in support of the 
motion by my colleague, the hon. member for Rosemont.
<P>
	This motion deals with a subject very close to my heart: child 
welfare. Even if the wording of the motion refers to calling upon 
the Canadian government to undertake negotiations and political 
representations in order to ensure the return to Canada of a child 
kidnapped by his father, nevertheless the individual really at the 
centre of any such matter is the child.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	I shall therefore focus my speech on that aspect. As I have 
already said, we are speaking of a three year old who has had his 
mother brutally taken away from him. This is how we need to focus 
any discussion on the abduction of children.
<P>
	The very real consequences, to get down to earth, to get down to 
the every day nitty-gritty of it, is that little Karim has not seen his 
mother for three years, is growing up without her, without her 
presence, without her care, without her love. All this because one 
adult has decided that is the way things will be, for reasons that 
have nothing to do with the child.
<P>
	This is a cruel reality, with the risk of very negative 
consequences for the child. I am not saying, and am far from 
believing, that it would be more acceptable for a child to be 
deprived of the care of his father. On the contrary. The presence of 
both parents is necessary for a child to develop properly, but that 
presence can take a number of forms, depending on the 
circumstances. In the case of concern to us today, one of the two 
parents disappears completely from the child's life, for reasons that 
have absolutely nothing to do with him.
<P>
	Unfortunately, children are often the victims of the bitterness 
and anger which eats up a family during and after a separation. 
According to the 1995 annual report of the RCMP'S Missing 
Children's Registry, often the abductor tells the child that the other 
parent no longer loves him, or worse, that the other parent is dead.
<P>
	As well, the abductor often neglects the child's education and 
health, not to mention that he or she is left alone for long periods of 
time, which predisposes him or her to antisocial behaviour. In the 
case of Karim, we are told that he is ill. He was seen again this 
summer for the first time since January 1993.
<P>
	Such situations are unacceptable and in fact criminal. They are 
criminal and punishable under the law. The Criminal Code 
provides a maximum prison sentence of 10 years for a parent who 
acts like the father of Karim.
<P>
	With this legislation, our society recognizes how important it is 
for a child to live in a stable emotional environment, irrespective of 
the quality of the  relationship between the adults who take care of 
him. Our society recognizes the importance to the child of having 
access to both parents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4971"> 4971 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, our society feels it is important, in case of a conflict, to 
let a third party, in this case the courts, take on the difficult task of 
determining how the interests of the child are best served. A parent 
who abducts his child and deprives him of the presence of his other 
parent is a criminal who only thinks of his own interests and causes 
considerable damage to the child.
<P>
	Little Karim is unfortunately not the only child to have been 
taken abroad illegally. In recent years, cases of child abduction and 
taking children to other countries have increased. This is partly due 
to the greater ease with which people are able to travel quickly over 
large distances.
<P>
	In these cases, dispute resolution procedures are complicated 
because of their international nature. Even if one parent has been 
given legal custody of the child in Canada, we cannot be sure that 
this decision will be respected elsewhere. Consequently, and this is 
particularly true in the case before us today, a parent or guardian 
may be tempted to abduct a child, expecting to be safe from the 
Canadian justice system abroad, as in the case of Karim's father.
<P>
	There are no statistics in Quebec today that establish with any 
accuracy the total number of Quebec children that have been 
displaced or are being detained abroad annually by one of the 
parents. After checking with the Missing Children's Registry of the 
RCMP, it seems the situation is the same at the federal level.
<P>
	Figures are of course available. However, these indicate the 
number of abductions committed by a parent and brought to the 
attention of the police, but they do not indicate which of these 
abductions are international in nature.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	In this context, it is still difficult to evaluate how widespread the 
problem of international child abduction really is.
<P>
	However, even if the number of Quebec and Canadian children 
who are abducted is relatively low, we should not lose sight of the 
hardship suffered by these children.
<P>
	Again, the real victim of an abduction is the child himself. In this 
particular case, it is young Karim, who has suffered and is still 
suffering from a loss of balance and stability caused by the trauma 
of being separated from the parent with whom he had always been. 
He is the one who has to put up with the uncertainties and the 
frustrations related to having to learn a new language and adapt to a 
new culture.
<P>
	The ability to make contact with the abducted child and the 
chances for a quick resolution vary greatly, depending on whether 
or not the country of refuge is a  signatory to the Hague 
Convention. The convention aims primarily to prevent the 
international movement of children by promoting close 
co-operation between the legal and administrative authorities of the 
contracting states.
<P>
	However, Egypt, where Karim was taken, is not a signatory to 
the convention. We also know that, to this day, a small percentage 
of children abducted and taken to a country which is not a 
contracting state of the convention have been returned to Quebec 
and to Canada. In such cases, the co-operation and legal 
mechanisms established by the Hague Convention and by the 
Canadian legislation are not available to those parents who need 
help.
<P>
	Locating a child becomes more difficult and may require the use 
of private investigating agencies. The parent must also seek legal 
representation abroad and pay for the related costs, as is the case 
for Karim's mother.
<P>
	In addition to all these problems, the legal battle is subject to the 
national laws of the state, where the rules greatly differ from the 
ones that we have here.
<P>
	Given this situation, I join the hon. member for Rosemont in 
asking the Canadian government to really do something about 
Karim's plight, and to show its support to the mother by exerting 
all appropriate political pressure on the Egyptian government to 
ensure the immediate return of young Karim.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened with attention to the speeches made today 
by my hon. colleagues, and I, too, would like to take a few minutes 
of this House to address this issue.
<P>
	Of course, unlike the hon. member for Rosemont, I do not know 
the child or his family personally, but I was closely involved in a 
similar case several years ago.
<P>
	Back in 1982, when my daughter was in kindergarten, one of her 
little classmates disappeared. The child in question, Tina Lynn 
Malette, had been abducted by her father. A short time later, the 
family contacted me. I was then a member of the provincial 
legislature. I wrote to all the school boards in Ontario, then to those 
in Quebec and finally, in April 1983, we found out that Tina was in 
Tunisia. This is somewhat similar to the case that our colleague 
across the way has just described.
<P>
	Like today, there was no extradition treaty covering such cases 
and Tunisia had not signed any conventions either.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	What was difficult for everyone involved, including your 
humble servant, is that I knew the child and her family personally. I 
lived through this situation; her classmates, including my daughter, 
even asked me where Tina was.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4972"> 4972 </A></B>
<P>
	We worked for years. I remember going to see the Tunisian 
ambassador to bring him petitions signed by 7,000 Canadians 
asking him to take whatever steps were required to return the child 
to Canada. In the beginning, the ambassador did not know or at 
least claimed he did not know where the child was, but later 
everyone knew where she was. She was in Tunisia. It was no 
secret.
<P>
	Worse yet, the child's father had no legal authority over her. First 
of all, the parents were not married, not that it would have made 
much of a difference in this case. Second, the father and mother had 
been separated for years, and the mother had sole custody of the 
child. Third, he was not officially recorded as the father in the birth 
register, although he was the father, a fact the mother did not deny. 
So this is an abduction very similar to an abduction by a total 
stranger.
<P>
	Just moments ago, I tried to reach Tina Lynn Malette's aunt on 
the phone, seeing that she is a neighbour of mine. I still do not 
know if the child's whereabouts have been established yet. I 
checked a little while ago. I keep inquiring. Today, my daughter is 
19 years old and a university student. She has never seen Tina 
again, and neither have I nor my neighbour for that matter-the one 
I just referred to, who had custody of the child when her father 
kidnapped her, on the pretext of a Sunday afternoon visit. He had 
no visiting rights by the way.
<P>
	In a nutshell, these are the facts of this case. I am sorry for telling 
such a sad story, a story that may even sound discouraging to those 
close to the child our hon. colleague opposite just told us about.
<P>
	My goal in bringing this case to the attention of the House is 
certainly not to discourage this child's parents, but rather to share 
with this House my sadness around this kind of situation and also to 
show how frustrating it can be for those involved. In this, I share 
the sentiments of our colleagues, who raised this matter today. I 
hope that the governments that have not signed such treaties will do 
so.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to say how important it 
is, in the field of international relations, for everyone in this House 
to take an interest in this question of extradition treaties and so on.
<P>
	Some of us in this House, and this happens at certain times, try to 
take a somewhat isolationist approach. I am thinking of a certain 
political party, and I apologize for being partisan at such a sad time. 
They even try to get themselves exempted from delegations of 
parliamentarians who are exchanging points of view between 
countries. If only there were no other reason, but there are several 
others, on which we must reach agreement and come to an 
understanding between the countries of the world. It is for the very 
purpose of ensuring that there are laws to prevent this sort of 
situation from happening again in future.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	At the risk of being pessimistic, there will probably always be 
countries in the world that will refuse to sign treaties and ensure 
that there is the good understanding necessary for relations 
between countries, of course, but, above all, to ensure the safety of 
children here and elsewhere.
<P>
	In conclusion, we should all work together to put an end to this 
sort of problem, to resolve it to the extent that all governments are 
interested in doing so, and I hope that ambassadors, emissaries of 
other countries who may read the debates of this House, or even 
hear them live, will take note of what has been said by all members 
today.
<P>
	I think that it is the wish of all parliamentarians to put a stop to 
situations allowing certain stronger parents, in conditions that are 
advantageous to them, but not to their children, to carry out 
abductions like this, to cause the difficulties about which our 
colleague, the member for Laval East, spoke a few minutes ago, the 
cultural difficulties faced by Karim Noah, and by Tina Lynn 
Malette when she left South Peele, Ontario, Canada, to go and live 
in Tunisia, and God knows whether she is still there.
<P>
	A few years ago, my daughter had an opportunity to correspond 
with Tina Lynn, to send her a letter and a photo, although she had 
not seen her for perhaps ten years. Today, I no longer even know 
where Tina Lynn is.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity today to rise in 
support of the motion of the hon. member for Rosemont and also to 
raise another aspect of this question which was mentioned by the 
hon. member for Rosemont and the hon. member for Laval-Est.
<P>
	Aside from the human aspect, it is necessary to give hope for 
parents who experience this kind of situation. I just heard the 
government whip tell us about what happened to people he knew, 
and the situation has not been cleared up yet at this moment, so that 
the family, the mother still wonders whether she will ever see her 
daughter again.
<P>
	One would also expect, and this is not intended as a partisan 
remark, the government to do more than just being understanding. I 
heard what was said by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It 
is all very interesting to hear the Secretary of State say that he 
sympathizes with the family, that he understands the problem very 
well, and that he hopes we will find a solution will be found to the 
problem now facing Mrs. Tremblay, but I think they should also 
tell us-not only tell us but do something-they should also tell us 
what they are going to do in concrete terms to find a solution to this 
problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4973"> 4973 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have to say that this government's past record 
does not hold out much hope for Mrs. Tremblay and others in a 
similar situation. We saw this in the case of Trân Trieu Quân, 
which my colleague from Louis-Hébert has raised in this House 
on several occasions. As far as the government and the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs are concerned, the case is closed.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	As in the case before us today, no specific action was taken, so 
that Mr. Quân is still in prison in Vietnam. For the past three years, 
Mrs. Tremblay has taken legal action upon legal action to obtain 
the return of her child, of whom she has custody. Unfortunately, 
three years later we are asking the same questions and making the 
same requests.
<P>
	I do not want to waste your time, but I want to tell this 
government's representatives that they must approach the Egyptian 
government in order to find a definite solution. Of course we can 
deplore the fact that Egypt did not sign The Hague Convention 
concerning this type of situation, but we must find a concrete 
solution. The government must stop talking and start acting.
<P>
	I refuse to believe that the Minister of Foreign Affairs cannot 
intervene directly with the Egyptian government and make it listen 
to reason in this particular case.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT DEBATE</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, further to my question to the Minister of Justice I wish to 
emphasize my constituents' concern about safe homes and safe 
streets for themselves and their families. They have made this clear 
during two very well attended forums in my riding to discuss 
justice initiatives which gave my constituents an opportunity to 
voice their concerns, in particular with reference to the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	The justice minister's initiative about dangerous and long term 
offenders is of great interest to me and to the people in my riding 
who attended those sessions and others. Tough new restrictions on 
high risk violent offenders will make Canadian homes and streets 
safer. These new initiatives go hand in hand with a whole series of 
initiatives designed to improve the quality of life for Canadians.
<P>
	The list of these initiative is impressive: the creation of a 
national crime prevention council which works on strategies that 
address the underlying causes of crime; increased sentences for 
young offenders who commit violent crimes; the creation of a 
flagging system using the Canadian Police Information Centre to 
help provincial prosecutors identify high risk offenders; a new 
mandatory five-year sentence for those convicted of using violence 
to force children into prostitution; the classification as first degree 
any murder committed while stalking; increased sentences for 
those convicted of stalking; a specific outlawing of the practice of 
female genital mutilation.
<P>
	We have introduced child support guidelines to help protect 
children from financial hardship resulting from marital 
breakdowns. We have increased minimum sentences by 400 per 
cent for those who commit crimes using a firearm. We have 
classified smuggling of firearms as an enterprise crime with a 
sentence up to 10 years. We have introduced amendments that end 
self-induced intoxication as a defence against crimes of violence. 
We have provided the basis on which police can serve warrants on 
suspects to take samples for DNA testing. We have improved 
legislation with respect to proceeds of crime.
<P>
	I have reintroduced my private member's bill to establish a 
victim's bill of rights in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Added to this list are proposals to create a new category of long 
term offender. Long term offenders will include those convicted of 
sexual assault and other sexual offences. To better protect the 
community, offenders in this category will be subject to an 
additional period of supervision of up to 10 years after they have 
completed their parole and prison sentences.
<P>
	Further, specialized conditions can be added to ensure close 
supervision of the offender such as regular reporting to the 
assigned supervisor and mandatory participation in counselling, 
electronic monitoring and other rehabilitation programs.
<P>
	These are all good initiatives but once again, I say to the minister 
that it is essential that young offenders also be subject to the 
provisions and sanctions included in Bill C-55.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	It is my hope that the justice minister will take this view into 
account when proceeding with this much needed and important 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for his persistent and 
thoughtful efforts at improving and toughening the criminal law 
across the land and for making representations on behalf of his 
constituents to ensure that our streets and homes are safe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4974"> 4974 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-55 is explicitly and unapologetically aimed at high risk 
adult offenders with long histories of violent behaviour. The 
government has listened to a public demand for Criminal Code 
amendments that will effectively target sex offenders, particularly 
pedophiles who present an ongoing risk to the community. The 
two improvements that are being made by Bill C-55 are the new 
long term offender sentencing option along with the dangerous 
offender improvements to that designation as well.
<P>
	The concern with both these issues as with the long pattern of 
offending, unfortunately in both these categories pedophiles often 
have a very long track record of aberrant behaviour and conviction.
<P>
	In both these types of procedures, long term and repetitive 
behaviour is required in order to bring them into question. The 
question therefore arises, are young offenders likely to be a target 
group for both these types of sentences?
<P>
	It is possible, in answer to the hon. member's question, that 
young offenders who are transferred to adult court could be subject 
to these provisions. There is required to be a pattern of repetitive 
behaviour, a serious past record of violent offences for these types 
of designations to apply. It is possible that the new legislation 
would apply to young offenders.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his question and will take his 
representations to the minister.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question of September 24 was as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The French speaking residents of the village of Laurier do not have a facility to 
house the students of the Franco-Manitoban school division. In spite of its 
constitutional obligations, the provincial government has made no decision 
acceptable to the parents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the federal government take action to ensure that section 23, dealing with 
minority language educational rights, will be complied with?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister replied, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, to be sure the community of Laurier has good reasons to invoke 
section 23 of the charter, and I am convinced that the education minister will show 
her willingness to settle a situation which contravenes this section of the charter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From discussions I have had recently, I hear there is a possibility 
of this willingness, and I hope that this is so, for this situation has 
been talked about for a long time and ought to have been settled a 
long time ago.
<P>
	The question I raised is important, not only in itself, but also 
because of its far wider implications. We are still talking about 
services for minorities, in this case the francophone minority 
outside Quebec.
<P>
	We are still talking about the roadblocks faced by these 
minorities. Despite the protection provided them, the communities 
still have to fight for their fundamental rights, in this case the right 
to an education in French.
<P>
	Yes, the government has just signed an agreement, yesterday, 
aimed at funding minority language education, and I applaud this 
initiative. I am proud of it. But the parents to whom I referred, as 
far as I know, are still lacking facilities for their Franco-Manitoban 
school division.
<P>
	What I am demanding for Manitoba, and in all of Canada 
moreover, is that, when we are faced with such a situation, the 
entire country be considered, the entire Canadian population. What 
happens in Manitoba has an impact on the francophone in 
Newfoundland, the francophone as far away as British Columbia or 
the Northwest Territories, everywhere in the country. What we 
require is great willingness and open-mindedness from all.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, each time there is an altercation of this nature in 
the francophone community outside Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois 
and other separatist forces tend to use it to serve their own 
purposes.
<P>
	Does the federal government have a role to play in ensuring that 
section 23 of the Charter, which deals with the right to education in 
French, is 100 per cent respected in Manitoba and elsewhere? I 
believe that the answer to that is yes.
<P>
	I would add that I also believe that the government must provide 
the necessary financial support to these minorities, whether for 
education, for television, for radio-everything they require to 
improve their situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am quite familiar with my hon. colleague's concerns 
about French schooling in Laurier, Manitoba.
<P>
	It is essential that French-speaking children be provided with 
suitable accommodation and access to the necessary services to get 
a good education. Discussions were held between the 
Franco-Manitoban school division and the Turtle River school 
board to find a mutually acceptable solution for this year.
<P>
	The parties reached an agreement providing for portables to be 
installed on the grounds of the Laurier school and for francophone 
students to have access to the school's washrooms, gymnasium and 
library.
<P>
	All those concerned realize this is only a temporary solution. We 
urge the Manitoba Minister of Education to look into the case so 
she can respond to the needs of the francophone community in 
Laurier. We are convinced that the problem will be settled to the 
satisfaction of all concerned.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4975"> 4975 </A></B>
<P>
	I would point out that this government has made a firm 
commitment to official language communities and will continue 
to support them. We have an agreement with Manitoba,which 
provides for assistance in observing section 23 of the Charter and 
putting in place structures for school administration. We also have 
an agreement with the province for the provision of provincial 
services in French.
<P>
	The federal government also supports many projects which the 
community feels are important to its development. For instance, a 
federal contribution of $1.5 million was made towards the 
construction of le Centre du patrimoine franco-manitobain.
<P>
	We also concluded an agreement worth $10.2 million over a 
period of five years with the francophone community to help with 
its development.
<P>
	All these interventions reflect the federal government's firm 
commitment to a flourishing Franco-Manitoban community.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GASOLINEPRICING">GASOLINE PRICING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last spring gas prices increased 8 cents to 10 cents a litre across 
Canada without justification. When I called for action by the 
Liberal government to stop this gouging by their masters, the big 
multinational oil companies, the Liberals blamed the provincial 
governments which by the way have no jurisdiction to regulate 
nationally established pricing practices.
<P>
	NDP MPs organized a boycott of Imperial Oil for one week in 
May resulting in thousands of consumers joining the boycott and 
effectively driving down prices in Saskatchewan by about 4 cents a 
litre and in British Columbia between 2 cents and 3 cents a litre.
<P>
	Finally the Government of British Columbia launched an inquiry 
as did New Brunswick. In June the federal government, through the 
Bureau of Competition Policy, initiated a criminal investigation of 
the oil companies' gas pricing practices. The boycott was called off 
pending the outcome of the criminal investigation.
<P>
	During the course of these inquiries being announced, the oil 
companies dropped their prices to create the perception that there 
was some competition. Yet all companies dropped their prices at 
about the same time to the same level. In late August and early 
September prices went up again. In Saskatchewan they went up 3 
cents to 4 cents a litre.
<P>
	The reasons given by the oil companies were laughable. In the 
spring big oil said prices were up because of the expectation of Iraq 
oil coming to market. In the latest increase big oil said prices were 
going up because of the expectation that Iraq oil would not be 
coming on to the market. Then when people laughed at these 
stupid, unfounded bizarre explanations for Saskatchewan's 
increase, big oil said that the increase was due to local conditions.
<P>
	What are local conditions? According to Imperial Oil's own gas 
station managers, they were called by their head office in Calgary 
and instructed to increase their prices locally. That is what oil 
companies call local conditions.
<P>
	The real reason for the increase is clear. There is a big increase in 
spring which is seeding time in Saskatchewan, and a big increase in 
the fall which is harvest time in western Canada, in Saskatchewan. 
Gouge farmers early, gouge farmers often. That is the slogan of the 
oil companies when there is no choice but to buy fuel for the two 
crucial business cycles: seeding and harvest.
<P>
	These silly, stupid antics by the oil companies only hurt middle 
class working Canadians and business while increasing big oil's 
profits which leave Canada. Imperial oil this year took out $1 
billion Canadian by buying Exxon shares which were held by 
Imperial Oil. These are reasons enough not to just investigate gas 
pricing but to have an energy price review commission which 
would have oil companies justify their prices with accuracy and 
truth, not smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	As a result of this latest increase, Saskatchewan is paying 4 cents 
to 12 cents a litre more than other provinces. Quebec now is being 
charged 54.9 cents a litre; Ontario, 53.9 cents; Manitoba, 57.9 
cents; Alberta, 50.9 cents. When the tax differences are factored 
out, Saskatchewan is still paying 4 cents to 6 cents a litre too much. 
That is in a province where we produce, refine, process and export 
our gasoline.
<P>
	That is why I have asked the director of criminal matters in the 
Bureau of Competition Policy to focus its criminal investigation in 
Saskatchewan to ferret out the unfair gouging practices of the oil 
companies. I feel assured that the criminal investigation into the 
pricing practices of oil companies in Saskatchewan will be helpful 
in reducing the gouging which currently exists. Hopefully, it will 
call on the oil companies to account honestly for their actions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member is aware, on May 13, 1996 
the director of investigation and research commenced an inquiry 
under the Competition Act into allegations of conspiracy by 
gasoline producers and marketers. This inquiry was commenced 
after the initiation of a six resident application for an inquiry under 
the Competition Act by the member for Ottawa Centre. If evidence 
of a criminal offence is uncovered, I am sure appropriate measures 
will be taken by the director.
<P>
	Some people are suggesting that prices should be regulated. The 
authority to regulate gasoline prices falls within the jurisdiction of 
the provinces. It is not a federal matter. In the member's province 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4976"> 4976 </A></B>
<P>
of Saskatchewan it is for the NDP government to take action if it 
feels that gasoline prices should be regulated.
<P>
	As a matter of general principle, the best regulator of gasoline 
prices is a competitive market. Prices set by government usually 
result in higher prices to consumers. This is in addition to the cost 
that taxpayers must bear to set up and administer a regulatory 
regime. The decision in July 1991 by the province of Nova Scotia 
to discontinue its gasoline pricing regime reflected in part a 
recognition that such decisions should be left to the competitive 
market forces.
<P>
	Regulation would also remove the incentive for petroleum 
suppliers to be more efficient. Price controls weaken the stimulus 
for firms to either swiftly adapt themselves to change in demand or 
to develop more efficient methods of distribution. It is easier to ask 
the regulatory body to increase the controlled price than to attempt 
to lessen their operating costs.
<P>
	In conclusion, it remains my view that the best interests of 
Canadians will continue to be served if gasoline prices are set in the 
competitive marketplace. As I indicated at the outset, unlawful 
anti-competitive behaviour will be appropriately addressed under 
the Competition Act.
<P>
	Recently my colleague, the minister responsible for FORD-Q, 
discussed the issue of gasoline prices with his provincial and 
territorial counterparts.
<P>
