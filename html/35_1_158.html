<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, today is a rather special day in 
our Parliament. I want to explain how we are going to proceed.
<P>
	We will have statements by the leaders of various parties. 
Then we will have the introduction of our new members of 
Parliament who will be joining us today, following which will be 
statements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of all members of this House, I wish to extend 
a very warm welcome to the Leader of the Opposition. All 
members of this House and all Canadians salute the courage and 
determination shown by the Leader of the Opposition 
throughout his recent ordeal.
<P>
	I also wish to pay tribute to Mrs. Audrey Bouchard and her 
children for their support for him during this very difficult time, 
which certainly played a major part in helping the opposition 
leader recover so quickly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank all Canadians, despite the differences of 
opinion we might have, who have shown to the Leader of the 
Opposition their sympathy and moral support in praying for him 
to recover his health in as short a time as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since it is one of his fondest wishes, I would like to say to the 
Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of all members of this 
House: Welcome back to the shop.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of all Reform members, including myself, I 
wish to welcome back the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
	We parliamentarians are all professional politicians. 
Although, in the course of our public lives, we often express 
heartfelt and varied opinions on matters of public policy, we 
remain human beings united by our shared love of life and health 
and by our vulnerability to disease and tragedy.
<P>
	When the hon. member became ill, all members of this House 
shared a feeling of solidarity because of their common concern 
for their colleague.
<P>
	Those of us who believe that the ultimate secret of life and 
death rests in the hands of the Supreme Being prayed for his 
recovery.
<P>
	When we learned that the hon. member was out of danger at 
last, we shared feelings of relief and gratitude.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	It is a tribute to the hon. member's courage and determination 
that all members of the House put their differences aside and 
showed their solidarity through their concern for his recovery 
and well-being.
<P>
	I therefore would like to express these feelings today by 
welcoming the hon. member back to the House and wishing him 
excellent health in the future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
upon the return of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois to the House 
of Commons, I would like to say, on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party, that we are glad to see him back in good 
health.
<P>
	The news of the devastating disease that struck the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois came as a terrible shock. Beyond all our 
differences, compassion is the bond that unites us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to offer my best wishes to the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois and to his courageous family.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Welcome back, Lucien.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, these past two months have taught me something 
about this House and its members. They taught me that one can 
get homesick for this place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9940"> 9940 </A></B>
<P>
	I return here with feelings of gratitude, with pride and 
confidence. I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for your constant 
concern throughout this difficult time. I also wish to mention 
the courtesy and understanding shown by the Prime Minister. 
His heart is in the right place. I am deeply grateful to the 
ministers and to the other party leaders and members of all 
parties who supported me with their messages of 
encouragement and, in so doing, perpetuated a tradition of 
compassion that is a credit to this House. I applaud this ability 
to rise above the many differences we may have, even in the 
midst of a debate that is about the future of Canada, no less.
<P>
	Also, Mr. Speaker, it should come as no surprise to you that 
during the anxious days that brought me these expressions of 
sympathy, I felt very close to all of you.
<P>
	At this point I want to thank from the bottom of my heart my 
friends and colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois caucus. They 
behaved like a family that, when one of its members is hurt, 
summons the courage and dignity to carry on. I want to say how 
much I appreciate their wonderful solidarity and the tremendous 
job they have done during my absence.
<P>
	I am also deeply grateful for the thousands of expressions of 
encouragement I received from my fellow citizens. I must say I 
felt strengthened and comforted by their prayers and best 
wishes.
<P>
	My illness gave me first-hand knowledge of how our health 
care system works. I have the greatest admiration for and am 
deeply grateful to the doctors and other caregivers at the 
Saint-Luc Hospital in Montreal who saved my life and those at 
the rehabilitation institute in Montreal who helped me learn to 
walk again. Their dedication and competence have reinforced 
my commitment to protecting and improving our social 
programs.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	And so today we answer the call of duty and again take up the 
mandate that was given to us by the people.
<P>
	Yes, I have been looking forward to this moment since a 
certain day in December when technology and destiny combined 
to give me another chance. If the rallying cry of democracy is 
stand up and be counted, I respectfully ask to be counted.
<P>
	I have so much to remember, the sympathy and compassion 
from this and every other quarter, from Quebec and from the 
whole of Canada, from friends and strangers alike. In such 
circumstances who is really a stranger? I remember a yellow 
rose, a gracious gesture by a gracious lady.
<P>
	In our moments of anguish my family and I were not alone. 
This we shall never forget. Our gratitude goes to all of those who 
offered us their thoughts and their prayers.
<P>
	We come back to this Chamber with a renewed hunger for life. 
Time is so precious and there is so much left to do. And so we 
will concentrate on the more important things and give the best 
we can. Quebecers and Canadians alike can expect your faithful 
servant to remain true to his convictions and values, for our 
convictions may clash, as they do and will, but we share the 
same values of tolerance and respect for democracy; values that 
are tragically in short supply in a large part of the world. Where 
others fight with bullets, we fight with ballots, with arguments, 
with facts, with emotions and it should always be with respect 
for those who believe differently from us.
<P>
	Let us never forget our common humanity. Let us never 
disallow our common need to reach out to one another so that in 
our times of suffering, of solitude, even despair, we can take 
comfort in the knowledge that in spite of our differences we 
share the same compassion.
<P>
	There will no doubt be heated exchanges in the weeks and 
months ahead. At the end of the day we will remember the 
intensity of our debates and the passion that suffused them. It is 
my fondest hope that we will also recall that civility prevailed 
and that outside this Chamber men and women of every 
persuasion will proudly be able to say they profoundly disagreed 
but they were, all of them, men and women of peace and honour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also mentioned the word pride, and indeed I am proud to be 
standing here with you in this House, where we were sent by our 
fellow citizens.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard: </B>I also used the word confidence, and indeed I 
have the greatest confidence in the democratic and responsible 
resolution of the issues before us.
<P>
	I was able to observe how compassionate and generous our 
fellow citizens from English Canada can be. Who would not 
have been moved by their expressions of sympathy? I realize 
this does not mean English Canada will be converted to 
Quebec's sovereignist option, any more than I will renege on my 
political commitments. On the contrary, these past few weeks 
during which I had time to think about these issues have 
strengthened my sovereignist position. However, I am confident 
that sovereignists and federalists can discuss their options with 
dignity, without impugning each other's motives.
<P>
	In concluding, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me, 
with the consent of the government and the other parties, these 
few minutes to address the House. However, after expressing 
these worthy sentiments, we must go back to the cut and thrust 
of parliamentary debate. In fact, I was a little worried earlier 
that the Prime Minister's kind words would have a disarming 
effect on me. I am aware that I will have to revert to a more 
robust approach in my first questions to the Prime Minister later 
on.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to greet Lucien Bouchard on his return. We are delighted to 
have him in our midst again, pleased to see that he has pulled 
through his terrible ordeal and is resuming his place in the 
House of Commons. The Leader of the Opposition knows only 
too well that nothing is certain in this life. And yet he maintains 
that the referendum should not be launched unless the 
sovereignist option is sure to win. This, he says, is in the interest 
of Quebecers.
<P>
	It is indeed in the interest of the entire country that a 
referendum be held, and as soon as possible, not to see one side 
or the other win, but instead to learn the position of Quebecers 
and resolve the issue once and for all. That is democracy. 
Anything else is shameful manipulation. Quebecers deserve 
better than that after all.
<P>
	For my part, I say yes to one clear question. I say yes to a 
strong Quebec, I say yes to a unified Canada.

<P>
	Yesterday, the Quebec Federation of Labour, which has some 
450,000 members, adopted a manifesto and an action plan to 
mobilize workers in favour of Quebec's sovereignty. I had the 
honour of addressing the 1,600 shop stewards present at this 
special assembly.
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois would like to pay tribute 
to Bob White, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, who 
spoke in favour of the democratic right of Quebecers to 
self-determination. He stressed that a yes in the referendum 
should be respected by the rest of Canada.
<P>
	We would like to congratulate the Quebec Federation of 
Labour for its commitment at this turning point in the history of 
the Quebec nation.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian Restaurant and Food Services Association has printed 
more than 10,000 neon yellow cards which make the important 
point that when taxes go up employment goes down.
<P>
	The restaurant and food services industry employs more than 
667,000 people in Canada. They know firsthand the devastating 
effect taxes can have on their businesses and jobs in Canada.
<P>
	The last time the government made a tax grab with the GST 
the industry lost 46,000 jobs almost overnight. An Ernst &amp; 
Young report concluded that two out of every three jobs lost 
were directly as a result of the new tax.
<P>
	The restaurant and food services sector is a huge employer of 
students, recent immigrants and single mothers. It has been 
estimated that 30 per cent of those Canadians working today had 
their first experience in the workforce in food service. It is also 
an industry that depends on disposable income and is one of 
Canada's most labour intensive.
<P>
	If taxes go up employment will go down. It is that simple. 
Taxes kill jobs.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on budget day Canadians will be preparing themselves for 
another tax increase on gasoline prices.
<P>
	The Liberal government will take the responsibility of 
justifying these high taxes to Canadians. However consumers 
have already had to deal with many increases in gas prices when 
oil companies hiked the prices at the pumps for no reason at all. 
These increases are invisible taxes on consumers by the 
multinational oil companies and have not been justified.
<P>
	The Liberal government not only condones this price gouging 
but encourages it. In a recent report the Bureau of Competition 
Policy has said that oil companies can charge whatever they 
want for gasoline.
<P>
	Canadians need an energy pricing review commission with 
the power to investigate gas price increases and when 
unjustified roll them back. I challenge the Liberal government 
in the upcoming budget to get out of bed with the oil companies 
and give consumers a fair deal by immediately setting up an 
energy price review commission.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
remind members of the House that February is Heart Month.
<P>
	Heart disease and stroke are the number one killers in Canada 
of both men and women and together are responsible for the loss 
of 75,000 Canadian lives each year. In fact 40 per cent of all 
deaths in the country are due to cardiovascular disease.
<P>
	The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada tells us that the 
risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high 
blood cholesterol, smoking and physical inactivity. The 
foundation strives to educate Canadians about these risk facts 
and plays an important role in the fight against heart disease.
<P>
	During the month of February more than 100,000 volunteers 
will be canvassing in our communities to raise public awareness 
and funds for research and education.
<P>
	Please join me in saluting the Heart and Stroke Foundation 
and its many volunteers for their excellent work. So, when they 
come knocking on your door, have a heart.

	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to bring good news from the port of Halifax. In 
1994 revenues of the port of Halifax were up 4.7 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	There is more good news. There was an increase of 23 per cent 
in container traffic in the fourth quarter of last year. Sixteen 
hundred vessels called at Halifax last year. That was a big 
increase. It included 39 cruise vessels bringing 38,000 tourists 
to Halifax, the home of this year's G-7 and was a 22 per cent rise 
over 1993.
<P>
	The future is bright for the port of Halifax. Officials there 
predict a 15 per cent to 25 per cent increase in container business 
this year.
<P>
	The port of Halifax is the key to economic recovery in this 
area. It provides 2,500 direct and 4,500 indirect jobs to Halifax.
<P>
	I am sure that members of the House will join me in 
commending the port of Halifax on a very successful year.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in the House today to offer my firm support to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans in his efforts to conserve Greenland 
halibut and turbot.
<P>
	The European Union has launched a formal objection to the 
quota decision of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization. It was the European Union's use of this objection 
procedure in the late 1980s that led to the moratoria on flatfish 
and cod on the tail of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.
<P>
	Even as scientific findings showed evidence of stock decline, 
the Spanish ignored all warnings and actually increased their 
fishing efforts.
<P>
	The NAFO decision is the result of a vote by the world's major 
fishing nations: Japan, Russia, Norway, Iceland, Cuba and 
Canada. Its findings are based on conservation, science and 
traditional shares.
<P>
	It is irresponsible for the European Union to play by the rules 
only when the rules are in its own favour. We cannot allow 
further destruction of Canada's fisheries resources while 
communities such as those in my riding of St. John's West are 
suffering economic devastation in the name of conservation.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the CBC's English network aired some deeply 
disturbing footage of the riot squad in action last April at the 
Kingston Prison for Women. The humiliation the six female 
inmates were subjected to at the hands of the male emergency 
response team raises some serious questions.
<P>
	In his report yesterday, the correctional investigator 
denounced the use of excessive force against inmates. The same 
report completely contradicts the findings of the internal 
inquiry by correctional services, which condoned the acts of the 
emergency response team through its complacency, to the 
disgust of the Elizabeth Fry Society.
<P>
	The Solicitor General must assure this House that the director 
at the prison for women who was in charge of the internal 
inquiry will be suspended immediately for having hidden the 
truth.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a strike 
or a lockout is looming for the nation's railways. The 
negotiating parties have had 13 months to reach a collective 
agreement on their own and they have failed.
<P>
	If such a strike or lockout were to occur, the country's 
transportation network would grind to a halt within days. It 
would devastate shippers of coal, potash and newsprint, 
paralyse the auto industry and, as usual, leave western grain 
farmers footing the bill for somebody else's irresponsibility.
<P>
	The cost of such a strike to our economy is just too high and 
the government knows this. That is why for the 14th time in the 
last 29 years we will have no choice but to suspend the rules of 
the House in order to pass emergency back to work legislation. If 
and when this happens it will be the second time in two years. I 
hope we have not already forgotten the Vancouver port strike 
experience.
<P>
	My private member's bill, Bill C-262, offers a permanent 
solution to this chronic problem. Let us pass Bill C-262 so that 
we do not find ourselves in the same position again this year.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville,

institutions raised their lending rates in reaction to the Bank of 
Canada's rate hike yesterday to a one year high of 8.38 per cent.
<P>
	Just as last week when Moody's Investors Service put 
Canada's AAA domestic bond rating on a credit watch, now our 
own institutions have shown a complete lack of understanding 
of our deficit problem. It is extremely shocking and saddening 
when our national institutions do not have the patience and 
presence of mind to wait for the budget.
<P>
	Maybe the finance minister will slash the budget drastically 
to control the deficit. I fail to understand why the bogeyman of 
inflation created by the previous government is being 
resurrected once again.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	With inflation presently running low, there is no need for 
higher interest rates. The increased rates will hamper job 
creation and hurt small businesses, as it will thousands of 
Canadians who have to renew their mortgages this year.
<P>
	It is time for the Bank of Canada to initiate systems policies-

<P>
	This appalling level of truck safety poses a serious threat to

report that 20 Canadian millionaires had paid less than $100 
each in income tax in 1991.
<P>
	I believe that the number has increased each year since. Each 
and every Canadian has to pay his or her fair share of taxes. How 
can we as members of Parliament tell our constituents that they 
must pay their income taxes when they see wealthy Canadians 
taking advantage of tax loopholes?
<P>
	If we are to fight the deficit on all fronts, I hope the Minister

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, since the federal-provincial finance ministers' 
conference, we know that Ottawa will make drastic cuts in 
transfer payments to the provinces while deferring the impact of 
these cuts until next year. The federal government is trying to 
pass off as renewed federalism what will amount in fact to 
offloading its financial responsibilities.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Are we to understand 
that his government chose deliberately to defer the substantial 
cuts in transfer payments until after the Quebec referendum in 
order to hide from Quebecers, on the eve of the referendum, the 
cost of the federal government's financial withdrawal from 
education and health? In other words, that the federal 
government is holding back but will hit as soon as the 
referendum is over?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to inform the Leader of the Opposition that, 
when we formed the government last year, we agreed with 
theprovinces that we would not make cuts without giving them 
prior notice. Under the previous government, the minister would 
get up on the day of the  budget and announce the cuts to come 
into effect the following day. We said and, furthermore we 
promised in the red book that this brutal approach would not be 
repeated.
<P>
	Therefore, if the Minister of Finance must cut transfers to the 
provinces, we will keep our promise and give the provinces fair 
notice before taking action.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, will the Prime Minister not admit that the block 
funding formula contemplated by his government, that is, 
consolidating all federal contributions to health and education 
programs into a single payment, is not a transfer of jurisdiction 
but a transfer of costs to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance must assume his 
responsibilities, and we intend to make substantial cuts in all 
public administration sectors. It is not a matter of punishing 
anyone. On the contrary, we want to treat everyone equally. In 
any case, we do not know if there will be a referendum in 1995. I 
hope that the Leader of the Opposition can come to an agreement 
with Mr. Parizeau. After the date of the referendum is 
announced, you will know whether or not we acted with the 
referendum in mind.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, how can the Prime Minister claim to offer flexible 
federalism when, in fact, while continuing to withdraw financial 
support for health and education programs, he tries to put the 
provinces in a straitjacket by forcing them to apply national 
standards to services that the federal government will stop 
funding?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we passed the national health legislation 
establishing medicare for all Canadians, it was approved by 
everybody. Everybody agreed.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	We do not have control over its administration. It is a 
provincial matter. When the programs were established we said 
we would help the provinces for a number of years but that once 
the programs were well established we might withdraw. That 
was the policy discussed at that time.
<P>
	As far as Canada's national health system is concerned, it is 
very important that we keep it because Canada has the best 
system. In fact a few minutes ago the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition referred to the very good health system that Canada 
has.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="OVERLAPANDDUPLICATION">OVERLAP AND DUPLICATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, things 
are getting clearer and clearer. Last week, in this House, the 
Prime Minister presented his vision of a federal Canada, for the 
first time.
<P>
	He said, in talking about the elimination of duplication, and I 
quote: ``Duplication comes from Quebec deciding to have its 
own ministry of revenue collect personal income tax, unlike the 
other provinces. . . Duplication often comes from the other 
side''.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Are we to understand 
from the revealing example he chose to give us that, in his vision 
of federalism, Quebec would be just like the other provinces and 
that, for example, he wants to take over from Quebec in 
collecting personal income tax?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out to the hon. member that, on the 
contrary, we gave the province the responsibility of collecting 
the federal sales tax, the GST. Why could the provincial 
government not do the same for the federal government with 
regard to income tax?
<P>
	As regards income tax, in the case of Ontario, only one line 
has been added to the tax return, and there is no provincial tax 
inspector for Ontario taxpayers. If Quebec wants to continue to 
have two systems, that is fine with me. I am making them an 
offer to help them save money. The minister responsible for 
harmonizing programs in Canada is successfully reaching 
agreements with the provinces in many areas. The only province 
that is not interested in discussing the elimination of duplication 
is the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister not agree that his so called plan for 
decentralization to the provinces is not eliminating any 
duplication, since the federal government never intended 
withdrawing from areas of provincial jurisdiction, and, in each 
province, there will always be two departments of health and 
two departments of human resources all paid for by taxpayers' 
money?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are making offers to the provinces right now. I was 
speaking with the Premier of British Columbia a few minutes 
ago. We were discussing the possibility of harmonizing certain 
existing programs.
<P>
	The other provinces are co-operating in trying to eliminate 
duplication. What is unfortunate is that only Quebec 
systematically wants to maintain duplication.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Finance attacked Reform's 
plan to balance the budget in three years.
<P>
	The minister made unfounded comments about its impacts in 
a futile attempt to divert public attention away from the 
shortcomings of his own budget targets. Under the Liberal fiscal 
plan, over $100 billion will be added to the federal debt. Interest 
payments will amount to about one-third of the federal budget 
by the end of this Parliament.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister explain to seniors and to other 
Canadians what paying $50 billion a year in interest will do to 
the social programs on which they depend?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased the leader of the third party 
mentioned old age pensioners. His document said he wanted to 
cut $3 billion from that program. Reform has to realize that new 
people come on the payroll every year because other people 
reach the age of 65. The leader of the Reform Party cannot stop 
that.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	It costs almost $1 billion more every year. If he wants to cut 
$3 billion from what we have today, he will have to exclude the 
people who come on the payroll in the next two years. He will 
have to pay them another $2 billion or cut another $2 billion. 
The hon. member made a little mistake in one day of $2 billion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister avoids the hard question of how the 
government is going to live paying $50 billion a year in interest. 
At the end of the day under the federal Liberal plan, the deficit 
will still be $25 billion a year, the debt will be over $600 billion 
and the government will have even less money than it has today 
to fund social programs.
<P>
	Why does the government not screw up its courage and simply 
tell Canadians that the real threat to social programs is its 
inability to control the deficit and the debt?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is the first time in a long time, and I have a lot of 
witnesses on this side of the House, that a government has 
presented a budget, as we did last February, and has met every 
target it set.
<P>
	It is very easy to make promises you know you cannot keep. 
When I saw the budget prepared by the Reform Party this week, 
somebody said that it was back to the future. It has nothing to do 
with the reality of today. On the old age pension program alone, 
the Reform Party made a mistake of $2 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9947"> 9947 </A></B>
<P>
	We will meet our target. We will be at 3 per cent of GDP next 
year. It is the first time a government in Canada has met its 
target and we will meet it. Do not worry about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has a red book that is symbolic of the 
red ink that flows from its policies.
<P>
	Last fall the finance minister presented a grey book which is 
symbolic of these grey compromises between spending cuts and 
tax increases. Now it is abundantly clear that the government 
lacks what it takes to balance a budget, just like Mulroney and 
Wilson in 1984.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that the colour scheme for 
the budget that his minister will deliver next Monday will be 
pale yellow?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member only has to wait until Monday. I hope 
he will support all the cuts we will be proposing.
<P>
	I would like to have his commitment right now that his party 
will support all the cuts we will make. It would be easy because 
they would turn around and say: ``You should not do this or 
that''. It is going to be a tough budget. I hope Reform Party 
members will be able to do in this House what they love to say 
outside it.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government plans to cut 45,000 employees from the 
federal public service over three years and, to this end, intends 
to move unilaterally to introduce legislation eliminating job 
security for public servants.
<P>
	Can the minister responsible for the public service explain 
why his government has chosen to push aside the proposals 
made by the largest union representing nearly 70 per cent of 
federal public servants, without having first exhausted every 
possible alternative through free collective bargaining?
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board has done excellent 
work on this issue. For weeks now, there have been discussions 
with every union affected. Sixteen unions out of 17 have found 
these proposals reasonable. And even in the union which 
opposes them, we are told opinion is greatly divided. People 
understand very well that what the President of the Treasury 
Board has offered as a solution is totally reasonable and logical, 
given the difficult circumstances facing the government at this 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
guarantee can the minister give people that laying off thousands 
of public servants will not as in the past give rise to a substantial 
increase in contracting-out which does not necessarily allow for 
savings but which is highly conducive to government 
patronage?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives us no joy to be downsizing the public service. 
However, as a result of the programs and services that we must 
cut in order to meet our deficit reduction targets, there are 
people we will have to ask to leave.
<P>
	We will give them every opportunity to find other jobs within 
the public service before they are put on layoff status. Certainly 
in terms of contracting out, I can assure the hon. member that it 
and temporary help and other means will be explored as a way of 
keeping our employees who want to stay before we allow for 
additional contracting out and other provisions.
<P>
	We value the public service. We value the kind of service that 
is provided to Canadians by the people we employ.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if yesterday's announcement of public service layoffs was 
designed to quell fears and rumours, it was a dismal failure. 
Today the government has rubbed salt in the wounds of the 
public service by increasing the size of the cabinet just one day 
after announcing 45,000 job cuts in the public service.
<P>
	The Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal put 
together a top level team of managers to tell him where to make 
cuts in the public service. Did he also put together a team of 
frontline workers to tell him where to make appropriate cuts in 
management?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that members of the third party speak 
from both sides of their mouths. On the one hand they ask us to 
reduce the expenditures of government; on the other hand they 
complain when we do exactly that by reducing the size of the 
public service.
<P>
	What we have done with the public service is in fact the best 
treatment that could be given. We have introduced the 
possibility for them to have either early retirement or cash outs. 
We have made it much easier for civil servants who cannot be 
employed any more to leave the public service in a humane way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously we have a problem with a growing cabinet in a high 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9948"> 9948 </A></B>
<P>
level of top heavy government at a time when it is making cuts at 
the bottom and in the front lines.
<P>
	For instance 20 per cent of all public servants, that is 48,000 
people, make more than $50,000 a year. There are 48,000 
managers looking over the shoulders of the people who actually 
deliver the services.
<P>
	Will the government tell us the proportion of management 
versus frontline cutbacks that we can see in this upcoming 
budget so that we can make sure that we are hammering the 
management, not just gutting the frontline services to 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the one addition to this side of the House is worth all of 
the ones and more on that side of the House.
<P>
	With respect to the downsizing we are going to be carefully 
monitoring the situation at the different levels. If there is any 
disproportionate amount at any given level, then certainly we 
will take corrective action. We are focusing on programs and 
services, not on people. As a consequence, people at all levels 
will be part of the downsizing.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last week in the House, the Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec confirmed that his strategy for regional 
development would be based on providing assistance to small 
business. After cutting the budget of the Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec, the minister indicated that the 
new approach to helping small business would consist in 
providing consulting services.
<P>
	Since the FORD-Q no longer has a budget for providing 
financial assistance to small business, will the Prime Minister 
admit that the Department of Industry, in other words, the 
minister responsible for regional economic development in 
Ontario, will now be responsible for the federal strategy for 
regional development in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister responsible for regional development in 
Quebec is the Minister of Finance. Obviously, the Minister of 
Finance has a very good working relationship with the Minister 
of Industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
would the Prime Minister agree that, as far as regional 
development is concerned, the FORD-Q, which no longer has a 
budget, has become an empty shell and will only be used to 
promote the visibility of the federal government in the regions 
and to set national standards for regional development, while 
ignoring the priorities of the Quebec government in this respect?

question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Last Monday's federal-provincial meeting on greenhouse 
gases ended in a resounding failure. Despite the commitments it 
made at the Rio summit in 1992 and despite the electoral 
promises in the red book, Canada is stating openly that it cannot 
do its part in the worldwide effort to reduce greenhouse gases.
<P>
	While Quebec has already achieved its objectives of 
stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions, how does the minister 
justify Canada's preparing to default on its international 
commitments because of a lack of political will on the part of the 
federal government and of the rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I repeat what I said 
last week. Quebec has done exactly what the other provinces 
have done. Through its minister of the environment, Quebec 
promised, at our meeting in Toronto, that it would have a 
Cabinet meeting in order to get an action plan to us by March.
<P>
	I have not seen this action plan, because none has been 
forthcoming. I am waiting for Quebec to let us know its 
stabilization objectives. The government of Canada has its own 
areas of jurisdiction, and I can assure you that we will attain and 
exceed the objectives of our action plan.
<P>
	Here is where we have problems. There are a number of 
jurisdictions we cannot encroach on. We cannot force a 
provincial government, like the government of Alberta, for 
example, to do more than it wants to.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	We are, however, doing our part and are patiently awaiting 
Quebec's action plan, which the government has not yet 
disclosed, and Cabinet not yet approved, according to the press 
release issued this week by Mr. Brassard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would remind the Minister of the Environment that Quebec has 
done its homework. So you do yours.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of 
the Environment. Rather than give in to pressure from the oil 
industry lobby, would she perhaps agree to follow Quebec's 
example and ensure that the rest of Canada honours its 
international obligations in fighting the greenhouse effect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member may 
not have received the Parti Quebecois' press release. I will read 
it to her: ``Issued in Quebec City at 2.42 p.m. on February 20, 
Quebec's plan of action will soon be submitted to Cabinet for 
approval''. It has not been approved yet, and we are impatiently 
waiting for it, because it is not only a question of stabilization,

think we need to do the review in a sensible and sensitive way. I 
do not think anybody should rush irresponsibly into this subject

	This year Canada's jurisdictional rights over Icelandic 
scallop is acknowledged by the United States, not challenged. 
This year we have completed the negotiation of a successful 
agreement governing the transit of Yukon salmon as a 
consequence of aggressive action last year. This year we are

Mr. Speaker, in my capacity as spokesperson for the Board of

the board has taken a decision to provide-I know it is a limited 
quantity-10 copies of the bill kit to all members of Parliament.
<P>
	I must as well inform the House that bill kits are worth 
approximately $20 each. Even that small quantity, as the House 
appreciates, results in a considerable expenditure that could 
range in the area of $400 per member of Parliament. Therefore it 
is a very large expenditure for the House.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally, it is my understanding that the Library of Parliament 
traditionally publishes notes. These notes are available to 
members of Parliament. They are referred to as bill summaries, 
and when the summaries are prepared they can be photocopied 
by members. That is not expensive and they can be presented to 
all and sundry.

a protest on behalf of many members of the House.
<P>

opportunity to read the words that are contained in a bill before 
the House. I am not asking for the bill kits. I am asking for the 
opportunity to go to the printing office of the House of 
Commons to have a number of copies printed. This would not be 
the $22 that the board has determined this would cost.
<P>
	It is imperative that all Canadians have access to the bills of 
the House. As a member of Parliament, I would like to supply 
my constituents with a bill presented in this Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, I should have 
mentioned that members can order extra copies through their 
operational budgets. I recognize this has limitations because it 
involves expenditures for each member of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I think the matter is quite 
clear to all members of the House.
<P>
	I thank the hon. government whip for responding and I thank 
the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake for 
bringing the issue back to the House following his original 
intervention some days ago.
<P>
	At this point I would indicate to the House that if the member 
for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake wishes to choose another 
route to continue to raise this issue, I am  sure as a well 
experienced parliamentarian he will find that mechanism and 
that route. For the time being the matter is deemed closed.

	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-307, an act to amend the Criminal Code and 
the Copyright Act (profit from authorship respecting a crime).
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, my bill would amend the Criminal Code 
and the Copyright Act to prohibit a criminal from profiting by 
selling, authorizing or authoring the story of a crime.
<P>
	If a person is convicted of an indictable offence under the 
Criminal Code, any moneys he or she may have made or may 
make in the future from the creation of a work based on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9954"> 9954 </A></B>
<P>
crime would be deemed proceeds of crime subject to seizure by 
the crown.
<P>
	Included would be moneys paid to the convicted person for 
the authorship of books, articles, screen plays, recordings, et 
cetera. Also covered would be moneys paid for the criminal's 
contribution to the creation of such a work, for example, getting 
paid to tell a story to a news program or the joint authorship of a 
book.
<P>
	The bill further amends the Copyright Act to provide that the 
copyright in any work principally based on the crime where the 
work is created, prepared or published by or in collaboration 
with the convicted person becomes the property of the crown.
<P>
	In countries that have signed the Berne convention on 
copyright, Canada could enforce its copyright ownership of the 
work, including preventing the sale and other distribution of the 
work and applying to seize any profits, the principle being a 
criminal should not receive a dime for committing a crime.

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-308, an act to provide the resumption of 
production activities at ADM Agri-Industries Ltd.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill entitled 
``an act to provide the resumption of production activities at 
ADM Agri-Industries Ltd''. The objective of this bill is to 
resolve the labour conflict between ADM, formerly Ogilvie 
Flour Mills Ltd., and the national union of employees of Ogilvie 
Flour Mills Ltd.
<P>
	The company and the union are presently engaged in 
bargaining to renew the collective agreement which expired on 
January 31, 1992 and applies to some 150 employees of the 
milling industry. Realizing that no agreement could be reached 
with the help of the arbitrator appointed by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, the parties faced a strike or 
lockout.
<P>
	Union members began the strike on June 6, 1994. A federal 
mediator met with the parties on several occasions to help them 
but, unfortunately, little progress was made. During that time, 
the company continued operating using replacement workers to 
carry out the work of bargaining unit members.
<P>
	In tabling this bill today, I would like to put an end to this 
dispute and conflict.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I placed Question No. 93 on the Order Paper on October 19. It 
should not be so difficult to come up with a response since the 
question was tabled on October 19, over four months ago. 
Normally, as you know, such questions must be answered within 
45 days. Despite what the hon. member said, I know full well 
that this is not a complicated question. The data requested is 
well documented.
<P>
	Knowing the minister responsible for this department, I am 
telling you, Mr. Speaker, that the delay in answering this 
<P>

question is part of the minister's strategy of silence. They are 
interfering with access to information and making it 
increasingly difficult. That was my experience with this 
minister and I am convinced-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I do not think this 
is a point of order as such.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to the hon. 
member-I think it was on Monday and also last Friday- the 
government considered his representations. We are in the 
process of drafting a response to this question. I am certain that 
there are people now working on the response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> I am not so sure about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes, I am sure, because I made inquiries 
regarding this question on Monday before the hon. member 
raised his point of order, and I am certain that we will soon have 
a response for the hon. member, which I will table here in this 
House.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	Once again, I thank the hon. member for raising this issue ad 
nauseam. I am delighted he is able to pursue it in this way. I look 
forward to having the response soon, as I indicated the other day.
<P>
	I request that all questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Shall the questions be 
allowed to stand?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from February 20 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act 
and the Criminal Code, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-37, which 
concerns young offenders, because this is a very important and 
very revealing bill. If we look at all the aspects of this bill, 
basically, it contains all the elements of a debate on social 
values.
<P>
	As you know, Quebec is involved in a process that is leading 
up to sovereignty, and often people wonder why we in Quebec 
are doing this. People wonder what kind of society we want in 
Quebec. Well, this is a good example of the kind of legislation 
Quebec wants to avoid, the kind of legislation that does not 
reflect tendencies in Quebec at all. As long as Quebec remains in 
Canada, however, we will never be able to introduce legislation 
that, in my opinion, would be fairer and more equitable than Bill 
C-37.
<P>
	When I say this could develop into a debate on social values, I 
mean that, when we talk about young offenders, we talk about 
young people, we talk about young people in our society and we 
also talk about violence. These are two subjects that go to the 
very heart of a society and reflect what is wrong with society. 
When young people commit violent crimes or commit suicide or 
are extreme in the way they act, it is because there is something 
very wrong with society.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	It is symptomatic and also reflects all the problems besetting 
society. We cannot consider the issue of young offenders in 
isolation. We cannot isolate young people's problems as we 
would do in the case of transportation or more technical 
problems. We are talking strictly about the human, fundamental 
values in society. We cannot isolate this from the fact that we 
have poverty and unemployment, for instance, some of the 
factors by which society is defined. We cannot consider the 
problem in isolation. We cannot find the cause because there is 
no single cause.
<P>
	An issue like that of young offenders must be approached with 
an open mind. We must consider what society is to us as well as 
our attitude to society and our attitude to justice within that 
society. We cannot take a short term view of this issue.
<P>
	If we are to deal with the question of young offenders, we 
must have a comprehensive vision of society, a long term vision. 
Young offenders are a very serious problem that goes to the very 
heart of our society.
<P>
	Once Quebec is sovereign, it will be a small and, I think, well 
integrated society. I think it will be able to come up with a real 
solution. In fact, the current legislation in Quebec that deals 
with young offenders is more advanced than what is being 
proposed by the federal government. I have the impression that a 
sovereign Quebec will be able to pursue this approach, to deal 
with the problem as we will deal with other problems, and that it 
will have a more enlightened sense of justice than what we see in 
Bill C-37.
<P>
	I would say that, as long as Quebec is a part of Canada, we will 
never find a constructive way to deal with the problem of young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9960"> 9960 </A></B>
<P>
offenders, because Bill C-37 is an attempt to respond to the 
demands of people from the West, people who have a different 
perspective and take a different approach to the problem.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is an attempt to respond to their concerns and their 
way of dealing with the problem. And consequently, this creates 
a problem for Quebec. It prevents us from going ahead with our 
own strategy.
<P>
	As long as Quebec stays in Canada, there will be a 
jurisdictional tug of war, on this issue as on many others, 
because of the difference in vision. In this case, there is a very 
obvious difference between Western Canada and Quebec. Our 
two approaches are diametrically opposed.
<P>
	This bill, which is an attempt to strike a balance, to respond to 
the demands of the West, will prevent the Quebec system from 
going ahead. It will be a waste of time and effort, it will not solve 
the problem, as I have been trying to explain, and will provide 
no remedy at all for the problem of young offenders. It is an 
exercise in futility and a waste of money, time and effort. I do 
not see anything constructive in Bill C-37.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In fact, the bill itself focuses particularly on young people 16 
and 17 years of age, who are charged with serious crimes 
involving violence, such as murder. It would mean that these 
young people could be brought before adult courts. They can be 
sent to youth courts, but with this bill, they could be tried in 
adult courts.
<P>
	If young people are tried in youth courts, the sentences will be 
harsher. The maximum sentence for murder will increase from 
five to ten years. The qualifying periods for parole will increase, 
parole will be harder to obtain, and the records of young 
offenders will be retained longer.
<P>
	In short, this bill imposes stiffer sentences on young persons, 
particularly those who are 16 and 17 years of age. This is the 
spirit of this bill: impose harsher sentences on young offenders. 
But violence among young people is the work of a few. They do 
not represent a particular trend in society. They represent a very 
small proportion of young people-a few dozen.
<P>
	This bill deals with a few exceptional cases, which do not 
represent any sort of trend in society. There is no distressing 
increase in violence by 16 and 17 year olds. The figures over 
some 15 years in this area reveal no sort of increase.
<P>
	Until 1992, there was a five per cent increase in crimes 
involving young persons, but since then, the figure has been 
more like 2 per cent. This is the general crime rate among young 
people. This increase compared with the increase in population 
reveals no startling change.
<P>
	All of the experts agree that the rate of serious crimes among 
young people, such as murder, manslaughter, aggravated 
assault, has remained stable or has decreased  in the past decade. 
This is what the statistics tell us about the number of violent 
crimes among young people.
<P>
	We cannot even say that violent crime has increased among 
young people, but we can say that there have been a few cases, 
the exception. For example, the two boys in England who killed 
a child of five or six, or other cases we can cite as examples of 
sensationalism, which were given considerable attention on 
television and in the newspapers.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is in response to this sort of sensationalism or this 
perception. We are not dealing with a critical problem for 
society. There is no crisis; violence is not really on the rise 
among young people. This bill is trying to deal with very 
exceptional cases.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	That is the nature of the problem with this bill. I would like 
now to address the consequences for young persons of calling 
for harsher sentences at this time. The consequences are, to be 
sure, the same as for older criminals, that is people in adult 
penitentiaries. The consequences are the same and every study 
by every expert confirms unequivocally that the sentence 
offenders receive has no influence whatsoever on the crime rate.
<P>
	Imposing sentences of 10, 15 or 20 years will not reduce 
crime. Studies show this clearly. Moreover, in looking at the 
situation, it seems that the more sentences are increased, the 
greater the number of offenders. Go visit Canadian 
penitentiaries. I have had the opportunity to visit every 
penitentiary in Canada, from Dorchester to the B.C. maximum 
security prison, including the Saskatchewan maximum security 
institution. I worked for the Canadian Penitentiary Service and 
visited all Canadian penitentiaries and, looking at what goes on 
inside them. Considering the studies and statistics, one realizes 
that, once a person is sent to a Canadian federal penitentiary, 
there is a four in five chance that he will return a second time and 
the odds increase.
<P>
	Canadian penitentiaries are training grounds for criminals, 
quite simply, and this is very easy to understand. If you go to 
Dorchester or any other prison, you will see how the law of 
violence rules these places. When they get out, people are 
already trained for violence, especially in Canadian 
penitentiaries as they were in my day, where there was no 
training of any kind, no rehabilitation or, if there was any, they 
were silly things such as programs to make mail bags.
<P>
	Yes, there were a few little programs here and there, for 
training, education, but generally speaking there was no 
training, no rehabilitation program whatsoever. Prisoners were 
left to their own devices and when released from prison, the 
situation was clearly disastrous. There are organizations which 
try to help prisoners after their release, such as the Elizabeth Fry 
Society for women, and there is also an organization which tries 
to help released prisoners, I forget the name, but there is very, 
very little help.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9961"> 9961 </A></B>
<P>
	In those days, the system was such that you could predict the 
number of criminals society would produce. In the penitentiary 
system, prison construction plans were drawn up for five or ten 
years down the road. In fact, when I was there, my job was to 
try to find cities where prisons could be built. The penitentiary 
system was a real industry within the government.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	We therefore could predict when we could fill them. 
Obviously, that could serve some political purpose. In fact, 
some politicians thought that it was desirable to have a 
penitentiary in their riding because it created jobs.
<P>
	We can agree that imposing longer and heavier prison 
sentences is not the solution. Nobody thinks that this is the way 
to help people who have committed serious crimes, especially 
young offenders. There is hope in setting up rehabilitation and 
training programs for young people. At least they can be 
rehabilitated. It is not by imposing heavier sentences that we can 
hope to rehabilitate offenders.
<P>
	From the way this bill is taking shape, it seems that we will be 
able to send 16 and 17 year olds to penitentiaries. The 27-year 
olds leaving jail after 10-year prison terms will be hardened 
criminals. This resolves nothing.
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-37 has sprung from a thirst for revenge. It was 
also created to please politicians from the right who think that 
heavier sentences will thin out the criminal element. It resolves 
nothing. It does not improve the lot of young people.
<P>
	The bill itself is incoherent. It will create administrative 
problems and delays for Quebec, which has already taken the 
rehabilitation route. Quebec is already well on its way to helping 
young offenders, and Bill C-37 will slow us down in this 
endeavour.
<P>
	It seems to me that anyone with a heart will realize that young 
people do not need to be put away, they need to be closely 
supervised. In my opinion, this is the best solution. Quebec 
already is on the right track, and a sovereign Quebec will be able 
to continue in that direction, not only when it comes to 
assistance for young offenders, but also when it comes to the 
issues of justice and violence. As a country, we will be able to 
propose real solutions, rather than measures like Bill C-37, 
which in no way resolve a very, very serious problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of his speech the member talked 
about a more fair and equitable policy. More fair to whom, the 
offenders or the victims; fairer to law-abiders or lawbreakers?
<P>
	He introduced a notion of values that should be upheld. He 
also indicated that there was no single cause of crime. He tried to 
turn that around to say that we need some long term global view 
rooted in the basic problems of society. He advocated a more 
insular cohesive Quebec with reduced interaction with the larger 
social world and  that somehow that would ameliorate the young 
offender problem. I assert to the member that is just another 
version of separatist fantasy stories.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Then he talked about Bill C-37, that perhaps it was only 
requested because of problems arising in the west. I advise the 
member that the human heart is the same and the propensity for 
young offenders to offend is the same across the country.
<P>
	It seems every comment from the Bloc is turned into a 
territorial turf question about who is in control and has a varied 
sociological view. This does nothing to constructively build a 
better Canadian society. The member denies the reality of youth 
crime in his own province. He advocates a separatist ideology of 
expansive social order and an inappropriate response to youth 
crime.
<P>
	Canadians across the country have subsidized rehabilitation 
efforts for offenders in Quebec. We do that with transfer 
payments yet he wants to abandon it. He claims that a separate 
country of Quebec could do a lot better. I say he is mistaken 
about his dreams. I advise him that the polls tell us that most 
Quebecers also say he is just dreaming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank God I am dreaming. 
Thank God that I can hope to improve or to speak in ways that 
can improve society.
<P>
	The system of justice is for whom? Certain people in the 
House speak only about the victims. As far as I am concerned 
from what I have read, the system of justice was conceived to 
protect and improve society. People who think that hanging the 
person who killed so-and-so will make the family of the victim 
better off are not thinking clearly or do not have a grasp of the 
problem.
<P>
	We need laws that try to improve society as a whole. It is not 
by imposing more severe punishment on young offenders that 
we will improve the lot of society.
<P>
	In response again to the hon. member, in Quebec we have the 
capacity to bring in a better system. We already have because in 
Quebec we understand. We have a sense of humanity in respect 
of young offenders that allows us to think in terms of 
rehabilitating them rather than thinking exclusively of putting 
them into prison and increasing the punishment, which has 
proven to be totally useless not only for the young but for the 
older criminals.
<P>
	We are already on a progressive path in respect of that 
problem. Bill C-37 is retrograde. It is coercive. It is repressive. 
It is like going back to the Middle Ages. That is why I say that in 
Quebec, and especially in a sovereign Quebec, we will probably, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9962"> 9962 </A></B>
<P>
hopefully, be able to do things a bit better. I hope people 
elsewhere will also be able to do better.
<P>
	It is not just a question of territorial control. Certainly it is a 
question of justice. It is a question of cultural sovereignty. It is a 
way of interpreting justice. Our way in Quebec of interpreting 
how young offenders should be judged is more equitable or more 
profitable in the long term for society than forcing young 
offenders to be submitted to longer terms of imprisonment, 
which are a total waste of human life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of my friend.
<P>
	He made the comment that people who are in favour of 
stronger punishment for criminals and capital punishment are 
not clear thinking or are not thinking properly.
<P>
	Does he realize that the majority of Canadians, including the 
majority of people in his own province, agree that we should 
have stronger sentences for criminals, that we should be tougher 
on criminals and tougher on crime, and that we should reinstate 
the death penalty in Canada?
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Is the hon. member going to then stand up and say that the 
majority of people in his province cannot think properly? That is 
what he is implying with his statements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not implying that by any 
means. I do not know which statistics the hon. member has 
looked at but in Quebec people are not crying out for more 
severe punishment. I do not believe that we are in agreement for 
the death penalty. We have progressed and realized that the right 
path is not the death penalty or severe penalties against 
criminals.
<P>
	I think we have understood that. There are no statistics in 
Quebec indicating that that is what the majority of people in 
Quebec would want. It may be in the west, but certainly not in 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to disagree almost completely with the 
comments made by the member of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Bill C-37 contains provisions that emphasize rehabilitation. 
How can you rehabilitate a young offender who is still on the 
street with his group of friends and partners in crime? I still 
remember that, as a kid, it was not the school teacher's strap I 
was afraid of, it was the spanking waiting for me at home after 
my brothers told my father.
<P>
	I remember when one of my brothers stole a 10-cent item 
from the store. When my father found out, he forced my brother 
to go back to the store to apologize and return the stolen item to 
the victim. This was followed by corporal punishment. I think it 
turned out well. My brother never had a problem with the law 
after that.
<P>
	Throughout this debate, we have shown great concern for the 
criminals but very little concern for the victims. I know people 
who commit a crime in the fall so that they can spend the winter 
in prison because they eat better there than many street people.
<P>
	I spoke about this with several police officers who must arrest 
these young offenders. Almost all of them say the same thing: 
Young criminals are laughing at us. We charge them with a crime 
and they say, ``I do not care. It does not matter what you do 
because I will be back on the street tomorrow morning''. They 
know they can go before a judge, who will slap them on the wrist 
and say, ``Do not do that any more, little boy''. That is why there 
are so many repeat offenders.
<P>
	Again, I think our first concern should be to protect society. 
As they say, if you cannot do the time, do not do the crime. 
Young people must realize this.
<P>
	The purpose of sentencing is not to punish young people but to 
act as a deterrent. If sentences are tough enough, they will have a 
deterrent effect and reduce crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the evidence is there. Studies 
have shown there is no deterrent effect. Increasing the sentence 
does not reduce the crime rate. Studies have confirmed this.
<P>
	I agree that, when you are a kid and your father gives you the 
odd spanking, it might help. But when we are talking about 
putting people in prison, especially young people, in institutions 
that reinforce criminal behaviour, that is different. I agree we 
have to strike a balance, and I agree that some people will say 
that we are more concerned about the criminal than the victim.
<P>
	Of course we have to be concerned about the victim, but it 
seems to me we should take a more progressive approach to the 
way we treat young offenders. And the way we do this reflects 
the values of our society. When we talk about young offenders, 
we are talking about a small number of people, but we need all 
kind of resources to help deal with what causes these young 
people to commit violent crimes.
<P>
	The trouble is this bill imposes more severe sentences for 
young people who have committed a murder but, basically, the 
problem is the same as in the case of young people who commit 
suicide. There is something deeply wrong with society, and 
young people are saying this by their extreme actions.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	So it is not by punishing young people who are victims of the 
system that we will solve the problem. We have to change the 
way society works. We have to make sure their father and 
mother have jobs and are not violent. As you know, a young 
person may be violent because his father and his mother are 
violent. That is why I say that in Quebec we will probably have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9963"> 9963 </A></B>
<P>
less trouble dealing with the real causes of these problems 
because we will consider all the other factors and not just-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry, but the period 
for questions and comments has expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Frontenac-Dairy farmers; the hon. member for 
Timiskaming-French River-Justice.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
rise today to comment on Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	This bill was the subject of justice committee hearings from 
June 23 to December 8, 1994. During these hearings, victims 
groups, groups of offenders, witnesses from children's aid 
societies, as well as representatives from judges' groups, bar 
associations and school boards all made recommendations to the 
committee.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of these 
individuals and groups for taking the time and effort to present 
their positions to the committee. I would also like to 
congratulate the members of the committee for their work on the 
bill during these hearings.
<P>
	This bill is not perfect. No bill ever is. I believe that to 
understand the purpose of this bill one must first understand the 
purpose of the Young Offenders Act generally.
<P>
	The Criminal Code of Canada sets out Parliament's goals and 
initiatives in the area of criminal sentencing for adult offenders. 
Conversely, we have enacted a separate statute, the Young 
Offenders Act, which legislates the sentencing process for 
young offenders. This is in recognition of the fact that young 
offenders often commit crimes for vastly different reasons than 
the motives behind adult crime.
<P>
	The goals of punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation are 
often achieved through different methods with young offenders 
than with adult criminals. The primary difference often 
recognized by experts is that many young offenders have a much 
better chance of being rehabilitated and becoming productive 
members of society than adult offenders. Tied in with this is the 
idea that for many young offenders the commission of a crime is 
an isolated incident in their lives, whereas for adult offenders, 
the commission of a crime more often signifies a larger pattern 
of lifestyle.
<P>
	Unfortunately, events over the past few years in Canada have 
shown that not all young offenders fit the stereotypical mould of 
a young person who in committing a crime made an isolated 
mistake. Perhaps the most striking example of this was the 
tragic death of Nicholas Battersby last spring here in Ottawa. 
Mr. Battersby was shot in a drive-by shooting in broad daylight 
just blocks away from this House. Four young offenders were 
accused of this crime. I believe one of these youths has already 
pleaded guilty to this offence.
<P>
	We also hear of swarmings in Toronto. This is the term for a 
phenomenon where a group of youths harass and beat a lone 
individual, sometimes simply for the clothes he or she is 
wearing.
<P>
	These and other tragic stories show Canadians one thing: 
Some young offenders, long before they reach the age of 18, 
have become hardened criminals and the Young Offenders Act is 
simply inadequate to rehabilitate them or to protect Canadians 
from them.
<P>
	We hear stories of youth who state that they commit crimes 
without any worry of being punished for their acts. We hear 
young Canadians openly saying that they would continue to 
commit crimes because the punishment available under the 
Young Offenders Act until the age of 18 simply does not scare 
them.
<P>
	It is with this backdrop that the Minister of Justice has 
brought forth this legislation, Bill C-37. I would like to speak 
now on some specific measures in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The first measures contained in the bill are, in my opinion, the 
most important and fundamental amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act. The amendments proposed to paragraph 3(1) of 
the present act send a clear message to the judiciary who are 
responsible for enforcing the act. The protection of society is a 
primary objective of the Young Offenders Act. This preamble is 
most important.
<P>
	Much of the time, the varying goals of the criminal law are in 
conflict. Some measures while they contribute to the 
rehabilitation of offenders may place the public safety at greater 
risk. I am here today to say that Parliament, the judiciary and 
other stakeholders in this debate must never forget that the 
safety of the public can never be compromised.
<P>
	While some measures may be seen as contributing to the 
rehabilitation process, these benefits must be contrasted with 
any threat they present to the public safety. This is the 
fundamental struggle of any criminal justice system. Nowhere is 
the dilemma more prevalent than it is with the young offenders 
system.
<P>
	While studies and common sense dictate that as a group young 
offenders are much more amenable to rehabilitation than adult 
offenders, we have learned the hard way that young offenders 
can also be serious threats to the public safety. The Young 
Offenders Act therefore must recognize the dual and conflicting 
role that it must play. The amendments proposed to paragraph 
3(1)(a) send a strong message to the judiciary that Parliament 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9964"> 9964 </A></B>
<P>
expects the judiciary to consider public safety and rehabilitation 
when considering the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The other amendment which this bill proposes to paragraph 
3(1) is to affirm that young persons must accept the 
responsibility for their actions and for their contraventions. 
Again, the whole purpose of the Young Offenders Act is to 
recognize that the young persons accept this responsibility in 
different ways than do adults. However, they still must accept 
responsibility for their actions and also the responsibility of 
rehabilitating themselves.
<P>
	On the theme of protection of public safety, I would like to 
turn to the amendments proposed to section 16 of the Young 
Offenders Act. These amendments would provide that 16 and 
17-year old offenders who commit murder, attempted murder, 
or manslaughter would be tried as adults unless the youth court 
orders that the youth be tried as a young offender. Under the 
present Young Offenders Act an offender can be tried in adult 
court, but only if the crown successfully petitions the youth 
court for such a transfer.
<P>
	Presently, a young offender who is charged with any crime 
will automatically be tried in youth court unless the crown can 
convince a judge that circumstances merit otherwise. Under this 
bill a 16 or 17-year old charged with murder, attempted murder, 
or manslaughter will be automatically tried in an adult court 
unless a judge, on application, can be convinced otherwise.
<P>
	I know I am repeating myself but it bears repeating. This is a 
very important step. Effectively, a reverse onus will lie with a 
young offender charged with these crimes to show a judge why 
he or she should not be tried in adult court.
<P>
	The effect of these amendments will be to increase public 
safety while also recognizing that in certain cases an offender 
charged with these offences may be best dealt with under the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This amendment is also consistent with the principle that 
young persons must accept responsibility for their actions. This 
amendment is of fundamental importance.
<P>
	The present maximum sentence available under the act of five 
years for a 16 or 17-year old who commits murder is inadequate. 
As many of us know, some young people who have committed 
murder openly mock this sentence.
<P>
	This amendment sends a message to all Canadians and to 
young offenders. That message is that while there may be valid 
reasons for giving a young offender a second chance, a young 
offender accused of these serious crimes must convince the 
court of these reasons.
<P>
	These amendments therefore address the competing interests 
between public safety and rehabilitation, particularly when 
serious crimes such as murder are at issue.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to bring the attention of the House 
to section 16(1.1)(b) which under clause 8(1) of Bill C-37 states 
that when considering whether a young offender should be tried 
as an adult or in youth court, the protection of the public will be 
paramount. If the judge is unable to reconcile this objective of 
public protection with other objectives, then the youth will be 
tried as an adult. This in my opinion is an ideal method of 
dealing with this dilemma of reconciling the protection of the 
public and other objectives of the criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Youth crime, like any other crime, demands a reasoned 
response to address all the goals of a criminal justice system 
such as general deterrence, specific deterrence, rehabilitation 
and public safety. However, when the other objectives conflict 
with the goal of public safety, public safety must take priority 
over other considerations.
<P>
	I therefore support the amendment whereby 16 and 17-year 
old offenders must show the court why they should be tried in a 
youth court. In fact, it is unfortunate in my view that this 
amendment applies only to 16 and 17-year olds. It could easily 
have been expanded to all young offenders with consideration of 
the age of the offender becoming a key consideration which a 
judge would consider in determining whether or not an offender 
should be tried in youth court. Perhaps this could be something 
that might be addressed later in phase two of the study on the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	In conjunction with the amendments in Bill C-37 dealing with 
the transfer of 16 and 17-year olds accused of murder or 
attempted murder, the bill also raises the maximum penalty 
under the Young Offenders Act for first degree murder to 10 
years from five years. In addition, the maximum penalty for 
anyone convicted of second degree murder will be raised from 
five to seven years. Again, these provisions in my opinion 
address the concern that we live in a society where a sentence of 
five years is not adequate in all cases to deter crime and to 
protect society, or to rehabilitate the young offender.
<P>
	Bill C-37 will also provide for victims of youth crime to make 
impact statements at the sentencing of a young offender. Too 
often with our criminal justice system, victims complain that 
they are victimized twice, once by the crime and again during 
the court proceedings in relation to the crime. We hear stories of 
victims who are not even informed of when the offender will be 
sentenced. Victims complain that they have no input in the 
criminal proceedings.
<P>
	While it is obvious that the judge in any case must be the final 
arbiter of a case, in order to adequately dispose of a case the 
judge must have the representations of all the affected parties 
before him or her. This includes representations from victims of 
crime detailing the impact the crime has had on their lives. Only 
with this input will judges truly be able to pass a sentence that 
fits the crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9965"> 9965 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to encourage all members of this 
House to support Bill C-37. I believe it provides amendments 
which recognize that the Young Offenders Act must obtain a 
balance of rehabilitation, public safety and deterrence. 
Unfortunately, in some cases the Young Offenders Act as it now 
stands does not adequately address the proper balancing of 
these interests.
<P>
	This bill provides an excellent start on the process of reducing 
crime by youth by providing for measures that will take into 
consideration the issue of public safety. I encourage all 
members of this House to realize that any criminal justice 
system must have as its goal the balance of the objectives of 
public safety and rehabilitation. This is particularly true of any 
criminal system designed for young persons.
<P>
	While it is true that young people are much more amenable as 
a whole to rehabilitation, the public must be adequately 
protected from all crime no matter who commits it. The 
amendments proposed to the Young Offenders Act as contained 
in Bill C-37 address the balancing of these objectives. This 
balance is lacking in the act as it now stands.
<P>
	Finally, let me add my voice to others who have mentioned in 
this House that this bill does not represent the whole story of 
reducing crime by young persons. Most of the Young Offenders 
Act by definition deals with offences already committed. The 
other half of the equation of course is crime prevention.
<P>
	In order for any initiative to reduce crime to be successful, the 
whole equation must be looked at. The 12th report of the 
Standing Committee on Justice released in 1993 pointed this 
out. It identified that in order to reduce crime we must attack its 
roots such as unemployment, illiteracy, physical and sexual 
abuse of children, the glorification of violence, and 
dysfunctional families.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Studies have shown that crimes in neighbourhoods are 
drastically reduced when programs designed to keep youth 
occupied are instituted. Similarly, programs that attempt to help 
young Canadians get off the streets will also help prevent crime.
<P>
	It is vital that the roots of crime be addressed in order that 
public safety is ensured. These steps in my opinion will be wise 
investments in the future of this country. Therefore I 
congratulate the Minister of Justice and the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs in taking the first steps in reforming 
the Young Offenders Act with Bill C-37.
<P>
	I also encourage the government to continue its efforts to 
eradicate crime by taking the initiatives that aim at preventing 
crime before it is committed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member finished off by congratulating the 
minister for taking the first steps. Perhaps we could say they are 
baby steps. Why not bring  in a bill that would comprehensively 
deal with the problems of the Young Offenders Act?
<P>
	At the beginning of her speech, the member talked about the 
importance of rehabilitation. The problem with youth crime is 
that many young offenders have never been habilitated in the 
first place. Society needs to respond to protect itself while 
respecting due process and offender needs.
<P>
	Throughout her speech, the member recounted the problems 
very clearly, but does she believe that Bill C-37 will fix the 
problems identified? I think not.
<P>
	She talked at length about the reverse onus provision and the 
whole procedure of transfers especially for 16 and 17-year olds. 
Perhaps she might address herself to the mind that it is basically 
an admission that the Young Offenders Act is fundamentally 
flawed for 16 and 17-year olds.
<P>
	This brings up the topic that if we have to spend so much time 
dealing with the special problems for 16 and 17-year olds then 
the act is fundamentally flawed. Really it deals with the wrong 
set of kids and 16 and 17-year olds should be dealt with in adult 
court.
<P>
	The member repeatedly cited the problems and the dilemmas 
but then made that unreasonable leap of faith that Bill C-37 is 
appropriate in responding to the problems that she cites.
<P>
	However, I was encouraged that the member acknowledged 
the notion of victims in the process. I would ask her, would she 
then advocate or be willing to support the giving of legal 
standing to victims in the young offender court?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. As I stated at the beginning of my comments, this 
bill is not perfect. It is a first step toward revamping the present 
act.
<P>
	To speak to the comment he made on the victims of crime, as 
we go along with this bill and the amendments that will come 
subsequent to this process, these facts will be dealt with in time. 
It is certainly a problem and one I am sure the committee will be 
looking at in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his latest 
report the Auditor General took what I consider to be a major 
step forward in discharging the duties of his office.
<P>
	In addition to the traditional accounts of waste and 
questionable accounting practices, this time around he pointed 
out that a major cause of wasted money-and in my view this is 
the major cause-is not overpaid civil servants, the redecorating 
of offices, or the wasting of staples and paper clips. The problem 
the Auditor General focused on this time around is that we spend 
billions of dollars a year on programs without ever saying what 
the programs are intended to achieve, or how we measure their 
success in achieving their goals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9966"> 9966 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not hard to think of a government program to which this 
criticism applies. Actually it is hard to think of one that it does 
not apply to. We have social programs that hurt society. We 
have family programs that destroy families. We have aboriginal 
programs that keep Canada's Indians from ever achieving 
self-sufficiency. We have trade programs that discourage free 
trade. We have expenditure control legislation that allows 
spending to spiral out of control, and so on. It is not a pretty 
sight.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Every time one of these programs fails, the solution is to 
spend more money. We never ask what we are trying to do, how 
we will know whether or not we have achieved it, and when we 
will shut the program down if we do not see some success.
<P>
	Getting to the Young Offenders Act, what is it supposed to be 
doing? Is it doing it? How can we tell? If it is not, at what point 
do we change our approach?
<P>
	The purpose of the Young Offenders Act is quite clear. It is 
intended to draw a distinction between hardened adult offenders 
on the one hand and juveniles on the other. Then it is intended to 
separate the hardened juvenile offender from the kid who got in 
with the wrong crowd and made a foolish mistake. Most of us 
would agree that the kid who made a foolish mistake and that kid 
alone deserves a second chance.
<P>
	I am sure many members are thinking: ``Come off it, Mike. In 
this country we do not hold hardened adult criminals responsible 
either'', and this is sadly true. It is difficult to pick up a 
newspaper today without seeing some dreadful tale of an 
innocent person abused or slaughtered by someone who ought 
still to be in prison serving out their sentence. Perhaps our 
governments do not take crime seriously even by adults, but the 
public wants them to and the Liberals ignore that desire at their 
grave peril.
<P>
	Last time the Liberals formed the government the public got 
so sick of their arrogance that it reduced them to some 40 seats 
in Parliament in the 1984 election. Let me serve notice here and 
now that if the Prime Minister and the cabinet ignore public 
feelings about crime, that will be the good old days for the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	If the Liberals hope to avoid such a debacle, there are so many 
things they are doing that they had better not. They had better 
not raise taxes for one thing. They had better not keep spending 
more money than they take in for another. They had better apply 
the Auditor General's critique to their entire crime policy. Is 
crime being deterred? How do we measure it? If it is not, how do 
we change the law so that it is?
<P>
	To help the Liberals in this unfamiliar exercise of considering 
whether what they are doing is actually working, I would like to 
start by applying the Auditor General's criteria to the Young 
Offenders Act and to these amendments to it.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act is supposed to give a second chance 
to those who deserve it. Is that what it is doing? Or is it just 
giving a licence to those under 18 to commit crimes? How can 
we tell? It seems quite simple to me.
<P>
	If the Young Offenders Act is working, those youths who are 
given light sentences, who have their records sealed when they 
reach the age of majority, who receive no punishment at all for 
their misdeeds, should subsequently turn out to be better 
citizens than those who are selected for more severe 
punishment. Young people who get into trouble with the law 
should be less inclined to continue their criminal careers into 
adulthood than before there was the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	In short, if the Young Offenders Act is working, we would 
either have no more youth crime than we had in the past or 
perhaps a little bit more but a much lower rate of juvenile 
delinquents going on to become adult criminals. If not, if youth 
crime is skyrocketing and young offenders who receive a light 
slap on the wrist for serious acts like robbery, assault, even rape 
and murder go on to commit serious crimes as adults, then the 
Young Offenders Act is failing.
<P>
	To me, the scariest possibility would be that the young thugs 
are manifesting an increasingly obvious awareness that they are 
beyond the reach of the law because of the Young Offenders Act, 
that they are responding rationally to the incentives government 
has built into its policies. That would be easy to measure too. 
Just look to see when the Young Offenders Act came into force 
and then after a few years delay when teenagers came to 
understand these provisions youth crime skyrocketed.
<P>
	I wonder whether the government bothers to keep statistics on 
these questions and if it does, whether it will release them. I 
wonder whether we had less youth crime before the Young 
Offenders Act or more. I wonder what proportion of those who 
receive lenient sentences or have their records sealed when they 
turn 18 go on to commit more serious crimes as opposed to those 
who used to receive a stiff punishment for an evil act.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I am submitting these as Order Paper questions because as 
Canadians we have a right to know what is going on. That 
includes knowing whether the Minister of Justice knows or cares 
whether the Young Offenders Act is working. If it turns out that 
when measured adequately against clear criteria the Young 
Offenders Act is the failure it seems to be, then I wonder 
something else. I wonder what the government's priorities are.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9967"> 9967 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice think that his primary and 
overwhelming responsibility is protecting the lives, liberties 
and property of Canadian citizens and does he measure each 
of his initiatives against that criterion? Or is he busy trying to 
turn us all into socially aware, personally tolerant, cappuccino 
drinking, fluently trilingual citizens of the global village of the 
21st century? Is he too caught up in his social engineering to 
protect society as it now exists?
<P>
	Some will doubtless believe I am being unfair to the minister. 
Some will doubtless maintain that the justice minister knows 
exactly what the Young Offenders Act and these amendments to 
it are supposed to achieve. And he knows exactly how to 
measure success.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act, some will tell me, is part of a grand 
social engineering project of this and previous Liberal 
governments. It is the abolition of personal responsibility. 
These people will further tell me that the Minister of Justice 
knows exactly what the amendments are intended to achieve. 
They are intended to deceive the bumpkins out in the hinterland 
into thinking that crime is being punished and innocence 
rewarded so that the project of relieving us all of responsibility 
can proceed unmolested.
<P>
	These people will tell me that the justice minister has very 
clear ideas how to measure his success on this project. They will 
say that if the justice minister can get the polls to say Canadians 
think he is cracking down on youth crime, he will not actually 
have to hold murderous young thugs accountable for their acts 
of evil. I do not think so.
<P>
	I prefer to be charitable and assume that the justice minister 
and the Liberals are so convinced of their divine right to rule 
over Canadians and reshape them for their own good that they do 
not bother asking themselves whether what they are doing is 
working.
<P>
	That is why I have risen in the Chamber today, to tell the 
justice minister as clearly and forcefully as I can that when his 
party was elected on the promise of a better yesterday, voters 
had in mind a time when jobs were more secure, the national 
debt was far lower and the streets were a lot safer. That is what 
they want to come back, not to the crazy experiments and wild 
excesses of the Trudeau years.
<P>
	I hope the Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister and the 
entire government understand that Canadians really do believe 
and cherish individual responsibility. They overwhelmingly 
favour the right to own property. They overwhelmingly favour 
politicians who listen to their constituents. They 
overwhelmingly favour the right of law-abiding citizens to live 
in freedom and in security. And they overwhelmingly favour 
tougher action against crime and criminals of whatever age.
<P>
	I call on the Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister and the 
government to take back this legislation and to repudiate the 
entire approach behind it. I call on them to recognize that the 
most primary duty of a government is  to protect the lives, 
liberty and property of its citizens from force and fraud.
<P>
	I call on them to develop and make public a set of standards 
for measuring the success or failure of the Young Offenders Act 
against this goal. And I call on them to amend it so that it works 
or abolish it if it cannot be made to work.
<P>
	Enough of softness on crime. Enough coddling. Enough 
punishing the innocent and pardoning the guilty. Either they do 
it now or the Reform government does it after 1997 while they 
collect their undeserved pensions and write their wistful 
memoirs.
<P>
	That would be simple justice. Simple justice is what the 
Canadian public wants and simple justice is what the Reform 
Party is going to give them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member. He acknowledges how 
much we are doing positively and how many millions we are 
spending within the juvenile justice system to respond to 
juvenile crime. Sometimes we do not hear about that but a lot of 
wonderful things are being done and great effort is made 
throughout the country within the juvenile justice system. It is 
not a matter of either or, but a great amount of resources are 
being spent.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	He makes the point that we must always evaluate our social 
programs for what is actually delivered. It is a point that must 
not be forgotten, and he mentions the role of the Auditor General 
in that.
<P>
	The member reflects the experience of the community and 
how the message has been sent by the operations of the Young 
Offenders Act. He points out that we have had the Young 
Offenders Act for 10 years, and if it was working properly it 
would have acquired the acceptance of the community. The 
opposite is true. The community's experience with the act has 
resulted in the act's repudiation and a lack of confidence that it 
would have earned if it was working properly.
<P>
	The member also pointed out the fact that the Young 
Offenders Act represents a Liberal social philosophy that is 
really not reflective of mainstream Canadian values. He talked 
about the issue of community accountability. The final measure 
of what should be done with the Young Offenders Act is, what 
does the public want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his comments and I would reiterate what I said in my 
intervention. We have to measure the success of our programs 
against clear criteria. We have to evaluate whether or not the 
legislation that is in effect right now or legislation that is 
brought into the House is actually working.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9968"> 9968 </A></B>
<P>
	The Auditor General said in his report that so many of the 
things the government does, fails. It fails the test of 
accountability. It does not achieve the lofty goals that it sets 
out to achieve. The Young Offenders Act is another example 
of that very deep malaise that sits in our federal government 
and has for a long time.
<P>
	The programs that are brought into the House or that are on 
the books right now have to be evaluated in clear terms. It has to 
be demonstrated they actually work and that Canadians are 
satisfied with them.
<P>
	Clearly Canadians from coast to coast are not satisfied with 
the Young Offenders Act and they will not be satisfied with the 
amendments as proposed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise to speak on this bill, this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are attempting to reconcile two views; one which looks at 
what one would refer to as tough treatment, incarceration, 
dealing with young people who create situations that are 
unacceptable to society in a very direct and sometimes I would 
suggest almost brutal kind of way.
<P>
	On the other hand, another group of people somehow believe 
that if you do not look at youth crime, and if you are patient and 
understanding and soft, that it will go away. Surely the answer 
lies somewhere in the middle. Surely there is a balance to be 
struck.
<P>
	This is what the bill is all about. It attempts to reconcile two 
views. It attempts to establish a correct balance, and that correct 
balance would obviously vary according to the values that an 
individual holds.
<P>
	We are asked to define what is a fair response. What is a just 
response? What is a correct response to a crime situation when it 
is undertaken by a young man or woman? That is extremely 
difficult. I do not pretend to have all of the answers and it would 
be presumptuous of me to suggest that I do.
<P>
	I want to share some ideas in the spirit of debate to try to 
address a very serious situation. I do not believe that you can 
wish it away and it is simply going to disappear. I do not believe 
that incarceration and rough treatment is the answer either.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has to manage. It has to protect society. At 
the same time, simply putting people away does not solve the 
problem. It does not even come close to solving the problem.
<P>
	One can look at rough treatment or direct treatment or 
incarceration. A lot of people would say, ``not pandering to 
those criminals''. Do they look at the success rate of reacting 
that way? What happens when we put people away? What are the 
costs when people are put away? We do not talk about that. 
There are costs. It  costs a lot of money to detain people today. 
Obviously it has to be done because society has to be protected 
in certain circumstances. As a solution it is not only costly but I 
think it is extremely dysfunctional.
<P>
	Look at the people who are put away. Since they are young 
people many of them are eventually released. Once they are 
released how many go on to integrate into society and lead 
productive lives? What is the success rate of that kind of 
approach?
<P>
	Pretending that no problems exist will not resolve anything. 
We have to acknowledge that there are difficulties in society that 
are caused by real reasons. The real challenge to us as 
parliamentarians, as members of Canadian society, is to find out 
why it is that people commit crimes.
<P>
	Some people suggest there are good and bad people. That is 
too simplistic. There are people who along the way, for a variety 
of reasons that we do not always understand nearly as well as we 
should, commit criminal behaviour that is totally unacceptable 
to society. That is where the challenge lies. If we could 
understand that, we could respond. In responding to that we 
could cut down the amount of crime in society. It would be much 
less costly, much less dysfunctional and a much more humane 
and satisfying kind of way of dealing with our fellow human 
being whether he or she is or is not a criminal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are trying to strike a balance between those who feel that 
imprisonment is the solution and those who feel that patience 
and education will eventually bring an end to this type of 
violence, abuse and criminal behaviour.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill includes a number of serious measures. I am not 
disappointed when I hear people suggest other or additional 
measures. That does not bother me. What does bother me is 
when the efforts of a very prominent Canadian are belittled, a 
justice minister who knows a lot about the law and criminal 
behaviour and who has taken the time to consult widely. Then 
we pose as supposed experts and simply belittle that which he 
has produced. That is arrogance.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know you would agree with me that when 
members on the opposite side suggest that members of our party 
are arrogant, there is no greater arrogance than pretending that 
one is an expert, that one has all of the solutions to all of the 
complex problems of society when one in fact does not. They 
come forward with simple, glib, catchy little solutions that 
pretend to resolve, so they can go away and suggest they are 
really listening to people and applying those solutions, and they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9969"> 9969 </A></B>
<P>
are going to correct the ills of society, that is arrogance. That is 
the most profound arrogance that one can find.
<P>
	Unfortunately we find it a great deal in some members of the 
House. Some of them are raising their hands. I wish the camera 
could catch them right now so their electors could see firsthand 
who they are. Unfortunately that is not possible. Perhaps they 
will have the courage to get up and ask question, so we can have 
a bit of a debate. I can say a few more things to them then.
<P>
	The bill includes increased sentences. Has anyone talked 
about that? It includes going to adult court in certain 
circumstances, when the crime is sufficiently serious to warrant 
that kind of situation. It includes extending the time served 
before being considered for parole. Has anyone from the 
opposite side mentioned that? It includes a better sharing of 
information among those people who deal with youth and 
criminal behaviour by young people.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	It also includes rehabilitation and treatment. That underlies 
the whole notion here. We want to rehabilitate. We want to be 
able to treat. We want to keep young people out of penal 
institutions. It is costly. It is dysfunctional. It does not do them 
any good as human beings. It protects society and, as I 
mentioned before, when protection is needed that is clearly what 
we would do.
<P>
	The legislation includes the possibility of victim impact 
statements when sentencing, something that is now used in adult 
situations only. It talks about conditional supervision which is 
rare in a number of circumstances today but which is extended.
<P>
	It talks about medical and psychological assessments. We no 
longer need to get consent. We can ask for those assessments to 
assist us in making better, more sensitive judgments that will be 
practical and address the real problems. A very important point 
is the possibility of restitution to the victims of crime. It has 
many components the opposite side has not addressed.
<P>
	The major challenge to us today is twofold. It is to look at the 
legislation not in a partisan way but in the spirit of openness to 
see what merits support and what can be improved. Surely 
members on the opposite side see some positive features in the 
legislation. They can bring about suggestions that may lead to 
improvements. That is one of the challenges.
<P>
	Another challenge before us today is to try to understand 
better than we do why it is these young people turn to criminal 
behaviour. If we could understand that we could prevent crime. 
Preventing crime would ensure that there is less incarceration, 
less cost to society and more productive lives being lived by 
young people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe I am reaching the end of my speech. I will stop here, 
and I look forward to questions from my colleagues across the 
floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are listening on this side of the House. Hopefully 
our constituents are listening at home as well.
<P>
	I appreciate the hon. member's comments about Bill C-37, 
the reforms to the Young Offenders Act. He said that if we had 
any suggestions he would welcome them and that we should 
bring them forward to the government. We have been trying to 
do that at every opportunity in the debate on the Young 
Offenders Act and the specific bill.
<P>
	It is high time young people who commit violent repeat 
offences are held accountable. We talk about that often. We 
should quit blaming society, family or peer pressure for their 
crimes; they have to be held accountable.
<P>
	I wrote down from the hon. member's speech that he does not 
believe incarceration and rough treatment are the answer. Some 
people would differ when it comes to repeat offenders and 
offenders who commit horrendous violent crimes.
<P>
	I would like to refer to a newspaper article and ask the hon. 
member if he would agree with this type of treatment and 
indicate whether it has some potential in Canada. I refer to an 
article about the Toulson Boot Camp in Maryland, U.S.A., 
which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Offenders between the ages of 17 and 25, sentenced to five years or less, can 
sign up for the six-month boot camp program at Toulson. And then you're 
home-free on parole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The program at Toulson is modelled on the U.S. Marines' boot camps and 
about half the instructors are former marines. It emphasizes discipline and 
accountability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So lifting a log isn't about lifting a log. It's about teamwork and overcoming 
adversity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And moving a rock pile isn't just moving rocks. It's about being responsible 
for your actions and putting effort into work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toulson is a little different than other American boot camps, however.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That's because, in addition to the strict military regime and physical training, 
inmates also get job training, schooling (more than 70 per cent receive their 
high school equivalency diploma before they leave) and strictly supervised 
probation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Boot camps without such measures find 50 to 70 per cent of their ex-cons end 
up back in the clink-the same rate as for conventional U.S. prisons where 
inmates can do whatever they want all day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to statistics compiled by Toulson officials, only 20 per cent of 
inmates released from the boot camp have reoffended.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9970"> 9970 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	In light of those statistics-he has asked for 
suggestions-would that perhaps be something that Canada 
should be looking at to put some of the violent repeat offenders 
into a structure such as that one and hopefully we would have a 
better success rate than we have had in our rehabilitation 
programs of the past?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased by the question and 
I shall attempt to answer it in a responsible way.
<P>
	Initially there was a comment from the member's party 
indicating that my party was prone to attempting all kinds of 
programs without appropriate evaluations. Then this hon. 
member puts forth the suggestion of a boot camp in his question, 
a particular boot camp where supposedly there has been some 
success.
<P>
	I would caution in taking one example only and extrapolating 
it to the whole of youth crime or the whole of Canada. Whether 
one calls it boot camp or an alternative way of serving a sentence 
or being socialized differently, certainly we can look at it and we 
should. I know this is happening in certain parts of Canada.
<P>
	I deplore, and my colleague did not suggest it, when some 
members indicate that boot camps sound tough. It sounds as if 
we are doing something when we are not doing anything except 
for symbolic reasons. I think that is hypocritical. I stress again 
that my colleague did not suggest that was the reason, but in 
some cases it is hypocritical, political and has no intent but 
trying to respond to a group of people out there that believes it is 
the answer to all youth crime.
<P>
	Another point I want to make is a very important one. I take 
issue with my colleague in this regard, at least slightly. I did not 
say that incarceration was not the answer. I say that 
incarceration needed to be the answer in certain cases to protect 
society. He can check the blues. I did say that.
<P>
	I hope my colleagues will listen very carefully but I wanted to 
make a point-and I am delighted to be able to make it again 
because it is an important one-for those who suggest that we 
should simply put people into an institution and throw away the 
key. There are some people who suggest that because they do not 
know any better. They do not understand the situation. They 
keep hoping for simplistic solutions. I simply suggest to them 
that approach to incarceration, with that kind of motivation, is 
not the answer.
<P>
	We have a greater responsibility toward our fellow human 
beings, whether or not we like them, whether or not they are 
offenders, and that is to try to find out what we can do in a 
responsible way to ensure that they are contributing members of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak today on Bill C-37 as it 
addresses an area of concern to me and certainly a matter of 
concern to my constituents.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has responded quite quickly to public 
concern about problems with the Young Offenders Act through 
the amendments he is proposing in Bill C-37. As the 
government has been doing with other important pieces of 
legislation, the public has been consulted widely on possible 
changes and improvements both before the bill was drafted and 
tabled in the House and subsequently in committee.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	These amendments therefore are the reflection of wide public 
consultations and intended to respond to wide public concerns. 
That does not mean they will please everyone. Indeed critics 
have argued that they are either too harsh or too lenient. That 
usually means they are just about right.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act has had two purposes since its 
inception. One is the protection of society. The other is to 
interrupt the beginning of a criminal career and try our best to 
rehabilitate young offenders so that they do not become lifelong, 
hardened criminals.
<P>
	In response to public concern the minister has amended the 
declaration of the principle of the act to make it clear that the 
primary objective of the youth system, however, must be the 
protection of society.
<P>
	This can only be achieved if we have a real commitment as 
well to rehabilitation and to crime prevention. This means that 
for chronic serious offenders, judges are clearly authorized in 
the bill to have proper psychological or medical evaluations 
done.
<P>
	It would be a tragedy, for instance, if young persons who 
might otherwise be entirely treatable, correctable and able to be 
put on a better path of life through medical or therapeutic help 
were simply to be punished and then released into society 
possibly to commit increasingly serious crimes as they become 
adults and lifelong criminals as they mature.
<P>
	Increasing the sentences for first degree murder to a 
maximum of ten years and for second degree murder to seven 
years is something that I think has a great deal of public support. 
In making these sentencing changes the minister is addressing 
the need for sentencing for violent crimes that matches both the 
public's perception of the seriousness of the crime as well as the 
need to hold young offenders accountable for the damage their 
crimes have caused.
<P>
	I do not mean only greater punishment but, again combining 
the two purposes of the bill, also more reasonable time for 
rehabilitation and counselling. Our party in opposition argued 
for these longer sentences simply because we knew there were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9971"> 9971 </A></B>
<P>
some young offenders, even those who committed violent 
crimes, who  could be rehabilitated. It cannot necessarily be 
done in the five years that the act currently allows.
<P>
	As well by transferring 16 and 17-year olds to adult court 
when they have been charged with murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault and aggravated assault, 
we are sending a message to violent offenders that they will be 
held accountable regardless of their age.
<P>
	There is still the ability nevertheless for young persons to 
apply to have their cases remain in youth court if the objectives 
of protection of the public and rehabilitation can better be met 
there. The onus is on young offenders to prove that exceptional 
treatment rather than adult court is merited in their case.
<P>
	We can see that the amendments are improvements of the 
current system that allow for flexibility only in exceptional 
cases. They will also allow police officers, school officials and 
welfare agencies to share information on young offenders for 
the better protection of public safety. It says to our communities 
that while the interest of young offenders must be taken into 
account there are other important interests and concerns.
<P>
	For youth who have committed less serious crimes, 
alternatives to custody should be considered as the bill would 
allow. I return to the second purpose of the Young Offenders Act 
which is to ensure, wherever possible, that young offenders are 
given the opportunity to develop a better way of life and not 
continue with a life of crime.
<P>
	Let us turn to fitting the punishment to the crime. The bill 
allows for the kinds of alternatives to custody as a method of 
restitution for the victim, or some type of community service 
that may be far more productive than the more traditional 
approaches of incarceration.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	These amendments as presented in Bill C-37 are not perfect 
solutions, nor are they the end of the process. They are 
improvements. They show Canadians that the government is 
serious about protecting their personal safety and their property. 
At the same time they offer the opportunity for rehabilitation 
where possible and feasible and for crime prevention.
<P>
	Moreover, as the House is aware, the minister has asked the 
parliamentary committee of justice to undertake a thorough 
review of the Young Offenders Act. We realize that this is just a 
first step. This will provide the forum for additional changes and 
improvements to meet both purposes of the act, the protection of 
public safety and the rehabilitation wherever possible of young 
offenders.
<P>
	These are issues that need to be addressed. We need to know 
why some of our young people are falling into criminal ways. 
We do need to examine the relationship between youth services 
and the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	A very recent study has indicated that a violent child of six 
will become a violent adolescent and a violent adult. Right now 
we do not have services in our country or in our communities 
that are nearly adequate to turn that young child's life around at 
the age of six rather than waiting until the age of 16 when they 
are damaging themselves and others in a far more serious way.
<P>
	We need to understand how the government can attack some 
of the underlying causes of crime such as poverty, family 
violence and drug abuse. Members opposite may not want to 
acknowledge that sometimes somebody else is responsible for 
the criminal behaviour of the young person. In may cases, far 
more than they would like to know about, criminal behaviour is 
very directly linked to sexual abuse as a child. Much as they 
would like to simply put the burden of proof on that 12, 13 or 
14-year old young person, we as a society have to take some 
responsibility for those among that population who were abused 
in a society that failed to protect them.
<P>
	The members opposite mentioned certain ways of dealing 
with young offenders. I think we have to be more open and that is 
why a more fundamental review can look at other methods of 
treating young offenders while they are in custody or under 
supervision of some kind. It is only by addressing these more 
fundamental issues that we will make real strides in keeping our 
youth out of the justice system and turning their lives around 
where possible when they come into conflict with the law.
<P>
	We need to look at every possible investment toward keeping 
our society a healthy place for children to grow up so that future 
generations are not looking on our youth as a problem, a source 
of violence and a source of fear to our citizens and to our society.
<P>
	As I said, this is the first step in that process. It is not the end 
of the process. I look forward to the Reform Party supporting the 
progress that is being made in this bill and participating fully in 
the ongoing debate about further improvements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose one concern of the Reform Party that I think has been 
fairly well expressed is the lack of success that the current YOA 
has had.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could enlighten me on some things, 
for example the fact that 47 per cent of all cases where charges 
are made under the Young Offenders Act are for repeat offences; 
19 per cent of all those charges are for the fifth offence under the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	In her judgment, what in the amendments is going to actually 
change that? What in the amendments is really going to work to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9972"> 9972 </A></B>
<P>
the resolution of that problem or do these amendments not touch 
the reality of the repeat offences?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how those statistics 
compare with adult crime. However, what the member has just 
said is that 53 per cent of charges against young offenders are 
laid against first time offenders. They have never offended 
before. The fact that only 20 per cent have then gone on to offend 
more than twice is a fairly good indication to me that there is a 
reasonably high level of rehabilitation because of the act and the 
effect it has had since it was first implemented.
<P>
	However, in the cases for which there is the greatest public 
concern, the kind of amendments that I think are going to make a 
substantial difference is for severe and violent crime, murder, 
assault, aggravated assault, sexual assault and so on, and the 
requirement to have the young person tried in adult court 
according to adult rules, the possibility of longer sentences, up 
to double what they are now.
<P>
	I also feel that oftentimes when we do incarcerate young 
people we put them into a school of crime. We put them into 
contact with people who have been in the system perhaps more 
than once or twice, who are much more knowledgeable about 
crime and living off the avails or crime. That I do not think is a 
desirable situation.
<P>
	I certainly believe in the requirement to look at non-custodial 
solutions, especially where the young person is being held 
directly accountable through compensation to the victim 
directly for the harm they have done or through community 
service to compensate the community directly for the harm that 
he or she has done to the community. Those are the kinds of 
measures, among others, that put a direct link between the crime 
that has been committed and the effects of that crime. To me that 
kind of discipline is a productive kind of discipline.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This concludes the period 
of questions and comments and also concludes this stage of 
debate. As we continue third reading of this legislation, 
members will now have a maximum of 10-minute interventions 
without questions or comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since June 
2, 1994, when Bill C-37 to amend the Young Offenders Act was 
tabled, I have been unable to convince myself that the federal 
government is seriously trying to make those of us in Parliament 
and the people in Quebec and the rest of Canada believe that its 
proposed reform will increase public protection.
<P>
	As you know, I have more than 21 years' experience in 
teaching and have learned to trust. I have learned that, in life, 
you have to offer a second chance. I learned this during all those 
years. The debate, this debate, is simply a public relations 
exercise by the government in an effort to reassure part of the 
population about its public institutions.
<P>
	The reality is that the existing legislation contains all the 
provisions needed by the courts and crown prosecutors to give 
society proper protection. The problem is one of enforcing the 
provisions in the Young Offenders Act, and not a complete 
revision of it. In my view, changing the commas and periods in a 
text will not make it suddenly more effective.
<P>
	Did the Minister of Justice first make sure that the existing 
Young Offenders Act no longer met the needs of the public and 
society before changing it? Did the Minister of Justice first take 
into account the many recommendations by the principal 
stakeholders?
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Considering that most authorities concerned want more 
latitude in enforcing the current legislation, and not a repressive 
and intimidating reform of the act, why is the Liberal 
government nevertheless going ahead with its crusade against 
young people?
<P>
	We can only wonder why the federal government made this 
one of its key issues. The Liberals' red book holds the key. In 
fact, the Minister of Justice is using his role in the government 
merely to keep a purely partisan campaign promise, without 
regard for its economic, social and moral impact.
<P>
	It is these kinds of actions which, in my opinion, cause 
taxpayers to become disillusioned with politics. Such displays 
of disregard for institutions and the duty of the elected is 
revolting to the taxpayers of Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, I do not believe that an act should be amended 
just because 30 per cent of the population believes that crime is 
on the rise and that offences are becoming more violent, 
especially when current statistics prove the opposite. How many 
times will we have to say it? We will never resolve the problem 
of violence in society by sending people to jail earlier and 
earlier on in life.
<P>
	Longer and heavier sentences, lowering the minimum age for 
assuming criminal responsibility and extending measures 
available to repress young people will not resolve the problem 
either-they will have the opposite effect. The proposed 
amendments to the bill counter the ultimate goal: protection of 
society and of young people.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, I had the privilege-and I 
mean privilege-of visiting a halfway house, where some 20 
young men lived. I spoke with them for over an hour about their 
future and I left the place firmly believing that they deserved a 
second chance, even though they had committed reprehensible 
acts.
<P>
	I think that the government should concentrate on crime 
prevention programs. That is where emphasis should be put, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9973"> 9973 </A></B>
<P>
these programs are our greatest challenge. That is the approach 
that Quebec is taking, with great success I might add.
<P>
	In consequence, the bill's main objective should be 
reintegration. A long term crime prevention program, with the 
aim of deterring young offenders from continuing to act in a 
reprehensible way, is what is really needed.
<P>
	On this issue, Quebec is sending a clear message to Ottawa: 
``Let us continue to resolve our problems in the way we see fit 
without imposing rules to follow or amendments that may 
satisfy other provinces, but do not fit Quebec's experience at 
all''. This is another area where I think Quebec is distinct.
<P>
	Quebec has a rich experience. Those looking for inspiration 
need look no further than Quebec's Youth Protection Act. In 
addition, the work and reports of Quebec's Department of 
Health and Social Services are also good sources of information. 
Finally, studies have been conducted recently in Quebec. These 
studies, the tailor made protection, the jointly devised plan, and 
the protection of young persons, more than legislation, bring out 
the valuable experience and background of the Quebec system, 
as well as a number of problems to be resolved to ensure more 
effective enforcement of the act.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, there is a well established consensus. The 
consensus in Quebec is that the principles and rights accorded to 
the child under Quebec legislation must be preserved, while at 
the same time stipulating the means of implementation and the 
adjustments required by social change and recent legislative 
reforms.
<P>
	In regard to young offenders, Quebec's perspective and 
experience are diametrically opposed to the reforms proposed 
by the federal government. Quebec stresses rehabilitation while 
the federal government's proposals are repressive and 
hard-line. In other words, Quebec does not regard life terms 
with repeat offenders as a solution for young persons who are 
often grappling with serious family and social problems.
<P>
	In conclusion, to ease matters the Minister of Justice could 
grant Quebec special status to allow us to preserve this credible 
experience in regard to protecting young persons and this moral 
and social duty towards young Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on these amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act. Like most communities, 
Guelph-Wellington is concerned about crime and the safety of 
our community. Its people welcome any initiative that 
encourages public protection and crime prevention.
<P>
	Young offenders are not new. The House of Commons enacted 
the Juvenile Delinquents Act in 1908. The government of the 
day believed that youth were not to be treated as criminals. 
Rather, the act stated that they should be treated as misdirected 
children in need of aid, encouragement, help and assistance. It 
sought to save children through social intervention. Almost 90 
years later we are still concerned with giving children aid, 
encouragement and assistance.
<P>
	My community of Guelph-Wellington knows the 
importance of children. We pride ourselves in providing quality 
education and preparing our children for their future. Our 
industry is one of the finest in the country, built to withstand 
radical changes in the marketplace and designed to be the 
forefront of technology so our children can remain in our 
community and become active participants in our society.
<P>
	They are concerned about deficit reduction, not for their sake, 
but so their children and grandchildren will not be burdened by 
our excesses. Like almost every community in Canada, we are 
concerned about youth crime. We know the majority of our 
children are good and live their lives free of crime.
<P>
	However, others do demand our attention. We are concerned 
about them. Programs like Guelph Change Now, a crisis and 
counselling service for youth, and START from the Second 
Chance Employment Counselling, aim to help young people, 
some young offenders, in housing and life skills.
<P>
	My community knows the causes of youth crime are many. It 
wants this government here and now to deal with the issues of 
family violence, poverty and illiteracy. It also wants us to 
respond now to its dissatisfaction with the current treatment of 
violent young offenders.
<P>
	Last June 16, I attended a community forum sponsored by the 
Guelph Mercury. The forum dealt with the Young Offenders Act. 
During the discussion it became apparent that 
Guelph-Wellington residents are concerned with the 
prevention of crime. They want more respect for the law by 
putting emphasis on the home, in the schools and on preventing 
young people from becoming criminals. They also want more 
money spent on rehabilitation. This was a clear message I 
received.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Following the forum I wrote to the Minister of Justice and 
informed him that these people do not see the problem with 
legislation. Rather, they see the problem in the court room. They 
look at the courts as too lenient and so much so that our young 
people are no longer deterred by the sentencing. They ask me in 
this government to make sentencing tougher so that young 
people will realize that their actions will be punished.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9974"> 9974 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation today responds to their concerns. My 
constituents have asked us to increase sentences for teenagers 
convicted of first and second degree murder. They believe that 
five years is not enough.
<P>
	They want more young offenders tried in adult court when 
charged with serious personal injury offences and they want 
improved measures for information sharing between 
professionals. They know that it is often too easy for a young 
offender to fit between the cracks because school officials, 
police and child welfare agencies sometimes do not share 
information when the public may be at risk.
<P>
	At that forum and in letters and telephone calls I received 
from constituents, they recognize the need for rehabilitation 
services. They contact me seeking ways to improve the judicial 
system and I have heard from parents whose children disregard 
their authority because they believe that they can safely hide 
behind provisions of the Young Offenders Act. This is not right.
<P>
	These children may lose respect for authority because they 
believe that our system is too lenient. Mothers worry that their 
children from a very early age have learned not to respect the 
law. These parents and in many ways their children have asked 
us to respond. It is a clear call for help.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington residents want stiffer penalties for 
young offenders who commit serious crimes. They want victims 
to be able to make a statement if they so wish about how crime 
has affected them and they want stricter controls over the young 
offender who is in the community while serving probation and a 
quicker response if a youth should break the conditions of that 
release.
<P>
	They want the courts to have as much information as possible 
when a young offender is sentenced. Currently young offenders 
must consent to treatment. This legislation responds to my 
constituents' concern for an effective response to chronic and 
serious young offenders.
<P>
	I have said before that my constituents demand excellence in 
many of my speeches. They want legislation passed by the 
House that effectively deals with their concerns and improves 
the quality of life for them and their families.
<P>
	This bill betters the Young Offenders Act and enables it to 
deal more effectively with serious youth crime. The changes 
proposed in this legislation help further protect our community 
where you and I live. Their aim is to make young people more 
responsible for their actions while recognizing the special 
circumstances of their youth.
<P>
	They respond to the concerns of people in 
Guelph-Wellington and elsewhere in order to make our 
community better. Sergeant Brent Eden of the young offenders 
branch of the Guelph police force described to the people who 
attended the forum on the Young Offenders Act as concerned 
with making things better, not just blaming the system, not just 
blaming the police and not just blaming the government.
<P>
	These people know that this legislation will make things 
better. They have told me that the police support this legislation. 
That is what they want from this government, that it is what they 
demand from this government.
<P>
	These amendments continue our goals of offering aid, 
encouragement, help and assistance to our children. The goals 
are simple. Punish those who commit the crime and help 
rehabilitate these young people so that they can contribute to our 
society.
<P>
	We want tough legislation which gives a clear message. We 
will not tolerate murder, assault and other criminal acts. We 
want to help our young people but we will not accept certain 
behaviour. This behaviour will be punished.
<P>
	During the last federal election I promised the people of 
Guelph-Wellington that I would support reforms to the Young 
Offenders Act. It was asked many times of me. They want things 
to deter young people from committing crime, something to 
provide real justice and to rehabilitate our young people to help 
them build better lives. This legislation and the broad review 
which will be taken by the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs does just that.
<P>
	These deserve our support. These respond to the concerns 
expressed by my constituents and people across Canada.
<P>
	In its own platform, the Reform Party promised Canadians 
adequate punishment for young offenders. I look forward to its 
support for this bill because it keeps that promise as well.
<P>
	The majority of our young people know that hard work and 
education will be the key for their success. They want to 
contribute to making our country better and to be a part of the 
Canadian dream. They want children of their own.
<P>
	For their sake and for ours, I will support Bill C-37 and call on 
this House to vote in favour of this bill; legislation that aids, 
helps, assists and encourages our children and our future.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of providing a fairer future for Atlantic Canada by adopting policies 
and programs to create jobs through initiative funds for co-operatives, 
encouraging small business, upgrading municipal infrastructures and 
diversifying single industry communities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking the member for 
Moncton for seconding my motion. Basically, as the motion 
indicates, I am calling on the government to consider the 
advisability of providing a fairer future for Atlantic Canada by 
adopting policies and programs to create jobs through initiative 
funds for co-operatives, encouraging small business, upgrading 
municipal infrastructures and diversifying single industry 
communities.
<P>
	Basically this motion is broad enough to include a major 
reassessment of government policy toward Atlantic Canada, a 
reassessment of whether those policies have been successful and 
an opportunity to consider maybe doing things in a rather 
different way.
<P>
	What I will do is not spend too much time on the problems but 
put forward some ideas for solutions. I will draw upon the recent 
experience in Saskatchewan and British Columbia with regard 
to mechanisms for bringing together diverse groups in our 
society with the aim of building a vision for the future to which 
we can all be committed and to which we can then direct 
government policy and regulation.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada has long been a region dependent on its 
natural resources and on the involvement of the public sector. 
Both have been allowed to decline as government policies and 
private sector decisions have conspired to create an 
environment that undermines long term development and 
sustainability of many of the communities and economies of the 
region.
<P>
	The economic and political policies of the past that have 
resulted in the underdevelopment of the Atlantic region must be 
challenged and overcome. Policies that have promoted the 
export of unprocessed and semi-processed resources along with 
jobs that otherwise might be involved in that value added 
activity must be replaced with value added production and the 
skilled jobs that accompany those processes.
<P>
	This will require the federal and provincial governments to be 
much more involved with the local communities in reaching this 
goal. Also we have to be cognizant of the impact of federal 
cutbacks over the last decade to the support structure of both 
rural and urban life in Atlantic Canada and be prepared to 
respond to those extra difficulties.
<P>
	The future course of economic development must begin with 
the involvement of people in their communities working with 
their governments. This will require a new partnership with the 
federal government, the people, the communities and 
institutions; a partnership unlike any relationship that currently 
exists in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	In order to make that relationship work we must commit 
ourselves to some real and achievable goals. It should not be 
unreasonable to expect in Atlantic Canada that we move toward 
full employment; that we move toward a full opportunity 
economy which builds on the diversity of Atlantic Canada and 
ensures the full participation of women, youth, aboriginal 
people, visible minorities and people with disabilities.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	It should be within our realm of opportunity to consider the 
importance of community involvement and the community 
control of economic decision-making. We should be building an 
economy based on environmentally sustainable economic 
principles. Nowhere other than in the Atlantic provinces have 
we seen the impact of not ensuring that our economic policies 
are environmentally sustainable.
<P>
	We should be able to ensure the protection and the 
improvement of our social programs to support Atlantic 
Canadians in their times of difficulty between jobs and 
particularly now when we see that a major resource is simply not 
there to support the population as it did previously.
<P>
	We need a new emphasis on co-operative development, an 
emphasis that places people and their communities ahead of 
corporate profit. We also need transportation systems that meet 
the needs of the regions so that products made within the region 
can effectively be moved to markets.
<P>
	Atlantic regional development is not just about increasing 
incomes. Development is a process by which human capabilities 
and natural resources combine to fulfil social, cultural, 
political, psychological and material needs. This is a process in 
which increased self-reliance, independence of individuals, 
communities and the region are achieved by building on the 
strength that thrives on the interdependence of equals.
<P>
	As someone who lived in Atlantic Canada for more than a 
decade, there are no more independent people in the country, 
wanting to work together for the benefit of all rather than work 
against each other so that only a few benefit.
<P>
	Development can only be sustained if it strengthens the social 
fabric, building a consensus as to goals, values and means and 
focusing on increased productivity and the needs and potential 
of those in society, particularly the most disadvantaged. An 
integral component of real economic development strategy for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9976"> 9976 </A></B>
<P>
Atlantic Canada is the reduction of the inequity of incomes and 
the removal of the pain of poverty for so many of our citizens. It 
is  clear from the writings of a wide range of economists that 
inequality of income is a major drain on economic growth.
<P>
	These goals of building together will only be achieved if the 
process is from the bottom up, with people participating in the 
decisions that affect them. People in communities must 
recognize that they have a capacity and a responsibility to shape 
and direct the development process at all levels. That capacity 
and responsibility must be encouraged through the planning 
process and through the role that government plays.
<P>
	The regional development policies of previous governments 
have always been controlled from the top down. Surely we  
believe that people in the community have the best interests of 
that community at heart. People who are rooted in a community 
have the most at stake in evaluating and encouraging sustainable 
development. It is critical that we use that resource, that 
understanding and that community commitment. We should 
support community economic development that gives 
communities a true sense of ownership and increases local 
control over the economy.
<P>
	It has been very clear that allowing people to come in from 
outside, reap the profits and leave is a devastating strategy and 
one that has long term negative effects, not long term beneficial 
effects. As much as possible development should be owned and 
managed locally, be located within the community, provide 
work for local people, make use of local materials and serve 
community needs for products and services. The best types of 
economic development activities are those that maintain a 
community focus.
<P>
	Let me make one more general comment with regard to this. If 
economic development is to work in Atlantic Canada it must 
pursue the principle of economic self-reliance. It is no longer 
possible in this country, if it ever was possible, to maintain 
industries and economic units that are no longer efficient. We 
need to pursue a principle of economic self-reliance, harnessing 
all of its resources to both determine and meet the needs of the 
people of Atlantic Canada. As I have said, that means the control 
of the resources and economic institutions must be much more 
firmly in the hands of Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	In order to ensure that community economic development 
objectives are met, one strategy would be to encourage the 
development of locally based community development 
organizations. They could represent all sectors of the 
community. Their function could be to oversee discussions, 
decisions and implementation of development projects.
<P>
	This would ensure that the communities, in co-operation with 
the private and public sectors, would be instrumental in making 
decisions about the kind of development that would occur and 
would be able to ensure the community would benefit most from 
that development.
<P>
	They could be coalitions of local, social, business, financial 
and labour organizations, as well as co-operatives and 
governments. They could perform the function of co-ordinating 
development within those various regions. They could be 
responsible for the allocation of whatever public funds might be 
available within those regions to ensure that those funds are 
used to the best possible advantage.
<P>
	One very good example of how this could work is in Cape 
Breton. An organization called New Dawn Enterprises, which I 
have visited in the past, has assisted in developing a network of 
firms and facilities throughout Cape Breton. This development 
corporation holds assets of some $10 million and has become 
involved in a very wide range of activities from construction to 
real estate to care for the elderly. There are examples within 
Atlantic Canada we could learn from and utilize across the 
whole region.
<P>
	Across Atlantic Canada there is a large, effective, efficient 
and responsive network of co-operatives we could also build on. 
Atlantic Canadians have built a co-operative movement which 
attests to their resilience and creativity in the face of adversity. 
Those co-operatives maintain jobs in the communities, provide 
services to the communities and provide local control to ensure 
that local needs are met. People have a stake in those enterprises 
and they often are more productive as a result.
<P>
	It is necessary to ensure, at both the federal and provincial 
levels of government, that we remove any barriers to 
co-operative development and that we ensure and encourage the 
development of co-operatives across the region.
<P>
	This is clearly an integral part of the development of Atlantic 
Canada. In the last decade, 1980 to 1989, small firms created 90 
per cent of the new jobs in Atlantic Canada, while large firms 
saw reductions in employment capacities.
<P>
	A report that was done by Enterprise Cape Breton found it was 
locally based operations which were the most successful. 
Projects that received $100,000 or less in the form of support 
had a success rate of 72 per cent, at an average cost of $23,000 
per job, while those projects receiving $1 million or more had a 
failure rate of 71 per cent, with an average cost of $154,000 per 
job. The proof in Atlantic Canada is that it is small business that 
is going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9977"> 9977 </A></B>
<P>
to create jobs, and it is small business on which we should focus 
our activities.
<P>
	The agencies that we have in operation in Atlantic Canada 
also need to be reconsidered. As I have pointed out they have not 
worked very well. Their support, in  large sums of money, to 
large enterprises have not given benefit to the community as one 
would have wanted. However, support in small sums to small 
businesses have done so. We need to ensure that the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency really becomes an advocate for 
employment creation and economic development in the region 
and is not used, as it has been in that past, as a political slush 
fund. We need to reconsider and reassess the agencies that we 
use as arms of government in the development of Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	I have talked about co-operatives but credit unions also have 
an important role in Atlantic Canada and we need to encourage 
them as well. I will give one example of a real success story to 
show how credit unions can really contribute to the economic 
development of the region.
<P>
	In 1984, in Eagle River, Labrador, the Bank of Montreal 
closed its branch saying it was no longer a viable operation, 
which is a fairly familiar picture across Canada. With the aid of 
the Labrador Fishermen's Union Shrimp Company the 
community was able to establish its own credit union. In fact, it 
had the co-operation of the caisse populaire located in the 
neighbouring Quebec community. The credit union has been 
able to provide basic essential financial services to people in 
that area.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	In the less than four years that this financial institution has 
existed it has provided more than $3 million in loans to local 
residents. It is a viable, profitable and locally owned enterprise, 
showing that credit unions can have a major role to play in the 
development of Atlantic Canada and across the country.
<P>
	We should do what we can to support and nurture credit 
unions, especially those that are small and just beginning and 
need some support. There are many things that we can do. For 
example, governments could use credit unions much more than 
they do now as the depositories of funds or as their current 
accounts.
<P>
	Much of Atlantic Canada is made up of single industry towns. 
Those are vulnerable communities, vulnerable economic units. 
Atlantic Canada is fortunate to have such resources in our 
communities but they must be managed by those who have the 
greatest stake in ensuring the long term viability of those 
resources in those communities, the people themselves.
<P>
	Several resource based industries are in crisis and we should 
not tolerate that situation any longer. The most obvious of 
course is the fishery. Many of us today received representations 
indicating that a stock that had not been fished all that much in 
the past, turbot, is now under serious threat as a result of 
overfishing. It is important for Canada to exert its jurisdictional 
power to make sure that this resource does not go the way of the 
cod stocks which we all know so much about.
<P>
	It is important for single industry towns, based on natural 
resources and non-renewable resources, to be much more 
effectively upgraded in the interest of the communities in which 
they operate.
<P>
	I will not say any more about the fisheries. We all know what a 
disaster that has been. It is primarily a disaster because of 
federal policy mismanagement over the last few years, 
something we cannot do anything about now but something we 
do have to remember and treat as a lesson in the future.
<P>
	The same sorts of concerns can be expressed about the 
forestry industry. In comparison to forestry industries in the rest 
of the world, a great proportion of forestry in Atlantic Canada is 
privately owned: New Brunswick, 49 per cent; Nova Scotia, 
about 70 per cent. This resource has not been used for the benefit 
of those living in Atlantic Canada but rather to benefit the 
corporations that control it and, which incidentally, pursue 
forestry practices that in their home countries they would not be 
able to pursue.
<P>
	Therefore, we have to ensure that resource is also one for the 
benefit of the communities in question and for the benefit of 
Atlantic Canada. It must be developed in a way that is 
sustainable, to provide jobs and economic opportunities for 
Atlantic Canadians well into the future and ensure that young 
people from Atlantic Canada do not have to leave their homes in 
order to find economic opportunity.
<P>
	In my last few moments I would like to make a quick 
reference to developments in two provinces and two resource 
based provinces which might be of use in considering how to 
develop Atlantic Canada. Let me first take the example of 
British Columbia and the arrangements that have been made 
there in order to develop the forestry industry.
<P>
	We know that in the past there has been enormous tension 
between the forestry companies and environmentalists, between 
communities and environmentalists, the workers in the forestry 
industry and environmentalists. We know we have to resolve 
those differences.
<P>
	What British Columbia did in a unique way was bring those 
different interests together and work with them to find a vision 
for the future of that region. Everyone made sacrifices and 
everyone gained. However, in the end there was a common 
vision adopted to which everyone could be committed and to 
which everyone could work. That is the clear focus. We have to 
change the way in which we consider economic development. 
We have to make sure we all work together to the best advantage 
of all.

<P>
	I would certainly recommend that B.C. approach Atlantic 
Canadians and the federal-provincial governments, labour 
unions within the province, the business community, the 
communities themselves and environmentalists within Atlantic 
Canada. That should be pursued as a goal for economic 
opportunity development in the region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as an 
Atlantic Canadian it is a pleasure to speak on this motion. The 
motion by the NDP member strikes to the core of what we are 
talking about in Atlantic Canada as we try to improve our lot and 
to become a have part of our country.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the infrastructure program. I would 
also like to talk about my own community of greater Moncton. It 
shares some of the problems alluded to in the motion, 
particularly having a single industry. The Canadian National 
Railway employed upward of 5,000 people and will effectively 
close. What does that mean to a community such as Moncton 
and what we have been able to do both on our own and with 
assistance? I will quickly talk about the infrastructure program 
and then move on to my own experiences.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is near and dear to my heart. In my 
other life as mayor and councillor of the city of Moncton, I had 
the good fortune to be on the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities task force dealing with infrastructure. It was a 
program which was advocated for many years and it took the 
Liberal government to actually put it into effect. We are seeing 
massive benefits throughout the country, particularly in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	In my own riding of Moncton we were given roughly $4 
million of federal funding for the infrastructure program. To 
date with the projects that we have on the go in our community, 
we are going to see an investment of roughly $30 million.
<P>
	For a Canadian federal government program, seeing an 
investment of $4 million turn into $30 million is an investment 
and not an expenditure. That is why the infrastructure program 
works in Atlantic Canada. That is why it is of benefit.
<P>
	I would like to refer the House to some of the things that are 
happening as a result of the infrastructure program in Atlantic 
Canada. These agreements represent a total federal investment 
in the Atlantic region of $181 million. That in turn will generate 
equal investments on behalf of the provinces and the 
municipalities for a total investment of $540 million into the 
Atlantic economy resulting from the Canada infrastructure 
program.
<P>
	It is estimated that over 9,500 person years of employment 
will be created in the region, both on and off the project sites 
across Atlantic Canada. As of December 31, 1994 over 575 
projects have already been approved in Atlantic Canada. This 
represents a total  investment of $450 million in the Atlantic 
Canada economy and will create over 7,300 jobs in the region.
<P>
	Projects under way under the infrastructure agreements in the 
Atlantic region range from installation and upgrading of sewer 
systems to rebuilding roadways and linking up public schools to 
the electronic highway.
<P>
	More than 60 per cent of the federal dollars committed in the 
Atlantic region are for water and sewer projects. Almost 12 per 
cent of the federal investment is to construct and repair 
municipal roads. Another 16 per cent is committed for 
community based projects. High technology projects are also 
being supported and account for 4 per cent of the federal 
government contribution.
<P>
	Those are all good projects, projects that really make things 
happen in Atlantic Canada. That is why the infrastructure 
program is a success.
<P>
	We are looking for partnerships. We are looking for spinoffs 
associated with this program. That is what we have done in my 
riding of Moncton and what we have done throughout Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	When we see an investment of roughly $200 million in 
Atlantic Canada spinning off to roughly $600 million and then 
going higher to $800 million and $900 million, this is an 
investment, not an expenditure.
<P>
	We listen to Reform Party members on their position with 
respect to the infrastructure program but mind you, they still 
take the dollars when it comes to their ridings. When we listen to 
what they say about Atlantic Canada and where we should be, 
the Reform Party is of the view that the only solution offered to 
Atlantic Canada is to tell them to move. ``Get them out of 
Atlantic Canada,'' is the Reform Party solution.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	To quote the Reform Party again, its finance critic says: ``The 
rest of Canada is not prepared to foot the bill for Atlantic 
Canada''. There is no bill. We are making a contribution in this 
country. We are making things happen and the Reform Party's 
view is: ``Tell them to move''. Shame on them.
<P>
	To quote the Reform Party's budget on page 34: ``There would 
be some short term costs associated with fiscal retrenchment. 
These costs would come primarily in the form of adjustments 
that economic sectors and regions of our economy most 
dependent on government transfers would have to make''. The 
code words: Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Going on to page 36: ``Under the Reform budget, the short 
term employment impact of spending and deficit reduction is 
negative but manageable''. It will not be manageable in Atlantic 
Canada if it goes through with its program to eliminate ACOA, 
which has created 42,000 jobs in its first five years and has 
stimulated major private sector investments of $2.4 billion. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9979"> 9979 </A></B>
<P>
ACOA pays for itself. It is an investment that generates $4.2 
dollars of benefit for every dollar of public funding spent.
<P>
	We are not prepared to sign on to the Reform Party budget that 
would see 65,000 Atlantic Canadians out of work over the next 
five years. We are not signing on for the principle that we should 
move somewhere else because Atlantic Canada, in my humble 
opinion, is the best place in all of Canada in which to live.
<P>
	I want to talk about a community that has pulled itself up by 
the bootstraps. That is my community of greater Moncton. We 
experienced the upper Canadian and western Canada view that 
we should just shut down everything in Atlantic Canada. We lost 
Eaton's catalogue, Swift's and the Canadian National Railway 
Company. They were all major employers in our community.
<P>
	We turned around and made investments in our community. 
We made investments in our downtown and in a new way of 
doing things. Arising out of those investments now is the fastest 
growing community in Atlantic Canada, greater Moncton. For 
the edification of the Reform Party The Wall Street Journal 
wrote about the community of greater Moncton: ``It is the call 
centre for North America. It is the centre that is showing the 
way, the new wave of the new economy, to the rest of Canada and 
to North America''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are not real jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> They are real jobs. We are employing people. 
On top of that, we recognized that we were a bilingual 
community and that was an asset. We built on l'Université de 
Moncton, on the bilingual nature of our community. Now we are 
employing people and making things happen.
<P>
	These people do not want to move. They want to stay in 
Moncton. They want to stay in Atlantic Canada. We even have 
people coming from British Columbia who now want to live in 
our community. We are seeing a migration to Moncton rather 
than away from it.
<P>
	I say to Reform Party members: They should rethink their 
budget and their approach to regional development. Recognize 
that Atlantic Canada is a great place to be. It is going to be a have 
part of this country in the not too distant future because we are 
taking advantage of those investments this Liberal government 
is giving us. That is why we support this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the official opposition critic on regional development, I rise 
to participate in this debate on the motion put forward by the 
hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing.
<P>
	First of all, I feel that elected representatives from all parts of 
Canada are all concerned about economic development. This is 
extremely important under the current economic conditions, 
especially since we know that it is essential to create jobs to stop 
stagnating and start moving toward economic and structural 
development.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I am a little surprised by the motion. This motion respecting 
federal assistance for Atlantic Canada's economic development, 
which was put forward by my colleague from 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, touches on, among other things, 
the importance of a better future for the Maritimes. This concern 
is quite commendable, in my opinion.
<P>
	With all due respect, this motion reflects a certain lack of 
knowledge about the federal government's regional 
development policies and about Quebec's traditional demands 
regarding regional development.
<P>
	I wish to state in this House my position on this motion 
concerning equity in federal contributions to Atlantic Canada's 
regional development. The Bloc Quebecois must, of course, 
show some opposition to such a motion.
<P>
	Allow me in the next few minutes to elaborate on some of the 
reasons why Quebec must give priority to its own regional 
development.
<P>
	The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency or ACOA is the 
federal government's main regional development agency in 
Atlantic Canada. The ACOA mostly deals with small business, 
helping to launch new ventures and modernize existing 
companies. On November 30, 1993, the federal government's 
contribution amounted to $865 million out of the total $1 billion 
budget forecast, or $431 per capita.
<P>
	Until very recently, the federal government's main regional 
development agency in Quebec was the Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec or FORDQ. Since the FORDQ 
was created in 1991, its mandate has been to emphasize 
long-term economic development and job creation.
<P>
	However, given its limited financial resources, the FORDQ 
will pay more attention to small business by offering 
information and analysis services and promoting exports. This 
is a far cry from the basic principles of local development.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, why would Quebec want to invest 
additional public funds in Atlantic Canada? On July 20, 1994, 
the federal government's share-close to $350 million-had 
still not been committed in Quebec. The total budget for the 
economic and regional development agreement is $1.6 billion, 
or, and this is the total budget, $64 per capita in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9980"> 9980 </A></B>
<P>
	In Western Canada, in British Columbia, Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Western Economic 
Diversification Canada or WED is the main federal vehicle for 
regional development.
<P>
	As of November 30, 1993, spending under these programs 
totalled $936 million. The ERDA provides for a budget of $1.l2 
billion or $160 per capita. That is, very briefly, what regional 
development looks like in Canada, and I want the hon. member 
to pay attention to these figures and this breakdown of federal 
regional development assistance.
<P>
	There is no common standard for the West, the Maritimes and 
Quebec. The federal contribution to these agreements is $64 per 
capita in Quebec, compared to $160 in the western provinces 
and $431 in the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	So why should Quebec support a motion that would increase 
federal assistance to the Atlantic provinces, when some 
provinces seem to be more equal than others?
<P>
	The 1993 and 1994 Estimates indicate that the federal 
government spends less on regional development in Quebec 
than anywhere else. In fact, the budget for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency is $314 million, the budget for the 
Department of Western Economic Diversification is $238 
million, and the budget for the FORDQ is $232 million.
<P>
	However, the total population of these other provinces is less 
than the total population of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	In his last budget, the finance minister announced a cut of $70 
million in the subsidies and contributions for the FORDQ. 
Quebec's regions are the big losers as far as federal funding is 
concerned. Since 1983, annual federal funding for regional 
development increased only 50 per cent in Quebec, but 250 per 
cent in the Maritimes and 300 per cent in the West.
<P>
	In other words, through the federal government, Quebec 
funds regional development programs and policies it is not in a 
position to implement in its own regions. The 1993-94 budget 
for the Quebec Regional Affairs Secretariat is for $71 million, 
while Quebec's part under agreements concluded with the west 
and the maritimes amounts to $550 million, or 25 per cent of the 
$2.2 billion federal budget.
<P>
	Ottawa's regional development policies are clearly 
discriminatory toward Quebec. If the amount Quebec receives 
from the federal government in transfer payments and for all 
kinds of national programs is approximately equal to the tax it 
pays to the federal government, this is among other things 
thanks to transfer payments earmarked for income security and 
the unemployment insurance program. In other words, for want 
of a true regional development policy in Quebec, the federal 
government is maintaining poverty and unemployment there. 
This is why Quebec is calling for and has for years called for the 
repatriation of all  regional development responsibilities. The 
Bloc Quebecois therefore has no choice but to oppose a motion 
entailing an increase in moneys for regional development in the 
maritimes.
<P>
	Regional development is of course not a distinct area of 
jurisdiction in the Canadian constitution, as a result of which 
Quebec is forced to engage in endless negotiations to arrive at 
agreements. Unfailingly, these agreements ultimately authorize 
the federal government to interfere repeatedly and awkwardly in 
regional development. It is interference. The regions in Quebec 
suffer from duplication of efforts in regional development 
matters and from the lack of consistency in government policy.
<P>
	Which brings us back to what the present Liberal government 
is doing, namely structural duplication giving rise to 
considerable operating costs as opposed to real investments in 
development, as well as multiplicity of government parties 
involved which frequently results in confusion among regional 
stakeholders. Quebec has adopted an overall regional 
development plan, an overall plan for each of its sixteen 
administrative regions. This is why, and justly so, it wants to get 
back from the federal government the resources it should 
receive for regional development. Let us first establish fairness 
in redistributing federal moneys for regional development 
before broaching the subject of the gap between what Quebec 
and other regions in Canada receive.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to the motion. It was not clear to me in 
the original motion whether or not the suggestion was being 
made to put more money into Atlantic Canada. If that is the case 
we would oppose it.
<P>
	There is much talk about what Atlantic Canada needs. The 
proposer of the motion suggested full employment. Whilst full 
employment would be good for Atlantic Canada, I suggest that it 
would be good across the country. However the full employment 
goal will not be achieved. Regardless of how much is spent in 
the country or how good the opportunities are, full employment 
is unachievable.
<P>
	The presenter of the motion also said that regional 
development policies and programs have been managed from 
the top down. That is so. ACOA is a prime example. Western 
Economic Diversification is another example as is FORD-Q.
<P>
	For labour and communities to co-ordinate how we are to 
improve the economy in Atlantic Canada is a good avenue, but it 
is also a good avenue to pursue right across the country. 
Co-operatives are in existence so these things can happen if the 
people want them to happen. That kind of activity does not need 
government intervention.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9981"> 9981 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The mover of the motion suggested the fisheries problems in 
Atlantic Canada were a result of government bungling. We all 
know that to be so on both the east coast and west coast. That is 
unfortunate. The less government we have in the country the 
better off we will be. To try to increase government is not the 
way to go.
<P>
	The proposer of the motion also suggested that young people 
should not have to leave home. While that again is nice to say, 
the reality is that young people leave home. Young people go 
where there is work. Young people leave home for various 
reasons. To expect young people to stay in Atlantic Canada any 
more than they do in the towns of Ontario, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba or wherever is unrealistic.
<P>
	I am quite impressed with the skills of the provincial 
governments in Atlantic Canada. Frank McKenna in New 
Brunswick impressed the nation with some of his moves to get 
business into New Brunswick. Clyde Wells in Newfoundland is 
also making good innovative approaches to improve its 
economy. That is what really needs to happen. It is up to the 
people themselves. I do not think the federal government 
necessarily plays a big role in this activity.
<P>
	One of the real potentials I see in Atlantic Canada is the cost 
of land and housing. For example, young people growing up in 
the area I come from in the lower mainland of British Columbia 
cannot afford to buy houses or to buy land. It is just too 
expensive for them. I see the day when young people will be 
going back to the eastern part of the country. They will look to 
where there are appropriate housing costs. They will look to 
where they can buy land, live and raise families. The potential of 
Atlantic Canada will be much greater in the future because of the 
natural evolution of the country. As a result of the younger 
generation moving we will see jobs being created. In areas like 
the lower mainland of British Columbia we will see an outflow 
of younger people for that reason.
<P>
	Where there are successes there are failures. We only have to 
look at some of the activities of ACOA to see failures in the 
nation as far as regional development and western economic 
diversification are concerned. It is a presumption of government 
that it knows best how to spend our money.
<P>
	The minister responsible for ACOA recently said that there 
would be no grants. A lot of that came from the pressure we put 
on the government. As a result we now have ACOA giving out 
loans that basically FBDB should be giving out. Why ACOA is 
not cancelled today is difficult to understand. There are 
institutions in the country that can look after the affairs ACOA 
used to look after or the new responsibilities of ACOA. We need 
not have that bureaucracy in existence.
<P>
	I look forward to seeing what the Minister of Finance will do 
next Monday with the operations of ACOA, Western Economic 
Diversification and FORD-Q if he is truly interested in making 
some positive changes in the country.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada needs less government, not more 
government.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Owners of some businesses who receive grants, and they are 
the minority of businesses, will not say that. When we really get 
down to the people who are paying the taxes for the money going 
to those businesses, they are saying: ``Look, we would rather 
have the money in our pockets. Create businesses and create 
wealth from our perspective. Don't give it to the friends of the 
recipients over there''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Moncton talked about infrastructure. He 
suggested that infrastructure was an investment and not a cost. I 
have the greatest of difficulty with that philosophy. The 
infrastructure started by the Liberal government came into place 
as a result of its commitment to jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	The Liberals said that they were going to spend $2 billion at 
the federal level and $2 billion at the provincial level if they 
chipped in. Also the municipalities were to throw in $2 billion. 
What was not acknowledged was that there was only one 
taxpayer paying this money. The government took over a $40 
billion deficit, $40 billion of overspending, and then said that it 
would spend some more. It was going to borrow another $6 
billion from taxpayers to start an infrastructure program to show 
the whole country it could create jobs.
<P>
	Yes, it did. It created short term jobs. In the long run that is 
unhealthy for the country. It does not help at all. Only when we 
have a continuous infrastructure can it be of benefit to the 
country. We cannot have it continuously because we are 
borrowing too much money. We have too high a debt load.
<P>
	It was patently wrong for the hon. member for Moncton to 
suggest that bad Reformers over here were treating Atlantic 
Canadians indifferently or incorrectly because they were against 
infrastructure. The fact is that the infrastructure is not good for 
taxpayers across the country regardless of what province they 
live in.
<P>
	I trust the motion is not asking for more money. I trust it 
speaks to the fact that Atlantic Canadians can help themselves 
just like anybody else anywhere in the country. All the more 
credit to them.
<P>
	If we want to look at ingenuity in the country we can look at 
Atlantic Canada where the provinces for years have had less 
money than many other provinces. They seem to dig down, dig 
deep, work hard, innovate and come up with answers that many 
of us across the country should be looking at and following. We 
should be using some of their initiative. Hats off to Premier 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9982"> 9982 </A></B>
<P>
Frank McKenna. He is on the right track as far as any 
government in the land is concerned.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the motion put 
forward by the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing 
who has spent some time in his past life in my riding of Halifax.
<P>
	I thank him for his motion because it is refreshing to finally 
hear some understanding of Atlantic Canada being expressed by 
members on the other side. Also, the motion serves as an 
important reminder to government members as well as we enter 
into the final days before our budget.
<P>
	The motion voices the belief shared by the vast majority of 
Canadians and promoted by the government that there is a 
vibrant future for Atlantic Canada and that it has much to 
contribute, as it always has, to the future of the country. 
Government has a role to play to ensure a fairer, more equitable 
and just future for Atlantic Canada by encouraging policies and 
programs to create jobs through initiative funds for 
co-operatives, encouraging small business, upgrading 
municipal infrastructure and diversifying single industry 
communities.
<P>
	Never before has it been so important for government to 
provide the encouragement and framework for economic 
self-reliance. Given the current fiscal situation, government is 
faced with doing more for Canadians with ever fewer resources. 
Canadians expect their government to approach economic 
development with a keener business sense, expecting greater 
returns on their investment.
<P>
	This is why the motion is so important. It underscores the 
innovative and productive ways in which the federal 
government, in partnership with the provinces, the private 
sector, communities and most important of all the people, can 
kindle and encourage the entrepreneurial spirit in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	It is also timely, coming as it does in the wake of the thinly 
veiled attack on Atlantic Canada by members of the Reform 
Party with the release of that manifesto yesterday. The Atlantic 
culture, its way of life, the vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, must 
be kindled, encouraged and recognized for what it really is: 
strong, proud and independent. Our national policies must 
reflect this reality.
<P>
	Unlike the Reform Party, we cannot afford to base 
government policies on offensive stereotypes. The Reform 
Party in past comments by its MPs and in its manifesto on deficit 
reduction released yesterday attempts to propagate the ignorant 
stereotype that Atlantic Canada is a wasteland filled with 
dependent and enslaved welfare recipients and working stiffs 
who are a drain on the national treasury and economy, and the 
italics are theirs.
<P>
	As an Atlantic Canadian I find these gross generalizations 
very offensive, but then again why should I expect anything 
different? We hear policies on women, on the family and on race 
that are a testament to the fact that the Reform Party prefers 
ideologically driven false assumptions. Sure, if stereotypes held 
true the world's problems would be a lot simpler to deal with but 
reality constantly confirms that they are not true.
<P>
	When a regionally based political party from the west 
recommends solutions based on untrue stereotypes of a group of 
people who live in another region of the country we have the 
makings for divisive, dangerous and destructive debate.
<P>
	Those of us from the region know that nothing can be further 
from the truth. By perpetrating these offensive stereotypes the 
Reform Party is attacking the very foundation of Atlantic 
Canada. It is maligning the region's hard working men and 
women. We must recognize that the people of Atlantic Canada 
are the key to economic development, the people who have lived 
and laboured and not only survived but flourished in this region 
over the last half millennium and longer in the case of our 
aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	As elected representatives we have a responsibility now more 
than ever to promote and protect their interests here in Ottawa; 
their real interests, not those imagined interests seen through the 
lens of destructive stereotypes.
<P>
	For the Reform Party the solution to Atlantic Canada is 
simple. It wants a government sponsored and enforced 
migration program. Again, this is confirmed in the document 
released yesterday and in statements made by members of its 
caucus. They advocate that UI and other benefits be dependent 
on the willingness to relocate.
<P>
	The Reform MP from Capilano-Howe Sound is quoted as 
saying people should be moving to jobs and the rest of Canada is 
not prepared to foot the bill for the alleged dependency in the 
Atlantic region.
<P>
	These approaches would make government a destructive 
force in the lives of Atlantic Canadians as opposed to a catalyst 
for economic and social development.
<P>
	For that reason I would like to speak today about Atlantic 
Canada, about the diversity of its economy, the aspirations of its 
people and the real future that we in Atlantic Canada are 
working toward.
<P>
	Members of the Reform would do well to listen and perhaps, 
although unlikely, learn something about the region. The 
government has a role and I would like to provide some 
examples of areas where we have been successful.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9983"> 9983 </A></B>
<P>
	We in the government recognize that the people of Atlantic 
Canada are the key. I can think of no greater example of 
community based grassroots development initiatives than those 
of the co-operative movement which was founded in Atlantic 
Canada. It is recognized as one of the region's major economic 
players despite its modest beginnings. Today co-operatives are 
involved in financial services, insurance, consumer products, 
manufacturing, processing, housing projects and in various 
worker owned co-ops.
<P>
	Their strength can be summarized in a few words: knowledge 
of the people and the community. Their innovation is reflected 
in some recent senior housing developments and the 
introduction four years ago of a venture capital funding 
instrument by the caisse populaire movement in New 
Brunswick, to cite but a few.
<P>
	Experience in Europe and elsewhere demonstrates the 
amazing potential for this type of initiative to contribute to 
economic development.
<P>
	Approximately 750,000 people, 30 per cent of the Atlantic 
population, are members of or use the services of co-operatives. 
Five hundred thousand Atlantic Canadians are members of 
credit unions and caisses populaires which administer $2.4 
billion in assets in the region. They employ 2,000 people. 
Insurance co-ops have another 477 employees; consumer 
co-operatives, 2,400 employees. The major co-operative 
employer, however, is the producer co-operative, with close to 
6,000 employees.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I want to stress that a co-operative is more than a business. Its 
raison d'être is the economic and social betterment of its 
members and the community. The human aspect takes a central 
role with the co-operative movement and this is a real asset. 
Approximately 11,000 Atlantic Canadians are employed in this 
system; a major employer by any standard.
<P>
	In the area of small business we have great success in Atlantic 
Canada. It is the engine of economic growth throughout Canada, 
most particularly in the Atlantic region. Small business and the 
growth of new business is alive and well. The rate of small 
business start-ups has continued to grow. The number of small 
businesses, those with fewer than 100 employees, grew to 
83,000 from 53,000 in the ten-year period from 1981 to 1991. 
The number of large businesses with more than 500 employees 
decreased marginally. We are experiencing an unprecedented 
increase in the business start-up rate and job creation in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	The number one priority of this government has been robust in 
the maritimes with the inception of the Canada infrastructure 
works program, a program which it seems is singularly difficult 
for the members opposite to grasp.
<P>
	As of December 31 over 575 programs have been approved in 
Atlantic Canada, from installing and upgrading sewer systems 
to rebuilding roadways. This represents investments of $450 
million and will create over 7,300 jobs in the region.
<P>
	The government has made its number one priority to restore 
the dignity of Canadians by putting them back to work. This 
government received an overwhelming mandate from 
Canadians in every region to do just that.
<P>
	The minister responsible for ACOA said recently that what is 
good for Atlantic Canada is good for all of Canada. I know that 
Reform members have difficulty with this. That is because they 
do not have a national vision and they do not share the Canadian 
belief that we must continue to work together in every region of 
the country toward economic and social development.
<P>
	I am delighted to speak in support of this motion. I am 
delighted to stand in this House and explode some of the myths 
perpetrated about Atlantic Canadians by members on the 
opposite side. I am delighted to speak, in particular, about 
co-operatives, coming from the province of Nova Scotia, the 
home of Monsignor Moses Coady and Father James Tompkins, 
the fathers of the co-operative movement worldwide.
<P>
	It is a proud thing to be an Atlantic Canadian. It is a great 
thing to be an Atlantic Canadian standing in this House 
representing other Atlantic Canadians. I invite members on the 
other side who do not seem to understand that pride, that 
heritage, that culture and that future to come see us. We will 
show you where the real world is.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated 
as a votable item, the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired, and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper pursuant to Standing Order 96.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DAIRYFARMERS">DAIRY FARMERS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
United States is getting ready to encroach on an area and our 
farmers are not at all happy about it. In Quebec, farmers know 
what supply management means.
<P>
	In December 1993, I participated in an information session 
put on by the UPA in Beauce. The meeting was held in 
Saint-Georges. We were told, with input by Yvon Proulx, senior 
economist at the UPA, that, under the GATT, we were going to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9984"> 9984 </A></B>
<P>
have to drop milk quotas, which would be replaced by import 
tariffs. These import tariffs would be so high that they would 
prevent, to all intents  and purposes, the entry of supply 
management commodities, such as dairy products, eggs and 
poultry.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Both the farmers and I were sceptical, but the UPA kept on 
repeating that the freshly elected Liberal government had given 
guarantees.
<P>
	However, Canada and the United States each have their own 
interpretation of the FTA and NAFTA. On the one hand, we have 
Canada, which claims that converting import quotas for dairy 
products into tariff equivalents, as the GATT agreements 
stipulate, takes precedence. On the other, we have our American 
friends, who claim that NAFTA prohibits the use of tariff 
equivalents.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister assured me ``from one Chrétien 
to another'' that he would bring the issue before a WTO panel if 
the Americans did not stop pestering Quebecers and Canadians. 
Today, I would like to remind the government that, under the 
GATT agreement, Canada's agricultural tariffs for each 
commodity will be reduced by 36 per cent over six years, with a 
minimum reduction of 15 per cent per commodity. That is what 
was promised to farmers in order to let the GATT be passed, in 
December 1993.
<P>
	By July 1995, therefore in a few months, the tariffs should be 
as follows, to quote a few: butter, 351 per cent; cheese, 290 per 
cent; powdered milk, 250 per cent; chicken, 280 per cent; eggs, 
which have the lowest tariff, 192 per cent; milk, 283 per cent and 
ice cream, 326 per cent.
<P>
	These high tariffs will protect producers in Quebec and 
Canada for several years to come, despite tariff reductions of 15 
per cent to 36 per cent over the next six years.
<P>
	The important thing for our farmers is not to produce but to 
secure markets for their products. That is why this government 
must stand up and show once and for all that, under section 309 
of NAFTA, Canada can invoke section XI of the GATT 
agreement to protect its agricultural industry. I hope that this 
government will show more backbone than it did in the durum 
wheat dispute last summer.
<P>
	Supply management is nothing new in Canada. In fact, dairy 
products have been supply managed since 1972. There were then 
17 cows in the average dairy herd, compared with 48 today.
<P>
	We must remember that, in 1971 and before, farmers had a 
little bit of everything. They used to keep three or four pigs, one 
or two horses, beef and dairy cows, sheep, chickens; it was 
almost a zoo.
<P>
	Today, our farmers specialize in pork, dairy, poultry and other 
products. We asked our farmers to specialize in order to become 
competitive and they took up the challenge. To meet this 
challenge, they must have a decent income and know how much 
they can expect to receive in 1995 and 1996, and not a widely 
fluctuating  income. Supply management offers dairy producers 
some income stability.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	I know that my question will be answered by the hon. member 
for Prince Edward-Hastings on behalf of the Prime Minister, 
but I hope that he will take these demands under consideration. I 
know that the hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings is very 
familiar with all agricultural sectors and that he, too, is very 
sensitive to farmers' concerns. I, for one, can tell you that 
farmers would never have agreed, in December 1993, had they 
known that this import tariff agreement would be so fragile.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his comments tonight. I can assure him that we 
heard what he has said. We heard what his representatives have 
said and we heard what the supply management industry has 
said.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member asked the Prime Minister whether 
he plans on telling President Clinton that Canada has no 
intention of negotiating bilaterally any reduction in the tariff 
equivalents that were negotiated in the Uruguay round and then 
implemented by Canada.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister stated very clearly in his response to 
the member, our application of tariff equivalents on supply 
managed commodities that were negotiated in the Uruguay 
round is fully consistent with our rights under both GATT and 
NAFTA.
<P>
	We are satisfied that our legal position is sound and we will 
continue to hold firm on our position. This message will be 
conveyed to President Clinton by the Prime Minister during 
President Clinton's visit to Canada and to this House to speak 
tomorrow. The Prime Minister, as we know, will be meeting 
with President Clinton for the next two days.
<P>
	During the FTA, NAFTA and multilateral trade negotiations, 
Canada's position was that we would not make any concessions 
that would undermine supply management. This position is 
reflected in all those agreements.
<P>
	Tariffication was a central issue during the Uruguay round. It 
was clear that these tariff equivalents would apply to all 
imports, including those from the United States.
<P>
	The United States has requested consultation and it should be 
seen as just that; a request to meet and discuss the issues. It is the 
first step in the dispute settlement process. If the United States 
so desires, it may eventually seek to resolve the issue by way of 
a panel under either NAFTA or the WTO or as it is otherwise 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9985"> 9985 </A></B>
<P>
known, GATT. This, however, does not preclude Canada from 
requesting a panel in either NAFTA or the WTO, if we so desire.
<P>
	I would like to point out again to the member that the Prime 
Minister met with the representatives of the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture, including representatives from 
supply management agencies, and including the president of the 
UPA who was present at that meeting on Monday of this week.
<P>
	He indicated very clearly that Canada has a strong, legal case 
and that Canada would ardently defend its rights regarding the 
tariffication of import measures on supply managed 
commodities.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to expand on my question 
today to the Minister of Justice on family violence.
<P>
	When I talk about family violence I am not talking only about 
violence against women. I am talking about violence against the 
elderly, violence against the handicapped, violence against 
children, and yes, sometimes violence against men. I am not 
talking only about physical abuse or physical violence. I am 
talking about mental abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and 
sometimes financial abuse in terms of dependency.
<P>
	I have held two forums on family violence in my riding. They 
were attended by about 80 presenters from all walks of life, such 
as from the mental health field, family law, crown attorneys, 
police chiefs, counsellors, educators, and victims of violence.
<P>
	One thing that came through very loud and clear from the 
forums is that there is definitely a lack of awareness in our 
society on family violence. There was consensus that as a 
government we have to do something to make Canadians aware 
of the gravity and the prevalence of violence in our society.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	A lot of questions were asked. For instance, when there is a 
family violence situation, why do we remove the victims and the 
children and put them in a shelter and the abuser or offender is 
free?
<P>
	I believe, as was the consensus during the forums, that there is 
a real need to conduct some national forums on family violence. 
The purpose of those forums would be to create awareness. In 
my next householder I intend to give numbers to assist people in 
knowing where to find help. A lot of victims do not know where 
to turn, especially in the rural areas of Canada.
<P>
	During the course of my forums the media: radio, television 
and newspapers talked about them. Many victims came out of 
the woodwork to seek help. If we can create awareness by the 
forums, we will have achieved at least part of our goal.
<P>
	The second goal of having such forums would be to develop, 
in consultation with all parties involved, a set of 
recommendations. What changes can we make to the Criminal 
Code to prevent family violence? What changes can we make to 
the administration of justice? What support programs can we 
implement, not only for the victims of family violence but also 
for the offenders?
<P>
	I can already hear members of the Reform Party saying that 
this is going to cost money. These forums can be organized in a 
very cost effective manner. All we actually need are two 
co-chairs, preferably a man and a woman, a support staff from 
the justice department and perhaps from the minister for the 
status of women. We could ask members in each riding to look 
after the logistics of organizing the forums, to advertise and to 
find a venue.
<P>
	We would need only a very small travelling budget for three or 
four persons and maybe have 20 or 25 of those forums across the 
country. A small amount of money like that would be well spent 
in protecting our children, our elderly and the lives of women in 
this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice shares the hon. member's 
concern and commitment to addressing the serious problem of 
family violence.
<P>
	Recent examples of the justice minister's commitment 
include Bill C-42 which was proclaimed on February 15, 1995 
and amended the Criminal Code peace bond provisions to help 
prevent acts of family violence before they occur. These 
amendments will allow police and others to apply on behalf of 
persons at risk of harm for a peace bond. They will also enable 
the court to specify the conditions that can be imposed as part of 
the peace bond including, for example, prohibiting the husband 
from being at or near the family home or from communicating 
with his wife.
<P>
	These amendments also make the breach of a peace bond more 
serious by making it punishable on indictment and liable to 
imprisonment for a maximum term of two years instead of the 
previous summary conviction maximum of six months.
<P>
	Another example is Bill C-41 introduced on June 13, 1994 
which proposes sentencing reforms and would make the abuse 
of a position of trust or authority in the commission of an 
offence an aggravating factor in sentencing.
<P>
	On February 14, 1995 the Minister of Justice tabled Bill C-68 
which proposes significant reforms to control firearms. We 
know for instance from the Statistics Canada spousal homicide 
survey that between 1974 and 1992 a married woman was nine 
times as likely to be killed by her spouse as by a stranger and that 
42 per cent of women killed by their spouses during this period 
<P>

<P>
were killed with guns. These firearms' proposals will provide a 
clear and effective response to prevent such use of firearms.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice also acknowledges the importance and 
value of consulting with Canadians. Public consultations 
provide the government with invaluable insight into various 
issues.
<P>
	A recent example of the value of such consultations is the 
June 1994 national consultation with women's organizations on 
violence against women issues which included family violence. 
This national consultation was co-hosted by the Minister of 
Justice, the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for the 
Status of Women.
<P>
	These existing efforts to address family violence by the 
federal government will help to protect women, children and 
seniors who are the primary victims of family violence. The 
individual efforts of members such as the hon. member's public 
forums will clearly contribute to the national capacity to better 
understand and respond to family violence.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, pursuant to order made 
Thursday, February 16, this House stands adjourned until 
Friday, February 24 at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.11 p.m.)
