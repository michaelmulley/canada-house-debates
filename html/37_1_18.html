government is keeping its promises.  With respect to the 
environment, this week we announced a $120.2 million investment 
to accelerate action on clean air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, the measures announced will regulate vehicle 
production to provide cleaner transportation, will make a 90% 
reduction in the emission of smog-causing emissions from 
industry and will improve the network of pollutant monitoring 
stations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the federal government has signed the ozone annex with 
the United States. 
Under this agreement, we will be working in collaboration with 
our neighbours to the south in reducing pollution from vehicle 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that air pollution is responsible for many heart and 
lung diseases.  The problem concerns us all.  I am proud that 
the federal government has made a commitment to improving our 
living conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clearly shows its concern for the health of its population.

Speaker, with these words, “I am just an ordinary MP looking 
after the interests of my constituents”,  the Prime Minister 
dismisses his intervention in the application of a $600,000 loan 
for a friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is no ordinary MP.  He appoints the members 
of the Senate, supreme court judges and ministers of the crown. 
No one can appeal his decisions.  He declares government bills 
and motions to be votes of confidence and does not permit members 
of his Liberal Party to vote the wishes of their constituents.

2001, a tug of war team from my riding of Oxford will travel to 
Taiwan to participate in the second annual MacKay Memorial Tug of 
War Championship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Oxford-Zorra girls tug of war team has been invited to 
compete in this tournament because Oxford county is the 
birthplace of the Reverend George Leslie MacKay, a Presbyterian 
missionary highly revered for his work in Taiwan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This trip will help to advance the twinning relationship between 
Oxford and the Tan-shui region of Taiwan by providing the 
participants with an exciting opportunity to participate in and 
experience a different culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Oxford-Zorra girls, accompanied by the Ingersoll pipe band, 
look to carry on the tradition of another successful tug of war 
team from Oxford, the Mighty Men of Zorra.  That legendary team 
became world champions at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to bring from a constituent a non-partisan issue that every 
member in the House should find very distressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada has just increased the change fee for transborder 
fares from $100 to $145, a 45% increase.  It appears that on 
March 1 it will burden all Canadians with this increase by also 
applying it to domestic fares.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To stabilize our economy, this nation has inflation targets of 
less than 3%.  This quasi-monopoly has the nerve to impose a 45% 
increase in the fee.  Quarante-cinq pour cent, c'est incroyable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are turning increasingly to the competition because of 
such audacity.  Canadians do not want it, businesses do not want 
it, Yukoners do not want it and I do not believe the constituents 
of any member here want an Air Canada increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to stand up and be counted and say to Air 
Canada that enough is enough.

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the environment was the big winner last Friday when a 
Washington state regulatory body recommended against the Sumas 
Energy 2 power plant proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the hard work of Canadians and Americans alike, the 
message came through loud and clear that the public does not want 
a power plant built on the edge of the Fraser Valley, Canada's 
second most polluted air shed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulator's recommendation, however, is only a roadblock and 
not the end of the road for the SE2 project.  The Washington 
governor now has the final say on whether the proposal can go 
ahead.  It is no longer an environmental decision.  That has been 
resolved.  It is now a political decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation boils down to this.  There are no further 
environmental hearings planned in the United States.  There are 
no National Energy Board meetings planned because they have now 
been suspended in Canada.  The studies are over.  The hearings 
are finished.  It is now a political decision and the governor of 
Washington will make that decision soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, will the Minister of the Environment finally 
stop talking about process and reports and now tell Governor 
Locke, in the strongest terms possible, that Canada opposes the 
SE2 project?

the team Canada trade mission to China was a unique opportunity 
for me to join the Prime Minister and eight provincial premiers 
on the largest trade mission in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, as captain of the team, delivered a strong 
message for human rights to Chinese officials, students and the 
general public.  He stated that human rights not only protect 
individuals from abuse but also empower people to contribute 
fully and creatively to building a stronger society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With $5.7 billion in new deals for Canadian companies, team 
Canada was a success for commerce and for advancing Canadian

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
of Quebec has decided to intervene with the CRTC in support of 
community television.  As we know, this has undergone unique 
development in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the CRTC decided to make the existence of community 
television a precarious one by no longer requiring the cable 
companies to fund it, thus forcing the majority of these 
stations to close down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the Bloc Quebecois intervened to support community 
television against the diktat of the CRTC, which was thumbing 
its nose at Quebec's cultural specificity.  We also intervened 
with the CRTC, requesting that it hold public hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these do take place, the Bloc Quebecois intends to continue 
to pressure the CRTC to ensure the continuation of community 
television so that regional voices will not be silenced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all the farmers I have met with over the past 
few months, especially the Chapmans, the Donors, the Holtrops and 
the Oldhams.  They gave me the words I needed to share with the 
members of this House and with Canadians who watched the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night our nation's farmers were here in Ottawa sharing the 
tasty fruits of their labour at a family farm food and wine 
celebration.  This was an unprecedented event that brought 
members and senators from rural ridings and urban ridings 
together to meet with our country's agrifood producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we must continue this very important dialogue and work 
toward solutions that solve the problems faced on the family 
farm.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians are needlessly suffering 
because federal health bureaucrats in the Surveillance Management 
Program are dragging their feet on new pharmaceutical drug 
approvals.  In fact, Canada's drug approval process is slower 
than most other developed nations and the problem is getting 
worse, not better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Russell, a researcher from the University of Alberta, was 
providing his patients with an exciting new drug to treat 
arthritis on a trial basis.  However, after the trial was over 
his patients were no longer able to get access to this medicine 
even though every other country in the developed world has the 
approved the drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Russell is now doing the only thing his conscience will 
allow:  he is providing his patients with a safe and effective 
but still unapproved drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health has to make a decision.  Does he want Dr. 
Russell to continue to provide his patients with an unapproved 
drug or would he prefer to force these sick people to wait in 
pain until Health Canada bureaucrats catch up to the rest of the 
world?

outstanding volunteer service, especially for making sure that 
countless new Canadians feel at home in this country and in 
Ottawa in particular.

the Governor General's prestigious Caring Canadians Award, the 
Canada 125 Commemorative Medal and a certificate of merit for 
citizenship and immigration.

ask all members of the House to please join me in congratulating 
him for making our country a better place for everyone.

the recent bombing by the U.S. and the U.K. of the Baghdad area 
of Iraq is another gross violation of international law that has 
led to more injury and deaths of innocent Iraqis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this illegal bombing is being condemned by many countries, 
including France and Germany, shamefully Canada's Liberal

Democratic caucus, I would urge the Prime Minister to let both 
Tony Blair and George Bush know very clearly that Canadians are 
appalled by these latest bombings, the ongoing bombings in the 
north and south, and the impact of depleted uranium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tell Tony Blair and George Bush that Canadians support the 
immediate lifting of the genocidal economic sanctions on Iraq 
that have killed so many innocent civilians.  Act on the 
unanimous recommendations of the foreign affairs committee on 
Iraq.  Let us send a clear and strong message to Tony Blair and 
George Bush.  Let us stop bombing Iraq and lift the economic 
sanctions now.

I may, I will read a statement that comes directly from the 
students of Alma college and the people of Lac-Saint-Jean.  It is 
directed to the Minister for International Trade representing 
the public at the summit of the Americas: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the summit of the Americas and Canada's participation in it 
be conditional on human rights and the environment being given 
priority over trade interests in the negotiations.  In addition, 
public participation must be given greater importance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this to happen, the students want all negotiations to be 
governed by a code of ethics and subject to the universal 
declaration of human rights and to environmental protection in 
the case of all countries concerned.  This will mean human, 
including workers' rights must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the students want the texts of the negotiations to be 
made public immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
every dollar that Canadians spend on agriculture Americans spend 
$2.06, Europeans spend $2.14 and the Japanese $3.47.  The United 
States subsidizes farmers four times more than we do and the 
Europeans six times more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good result of this is that all Canadians spend less than 10% 
of their incomes on food.  All other developed nations spend much 
more.  However, a bad result is that our farmers' share of food 
costs is very small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we can be proud that we eat the healthiest food in the 
world at the least cost, we must think of the long term.  Our 
wonderfully efficient farming system will be maintained only if 
farmers and their families receive a fair income for their 
efforts and ingenuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If today's food is too cheap we will pay the cost tomorrow.  Let 
us be sure that our farmers receive their fair share.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reception was attended by representatives from all political

communities across Canada here on Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reception demonstrated that the message is starting to get 
through to members of the government side.  The overwhelming 
concern for the plight of our farmers has crossed party lines and 
at last week's emergency debate was clearly shown.  The federal 
government should seize the opportunity to extend a helping hand 
to this industry in a demonstration of goodwill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message from last night's reception was clear:  whether 
members represent an urban or rural centre in Canada, we can all 
learn about, understand and recognize the problems the 
agricultural industry has faced over the past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only question that has to be asked is when will the minister

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ECONOMY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, along with the official opposition 
others are also expressing concern about the government's 
financial plan no longer being in touch with the changing 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the chief economist at the TD Bank. 
He is also the former assistant deputy minister of finance.  He 
said of the finance minister's economic update that “the October 
2000 economic statement and budget update is now outdated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vague commitment from the finance minister about some update 
some time in the spring just will not cut it.  If the finance 
minister is not prepared to listen to concerned Canadians, to the 
markets, to people in business or to the official opposition, 
will he at least listen to his former top adviser and now a chief 
economist and table a budget and do it soon? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member ought to listen to the people that he is 
quoting.  Neither Mr. Drummond nor the vast majority of other 
economists have said that we should be producing a budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have asked for us to do an economic update to update the 
projections.  Of course we have said on a multitude of occasions 
that when the consensus of private sector forecasters is ready, 
of which Mr. Drummond is one, it will obviously be the time to 
consider an update, as indeed we did last spring. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have been trying to give him that 
consensus for days and days now, and he is not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another quote from Mr. Drummond, his former senior 
adviser: “The economic assumptions underpinning the October 
update now seem decidedly optimistic”.  He is saying these are 
not realistic plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the finance minister that we are not blaming 
the downturn on him.  We are not doing that.  He had nothing to 
do with it, just like he had nothing to do with the upturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to impress upon him that this is an important issue. 
Canadians want a financial plan to know how to lessen the impact 
of an economic downturn.  When will he table it, not some vague 
promise of spring? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would really like to welcome the Leader of the 
Opposition to the real world if he has only now discovered that 
there has been a revision by most private sector forecasters that 
there is a slowdown going on in the United States.  Well, then, 
welcome to reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been saying that for quite some time.  What 
the government has also said in terms of its own forecasts is 
that in the October statement we put in a contingency reserve and 
the prudence to cover this very kind of eventuality.  In short, 
we have shown foresight and that Canada is the stronger for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was only last Friday that the 
government finally admitted we are into an economic downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about that contingency reserve.  In the red book 
there is a reflection about revenues, with 50% going to increased 
spending and 50% going to taxes and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Prime Minister wrote the red book we will not blame 
the finance minister.  Will the Prime Minister tell us, then, 
what is his plan?  How can we know?  With revenues being reduced 
as they will because we are in a downturn, is he planning to 
reduce spending, or will he back off on debt reduction which will 
weaken the dollar?  How can we know what he will do without a 
budget? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone around who knows the situation is praising the 
government because we reduced the taxes on January 1.  Everyone 
said that we had perfect timing in doing it at the same time as 
the downturn in the United States. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I guess the finance minister still has not sent a 
memo to the Prime Minister pointing out that taxes are going up 
this year with the CPP increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Drummond said in the same report that the October statement 
“does not reflect the tax changes promised in the statement or 
spending commitments in red book three or the throne speech”. 
He also said that economic assumptions in the October statement 
were “decidedly optimistic”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the finance minister agree with his comment that the 
assumptions are not realistic?  If he does agree, what does he 
believe are realistic assumptions for the future of our economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as we have every year, and opposition members have had a 
lot of difficulty with it because they said we were being too 
prudent, the assumptions that were made in the October statement 
were then offset by the contingency reserve and the prudence for 
just this kind of eventuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we do not have to rush into an economic update.  It 
is certainly why we do not have to rush into a budget, because in 
fact we have shown the foresight.  I have said that when the 
consensus of private sector forecasters is ready we will indeed 
do an economic update. 
We did it last spring and we will do it this spring.  We did it 
last fall and we will do another one next fall.   Welcome to the 
real world.  That is the way the government operates.

<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again all I can say is:  Take a look at what we have 
done compared to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax stimulus that we provided the economy in our October 
update, which took effect on January 1, was four times greater 
than that of the United Kingdom and eight times greater than 
those planned in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is what other people are talking about doing we have 
already done.  The fact is that we have provided for the 
spending.

talking about the entire Auberge Grand-Mère affair. There were 
negotiations, there was a loan, and there was a subsequent 
attempt to cover up.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the loan was made in 1997, he worked for me.  In 1998 he 
left my office and was hired by the Business Development Bank of

continued the loan for four years and the enterprise is still in 
operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The loan was made in 1997.  Mr. Carle was working with me and 
was not involved in the file.  He joined the bank in 1998, so he 
had absolutely nothing to do with this loan to Auberge

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in fact there are a couple of questions that arise from 
the loan itself, and I would like to bring them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have obtained an internal memo from the Business Development 
Bank that details the very loan to the Auberge Grand-Mère.  I 
will quote from that document.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the global risk for BDC is very high.  We are aware that the 
financing structure recommended does not meet the normal policy 
and criteria of the bank. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that why the Prime Minister has not been entirely, shall we 
say, forthcoming with the House?  That is the memo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Once again, I am concerned about the tone of 
the questions.  Hon. members know there are rules in the House 
concerning these questions.  I urge all hon. members to show 
proper and judicious use of their words in asking questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what is not forthcoming is the posing with four-legged 
animals outside parliament complaining about parliamentary 
pensions and then grabbing one right after the election is over. 
That is not professional. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the BDC memo which says very 
clearly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know it is Wednesday. 
Hon. members, we are losing a lot of time.  The hon. member for 
Edmonton North has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is pretty sad over 
there no matter what day of the week it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The BDC memo concerns loans to the Grand-Mère of $415,000.  What 
did it end up getting?  It got $600,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this.  A bank is very worried about lending a 
large sum of money so it first ignores its normal procedures, it 
increases the loan by 50% extra and then it hands over the cash. 
I would love the Prime Minister to call my bank when it is time 
to renew my mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask, is this a shady loan or is it the fact that he 
arranged it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am not sure I heard a question but I think 
the right hon. Prime Minister will reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Edmonton North will pose her question 
directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  She surely will, Mr. Speaker.  Is it 
the shady nature of that bank loan or is it the fact that he 
arranged it that prevents the Prime Minister from answering? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the facts are pretty clear.  The facts are that we have 
had a request by the Leader of the Opposition directly to the 
ethics counsellor for an investigation.  That has now occurred 
and a definitive answer has been given saying that the Prime 
Minister of Canada was in no conflict and has complied with the 
ethics rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had two letters from the leader of the Conservative 
Party to the RCMP.  Surely all Canadians can agree that the RCMP 
are objective and professional.  It did an investigation that 
said there was no need for a further investigation.  Then the 
leader of the Conservative Party wants to coach the RCMP on how 
to be policemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter is ridiculous and—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister

position was that culture, health and education would never be 
included in the negotiations on the free trade area of the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister confirm today that Canada's position is still 
the same and that our country will never accept that these 
issues be negotiated under the free trade area of the Americas? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as regards culture, we have done some very 
important work, along with the Minister of Canadian Heritage, to 
develop a different way of treating cultural products. We feel 
it is important that these products not be subjected to standard 
trade legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other issues, namely health and education, I have 
always made it very clear that Canada would never allow negotiations 
on its right to have its own systems and its own way of doing 
things in these most important areas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since we do 
not have access to the basic texts to be used in the

that none of these issues are on the agenda of the negotiations 
on the free trade area of the Americas? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to keep working with our colleagues from the 
hemisphere and to conclude, through negotiations other than 
those on the FTAA, agreements on the environment. Environment 
ministers will meet in preparation for the summit in Quebec 
City. We will also have meetings with labour ministers, who are 
holding their own talks. In early April international trade 
ministers will negotiate in Buenos Aires the extensions and the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>GRANTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last April, when we enquired about 
grants to the Strathroy Community Resource Centre, the 
parliamentary secretary not only defended the grants but attacked 
us for even questioning them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turns out, we had every reason to be concerned.  Last 
Thursday the police announced that fraud charges were going to be 
laid against three members of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister:  Why was the government defending these 
grants instead of protecting taxpayer money from criminal misuse? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we have always said, whenever there 
were allegations of wrongdoing in circumstances involving 
government money we took them seriously.  The department did ask 
the police to investigate.  The hon. member is correct, the OPP 
have laid charges against three individuals.  This is before the 
courts and, as such, I will say no more on the case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is apparent that the 
minister really does not know what is going on in her department. 
The HRDC performance report states that last year's audit of 
grants and contributions found “that no money was found to be 
missing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite interesting given that there are at least 20 
police investigations into the grants and contributions program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If no money is missing, as the minister claims, can she then 
explain to the House why there are these police investigations 
and why they are laying fraud charges on the files? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what is absolutely clear is that the vast 
majority of investments made by the government in communities 
right across the country, including investments in the hon. 
member's own riding, have made a difference in the lives of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect, from time to time, that there are allegations made 
about wrongdoings.  We always take them seriously.  If 
investigations are required, they are undertaken and action is 
followed.

there was nothing wrong with attending a FACT fundraiser.

Especially, Mr. Speaker, when her neck is on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their case before the supreme court, the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration lawyers flat out say that FACT is a 
fundraising front for the Tamil Tigers.  They go on to say that 
the Tigers “raise money through drug trafficking and by relying 
upon the willing or unwilling expatriate communities abroad, such 
as the large number of Tamil refugees in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what her own lawyers have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister deny that her cabinet colleagues were in 
fact raising funds for a terrorist front? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before the minister answers, the question 
had to do with whether ministers were raising money for other

entitlement under the parental leave program of the federal

discriminates against women who give birth prematurely.

program came into place at the end of the year 2000 as we 
promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the question whenever changes are made, there has to be a 
date of commencement.  We undertook discussions with Canadians. 
We had to talk with the provinces and territories.  We had to 
create legislation.  We set the date for the end of the year 2000 
as we promised.  We are very glad that on a go forward basis all 
parents will have access to the program.

does the minister realize that, if she agreed finally to

far less prejudicial to women?

expanded the parental benefit by doubling it in a very

of the lengths to which the government will go to sacrifice 
Canada's impartial public service if it does not willingly go 
along with the Liberal self-serving political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Health Canada scientist has been punished and her paycheque

have proven scientifically that this product is safe to export,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the minister supported the reduced flying 
hours for Aurora aircraft pilots by claiming that simulators 
would make up for the lost time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was dead wrong on that assessment.  A phone call this morning 
from Canadian Forces Base Greenwood to my office revealed that 
the simulators there are more than 30 years old and do not even 
reflect an Aurora cockpit.  Moreover, simulation training is not 
as effective as flying.  In what way does using an outdated 
simulator protect Canada's borders? 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as usual the Canadian Alliance is out of date on its 
research.  Yesterday it talked about a letter which is almost two 
years old.  Today it is talking about old equipment.  The 
government is investing in new equipment, new simulators, new 
sensors, new upgrading and technologically advanced equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the last hour I talked with the chief of the air staff. 
He fully supports the recommendation that is being made.  He 
assures me that we will not compromise the security of Canada's 
coastline. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the chief of the air force would probably be fired 
if he did not agree with the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that the reduced Aurora flying hours were 
justified because it was a case of quality versus quantity. 
Thanks to the Liberal government, when it comes to equipment we 
do not have either.  Would the minister tell the House how 
sitting in a simulator is quality border patrol? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there will not be any reduction in terms of the 
operations on the coastline. 
This comes from the chief of the air staff.  It is bottom up, not 
top down.  We in fact will maintain the kind of service that we 
have provided.  The integrity of the service will be maintained. 
We are investing in new equipment.  We are investing almost $1 
billion in the upgrading of the Aurora equipment to act in a 
proper fashion in terms of our surveillance capability.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
important issue of the U.S. missile defence shield, the Prime

of disruptions, but that then again it could lead to a solution. 
We will see”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister, and I hope he will 
elaborate further than he did earlier. 
If it turns out that the U.S. missile defence shield causes all 
sorts of disruptions, to use the Prime Minister's words, 
including a renewed international arms race, will the Prime 
Minister strongly oppose this project?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, during question period the member for 
Medicine Hat referred to both myself and the Minister of Finance 
and said that we had attended a terrorist dinner or function and 
that we support terrorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We attended a community event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he says things like that, he is painting members of the 
Tamil community as a whole as terrorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a community event that was made up of respectable 
Canadian citizens.  I did not attend or have dinner with a group 
of terrorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this as an offence and I ask for an apology.  I do not 
support terrorism and neither does my colleague.  That is 
absolutely unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  From time to time some hon. members of 
the House say things that may cause some offence to some other 
hon. members.  I think the member has made a point here that 
has clarified the situation, insofar as she is concerned, under 
the guise of a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more in the nature of a grievance than a question of 
privilege.  While the Chair is sympathetic and has allowed the 
hon. member to perhaps make her point, and she has made it, as I 
say, I do not believe that her privileges as a member have been 
infringed as a result of what the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
may have said.  I do not think that what he has said is contrary 
to the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a disagreement here on an interpretation of what the 
nature of this meeting was.  The hon. member has expressed his 
view.  The hon. minister has disagreed with that point of view. I 
think we will leave it at that.  I do not think there is anything 
the Chair can say that will change that situation.  Accordingly, 
I am declining to deal with it.

<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is difficult to understand how there can be a valid 
difference of opinion as to the nature of the meeting given the 
fact that the minister and I were there and the hon. member was 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue.  The other part of the issue is that it 
is alleged that we support terrorism and fundraising activities 
for terrorism.  That is clearly not the fact.  It not only 
besmirches us, it besmirches the entire Tamil community, but it 
is our own privileges that we are raising this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I simply have to bring some clarity to this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period I certainly did not suggest in any way 
that the Minister of Finance and the minister for CIDA knowingly 
supported this group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am alleging is simply that the department of immigration, 
CSIS and other government organizations have pointed to the fact 
that FACT is a front for a terrorist organization.  I argue that 
both ministers should have known that as they are cabinet members 
and that they should renounce that group that they in fact 
unknowingly supported. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It seems to me that we have cleared the 
air on what was alleged and what was understood.  Again I have 
trouble relating this to a strict question in terms of privileges 
of members, which hon. members can read about in our wonderful 
book on procedure that is available at the table, Marleau and 
Montpetit.  There is an excellent chapter in there on privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the hon. parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader himself has published a book dealing with issues 
relating to parliamentary privilege, which is of course a 
masterpiece.  We could all benefit from looking at those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have not heard anything in the exchanges today that 
has assisted the Chair in finding that there is in fact a 
question of privilege.  There is a grievance and the grievance 
has been aired.  There has been some clarification.  Perhaps we 
ought to leave it.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask you to please clarify the reasons why you 
would not allow my S. O. 31 statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully submit that I did not in any way intend it 
to be a personal attack on any member in the House but rather to 
take the very words that the ethics counsellor himself used about 
the Prime Minister, saying that he was no ordinary MP.  It was 
within that context that these particular words were put 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did provide you, Mr. Speaker, with the text of what I was 
about to submit to the House.  I would ask if you would please 
clarify what it is about that statement that you considered to be 
a personal attack on a member of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will not read the hon. member's 
statement to the House.  What I will read to him are the 
guidelines that are set out on page 363 of Marleau and Montpetit: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In presiding over the conduct of this daily activity,— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the daily activity of Standing Order 31 statements. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Speakers have been guided by a number of well-defined 
prohibitions.  In 1983, when the procedure for “Statements by 
Members” was first put in place, Speaker Sauvé stated that 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may speak on any matter of concern and not necessarily 
on urgent matters only; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal attacks are not permitted; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulatory messages, recitations of poetry and frivolous 
matters are out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines are still in place today, although Speakers 
tend to turn a blind eye to the latter restriction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'll say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a ruling in 1996, Mr. Speaker Parent further cautioned that 
“once they”, the words, “have been uttered, it is very 
difficult to retract them and the impression they leave is not 
always easily erased”.  Accordingly, the Chair errs on the side 
of caution in making rulings in respect of statements by members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case, the hon. member for Kelowna has 
provided me with a copy of his statement that he was in the 
process of reading.  I have to say that when I read the whole 
statement I have no doubt that my decision was correct. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that it was in my view a personal attack. 
Statements by members are not ones that can be responded to.  If 
members are going to attack one another in statements by members, 
there is no opportunity for anyone else to comment. Question 
period is a different kettle of fish.  There is question and 
answer, there is give and take, but in a statement by members 
there is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is not prepared to countenance members rising on the 
guise of those statements and attacking one another in the House. 
There is enough opportunity to do that at other times.  It is not 
going to happen under statements by members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the hon. member for Kelowna stepped over the line in 
his statement.  Having read the entire statement, I have no doubt 
I was correct.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian

my question in regard to agriculture, the agriculture minister 
saw fit to cast aspersions on the Canadian Alliance and me with 
the idea of our not having asked any questions or participated in 
any activity in agriculture in the House.  That is not true.  We 
have had over eight questions and dozens of statements and 
speeches. I believe the agriculture minister should retract that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Once again we are in a situation where 
members say things on which there is disagreement.  I do not know 
how this could be a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and the minister clearly have a disagreement.  I 
know that the minister seemed, in his answer, to disagree with 
the member's statement that nothing had been done.  These 
disagreements are commonplace on issues of policy in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member may not like the answer the minister gave, 
I sense the minister was not entirely happy with the question 
either.  That is sometimes the way things are and we all have to 
live with it.  I do not think there is a point of order here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak 
to my motion that is supported by all the opposition parties. At 
committee stage, this motion would divide Bill C-2, an act to 
amend the Employment Insurance Act, into two separate bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have previously been two precedents in the House for this 
type of motion. In fact, the House of Commons Procedure and 
Practice stipulates the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a bill has been referred to a committee— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the case. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the House may give the committee an instruction which 
authorizes it to do what it otherwise could not do, such as, for 
example, examining a portion of a bill and reporting it 
separately, examining certain items in particular, dividing a 
bill into more than one bill— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion does exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 brings to our EI plan some of the improvements the Bloc 
Quebecois has been demanding for several years now. However, 
these changes are minor compared to the EI surplus, which could 
have been used to improve the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-2, only about 8% of annual surpluses will be given 
back to workers, to the unemployed, while 92% of these surpluses 
will continue to be used to cover other government expenditures, 
including the debt. The money used for all that will come from 
the contributions paid by employers and workers, but 
particularly from the benefits that the unemployed will not 
receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This part of the bill is aimed at legalizing the fact that EI 
contributions are no longer insurance premiums but rather a new 
payroll tax. This should be the subject of a separate debate, 
different from the one on improvements to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal I brought forward is supported by the three 
opposition parties. 
Indeed, those parties made very eloquent presentations at a 
press conference, the purpose of which was to show that, even 
though all parties do not share the same views on ways of 
improving the plan, it is possible to have similar objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance's views on ways of improving the plan may 
be very different from ours or from those of the New Democratic 
Party or the Progressive Conservative Party, but we share the 
same position with regard to the fact that, by hiding a 
provision in a bill, the government will legalize the 
misappropriation of surpluses in the EI fund, something it has 
been doing for several years. This issue cannot be dealt with at 
the same time as improvements to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are asking the House to mandate the committee to 
study both issues separately. This afternoon, the committee will 
hear the human resources development minister, who will have to 
justify her bill, especially since, during the whole electoral 
campaign, liberal members have said that the system could be 
improved some more at the committee stage. I think of the 
members for Bourassa and for 
Gaspé—Bonaventure—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok in particular. 
They were saying that, in committee, improvements other than the 
ones included in the former Bill C-44, and which are still not found 
in Bill C-2, could be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want the committee to give appropriate time to the 
priority consideration of improvements to the system, I propose 
this motion which involves the study by the committee of the 
issue of improvements so that more improvements can be made 
since Bill C-2 only contains a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that those who will appear before this committee will 
tell us that these improvements are far from being enough and 
that many others will have to be added to the government's 
propositions to broaden eligibility for EI benefits, to 
eliminate the qualifying period and to ensure that seasonal 
workers' status is not dependant upon the economic situation in 
their region and that they are guaranteed a decent income 
between jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, all issues concerning the transformation of EI 
premiums into a payroll tax scheme should be the subject of 
another debate at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the whole issue of tax reform could be raised. We 
should not forget that the way EI premiums are currently taxed 
represents a very regressive tax because anyone who earns up to 
$39,000 has to contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that someone earning $43,000, $44,000 or $50,000 a 
year does not contribute on income over that limit. EI 
contributors are the ones contributing to the elimination of the 
deficit and to the reduction of Canada's debt, not those earning 
over $39,000 or, even worse, those who do not contribute to the 
EI scheme at all, including members of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A broad public debate is going on about the whole issue of tax 
reform, an issue that ought to be discussed elsewhere, for 
example in a joint committee bringing together members of the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and members of 
the Standing Committee on Finance. It is a much broader issue 
that is changing the balance between income tax, taxes and 
payroll tax and their impact on productivity. Those are very 
distinct elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I call on the members of the House to debate that 
issue and to pass this motion. I hope that the Liberal majority 
will show an open mind and let us debate that matter today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, from 
time to time the House has to deal with complex bills.  Often 
they have issues that deal with separate items in a policy 
envelope.  I really do not understand why the member opposite and 
his party want to split the bill when, from the point of view of 
this member anyway, the bill seems to be so positive and so 
directed at remedying apparent defects in the employment 
insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why they would not wish to pursue the bill 
as a package.  I would ask the hon. member to explain why there 
are not enough good things in the bill and why he and his party 
feel it necessary to split the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the question of the 
parliamentary secretary is very relevant. The answer was given 
in the newspapers the very evening of the debate on our 
proposal, which was supported by all opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conseil du patronat du Québec, which is not comprised of 
unionized people, would like a separate debate on the whole issue 
of payroll taxes, because employers have been contributing to 
the employment insurance program for a long time and in a 
disproportionate way, considering the program that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a private insurance program, whatever it may be, there is a 
balance between premiums and the benefits paid out. If there is 
a major surplus, premiums are usually reduced or the terms of 
the program are improved for the employees, in the case of 
employment insurance, among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, why should we divide this bill in two and examine 
each part separately? Because, through this bill, the government 
is appropriating a right. It is legalizing the fact that it has 
been misappropriating the employment insurance surpluses. This is 
not insignificant, we are talking about $30 billion. This is 
money that was paid by employers and employees to fund the 
employment insurance program but was used to fund other types of 
government spending, including Canada's debt payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, Canada's debt has to be reduced, but this battle must 
not be fought only at the expense of people who contribute to 
the employment insurance program, because that would reinforce 
the regressive nature of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the main reason why the bill must be split in two for 
consideration. 
The motion calls for the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development to examine the improvements to the plan first, and 
to report to the House on that part of the bill first. The standing 
committee could also choose to report on the second part, which 
could be the subject matter of another bill, but it is 
unacceptable that the government should try to pull the wool 
over our eyes with a nice little package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is playing the game of saying, on the one hand, 
that it is going to abolish the intensity rule, something the 
Bloc has advocated for several years. This represents about 
$300 million. On the other hand, it will legalize the 
misappropriation of funds by a vote that will enable it to dig 
out of our pockets $6 billion a year and use that money for 
all sorts of expenses, including paying down the debt. 
Those who contribute to the plan are people who earn $39,000 a 
year or less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we not ask that those who contributed to the 
elimination of the deficit by being unemployed now reap the 
benefits, just like the taxpayers are being rewarded by tax cuts 
for their contribution to the elimination of the deficit?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some workers, more particularly seasonal workers, whose status 
is precarious, do not pay huge amounts in taxes. What they need 
is decent employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, which, by the 
way, is the riding with the longest name in Canada, to reassure 
the House and to inform our listeners that the Bloc Quebecois is 
not against improvements to the intensity rule. He said very 
clearly that this is something the Bloc has been calling for, 
for several years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to give more details on why he is asking that 
the bill be divided because, if the bill is passed without 
amendment, it will open the door to ill intentioned persons, 
particularly on the government side. 
The government could say “You from the Bloc were opposed to 
improvements to EI. You were against them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be too easy later on to use a bill with clauses on 
such a wide variety of subjects as an excuse to indulge in 
demagogy. For that reason, I would like my colleague to repeat 
that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of increasing benefits for 
workers who have had to take large cuts since the government's 
first reforms in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, even before Bill C-2 was 
introduced, we had submitted a proposal to the government to have 
two separate bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said we were willing to dispose very quickly of the issue of 
improvements to the plan. Even before an election was called, 
when this bill was known as Bill C-44, I remember asking the 
Prime Minister in the House if we could vote right away on 
improvements to the plan, excluding the provision enabling the 
government to divert for its own purposes the employment 
insurance fund surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our attitude has not changed. This afternoon in committee we 
will hear from the minister. We will ask her questions, but we 
hope that this bill can be passed as soon as possible, as far 
as improvements to the plan are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in committee we decided to make a list of witnesses 
who could be invited to appear. Within 24 hours, we came up with 
a list of 30 or so groups and organizations that wanted to be 
heard. The committee will begin its deliberations immediately 
after the visit of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on 
Thursday, and next week hearings will begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are willing to proceed very rapidly. However, we are hearing 
from people with very different opinions, including not only the 
Conseil du patronat du Québec, but also unemployed workers 
advocacy groups, which know full well that seasonal workers need 
the money they will get from the elimination of the intensity rule 
and they need it quickly. 
However, they also agree with the Mouvement autonome et 
solidaire des sans-emploi that this bill, if passed as is, will 
not really deal with the fact that we have a surplus of billions 
of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have young people, women and seasonal 
workers who are not eligible to EI because of the government's 
greed. The government wants to use the money to fill up the 
coffers, pay down the debt and pay its expenses, but not give 
adequate EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we do want the improvements to be passed as soon as 
possible, because we have been asking for them for several years 
now. In the last few years, we have introduced about a dozen bills to 
improve the EI plan. The Liberals have picked two or three of 
our ideas, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. Let 
us put our time, our energy, the work of our committee and the 
ability of all members to good use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I especially ask for the support of the Liberal members who, 
throughout the election campaign, kept saying that the plan 
would be changed after the election and that it would greatly 
benefit all Canadians because it would be made fairer. So far, 
these commitments have not been added to old Bill C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, to answer my colleague, I say that yes, it is true, we have 
to focus all our energy, and as soon as possible, on restoring 
some value to the plan, but we must not legalize any 
misappropriation of the EI surplus, as employers, employees and 
the unemployed would never forgive us.

to make a comment and ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member explain what happened during the election 
campaign when there were demonstrations in the Prime Minister's 
riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals had made some promises. One of the ministers, the 
public works minister, and another one whose name and title I 
cannot remember, promised people in Quebec that there were going 
to be further changes to employment insurance over and above 
what was in Bill C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member explain it to us in order to shed some light on 
the issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed, during the election 
campaign the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and the 
Minister of Public Works promised a parliamentary committee to 
people, particularly union leaders, who came to meet with them, 
and told them “You are going to be able to propose your 
amendments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some openness in this regard. It was said that they were 
open to changes. I hope this openness to changes did not 
mean that they would be able to put even more money in their 
pockets instead of handing it back to those who contributed to 
the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of this position and the Prime Minister's statement, and I 
will end on this note, in the maritime provinces, acknowledging 
that there were several major flaws in the employment insurance 
reform, we are still waiting for this same Prime Minister to 
specifically acknowledge these flaws through amendments to Bill 
C-2, in order to bring about a true reform of the employment 
insurance plan instead of trying to hide the hijacking, by the 
Liberal government, of the surpluses in the EI fund.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 19 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-5, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak once more about the species at risk bill. 
The last time I spoke on this, I had mentioned a number of 
aspects which satisfied us in principle. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that inevitably a number of international 
agreements had  been signed. However, the most important agreement, 
the one which requires species at risk laws, is the 1992 
agreement called the Convention on Biodiversity, which clearly 
states that every country has to establish and apply legislation 
aimed at protecting species at risk. Canada is one of the 
signatories of this convention, and we are proud of this fact, 
because we must immediately pass laws aimed at protecting 
species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This explains why, as early as 1989, the government of Quebec 
and the national assembly passed a law for the protection of 
species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already spoken about the importance of Canada's 
international commitments. I have also dealt with the importance 
of and reasons for introducing such legislation. I am not 
necessarily referring to this specific bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I will compare some aspects of this bill with the act 
passed by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that it was somehow paradoxical for the federal 
government to introduce a bill because we, on this side of the 
House, believe that it would duplicate the efforts made by 
Quebec in the area of identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the House of the principles of the act introduced 
by Quebec in 1989. They are the identification of species at 
risk, the legal designation of those species and the protection 
of aquatic environment. All this is inevitably linked to 
recovery plans which must be implemented in collaboration with 
industry, landowners and non-profit organizations working on a 
daily basis to preserve the heritage of Quebec. So there are a 
certain number of elements and measures incorporated in this 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, on the whole issue of identification of species, 
the bill will give legal status to the Committee on the Status 
of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, or COSEWIC, which has so far 
identified more than 340 plant and animal species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have the same type of tool in Quebec? Was it necessary to 
create a committee on species at risk for the sake of having a 
double security net? The answer is no. If members look at 
Quebec's act, they will soon see that the province created, back 
in 1989, an advisory committee composed of scientists who are 
knowledgeable about species at risk in Quebec and who have 
identified more than 19 plant and animal species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This advisory committee already exists. It is working in 
co-operation with the Committee on the Status of Endangered 
Wildlife in Canada, or COSEWIC. However, we are disappointed by 
this government which has committed itself toward the government 
of Quebec and the provinces, through the harmonisation agreement 
on species at risk in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that the federal government promised the 
government of Quebec (The environment minister at the time was 
David Cliche) that it would co-operate with the provinces to ensure 
that it would not infringe upon provincial areas of jurisdiction 
nor duplicate provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the federal government did not keep its promise. We 
believe that habitat protection comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. We believe that the federal government should not 
interfere in this area. Under several of the clauses in the bill 
now before the House, the federal government would be able to 
get involved in wildlife habitat management in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about protecting critical habitat, and if 
that is not a direct infringement upon one of Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction, I do not know what it is. In clauses 37 through 
73, that notion of critical habitat is directly applied. This is 
totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable, because in Quebec we have species at risk 
legislation which sets out what we call recovery measures to 
protect the habitats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the federal bill contain the same provisions? Again, the 
answer is yes. Why do we need federal legislation that sets out 
recovery plans when we already have some under Quebec 
legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of compensation. The 
government is clearly improvising on the issue of compensation. 
During a briefing given by Environment Canada officials, we 
tried to ask them a few questions about the kind of compensation 
that would be provided to private landowners, but they were 
unable to give us a definite answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do know, in that regard, is that such compensation will 
be limited, because it says so in the bill. However, we would 
have liked to see a number of other provisions included in the 
bill. I am thinking, among other things, of the Pearse report, 
which said clearly that landowners who believed that they would 
suffer losses as a result of the application of the act would 
receive compensation equivalent to 50% of these losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill before us today were clear on that, at least we 
would know what to expect. However, what we can expect from this 
government, and we see it very often in the bills introduced in 
the House, are provisions regarding regulations, which will be 
made at a later date and which we know nothing about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we are asked to form an opinion and to take 
a stance on a bill when the regulations have not yet been 
tabled. This is totally unacceptable. If the government had 
wanted to be transparent, if it really had wanted people to know 
about the compensation process for landowners, then it would 
have tabled the regulations at the same time as the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement issue is another aspect of this bill. I said a 
few moments ago that Quebec has had legislation on species at 
risk since 1989. 
I would add that not only does Quebec have legislation on 
species at risk, but it also has two other tools. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635
<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first tool is the Quebec wildlife conservation act.  In 
Quebec, we have species at risk legislation and perfectly 
adequate wildlife conservation legislation as well.  We have 
fisheries regulations as well.  These three enable us to protect 
our flora, our fauna and our aquatic environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Closer scrutiny of this bill, clauses 85 through 96 in 
particular, shows that the government plans to create a new 
authority.  Its agents would intervene on both Quebec and 
Canadian territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we accept the creation of a new federal authority, when 
we in Quebec already have wildlife conservation officers?  Those 
officers come under Quebec's wildlife conservation act.  Why 
then create a new federal authority?  How will it apply on our 
territory?  That we do not know.  We do not know what the 
protocols of intervention will be.  We do not know what the 
authority's powers will be.  This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, if this bill merely applied on crown lands, that 
is land under federal jurisdiction, we would not oppose it.  If 
we were told “We are adopting a bill here in the House in order 
to protect endangered species in Canada's national parks” we 
would applaud that.  We would applaud it because the protection 
of species is not restricted to a single territory, and we are 
fully aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more serious is that this legislation will not apply 
just to lands under federal jurisdiction.  It is clearly 
indicated, and we must acknowledged that the minister has shown 
frankness, honesty and transparency by telling us so in this 
House, that the bill would also apply to Quebec lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tells us that, to a certain extent, the bill would 
apply to lands belonging to the government of Quebec, including 
Quebec wildlife preserves.  Imagine that, it would apply to 
lands managed by the government of Quebec. If the federal 
government deemed it necessary, agents of the federal authority 
could turn up on these Quebec owned and Quebec administered lands 
in order to enforce their law.  If conflict is what it wants, I 
do not think the federal government could find a better way to 
stir it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of this bill is the whole issue of offences, as 
if no offences are set out in the Quebec legislation.  It is as 
if the Quebec law provides no offences for an individual who 
decides to stalk and kill an endangered species.  The offences 
covered in the Quebec law are severe.  Why have a federal law 
providing for offences as well? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The laws overlap. This is totally unacceptable, for two reasons. 
The first is because, and I have said this, there is blatant 
interference in areas under Quebec's jurisdiction.  There is such 
blatant interference that the day the bill on endangered species 
was tabled, the minister acknowledged, to some extent, that the 
bill was open to legal challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we the time for a legal challenge?  If Quebec did not have 
a law, it would be a different matter.  There is not only Quebec. 
It is as if the provinces were guilty of not protecting species. 
There are other provinces, including New Brunswick, that have a 
law as well. The expertise and the experience the Quebec 
government has acquired over 12 years of applying the law must be 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is room for improvement, I agree.  A law passed 12 years 
ago certainly needs updating, and I acknowledge this quite 
honestly.  However, we must realize that the federal government 
is about to make a serious mistake by proposing this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the only reason the government is considering tabling 
this bill is to be able to come meddling again in the name of 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the need for legislation on endangered species. 
Considering that there are over 70,000 wild species that exist 
and that have been identified in Canada during all these years, 
we can understand that. Far from me the idea of claiming that 
the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, 
COSEWIC, did not do a good job, on the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, under this harmonization agreement, the two 
governments are co-operating. COSEWIC, which identified 15 
extinct species, 87 endangered species, 75 threatened species 
and 151 vulnerable species, shows that there is a real need for 
legislation. This is a bill that could have some teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are asking the government to act responsibly in its 
own jurisdictions. 
On this issue, as in all environmental issues, we are asking the 
government to take action in its own jurisdictions, instead of 
lecturing the Quebec government as it often does about specific 
issues. Let the federal government take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked the minister to be present in the House 
today. I would have asked him why the federal government took so 
long before introducing a bill to protect species at risk. The 
Quebec government passed such legislation in 1989, but the 
federal government still does not have an act to protect species 
on its lands and sites. Why did the federal government wait so

Biodiversity?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this mandate, we will remind the federal government 
that it must act in its jurisdictions, not only as regard 
threatened species, but also the contamination of its sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Which is its own business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Precisely, it is the federal government's 
own business. How can the government explain that some land and 
sites are currently contaminated?  That contamination is getting 
into the water table. There is contamination of drinking water 
supplies in municipalities. 
My colleague from Sept-Îles, the hon. member for Manicouagan, 
strongly criticized the government for its inaction on the issue 
of the Sept-Îles airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please explain why, in 2001, because of 
contaminated federal land, parents have to use bottled water to 
wash their kids. It is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do Shannon residents have to deal with contaminated water? 
How do you explain that the federal government has known since 
1997 that the military base in Valcartier was contaminated and 
that it has always refused and is still refusing to co-operate 
with the government of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote to the minister at the beginning of the month and my 
letter remains unacknowledged, as if there was no emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is respect for our areas of jurisdiction. What we 
want is for the federal government to be proactive on 
environmental issues in its own areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be examining this bill in detail. It seems that history 
is repeating itself once again. Need I remind the House that the 
government has introduced twice the bill now before the House? It 
was formerly known as Bill C-33. The provinces are not the only 
ones to oppose this bill, environmental groups do too, because it 
does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, with this bill, the minister is alienating the 
provinces as well as the environmental groups. The 
minister should go back to the drawing board and introduce a bill 
that would protect endangered species in his own areas of 
jurisdiction and that would also respect our jurisdictions and 
avoid duplication with provincial legislation.

it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House 
that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
is as follows: the hon. member for Brandon—Souris, Agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly my pleasure to speak to Bill C-5.  I will give a 
bit of background before I actually get into analyzing the bill 
and what will be our party's position on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank those people in the constituency of Red Deer who gave me 
a 73% support margin, the 70% who turned out to vote.  I thank 
the close to 40,000 people who put an <I>x</I> beside my name.  I 
also thank my wife, my family, and all those campaign workers who 
did so much work to make that happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my first speech as the official opposition environment 
critic.  I think it is fair to tell the House a bit of my 
background in environment.  It is fitting as well that I live in 
probably the most beautiful riding in Canada.  I know there will 
be some dispute in that regard, but I have parkland, lakes, 
foothills, the Rocky Mountains and part of Banff National Park in 
my riding.  It certainly rivals most constituencies and is a good 
one for the environment representative to be from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In high school I was very interested in biology and the 
environment.  Most people in my constituency would probably 
consider me somewhat of an environmentalist.  I was very active 
in the province of Saskatchewan in the Saskatchewan Natural 
History Society, the publishing of the <I>Blue Jay</I> magazine, 
Christmas bird counts and sharp-tailed grouse dancing grounds. 
All those were part of my high school days in Saskatoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In university I majored in biology.  During the summers I worked 
for the Canadian Wildlife Service.  I was involved in habitat 
protection projects, in sandhill crane projects at Big Grass 
Marsh in Manitoba.  I spent a lot of summertime working on 
environmental issues with environmental groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon graduating from university I moved to Red Deer where I was 
a high school biology teacher for 14 years.  During that time I 
became rather known in the community as part of the parks board 
and for habitat protection.  Many people would remember me as a 
teacher who could get many teenage students up at 6.30 in the 
morning to go out on early morning birding trips and partake in 
nature.  We did a lot of biological studies.  We studied areas in 
Kananaskis on the east slopes, the Syncrude project and many 
other environmentally related subjects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very involved with a committee that preserved the river 
valley.  We are very proud of our 28 kilometres of trails and of 
our pristine river valley and creeks.  We had to do a lot of 
environmental lobbying through the seventies to make that happen. 
It is something of which our city is very proud. The Gates Lakes 
Sanctuary, the Kerry Woods Nature Centre are all things that are 
the pride of our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved in the provincial organization which was a 
co-operative one between industry and education called SEEDS, 
Society Environmental Education Development Society. That group 
was very active in much of the curriculum development within the 
province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to travel as well and shared the stage with people like 
David Suzuki, talking about the Conserver Society.  My only 
comment there would be that in the seventies I was probably 20 
years ahead of what today is common sense knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now refer to the bill itself and where it is at.  All of 
us are interested in the environment, 100% of Canadians.  We all 
want to preserve species at risk. I am surprised when the 
government did its poll that it found 92% of Canadians cared.  I 
am really surprised it was not 100%.  I cannot imagine people 
saying they are not interested in preserving an endangered 
species.  We are on common ground there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us also realize that there are tradeoffs in environmental 
issues.  Some would have a pristine environment. Obviously those 
people would be prepared to live in a cave, not have roads, not 
have modern conveniences.  Then we could have a pristine 
environment.  On the other side there are industrialists who 
would probably pave the world.  Of course that would be 
unsustainable, would not last and certainly would not be 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere there is middle ground on environmental issues.  I 
believe all of us have to work very hard at achieving that. 
Extremes are not acceptable on either side.  It is that middle 
ground we must work toward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal record on the environment is not very good.  Let me 
talk a bit about that and how it relates to the Endangered 
Species Act.  In 1992 a protocol was signed saying that we would 
put legislation in place to protect endangered species.  The 1993 
red book talked about ensuring a clean healthy environment for 
Canadians and the preservation of natural species.  The 1997 red 
book also said that.  The 2000 red book did not say much about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the environment commissioner say about the government 
and what we have done environmentally?  Let me quote a couple of 
statements that I think puts it in perspective: “In many areas 
the Liberal government's performance falls short of its stated 
objectives.  This gap reflects the failure to translate policy 
directly into effective action”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner went on to say: “Although the federal 
government has repeatedly stated its commitment to sustainable 
development, striking a balance between economic, social and 
environmental goals now and for future generations, it continues 
to have difficulty turning the commitment into action”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one says it is easy to deal with environmental legislation. 
No government will have an easy time with it.  However, 100% of 
Canadians would say that the government should deal with 
environmental issues, be it water or endangered species which 
Bill C-5 addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of where the government has failed to 
deal with the problems.  Many of them have been identified.  Just 
to name a few, if we started with toxic waste sites we would find 
that according to most groups there are some 10,000 toxic waste 
sites across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most notable one is the Sydney tar ponds that have been 
talked about for 100 years.  Legislation has been proposed. 
Solutions have been proposed.  A committee is in operation but it 
has no timelines.  It does not know where it is going. Basically 
no one is happy. Industry is not happy.  People are not happy. 
Politicians are not happy.  The provinces are not happy. Everyone 
recognizes the problem.  Government and all of us in all parties 
need to work on that.  We cannot say we will fix it and then not 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kyoto is another example.  I was not the environment critic 
then; I was in foreign affairs.  I know how Kyoto was dealt with 
in the House.  When the minister said he was going to Kyoto 
questions were asked as to the cost involved if he signed the 
agreement, what would happen, what would be the socioeconomic 
implications of signing the agreement, how he would deliver on 
that signature if he were to sign it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans were very clear.  They could not sign it because 
they had not done enough homework.  The Australians came with a 
lot of homework done and even they had trouble. We went ahead and 
signed it.  Now we are finding that our emissions are 11% higher. 
We have guaranteed to lower them 6% below 1990 levels.  When we 
do not deliver on our promises, people stop trusting us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 is just that kind of legislation.  We can introduce it 
and put all the words in place, but if we have no intention of 
delivering we have some serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it extremely clear, because I do not want a headline 
saying that the Alliance opposes endangered species legislation, 
that the Alliance Party supports endangered species legislation. 
We want it and we encourage the government. It should have come 
sooner.  We want endangered species legislation.  It is a good 
idea.  It is supported by farmers, ranchers, industry, 
individuals, scientists and environmentalists.  We want it but we 
want the right legislation. We want legislation that will work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through our committee I hope we will be able to put together 
legislation that will work to preserve and protect endangered 
species.  The worst thing we could do is to put forward another 
bill that will not work and that no one has thought through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the history behind the legislation and why we 
are doing it.  I mentioned that the convention on biological 
diversity was signed in 1992.  At that point we said that Canada 
would go along with many countries in terms of this kind of 
legislation.  Was it a popular move?  Yes, it was right on.  It 
should have been done and we should be doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not implement anything for eight years. It is not totally 
the government's fault because there were all kinds of problems 
with Bill C-65.  Most people were happy that it died when the 
election was called in 1997.  Bill C-33 was an improvement.  A 
lot of people would say that, but it died with the call of the 
election in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Red book three did not mention any legislation on species at 
risk. I assume that was a typographical problem, that the 
publisher forgot to put it in, and that the page designated to 
species at risk was left out.  I assume the payment to the 
printer was reduced because he did such a bad job of printing red 
book three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the international scene.  As many members 
know, I am very interested in international events.  I am really 
concerned that in productivity Canada has dropped from third to 
13th.  In many areas of health care we are 23rd out of 29 OECD 
countries.  Environmentally we have dropped from fifth to seventh 
in terms of world ratings.  That really concerns me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I travel I ask people what they think of Canada.  They 
usually say positive things and I say positive things about my 
country.  I love Canada.  I would not be here if I did not. They 
tell me the Canada they think of is one with pristine lakes, 
limitless forests, wolves and bears literally on most corners, 
mighty rivers teeming with salmon, and the land filled with 
bounty; the most beautiful place in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is pretty beautiful but it has environmental problems. 
I do not know of many places in Canada that do not have some 
environmental problems.  We love to have international people 
think of those wonders.  Obviously tourism is very important.  I 
used to be part of that industry.  Certainly it was great to 
welcome foreigners to our country and it still is. However we 
must shape up in terms of protecting our environment.  We must 
start doing things that show leadership in protecting the 
environment.  That is partly what Bill C-5 is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of legislation do we want?  We could follow the 
examples we find in the U.S.  We could follow examples from some 
other parts of the world, but we could also learn from the 
mistakes they have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we introduce 1970 California legislation when it did 
not work?  Why should we go through the pains of Oregon, Montana 
and Colorado when there were problems there?  Let us fix what 
they did wrong and learn from that.  Let us do what they have 
done in Britain and Tanzania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On first analysis we see Bill C-5 as being weak and ineffective. 
It has not listened to the provinces, industry, environmental 
groups and landowners to deliver legislation that will work. 
What is our job?  It is to try to fix it.  As the opposition we 
will commit to working with the government to bring forward 
amendments and to try to make it work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that he was very favourably disposed to 
amendments. I hope he means that.  If he does, we will work with 
him because the legislation is good and popular for everyone. 
However, it has to be legislation that will work.  The government 
cannot say that it knows best and that we should have trust.  It 
cannot be that kind of legislation because a lot of people out 
there do not totally trust government to deliver what is good for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be sure that we consult, listen to and implement what 
the people are telling us.  That becomes very important in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that there is a great deal of distrust. 
Some people feel, maybe wrongly, that they will lose their 
business, be it a farm, an industry or a job in a mine, because 
of legislation like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to sit down with people and show them how legislation in 
other parts of the world has been designed so that it will work. 
It cannot be rammed through with closure.  It cannot be top down 
and heavy on penalties, threats and attacks because that will 
never work.  That has been tried and it did not work.  It meant 
that endangered species became extinct because of the type of 
legislation that was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us learn from that and not waste money, RCMP time and 
conservation officers' time trying to enforce a bill that has not 
been well thought out and designed in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not talk about the heavy penalties, the non-compliance, 
the RCMP and the heavy hand of government.  Let us talk about 
what kind of legislation will work to save endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are in favour of preserving endangered species.  We 
are in favour of preserving endangered species.  Farmers, 
ranchers, industrialists and environmentalists are in favour. 
Therefore all members of the House should be on the winning side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would we as the opposition improve the legislation?   What 
should we do?  What must we look at?  I will spend the rest of my 
time speaking about how we can develop better legislation.  I 
will put forward a few suggestions.  Obviously I will miss some. 
Obviously some will come out from people we call as witnesses at 
committee.  They will have all kinds of suggestions.  I have a 
long list of people who want to come and make sure parliament 
hears their voice.  We had better be here to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we need to do?  First, we need to co-operate.  The word 
co-operation has to be critical in the legislation.  Let us start 
with the provinces.  We must not threaten provinces.  We must 
listen to the member who spoke before me who said that Quebecers 
feel threatened by the legislation.  That cannot be.  It will not 
work in Quebec if they feel threatened by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot use court challenges.  We cannot simply do driveby 
smears.  We cannot have ministers using innuendo on one province 
over another.  All provinces must be treated equally.  We must 
remember that all the provinces have signed an agreement stating 
that they will implement and support endangered species 
legislation.  That must tell us how important this is if all the 
provinces have agreed already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have taken a step in co-operation.  Now we must build 
on it.  Having the provinces onside is critical.  This cannot 
work if they do not work with us.  I think all members would 
agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have to have the landowners on side. 
We cannot expect landowners to absorb all of the cost of 
protecting something that 100% of us want to protect.  If all of 
us want to protect an endangered species, all of us must absorb 
the cost of doing it.  We must have input into it and feel part 
of it.  That would be very positive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kinds of things can we do?  Habitat preservation is really 
interesting.  I was involved in such a project.  I mentioned that 
I worked for Canadian Wildlife Service as a biologist.  In one of 
my jobs I spent the whole winter identifying habitat for 
migrating waterfowl.  We used aerial photographs to identify the 
stopping places and breeding places of waterfowl across western 
Canada.  I forget how many millions of dollars we had, but we had 
a bankroll and we signed agreements with farmers to protect that 
habitat for 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.  I went to a place 
called Derwent, Alberta.  I was driving a government vehicle when 
I showed up in town.  I went to the restaurant for a cup of 
coffee and breakfast, and they would not serve me.  I then went 
to a gas station to fill up the tank, and they would not serve 
me.  I then went to the RCMP and an officer said he wished I had 
not come to the station because people would see me there. I 
asked him what was wrong with me.  What was wrong was that I was 
driving a government vehicle and people thought I was a tax 
collector or something.  They did not know what I was doing, so 
they sent me out of town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to Edmonton and met with a lawyer whose name I got from 
the RCMP.  I explained to him what I was doing.  When I went back 
to that community I got a free breakfast.  Everybody said hi and 
knew my name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had <I>x</I> number of dollars.  I phoned Canadian Wildlife 
Service in Saskatoon about two or three weeks later and said I 
was out of money, that all the agreements I had worked on during 
the winter were signed.  My boss said they could not be because 
it was a whole summer's work.  When I said that they were, he 
told me to make friends for wildlife in that part of Alberta, 
which I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to Ukrainian weddings, which often lasted a week, for an 
entire summer.  That was co-operation.  People there were happy 
to be involved in preserving wildlife.  They did not have any 
problem with that at all.  They were happy not to drain or burn 
and to provide nesting sites for migrating waterfowl. They were 
compensated and we co-operated with them.  That is how we must 
approach this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the heavy hand of government come down on those people 
telling them that they must preserve the area or they would be 
fined $50,000, their land would be seized or whatever, there 
would not have been many nesting waterfowl in the area.  The 
government would have been treated like I was when I first drove 
down Main Street.  It would not have been welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could use other examples.  Ducks Unlimited is an interesting 
example.  It often encourages people with incentives to protect 
water and wetlands areas, and it works great.  It works right 
across the country.  It has been in business a long time working 
with people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but tell the story of the gorillas in Rwanda.  My 
wife and I spent a month in Rwanda in 1985.  We trekked after the 
mountain gorillas.  We followed them and we lived with them 
literally for a couple of days.  There are fewer than 500 of them 
left.  Fortunately, however, even with the wars they have not 
been decimated.   The reason for that is farmers in the area who 
were encroaching on their habitat were told that tourists like to 
come and see the mountain gorillas.  They were told that some of 
the profit from tourism in the area would be shared with them and 
that they would be paid not to knock down the bamboo the mountain 
gorillas eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In countries like Rwanda, Tanzania and South Africa there are 
many examples of co-operation in the protection of endangered 
species. They are doing a heck of a job.  It does not cost a lot and it is 
working.  We have to look at all of those examples and I hope we 
will be able to do that in committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best conservationists I know are farmers and ranchers.  I 
had a fellow from my riding phone me recently.  He has owned his 
land for 100 years.  For 40 years he set aside 180 acres for 
wildlife.  He asked me if he should plough it this spring because 
he has an endangered species on the land.  He said he wanted them 
there so his grandchildren to see them, but the government might 
seize the land.  That is what these people are thinking.  I know 
the legislation does not say that but the people do not know 
that.  That is why we need the time to communicate with those 
Canadians who are affected by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not simply brush off the farmers and ranchers as a 
bunch of selfish guys who want money.  That is not true at all. 
They want to save endangered species but they want a co-operative 
way of doing it.  Let us make sure the legislation does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A difficult area to talk about is our aboriginal communities. It 
is very important that all Canadians be treated equally in 
preserving endangered species.  It is very important that our 
native leaders, as well as the grassroots natives, be onside with 
any endangered species legislation or it will not work.  It 
creates jealousy and conflict in the neighbourhoods and it puts 
the species at risk.  Whether we are talking about grizzly bears, 
or salmon or whatever, all Canadians need to be treated equally 
in this legislation.  I cannot emphasize the importance of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that many aboriginal people are very 
concerned about the natural world.  We need to recognize that it 
is part of their religious ceremonies in many respects.  We also 
recognize that if we just talk to the chiefs and not the 
grassroots who are living in substandard conditions, without 
sewer and water facilities, and living in impoverished 
situations, this legislation will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was troubled when I read the part of the legislation where it 
said the government would enforce the legislation for Canadians 
and that it would consult the aboriginal communities.  We cannot 
just consult.  They need to feel that they are part of this.  The 
need to be brought into the consultations.  We cannot leave them 
out.  They have to buy into this.  They have to be a part of the 
groups who make the decisions.  They have to be included in the 
round tables.  They have to be part of everything.  If they are 
not, this will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to include that because some would say that I 
was picking on them.  I am not.  I am saying that we treat all 
Canadians equally.  For me, that bill does not make that clear. 
Let us make it clear.  Let us bring them to our committees.  If 
we do that, we will be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we include industry in this list.  It is 
good business for industry to be interested in endangered 
species.  That is just smart.  The member for Wetaskiwin would 
like this example.  When Union Carbide decided to build a 
petrochemical plant in his riding, one of the first things it did 
was get together with a group and purchase a farm.  It is called 
the Ellis Bird Farm which raises bluebirds.  The mountain 
bluebirds have thrived because of what Union Carbide did. 
Community groups are working with it to work on this kind of 
enhancement of a species.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, when we talk about industry, we must do a 
socio-economic study.  We must include the socio-economic impact 
as part of any endangered species list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a simple matter of saying we are going to protect 
all endangered species.  While it is easy to say we all agree 
with that, we must look at all of the implications, be it the 
aboriginal communities, industry, farmers, ranchers or 
compensation.  All of these issues must be part of the bill.  To 
make this bill too simple will not work.   It will not save any 
species.  That is a major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I leave the Ellis Bird Farm, there are so many committed 
people across Canada.  Myrna Pearman is a person who should be 
recognized.  She is the director, although I am not sure of her 
exact title, of the Ellis Bird Farm.  She makes it click.  She 
makes the community feel part of it.  She makes Union Carbide a 
welcome industry in that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are hundreds of examples.  I know there are lots of 
examples in Ontario and in Atlantic Canada of the same sort of 
individuals and same sort of projects with industry.  They must 
be consulted.  If they are not consulted, they will not be 
players and they will not participate.  That will endanger the 
endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about what is important and what would we do, 
co-operation has to be a word we focus on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just zero in on a few other areas we want to talk about 
with some specifics.  I am going to list these quickly and 
obviously we will have a chance to elaborate more on them later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take time to consult.  We cannot have closure.  We 
cannot have the minister saying it has to get through by June. I 
do not know why we waited eight years.  If takes longer than 
June, than let it.  However, let us do the consultation that is 
necessary.  Let us do it right, if we are going to do it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we need the full committee review.  I have now talked to 
12 environmental groups, a whole bunch of industrialists and I 
will be talking to a lot more farmers and ranchers.  They want to 
be heard.  It is the duty of the House to listen to them.  We 
need to listen to the provinces and talk to each one of them.  We 
cannot use closure or ram this down our throats to get it through 
and be done with it.  It is too important for that in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the species at risk list.  Let COSEWIC, the 
scientists, determine the list.  I found it troubling, and maybe 
I did not understand something, that cabinet would decide on the 
list.  I do not want the cabinet deciding on that.  I want 
scientists making that decision.  I want socio-economic impact 
studies and I want to hear from scientists.  I trust them a lot 
more.  I want the broad range of scientists, not just the small 
range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to make sure we get it clear, many groups have spoken on 
endangered species.  There are many people out there who should 
be listened to.  It is important that COSEWIC base everything it 
does on science, not on politics.   It should be the scientists 
who make the legal list in consultation with all of the people I 
mentioned.  It should not be left to political lobbying, to 
political favouritism or to that sort of thing.  It is too 
important an issue to Canadians to be left only in the realm of 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is communication and co-operation.  The only way this will 
be successful is if we put emphasis on the voluntary and on 
communication.  The bill says we would have round tables. 
I have sat at round tables of foreign affairs.  At one there were 
four defeated Liberal candidates and three fundraisers who were 
there for a weekend with their wives and good meals.  They could 
not have given a damn about the issue we were talking about.  I 
want those round tables to be real round tables.  They are a good 
idea but let us make them for all groups.  Let us listen to the 
extremes, the middle and then come to our conclusions.  They are 
a good idea but let us communicate properly and let us get the 
feeling of the whole country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the country is suspicious about what we are doing. 
Compensation is a major issue and the minister said this in his 
speech.  We must deal with it and it must be in the bill.  It is 
not good enough to say it will be in the regulations and trust 
us. It is not in the bill now.  The only thing that is acceptable 
is to have that in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have serious problems with the Pearse report.  I feel it is a 
formula for disaster.  It will make the endangered species act 
not work.  We need to have compensation in the bill.  We need to 
spell it out and make it clear.  If we do we will please an awful 
lot of people and go a long way in getting the bill through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial-federal co-operation is vital.  We need to see the 
mechanism on how that is going to work and make sure it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the issue of enforcement, we cannot have willy-nilly 
“we'll enforce it” because Environment Canada does not have the 
ability to enforce it.  It says the RCMP will not be involved, so 
who is going to enforce this?  How can we have a bill that has no 
enforcement?  Is there going to be something? Again, we are told 
that it would be in the regulations.  That is not good enough. 
We have to see it.  We have to know what that means before it can 
be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the official opposition believes in an effective 
endangered species legislation.  We support it.  We want to make 
it work.  We want to make it better.  We believe that we can get 
effective endangered species legislation and that we can be world 
leaders.  We have to have a full hearing in committee and clearly 
communicate and talk to Canadians.  We need scientists, not 
politicians listing the endangered species.  We need innovative 
approaches.  We need to learn from what others have done.  We 
need compensation as part of the bill.  It must be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to talk about recovery and habitat protection, not just 
species.  We cannot just really protect a species, we have to 
protect its habitat.  How do we do that?  Of course compensation 
comes into that.  Get the politicians out of it.  The round 
tables have to include all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, I came to parliament because I wanted to make a 
better Canada for my children and my grandchildren.  I want them 
to be able to see grizzly bears catching salmon in B.C.  I want 
them to be able to see dancing prairie chickens.  I want them to 
see sandhill cranes and whooping cranes.  I want them to hear the 
loon on lakes in Ontario.  I want them to be able to see the 
beluga whales at the mouth of the St. Lawrence.  I want them to 
be able to see teeming stocks of cod and other sea life in 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can make this happen.  We can make this country what so many 
international people think of it.  However, we are going to have 
to work at it.  We are going to have to work co-operatively at 
it.  That is what we will be working toward in working with the 
government, hopefully, on Bill C-5.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FUEL PRICE POSTING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK191">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-220, an act respecting the posting of fuel prices by 
retailers, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to demand on behalf of 
consumers that the pre-tax price of a litre of gas be posted. As 
I said when I introduced this bill, when a fuel retailer causes a 
poster, label or sign to be posted indicating the selling price 
for a fuel, the price must be indicated without any taxes imposed 
on the consumer under federal or provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we introduce a bill in the House, it is placed on the 
notice paper and then we have to wait for the draw. 
Sometimes one has to wait one, two or three years before one's 
bill comes up in the draw. If one is lucky, one's bill might be 
one of the first ones to be drawn. I was lucky, which is 
fortunate for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the bill is reviewed by a committee, and one has to explain 
why it should be made a votable item or not. One goes before the 
committee members, as I did last week. Members listen to find out 
what the bill is all about. I explained all that to the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the committee meets a second time to determine whether the 
bill should be made a votable item. And this is when the problem 
starts. Once at this stage, and even earlier in the process, 
there should be a draw to decide which bills are votable and 
which ones are not. This is the problem we have in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the second meeting, last Friday, when opposition members saw 
that I was introducing this bill, Bloc members and Alliance 
members alike said “This is a provincial matter. This is a 
matter for provincial governments. You have no business 
introducing such a bill”. Therefore I did not win; it was 
decided my bill was not votable. But it does not matter, because 
in the House the main thing is to speak on behalf of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to tell the House what the price of a litre of gas 
is: today in Val d'Or, in Abitibi, it is 77.9 cents. Very few 
people know what the price of a litre of gasoline is before 
taxes. However if people call the Régie de l'énergie in Quebec, the 
experts will explain what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price we see announced is 77.9 cents per litre, but when we 
go in to pay the bill after filling up the tank, we see a total 
of $40, for example, but we do not see the 10 cent excise tax or 
the 10.55 cent Quebec road tax on the invoice. In our region we 
do not have a 1.5 cent special tax, as they do in Montreal. 
However, in Montreal motorists pay 15.55 cents, whereas in 
Abitibi, thanks to the government in office, we pay 10.55 cents 
because we live in a remote area. Then there is the GST and the 
QST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers only see two taxes; they do not see the other taxes. 
In the meantime, oil companies, such as Petro-Canada, put a 
sticker on the pumps that says that taxes are included in the 
price. That sticker has been there for months. It is still there. 
The funny thing is that once they stick it there, they forget to 
remove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the price of gas in Abitibi is 77.9 cents. 
Petro-Canada has a sticker on the pump saying that taxes are 51%. 
Let us take this price of 77.9 cents and add a few figures. The 
minimum price, according to the Régie de l'énergie, is 35.8 
cents. The cost of transporting gas to Val d'Or is about 2.4 
cents per litre. The cost of transporting it to Quebec City or to 
Montreal is about 0.3 cents per litre. If we add it up, 35.8 
cents plus 2.4 cents, we get a total of 44.4 cents, which means 
that taxes would be 33.5 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we get to the sticker. I am targeting Petro-Canada in 
particular because the Government of Canada owns 18% of that 
company. The consumer does not know what the exact price of a 
litre of gas is without taxes because it is not posted. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the year consumers are aware of the multiple billion 
dollar profits Canada's oil companies are making.  They know how 
much the bosses and their friends are collecting in dividends, 
yet the companies are unable to tell us how much a litre of gas 
costs at the pumps.  They do not want to tell the consumers 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday morning, at 6.35, I went to a gas station and asked 
for a litre of gas just for the fun of it.  How much would it 
cost?  On Chemin de la Montagne in Hull, the posted price was 
70.9 cents a litre.  I tried to get a litre but did not manage 
to get exactly that. 
I went inside and paid my 70 cents, then went back out and tried 
to pump a litre.  I ended up with 1.03 litres for 71 cents, yet 
the posted price was 70.9 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let hon. members try to do the calculation of what the price of 
a litre of gas is without the taxes.  No matter what means we 
use, this is impossible.  The oil companies are billionaires 
many times over, but they cannot tell the consumer how much a 
litre of gas costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that a litre of gas costs 35.8 cents anywhere in Quebec. 
The price added on top of that is for shipping it to the 
regions.  In Nunavik people do not know the price of a litre of 
gas. We know, however, that 4 cents a litre is for getting it to 
the Chapais, Chibougamau, Matagami and James Bay regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the profit margin is included in the price per 
litre at the pump. 
That is what I want to say to the government, and I tried to 
have a motion passed making the bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government of Quebec is doing a very good job, 
because it allows reductions on the transportation tax or the 
special tax in the outlying regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening right now?  Father Charles-Aimé Anctil, 
Val-d'Or's parish priest, wrote me the following one day:  “What 
a surprise not to hear politicians up in arms about the hike in 
gas prices.  Don't tell me that you can't do anything: you are 
the ones with the power”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing everything we can to get the oil companies to post 
the gross price of a litre of gasoline, minus the taxes.  They 
are not interested.  When we ask them why, we are told that it 
is the governments that are opposed. 
I put the question to the government of Quebec and to the 
Government of Canada and I was told that the problem was not 
them but the oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest laugh of all is that there is nothing preventing the 
oil companies from posting the gross price of a litre of gas in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of today, the price of a litre of gas in Quebec is 35.8 cents. 
It should be possible to find out the gross price of a litre of 
gas, minus the taxes, in Ontario, Manitoba or Vancouver, but it 
is not, because Petro-Canada's pumps break the price down into 
benefits: 1%, price of crude oil, 30%, refinery costs, 18% and 
taxes 51%.  That is what is posted today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However a look below, at the little bottom line reveals the words 
“average prices at the pump in 1999”.  We are being had by 
Petro-Canada, by misinformation.  At the moment, the oil 
companies are worth billions and cannot even manage to change the 
labels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgusting that a company belonging to the Government of 
Canada is incapable of being in consumer mode and revealing the 
cost of gasoline without taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the bill is to find ways to enable the consumer to 
discover the real price of gasoline.  A consumer buying a litre 
of gasoline in Abitibi Senneterre, or anywhere in Quebec knows 
he pays the QST and the GST.  He knows he has to pay the excise 
tax.  He also knows there is a provincial tax.  He knows there 
are taxes for Tom, Dick and Harry, but he cannot know the gross 
price of a litre of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some provinces, there is no provincial tax.  All the better 
for consumers.  One day, with luck, we may not have to pay the 
provincial tax on a litre of gasoline in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What counts most is reporting to consumers, telling them “Here 
is your product and the cost of it”.  A litre of gasoline in 
Quebec is currently 35.8 cents, plus transport, which in 
Abitibi and I am still talking about my region, is 2.4 cents and the 
service station profit may be 3 or 4 cents, but we can 
live with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can live with the taxes.  In any case, we will always have to 
pay them somewhere.  We will take it in our righthand or lefthand 
pocket.  We are always going to get hit.  Be it under the 
government of Quebec or the Government of Canada, we will always 
be paying taxes somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What matters to me is knowing the gross price charged by an oil 
company for a litre of gas.  Not many people have this 
information.  We have specialists.  Perhaps we will know more 
tomorrow because the report on competition, or the study that was 
done, is supposed to be tabled tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the study said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the oil industry should bear in mind the public's level of 
frustration and adopt more transparent pricing practices, 
including showing the gross price and giving the breakdown for 
refinery, processing, whole sale and retail prices, and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that everyone's interests would be better served if the 
industry made a greater effort to explain how prices are set and 
made this information available to consumers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote is from a letter sent me by the minister on June 5, 
2000. I have nothing prepared, I am speaking off the cuff.  The 
federal Minister of Natural Resources wrote me and recommended 
precisely what I have just said:  “that the consumer should be 
better informed”. That is what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It matters little which governments are in power in Canada. What 
matters is the consumer.  When we go into a corner store, we know 
that a case of beer costs $22 plus taxes.  On the reserve, it 
costs $22 without taxes.  That is another story.  Whenever 
one goes to buy something, one knows the price.  Here in Ottawa, 
we know that the lunch special costs $8.95, plus taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Try that with a litre of gas. 
Everybody is upset at the Government of Canada regarding the 
price of gas in my region and elsewhere. I tell parliamentarians 
that there is no act preventing oil companies from doing that. 
There is no legislation preventing oil companies from indicating 
the gross price before taxes. There is no act preventing them 
from doing that. They do not want to do that, they are hiding 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should know tomorrow, because we just got a memo saying that 
Industry Canada will table its report on the oil industry 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always the same thing with this issue. The government is 
the one being blamed. Sometimes this may be a good thing, but the 
government of Quebec is also blamed as well as all the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is wrong to say that all the provinces regulate gas 
prices in Canada. Unless I am mistaken, there may be two 
provinces that have an energy board: Prince Edward Island and 
Quebec. These two provinces set a floor price. They can try to do 
so. Today in Quebec that floor price is 67.6 cents, depending 
on the regions. In Abitibi the floor price of a litre of gas is 
currently 67.6 cents. It is less than in Montreal, because in 
Montreal they also have taxes. These are special taxes for the 
metro, 1.55 cents, and others at 1.5 cents, 0.10 cents, 15.55 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing for Canadian consumers is to know what kind 
of products they are paying for. What is the capital? What the 
gross price before taxes? We do not know. This is what I am 
asking from oil companies. If it does not work here in Ottawa, I 
am asking oil companies to stand up and to show the real price of 
a litre of gas before taxes.

to second the bill of their own party member.  That is how they 
encourage private members' business.  We of course want all 
private members' bills to be votable, but there is no one to even 
second this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's efforts would inform Canadians about the true price 
of fuel as opposed to the price we are paying, which includes 
taxes.  The bill defines fuel as gasoline types of fuels used by 
internal combustion engines and diesel fuel and propane gas.  The 
bill makes it clear that we are not talking about home heating 
oil or aircraft fuel.  We are talking about the fuel we use in 
our automobiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have too many problems with the bill.  The bill is of 
course limited in scope, as well as limited in seconders, because 
it applies only to consumers buying gas for their cars.  It seems to 
me that with the sharp spike in the price of home heating oil and 
gas, which has hit us so hard and is not included in the bill, 
the House should be consumed with that issue and that issue 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are suffering this winter in our cold climate.  It is 
a particularly cold winter this year.  There has been a 70% hike 
in natural gas prices which the Liberals did not foresee and did 
not prevent.  They did nothing about it except to send out 
cheques of a couple of hundred dollars, and then too, to people 
who probably do not pay the heating bills, for example, students, 
prisoners or even deceased Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canadians are paying over a couple of thousand 
dollars compared to the couple of hundred dollars that the 
cheques are for.  The government completely missed the target of 
sending the cheques to those most in need of assistance with 
their heating bills this winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal finance minister has no sympathy for Canadian 
seniors or persons on fixed incomes who have so little money that 
they are choosing among getting their prescriptions filled, what 
they can afford to buy to eat, or heat.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that it is also the Liberal government's fault that 
our heating fuel costs are higher than those in the U.S.A.  This 
government keeps our taxes high and our dollar weak.  We are 
being hurt twice.  It is a double whammy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about gas prices, which is what the bill talks 
about.  We started to see the price hikes about a year ago.  It 
is the amount of tax placed on gas that has driven the price 
upward.  We get really upset when gasoline prices jump by 10 
cents or 20 cents per litre and we hate it when it happens 
overnight.  We hate it most when it happens on a Friday just 
before a long weekend.  We all feel that we are hostages to 
gasoline prices while we also rely heavily on our automobiles for 
all kinds of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance's chief natural resources critic, the hon. 
member for Athabasca, in Alberta, is of course very knowledgeable 
on the subject of gasoline prices.  He has been working in this 
area for a long time.  My colleagues and I have great respect for 
his understanding of this field in particular.  He has been 
recommending transparency in the price of gasoline and has been 
advocating this on behalf of consumers.  He explains that the 
price we pay at the gas pumps includes a tremendous amount of 
tax.  That is why, when the price of gas or oil on the world 
market is hiked, we feel it, because not only is the price of the 
gas hiked but the taxes also get higher with respect to that 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This exacerbates the increase in the wholesale price.  If it 
were not for the taxes piled on top of the price of the gas, 
Canadians would not be so radically affected by the price hikes 
in the world price of oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to be able to clearly see the gouge made in their 
pocketbooks by taxes on gas.  It is not the oil companies that 
are the villains here.  It is the taxes.  If Canadians could see 
the large amount of taxes applied to the price of gas it would 
heighten awareness in Canada of the importance of tax cuts. 
Taxpayers could properly direct their frustration and anger at 
the governments applying these taxes, particularly the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that the Canadian Alliance stands for tax cuts. 
About 9 cents per litre of gas is federal tax.  On top of that we 
have a provincial excise tax.  On top of that we have a 
provincial sales tax.  On top of that we have the GST.  We have a 
tax on a tax on a tax and on a tax.  This is very unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some facts and figures from the B.C. edition of 
<I>FuelFacts</I> for February 13, 2001, which is the latest 
edition.  <I>FuelFacts</I> monitors the price of gas.  Clearly we 
can see from the chart that gas is 29.5 cents per litre.  When 
all the taxes are piled on top of that 29.5 cents, the price of 
the same gas is 74 cents per litre.  That is a shame.  Only 16 
cents of this 74 cent per litre price goes to the refiner and the 
marketer of the gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might say that is how the government raises revenue 
to pay for the things we need such as health care, highways, 
schools, prisons, free flags, golf courses, hotels for the Prime 
Minister's riding and so on.  However, my province of British 
Columbia gets only 5% of the amount of federal taxes we pay on 
gas.  This amount is returned to us to pay for transportation 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the federal Liberals raked in about $360 million in fuel 
taxes from British Columbia.  This figure has risen.  It is now 
about $700 million a year.  The federal government returns only 
5% to British Columbia and B.C. is the only province in the whole 
country that does not have any four lane highways. 
We cannot even buy enough street lamps with the 5% that the 
Liberals return to us for transportation and infrastructure 
development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do all of our tax dollars and tax revenues raised by 
gasoline taxes go?  They are not helping us in B.C. to pay for 
our highways, our airports, the RCMP, border protection, the 
coast guard or emergency preparedness, et cetera.  Our money is 
being kept in Ottawa or is being spent by Ottawa.  Maybe it is 
being spent on some of the boondoggles or maybe in the Prime 
Minister's riding for fountains.  Who knows where the money goes? 
There are many factors in this other than high taxes.  Sometimes 
it is surprising to see how the geography works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prices are affected exponentially with the increase in the price 
at the original level.  Sometimes a 5 cent increase becomes a 10 
cent or 15 cent increase at the consumer level because of the 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to gas stations, I want to mention that the government 
should be investigating how, on any morning, afternoon or 
evening, gasoline prices can suddenly increase, sometimes within 
seconds or minutes.  However, when the price of fuel goes down, 
it takes two or three days for the gas station prices to go down. 
What are we supposed to conclude when that happens?  Is it 
collusion, price fixing or an oligopoly?   What happens to the 
stock or inventory of the retailers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to interfere with their private businesses.  We 
want supply and demand, or competition, to control the market, 
but at the same time we need to balance that with the public 
interest.  We do not want the public to be victimized or 
exploited by the federal government's taxes and then by 
businesses and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill would make it clear exactly how much 
money per litre of gas is being taken by the government out of 
the pockets of Canadians.  However, isolating the amount of taxes 
from the actual cost may not be the real solution for giving any 
tax relief to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, maybe we do not need to legislate.  Maybe the 
retailers would volunteer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the hon. member's bill is a very thoughtful idea and I 
tend to support it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, to follow the rules of the 
House of Commons, I would like to change the name of the seconder 
of my bill. I seek the unanimous consent of the House to have the 
name of the hon. member for Scarborough Centre replaced by the 
name of the hon. member for York West, who is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> Is there unanimous consent to 
proceed in such a fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to hear that the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik has 
finally found somebody to second his bill. It took a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, and before getting to the substance of the 
issue, at the beginning of his speech, the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik accused the opposition parties of 
not agreeing, at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, to make his bill a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of transparency, I request unanimous consent, and 
offer our total co-operation, to make this bill a votable item. 
Therefore, before getting to my speech, I would ask for the 
unanimous consent of the House to make this bill a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> Is there unanimous consent to 
make this bill a votable item? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, things are crystal clear. 
Members on the government side refused to make this bill a 
votable item. So now everybody knows who wants to make it votable 
and who does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this debate into perspective.  What is the situation 
on the fuel market?  Over the last year or year and a half, there 
has been an exceptional increase of prices causing hardship to 
consumers.  It creates inflation.  Truck drivers, farmers, 
consumers and people using heating oil are affected. This crisis 
is ongoing and is costly for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have an industry making record profits and 
governments raking in huge amounts of taxes, especially the 
federal government, which collects taxes not only on fuel but 
also on oil companies' profits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT41"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT41"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add that the federal government will collect more than $5 
billion thanks to the excise tax and will only reinvest 6% in the 
highway system.  This is an incredible cash cow for the 
government; the high prices of gasoline, petroleum products and 
petroleum-based products is not a problem for the government 
since they generate additional revenues.  However, for consumers, 
they represent a real loss of their purchasing power, and 
consumers are really feeling it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the issue is an important one.  How did the 
government address the problem?  It did two things.  First, last 
spring it asked the Conference Board to review the situation. 
We have not yet seen the study; we will have it tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am announcing, and it is a scoop,that members will learn 
that, according to the conference board, the oil industry is 
doing fine. According to the versions of the report that are in 
circulation at this time, and of which we have a copy, we can see 
that it contains no criticism of the oil industry. Members should 
not expect great miracles tomorrow or they will be disappointed. 
In fact, this is not surprising since oil companies happen to be 
members of the conference board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing the government did was just before the 
election. What did it do? It decided to free up $1.4 billion so 
it could send $125 or $250 cheques to individuals or families to 
help them deal with the high cost of energy products, or so it 
said. One has to look at how the government did that. It 
decided to send a cheque to all those who receive a GST tax 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some people do not have an oil heating system, 
they have electric heating. Some do not necessarily use a 
car, they use public transit, and so on. This measure was 
strictly meant to help members opposite during the election 
campaign because I am sure people badgered them on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members just had to say, “Look, we will mail you a cheque in 
January, we will help you”. We are talking about a $125 cheque 
for someone who has an oil heating system and who has seen his 
heating bills doubled. For some families, the increase can be as 
much as $1,000 with a long winter that started early in December 
and that seems to be dragging on longer than last year. 
That makes for incredibly high costs. These timid measures were 
not aimed at the people who really needed help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the bill now before the House. What is the 
hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik suggesting to solve the 
problem? It is a bill that says: “Here is our solution. We are 
going to ask the oil companies to post the prices before tax”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik to try to understand how his logic 
works. The price I am interested in is the price I have to pay. 
Even if the price before tax is posted, when I go fill up, I am 
still going to have to pay the same price if nothing is done to 
change the business practices in the industry and the fuel tax 
policy. The total price is going to be the same. 
Consumers want to know the price they are going to pay, not the 
price that will be posted. I do not see what good it would do to 
post a lower price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> I thank my colleague. I am glad to see I have 
so much support from the Liberals, although it is kind of 
strange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is the real price we have to pay, and that is 
a different debate in itself. Should we always post the price 
with tax? Consumers know full well that they are going to have 
to pay the GST, the PST and the excise tax. They might not 
always know the exact amount of tax they are going to pay, but 
they know the goods they are buying are taxed. The excise tax 
comes to 10 cents a litre and the provincial tax varies in 
Quebec between 10 and 15.5 cents depending on the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes are high, but we already know that. Consumers are more 
interested in finding out what improvements can be made to the 
business practices in the oil industry. 
How can we improve the situation in the short, medium and long 
term? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term, we could give consumers a break by reducing 
or suspending the excise tax for a while. We are being realistic 
and we know that oil products are under the control of countries 
which are big producers and which were therefore able to reduce 
the oil supply so that the price of a barrel of oil is very high. 
This is part of the explanation for the increase. We know that 
and we are being realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However one thing still puzzles us. Why is it that, when the price 
of gasoline at the pump increases, it is suddenly increasing 
everywhere instantly? There could be three or four different 
stations at an intersection, and they all suddenly show the same 
new price. As far as prices are concerned, there is incredible 
harmony among people who should be fierce competitors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I studied economics. I try to understand how this is possible 
without some form of collusion. Of course, this is very difficult 
to prove. But it is something to consider. 
Should we not change the Competition Act to make the burden of 
proof less demanding in cases of anticompetitive behaviour? Oil 
companies should be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an area where we could do something. A very interesting 
study was made a few years ago by Liberal members. It suggested 
that the average price of gas in Canada was about 4 to 5 cents 
higher because there is not enough competition in the industry. 
Why was there no follow-up on this report, why is it gathering 
dust on the shelves? The government is just playing for time by 
referring the issue to the conference board in the hope that the 
problem will just go away. It will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the oil companies publish their quarterly results, we 
realize that record profits are piling up. Their production 
activities have much to do in that regard but I am convinced they 
do not lose much in retail marketing. Logically, the oil 
companies should have a hard time in retailing when prices go up, 
but they do not, because they control the process from refining 
to retail marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go even further than that by looking at what is being done in 
six American states. They have decided that companies will not be 
allowed to be refiner, distributor and retail marketer all at 
once. I will very candidly admit that this was first brought to 
my attention by a working paper prepared by Liberal members 
describing this situation. They wrote that in the United States, 
some states have a 
legislation called a divorce act, to keep companies from being 
involved both in retail marketing and in refining. We have checked 
and there are six of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an interesting notion which prevents too great a 
concentration within the industry. I believe it is a way to 
improve competition in the industry, and we should look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, we should not lose track of another element, namely the 
long term. We must invest massively in the research and 
development of alternative energies. The way we use gasoline 
today has consequences for the environment. It is in our best 
interest to invest massively in the development of alternative 
energies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil industry has no interest in doing so because it stands 
to profit from the current situation. Governments will therefore 
have to be major players in supporting and developing alternative 
energies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I would like to get back to the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. I know he goes around the regions 
pretending to care about gas prices. It was his choice to have 
this motion debated today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another motion in his name, requesting that the 
government considerably lower its taxes on gas. He could have 
chosen that one because it is not his motion that was drawn, but 
his name. He is the one who decided which motion would be 
debated. He chose this one even though he had another one asking 
for lower taxes, which could have been votable. He cannot say 
whatever he likes. If he really wants lower taxes, he should say 
so and act accordingly and introduce real motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I will say that this bill does not deal with the 
problem. Posting the price, before or after taxes, does not 
matter. What matters is the price we pay. We must look for real 
solutions to the real problems consumers are facing, and that is 
what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have the opportunity to get back to this in the next few 
days when the Conference Board's study is made public. We will 
put forward our solutions once again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will say a few words on the motion by the Liberal 
member from across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree with him that we should have more explicit 
pricing of energy costs and should have the taxes listed.  The 
intent of the bill is probably quite honourable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will throw out a couple of other ideas that we might want to 
consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at oil companies today I see them making tremendous 
profits, higher profits than they have made in many years.  I 
think the time has come for the federal parliament to look at the 
idea of a surtax on those excessive profits and of using the 
surtax to reinvest in renewable energy resources.  We should 
start looking for alternatives to the internal combustion engine, 
such as wind and solar energy and other renewables that are 
clean. 
I think we could do that if we had more money to invest in those 
technologies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to lay before the House today a couple of statistics that 
show we have room to put an excess profit tax or special surtax 
on the price of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some numbers from Statistics Canada on the profitability 
of the energy sector:  the oil, gas and coal industries. If one 
looks back at 1999, the after tax net profit was $3.1 billion. In 
the third quarter of 2000 it more than doubled to $7.1 billion. 
In other words, there is an awful lot of money, an awful lot of 
cash, in that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alberta government does not seem to be putting much of a tax 
on the oil and gas companies in that province.  A study was 
recently conducted by a university group in Alberta, the 
University of Alberta's Parkland Institute, in November of this 
year.  It said that the Klein government had basically been 
giving away Alberta's oil wells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes now in Alberta are a lot lower on oil companies than they 
were during the days of Conservative Premier Peter Lougheed. 
Taxes are a lot lower in Alberta than in two other very oil rich 
jurisdictions in the world, Norway and Alaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institute did the study before the increase in energy prices 
and before the huge spike in profits of the gas and oil 
companies.  The study was done between 1992 and 1997.  Between 
those years, if the Alberta government had taxed the oil 
companies as much as Peter Lougheed and the Conservatives did a 
number of years ago, it would have collected an extra $3.78 
billion.  The Alberta government would have collected $3.78 
billion in extra money if it had had the same taxing regime, the 
same royalty regime, as Peter Lougheed, the Conservative premier 
of Alberta back in the 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compare a more modern regime in the world in terms of 
taxes to Alberta, let us use Alaska.  Alaska is part of the 
United States.  It is not exactly a socialistic country in terms 
of taxation regimes.  Between 1992 and 1997, if taxes in Alberta 
had been the same as taxes in Alaska, there would have been an 
extra $2 billion for the people of Alberta in terms of revenue 
from the oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax regime is even higher in Norway.  If Alberta taxes had 
been the same as the taxes in Norway, there would have been an 
extra $5.7 billion per year.  I should make it clear that I am 
talking per year.  If the same regime as the one in Alaska had 
been applied in Alberta it would have an extra $2 billion per 
year.  If the same taxation regime as Peter Lougheed's it would 
have an extra $3.78 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is tremendous room for a tax increase on the oil industry 
in Canada.  These numbers are from 1992 to 1997.  Since then 
prices and profits have skyrocketed.  The time has come for the 
federal government to act by putting a surtax on the excessive 
profits of oil companies and using those profits to invest in 
renewable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some oil companies in Alberta will scream and holler, but we 
have the jurisdiction as the federal parliament to impose a 
surtax.  It has been done to banks and to other companies in the 
past.  Let us take the leadership and do it in terms of oil 
companies and make sure the excess money is used for the ordinary 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My old friend from Souris—Moose Mountain lives in oil country. 
I am sure he will agree that the profits are excessive and much 
too high.  I am sure he will agree that the great Conservative 
leader Peter Lougheed taxed them at a fair rate back in the 
seventies and that the same thing should be done today. 
If Ralph Klein will not do it then we will do it in the 
Parliament of Canada for the benefit of all Canadians, for more 
money in renewable resources.

we can do it to other companies; but we must stay off big oil. 
That belongs to Alberta.  That oil belongs in part to all people 
in the country as well as the excess profit they are gouging from 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are gouging the consumers when they go to the gas pumps. 
Some of that excess profit should be used to invest in renewable 
energy.  They are gouging consumers in Regina, Macoun, Estevan, 
Weyburn, Montreal, Vancouver and even in Bengough.  In 
Newfoundland it is about 80 cents a litre for gasoline.  Big oil 
is bloated with humongous profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put a special surcharge, an excess profit surcharge on 
these big oil companies and make sure that money is used on 
behalf of Canadians.  I believe that is what should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that all these right wingers in the Reform Party and 
my friend from Souris—Moose Mountain will get up and agree with 
that.  As a matter of fact, if we did that we could lessen the 
tax burden from Ottawa on ordinary citizens, have a fair taxation 
system and collect the money on the basis of the ability to pay. 
I believe that is what should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do that, I am sure about 95% of the Canadian people would 
agree that we are going in the right direction.  Even my good 
friends in the Reform Party that come from the oil patch, the 
alliance reform or reform alliance party, would grudgingly agree 
that is not a bad idea whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I would like to make is that my good friend John 
Solomon, a member of parliament from 1993 to 2000, used to 
recommend an energy review commission to review energy prices and 
make sure consumers are not gouged.  It is an idea we should look 
at once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my Liberal friends that the Liberal premier of 
Newfoundland was on television at 5 o'clock this afternoon 
talking about how the Newfoundland government will control the 
price of gasoline in the province of Newfoundland.  It will be 
tied to the world price.  If the world price goes up, the price 
in Newfoundland will go up; if the world price goes down, the 
price in Newfoundland will go down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prince Edward Island does a similar thing.  It is a little 
different in terms of how the price is set there.  It is a little 
more arbitrary in Prince Edward Island, but at least it is the 
same principle and the same idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe, as a federal parliament, we should be directing our 
government to try to co-ordinate efforts across the board, to 
have some regulations in terms of oil and gas prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just a couple of ideas.  As I said, John Solomon often 
used to speak in the House of Commons about the need for an 
energy commission and doing what is now being done in 
Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island.  Perhaps the federal 
government should lead in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my last minute I once again recommend an excess profit tax 
and surtax on big oil.  Let us have big oil pay its fair share. 
Ordinary citizens pay their fair share; in fact they pay too much 
in terms of taxes.  How about big oil paying its fair share and 
using that money, the extra hundreds of billions of dollars to 
invest in renewable energy?  Each and every one of us and the 
environment would be much better off.  I am sure those words are 
supported enthusiastically by my friend from the alliance reform 
party from Souris—Moose Mountain.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak to Bill C-220, an act 
respecting the posting of fuel prices by retailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my hon. colleague for the introduction of the 
legislation.  It will help in terms of achieving greater levels 
of transparency in the pricing and in terms of allowing consumers 
to know the price they are paying at the pumps for fuel that 
actually goes to the retailer and ultimately to the petroleum 
company.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, the real culprit in fuel pricing in Canada 
is not necessarily the producer but, as is more often the case, 
the federal government in terms of the gas taxes that are 
collected and are not returned to the provinces for investment in 
our highways and our infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excise tax on gasoline in Canada and the U.S. is quite 
similar, despite the fact that gas retailers and refineries in 
Canada operate in a less efficient market than the U.S.  The 
federal government is clearly the real culprit in terms of the 
taxes levied on petroleum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1998 to 1999 the federal government collected $4.7 billion 
in gas taxes and only returned 4.1%, or a paltry $194 million, in 
provincial transfers for highways.  Thirty-six per cent to 45% of 
the price consumers pay at the pumps actually goes directly to 
federal and provincial taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 Liberal caucus task force, with, I believe, 47 Liberal 
backbenchers, recommended reducing the federal excise tax on 
gasoline from 10 cents to 8.5 cents.  After studying the issue 
their request was turned down by the Minister of Finance. 
Ironically, what the Liberal caucus task force was looking for 
was the elimination of the 1995 deficit reduction surtax that was 
introduced by the Minister of Finance at that time to ostensibly 
reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficit is gone.  Why is the gas tax, that unnecessary 1.5 
cents per litre gas tax, still there?  It was introduced to get 
rid of the deficit.  The deficit has gone.  The tax is still 
there despite the fact that 47 Liberal backbenchers recommended 
its elimination.  It is one of the times that I actually agree 
with my colleagues opposite that the gas tax should be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have called for a national highways infrastructure program. 
There are great disparities between the provinces in terms of 
their ability to afford to upgrade their highways as opposed to 
some of the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia we are facing significant financial constraints 
and infrastructure deficits at this time.  Highway 101 in my 
riding is a death trap.  There have been over 50 deaths in recent 
years on that highway.  It has the highest level of traffic in 
the province and is one of the most dangerous highways in the 
country.  We are looking for, and the federal government has said 
there will be, a federal-provincial cost sharing or twinning on 
that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that the province is not in the fiscal 
position to participate on a 50:50 basis from day one.  We are 
looking for a front end loading program where the federal 
government would in fact pay the lion's share of the cost upfront 
but, over a five year period, the province would pick up a 
greater part of the contribution.  This would make a lot more 
sense, particularly given the fact that this is a life and death 
issue and should be viewed as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of initiative would, in a reasonable way, facilitate 
the commencement of that project in the short term.  It would 
save lives and lead to greater levels of economic development in 
that fast growing area of the province, the Annapolis Valley.  It 
makes a great deal of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment now on a different area of the petroleum issue. 
The premier of Nova Scotia has been campaigning vigorously on 
this issue, on behalf of all Nova Scotians, regardless of 
partisan politics.  I direct my comments to the member for 
Halifax West, who I am sure at this point supports the premier's 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The campaign for fairness, which Premier John Hamm has 
initiated, is a very important debate in which we need to be 
engaged.  The federal government is currently taking the lion's 
share of offshore petroleum revenues from Nova Scotia.  We are 
not receiving the benefits.  Nova Scotia needs those revenues in 
order to bootstrap itself into the 21st century and afford the 
education and transportation infrastructures needed to compete in 
a hypercompetitive global economy.  At the same time, it needs 
those revenues to reduce its fiscal burdens, particularly its tax 
burdens, which inhibit growth and prosperity in this very 
difficult time.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all the 
members who spoke tonight, be they members of the Canadian 
Alliance, the Progressive Conservative Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois or the New Democratic Party. Most of them submitted 
good ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a remark before my last comment. The hon. 
member for Témiscamingue is trying to mislead the House of 
Commons and the consumers of Abitibi—Témiscamingue by saying: 
“The hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik goes around in 
his riding boasting of what he says in parliament, but in the 
meantime, he tabled a motion saying the opposite”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will put some clarity in the rules of the House of Commons. 
According to last week's draw, I got to present a bill,  not a 
motion. When I received a call from the private members' business 
office, I was in Abitibi, in the beautiful city of Val-d'Or, 400 
kilometres away from Ottawa. That call informed my office that I 
had won the draw and that my bill was chosen, not a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have many motions dealing with the demands made by the 
people of the large riding of Abitibi, which covers 802 000 
square kilometres and has a population of 100 000, including 68 
mayors as well as Inuit and Cree chiefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Témiscamingue is trying to mislead the 
House by saying that it was a motion and that I could choose. 
That is not true. He lied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> I cannot accept that comment, 
absolutely not.  I ask the member to withdraw his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw what I said, 
namely that he lied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
will admit that the member did table a motion dating back to 
Monday only, so he could not have won the draw for that motion. 
In fact, it would have been impossible for him to table the 
motion I was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The member's comment is 
really a point of debate.  I cannot accept it as a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, in any event, we will move to 
another topic because that one is headed nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 14,000 outlets in Canada.  Perhaps half of them are 
private service stations.  They do what they want, depending on 
the price of gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the report that will be tabled tomorrow and 
the comments in it, which matters to the public and to the 
consumer, is that the oil industry, with the millions, the 
billions it is making, stand up.  It should bear in mind the 
public's level of frustration and adopt more transparent pricing 
practices, including showing the gross price and giving the 
breakdown for refinery, processing, whole sale and retail prices 
and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that everyone's interests would be better served if the 
industry made a greater effort to explain how prices are set and 
made this information available to consumers.  That is what is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some good discussion this evening touching on the 
American, BQ, NDP and PC points of view.  What is important is 
that the oil companies are going to have to stand up and tell 
consumers what it costs.  They are hiding behind the taxes.  It 
is true that the taxes should be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like both levels of government, federal and provincial, 
to reduce the taxes.  We are all in agreement with that.  What is 
important is that the oil companies stand up. They are making 
billions of dollars in profits on the backs of consumers.  It is 
time they came clean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could say some unpleasant things, but I will not.  I enjoyed 
this evening's debate.  We all had a very interesting time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> It being 6.30 p.m., the time 
provided for the consideration of private members' business has 
now passed.  The motion not being designated as a votable item, 
the order is dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise this evening to speak on the late show.  I had the 
opportunity of posing a question for the Prime Minister a couple 
of weeks ago with respect to the Prime Minister's visit to the 
United States and his discussions with the President Bush. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was to talk about the unfair subsidization of 
agricultural products that the United States has been so famous 
for.  The Prime Minister in his answer was very forthcoming.  He 
said that he was going to discuss that particular issue with the 
president and that he would try to convince him to remove those 
subsidies wherever possible so that we could compete on a fair 
and level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of my question, I also suggested that if he did not 
receive the answer from the president that he was looking for, 
that there would not be any more subsidies, would he then 
increase the support payments to Canadian farmers so that they 
can compete.  That part of the question was never answered and 
was left hanging, a moot answer from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have an answer because it is extremely 
important.  For example, right now the United States is putting 
$48.2 billion back into its agriculture and its producers. Canada 
right now, and it has increased, is supporting its agricultural 
producers by $3.1 billion.  There is a terrible discrepancy with 
the amount of unfair subsidization, not only in the United States 
but in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my question for the parliamentary secretary tonight. 
Since the Prime Minister did not get any of those assurances from 
the president, since there are still unfair subsidies being put 
forward by the United States and the European Union, since our 
producers are still not able to compete on a level playing field, 
why will the Prime Minister of the country not support 
agriculture?  As a matter of fact, it is getting to the point 
that the Americans are putting more and more dollars into its 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently, the parliamentary secretary and I had an 
opportunity to meet the house agricultural committee chairman, 
Larry Combest, while we were in Washington.  Mr. Combest said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>America's farmers and ranchers will be looking to us to not only 
assist them in coping with the challenges that they are facing, 
but also to make some meaningful improvements to the farm safety 
net in order to bring some stability to their livelihoods.  I 
think that the report we are reviewing today presents us with 
good opportunity to begin an earnest effort in this Committee to 
build consensus on how best to address all the challenges facing 
agriculture today, and to craft better farm policy for the 
future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we had that individual here on that side of the House so 
that those same views could be shared with our producers and our 
agricultural farmers of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the parliamentary secretary to be able to stand today and 
tell us that in fact we are going to compete with the Americans 
on a subsidy basis.  The Prime Minister got the wrong answers 
when he was down there.  I would like to hear the right answers 
from the parliamentary secretary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians can 
be proud of the fact that we have one of the best food safety 
systems in the world.  However, that does not mean that we can be 
complacent.  Recently food inspection systems around the world 
have had to respond to a troubling development, the growing 
threat of BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as 
mad cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has taken several measures to prevent the spread or the 
induction of the disease.  So far, those measures have been 
successful but there is no such thing as zero risk.  That is why 
Canada asked its trading partners to provide information that 
would help to assess their BSE status.  They responded, except 
for Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the FAO, 
report indicated there is significant potential that BSE may have 
already moved beyond Europe.  Further information came to light 
that Brazil may have imported cattle from the European Union 
countries that are not free of BSE.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, Canada suspended imports of beef products from that 
country.  We took an extra step.  We went the extra mile to help 
resolve this issue.  With our NAFTA partners, the U.S. and 
Mexico, we sent a team of officials to Brazil to fully assess the 
Brazilian regulatory system for the risk of BSE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The team has gathered considerable data.  Building on this 
information, our animal health authorities are taking all the 
steps required to complete their assessment expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as Canada's objective in the decision to suspend imports 
from Brazil was entirely related to maintaining the safety of our 
food supply and the health of Canadians, our final decision will 
be based solely upon achieving these objectives.  Canadians 
expect no less.
