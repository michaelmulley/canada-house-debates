	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today because like you I was concerned about reports in the 
press which gave the impression that I had accused you of 
favouritism with respect to one particular party in the House 
vis-à-vis question period. I want to make it absolutely clear for 
the record that I have not done that.
<P>
	I continue to be concerned, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, 
about question period and the role of my party in it. However at 
no time have I suggested that Your Honour had any bias toward 
any particular party in this Chamber. I want to make that 
absolutely clear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona for his courtesy. As a veteran parliamentarian it is all 
the more important that this type of thing be clarified at the 
earliest opportunity.
<P>
	As far as I and the House are concerned with regard to the hon.

(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's lack of action and transparency 
with respect to the proposed restructuring of Canada's rail system, the 
gradual abandonment of regional services by CN, CP and VIA, especially in 
Quebec, and the government's lack of vision with respect to high-speed 
trains.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I thank you for having read before the 
House the motion on railway transportation that I have the 
honour of introducing.
<P>
	As you have already mentioned, I want the House, in other 
words the hon. members, to condemn the Liberal governments's 
lack of action and transparency with respect to the proposed 
restructuring of Canada's rail system. I also wish to condemn 
the gradual abandonment of regional services by CN, CP and 
VIA Rail, especially in Quebec, and I want to stress the 
government's lack of vision with respect to high-speed trains.
<P>
	After the last war, people came to believe that mass 
transportation in rich societies like that of Quebec would 
eventually be abandoned and replaced by cars and trucks. 
Railway transportation gradually collapsed while billions of 
dollars went into building a complex highway network.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	During that period, Europe and Asia upgraded their railway 
transportation networks, which came to play a fundamental role 
in their economic development. Europe in particular relied 
heavily on its train network as a public means of transportation.
<P>
	Railway transportation plays a fundamental role in the 
Canadian transportation system. The most important 
contribution of railways to the Canadian transportation network 
is, without a doubt, in the natural resources sector. In 1993, 
according to the National Transportation Agency, bulk products 
like potash, wheat, coal, lumber, newsprint, etc. accounted for 
about 54 per cent of the traffic on all railway lines, down about 2 
per cent from the previous year, 1992. That shows to what extent 
railway companies are dependent on raw materials.
<P>
	At the intermodal level, rail-road transportation is the most 
important, followed by rail-road-water transportation. 
Intermodal transportation is an important and growing part of 
traffic for CN and CP. In 1993, this traffic increased by 8 per 
cent for both companies. It amounted to 6.2 million tonnes for 
CN and 5.4 million tonnes for CP.
<P>
	In 1993, it was the third most important area for both CN and 
CP. This explains why the two companies are investing heavily 
in this sector. For example, CN built the St. Clair tunnel between 
Sarnia and Port Huron, and CP upgraded the western tunnels on 
its line.
<P>
	In the last few years, CN and CP have entered into large 
contracts with intermodal or trucking companies. CN in 
particular signed a deal with CSX, an American firm, for the 
transportation of truck trailers between Canada and the 
American midwest and southeast regions. CP did the same with 
Gilford Transportation. Intermodal transport has the highest 
growth potential for railway companies.
<P>
	For Canadian railways, competition comes mainly from two 
sectors: trucking and railway transportation through the US. 
Trucking is heavily subsidized by the government since truckers 
do not have to pay for the building and maintenance of the 
roadway. As railway companies must develop and maintain their 
own network, truckers have an important advantage over 
railway companies.
<P>
	CN and CP have repeatedly complained about the inequity of 
the fiscal treatment in Canada and in the United States. It would 
seem that because of the diesel tax and the various real estate 
taxes they must pay on lands crossed by the railway, their tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7771"> 7771 </A></B>
<P>
burden is heavier than that of their American competitors, which 
causes Canadian carriers to be non-competitive. CP estimated  
the tax burden on railway companies to be 48 per cent higher in 
Canada than in the United States.
<P>
	We know that the financial situation of both CN and CP is far 
from brilliant. We know that both companies are unable to 
generate sufficient operating revenues to post net profits. As a 
matter of fact, since 1988, CN has posted a profit only once, in 
1989; in 1992, the company lost around $900 million. It is 
encouraging to note that since the beginning of 1994, CN has 
posted a profit of around $200 million. However, it is not enough 
to produce an acceptable return on investment.
<P>
	For its part, since 1988, CP has lost money only in 1991 and 
1992, but its profits are also quite inadequate to produce an 
acceptable return on investment.
<P>
	Moreover, in Canada, since 1987, railway companies have 
been experiencing a drop in return on investment; it was only 3 
per cent in 1992. This situation is of great concern since 
American carriers have experienced an increase in return on 
investment from 4.9 per cent, in 1987, to 7.2 per cent, in 1992.
<P>
	If railway companies are not able to generate sufficient 
profits, it is obvious that they will be unable to invest enough 
money to maintain and improve their network.
<P>
	I will now say a few words about traffic. In 1993, total railway 
traffic amounted to 238.9 million tonnes, an increase of 1.1 
million compared to 1992.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Again according to the National Transportation Agency, CN 
accounted for 39.6 per cent of domestic rail traffic and CP had a 
33.1 per cent share, leaving 27.3 per cent for regional 
companies.
<P>
	As for the workforce, we know that in 1985, CN and CP Rail 
had 77,960 employees. By 1993, this number had fallen to 
48,841. The same year, the total payroll of both companies was 
$2.7 billion or 49 per cent of their $5.5 billion operating costs. 
Then CN implemented a plan to streamline its workforce. From 
32,392 the number of workers went down to 22,395. Some 2,096 
people work at company headquarters in Montreal. In all, close 
to 6,800 people work for CN in Quebec.
<P>
	Nowhere in the world does the passenger railway service 
really break even. It is a public service as are the road system, 
the school bus system, the St. Lawrence Seaway, the coast 
guard, the armed forces and others. I could go on and on.
<P>
	Canada had established a respectable railway system that was 
acclaimed in all European countries. Canada would never have 
developed like it did if our two coasts on the Atlantic and the 
Pacific had not been connected by the railroad. Other countries 
go on operating and developing their passenger service even if it 
is not cost-effective because it is beneficial in other ways.
<P>
	Take the way it relieves traffic congestion on highways. Also, 
in remote areas, for instance in Abitibi, in the Gaspé Peninsula, 
in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, passenger rail service is 
essential in order to compensate for the shortfalls of the 
education system, the lack of cegeps and universities, and also 
the lack of specialized health care. We cannot picture someone 
from the Gaspé paying approximately $600 to fly to Montreal 
for medical treatment, much less riding in a bus for 22 hours. A 
train with the new technology could replace these methods of 
transportation, and do so economically.
<P>
	It must be borne in mind that the train, using the new 
technologies as is done in Europe, almost completely eliminates 
pollution. Even with the existing technology, trains produce far 
less pollution than do cars or buses.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, cutting passenger rail links in the 
suburbs of major cites and outlying regions will just send the 
traffic back to the roads and shift the expenditures from the 
federal government to the provinces. The Canadian industry is 
obviously interested in maintaining passenger transportation at 
home, given that it has developed technology that it is exporting 
abroad.
<P>
	The saying ``No man is a prophet in his own country'' 
certainly applies to Bombardier, which exports its technology. 
The success of TGV in France is a case in point.
<P>
	The abandonment of passenger lines seems imminent on 
certain Quebec lines, such as Jonquière-Montréal, the Chaleur 
line, Gaspé-Montréal, Montréal-Senneterre, 
Senneterre-Cochrane, in Ontario and Montréal-Saint John, in 
New Brunswick, and Halifax.
<P>
	As this House knows, the abandonment of passenger services 
is not subject to the National Transportation Act. In any event, 
some of my colleagues will have an opportunity to come back to 
this.
<P>
	Finally, a number of jobs at CN and VIA headquarters in 
Montreal have been transferred to Campbellton, which just 
happens to be in the Minister of Transport's riding. I am sure this 
is no accident. Several jobs have also been transferred from 
Montreal to Winnipeg. In addition, the riding is represented in 
this House by the Minister of Human Resources Development. I 
am sure this is also pure coincidence, unless the intention was to 
thank the minister for trying to sell us the social security reform. 
But then again, as you know, this is only speculation going 
round in the halls of the House of Commons and such rumour is 
entirely without foundation. The government is much too 
transparent to contemplate such things, is it not?
<P>
	As you know, several applications to abandon rail lines are 
presently before the National Transportation Agency. 
Applications to the agency are almost automatically approved 
and, in most cases, without public hearings. Take the Murray 
Bay line 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7772"> 7772 </A></B>
<P>
that runs through my beautiful riding of  
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, for instance. In that case, 
the constituency asked to be heard by the National 
Transportation Agency. Their request was also denied and the 
Murray Bay line was sold without the people most directly 
concerned having been heard.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues will have the opportunity to come back to the 
issue of rail abandonment in their remarks. We know that 
railways are an economic development tool. Let me give you an 
example of economic development for the small municipality of 
Port-Daniel, in the Gaspe Peninsula, which borders on two 
ridings: Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Gaspé. There 
is a chance that the municipality could land a contract with Arab 
countries interested in establishing a cement factory.
<P>
	While 18 per cent of the population is unemployed in the 
Gaspe Peninsula and 39,4 per cent in Port-Daniel, here is a 
chance to create 400 new jobs. However, the municipality must 
meet two preconditions set by the Arab promoters: it must have 
a seaport and a railroad. What would happen if the railroad 
between Gaspé and Montreal were to disappear? Well, the 
cement factory project would fall through and the 
unemployment rate would remain high in the municipality. The 
400 people who would have found work in the factory would 
remain on UI or welfare and the taxpayers would have to foot the 
bill. That is the kind of horror story caused by decision makers 
with no medium or long-term vision.
<P>
	It is easy to make the case that a service is unprofitable based 
on figures alone. But before drawing hasty conclusions, we must 
be sure we have all the facts. Moreover, it is a well-established 
fact that when the times are hard, every job category, from the 
company president all the way down to the workers, must do its 
share. Mr. Speaker, do you think that CN employees are happy to 
have accepted cutbacks in their working conditions when they 
leaf through certain magazines and read things such as what I 
will now mention?
<P>
	Canadian National allegedly gave its president, Paul Tellier, a 
$432,000 no-interest loan to buy a house, of which $300,000 
came from CN Rail and $132,000 from SRS or Supplemental 
Retirement Security. This loan was not guaranteed by a 
mortgage so that this deal would not be made public. In return, 
the president signed an interim note and increased his individual 
life insurance by $300,000 payable to CN Rail to guarantee his 
loan. Worse yet, while a $432,000 loan was allegedly made, the 
house, according to our information, was assessed at $283,000.
<P>
	This same president made Canadian National pay for the part 
of the retirement plan payable by him, which amounts to 
$14,000 a year. Yet, CN pays its president, Paul Tellier, an 
annual salary of $345,000 plus expenses. After pointing out 
these horrors, I would like to get back to other issues of capital 
importance to Quebecers and  Canadians, whenever decisions 
concerning railways have to be made.
<P>
	My colleagues will have the opportunity to revisit the issue of 
the environment, of energy consumption by trains. They will 
have an opportunity to speak to you about high-speed trains, a 
project which would put Canada on the map of high-speed rail 
transportation in North America, a market estimated at $200 
billion. Nonetheless, the current Liberal government prefers to 
sink billions of dollars into projects like Hibernia, whose 
profitability is doubtful.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my time is running out. My colleagues will have 
the opportunity to get back to the whole approach on short-line 
railways. The rationalization of railways must continue, but the 
government must allow these short-line railways to operate the 
secondary network. Canadians and Quebecers must also be 
informed of an issue of national interest, namely the cavalier 
attitude of the government, which excluded the Official 
Opposition and the third party from the commercialization 
review of the largest Crown corporation, CN. That is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	It is inconceivable that the government would consider major 
decisions affecting railways without first consulting Canadians 
and allowing elected parliamentarians to participate in 
decision-making. We must condemn the government's 
carelessness and lack of vision in the area of rail transportation. 
All Quebecers and Canadians must be asked to boycott the task 
force on CN commercialization since it is composed of eight 
Liberal MPs and one Liberal senator and excludes members 
from the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	With this membership, the committee will have total control

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, all Quebecers and Canadians must be asked to 
boycott the task force on CN commercialization since it is 
composed of eight Liberal MPs and one Liberal senator and 
excludes members from the Bloc Quebecois and Reform Party. 
With this composition the committee will have total control 
over calling the witnesses it wants and being told what it wants 
to hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I wish to inform the House of Commons that the 
government's current actions and policies regarding railways 
only gives ammunition to the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois for the upcoming referendum. The more the federal 
government cuts services to the population, the more Quebecers 
will ask themselves what they are getting in return for the $28 
billion in taxes they pay Ottawa every year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7773"> 7773 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will take this 
opportunity, but not to put federalism on trial, because after all 
Canada has contributed to Quebec's economic development. We 
have a specific example of that with Mr. Chrétien's visit to Asia. 
I will not get off the topic, except to say that I find it very strange 
to hear the opposition member say that this government is doing 
nothing for rail transportation.
<P>
	I would like to ask him this question: Where was the present 
leader of the opposition when he was a minister in the 
Conservative government and on October 4, 1989, the 
Conservative government, with Lucien Bouchard as Minister of 
the Environment in the Mulroney Cabinet, announced cuts of 50 
per cent in VIA Rail's services across the country?
<P>
	I think that we should use today not to put federalism and 
federal transportation policy on trial but rather to call the Leader 
of the Opposition to account for what he did then. He was there 
and he cut the north shore Montreal-Trois-Rivières-Quebec 
City service, for example. Lucien Bouchard was also party to the 
decision to cut the 
Montreal-Ottawa-Sudbury-Winnipeg-Calgary-Vancouv
er service known as the Canadian. Lucien Bouchard was there 
when the night service from Montreal to Toronto was cut. 
Lucien Bouchard was there when the Winnipeg-Capreol 
service was cut.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would prefer that the hon. member refer to 
him as the Leader of the Opposition or the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean, if possible, instead of by name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. You are right.
<P>
	I just wanted to show that the last government is the one that 
cut services across Canada. It cut the service in my region of 
Gaspé from seven days a week to three. However, we are the 
ones who decided to restore rail service, but I ask the opposition 
to admit that their leader was party to a major decision to slash 
VIA Rail's services throughout Canada. I think that the Leader 
of the Opposition should be good enough to appear before us 
here to explain his actions to members of this House, Canadians 
and Quebecers. He should say, ``I cut VIA Rail's services 
because I no longer believed in it.''
<P>
	I ask his opposition critic to tell me why Mr. 
Bouchard-excuse me, the Leader of the Opposition; I 
apologize, Mr. Speaker-who claims to be the great defender of 
Quebecers cut so many services, up to 50 per cent, throughout 
Canada in 1989.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are used to hearing such 
comments from the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. He should know however 
that no one, no minister, no hon. member sitting on the front 
benches will ever do what the Leader of the Opposition did in 
May 1990. This man, who now  leads the Opposition, resigned. 
You, Mr. Minister of Transport, even less than anybody else-
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Oh yes, go ahead.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I would ask you once again to 
address your remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> He also resigned when he was an ambassador.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you please inform the 
Liberal members and ministers that the Leader of the Opposition 
left the Conservative Party to stick to his principles, and he 
acted in a manner no one, certainly not the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, no minister in this 
Parliament will ever act. He acted on his principles and, because 
of that, he is beyond reproach.
<P>
	A moment ago, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine was asking where the 
Leader of the Opposition was, but, Mr. Speaker, allow me to ask 
this of the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. Where were you last 
April during the public hearings organized in Gaspé by Cynthia 
Paterson of Rural Dignity of Gaspésie? Where were you during 
these hearings when 50 briefs were received from the people of 
Gaspé? Where were you?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again, I remind hon. members that they 
must always address their remarks to the Chair. I am always 
here. I will be with you all day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was certainly not in Paris. I point 
out to the hon. member that, in 1989, the current Leader of the 
Opposition was then a minister in the previous government and 
he made his decisions known. I too was not a member of 
Parliament back then. I was elected in 1993. I think I can say that 
voters in my riding of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, in 
the Gaspe Peninsula, are unanimous to say that their MP is the 
number one promoter of the region's development and interests, 
and that includes CN and VIA Rail. Indeed, we are the ones who 
reinstated the service and made savings, and we are also the ones 
who will guarantee the provision of that service. Separating 
Quebec from the rest of Canada will not guarantee CN's future, 
nor an adequate service for the regions.
<P>
	When the opposition talks about the future and, for example, 
the high speed train, it never says anything about remote 
regions. What about those regions? I am not the one who has to 
take the criticism because I am not the minister. I am just a 
private member. However, I certainly hope that I represent my 
constituents with dignity and I want some answers. Quebecers 
want to know why Mr. Bouchard was involved in the decision to 
cut 50 per cent of the rail service in Quebec. We want answers.

Instead of criticizing the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, you should ask that 
question to your leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not referring to events 
which occurred in 1989, before the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine became an MP. I want to 
know where the member was when, in April 1994, we heard 50 
submissions from Gaspe residents, from the local community 
service centres, from the Regroupement des Caisses populaires 
and from various other stakeholders. This is called the 
boomerang effect. Remember the old saying: People in glass 
houses should not throw stones. This is all I had to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I made VIA Rail and the need to 
maintain this service the focus of my election campaign. I urge 
the opposition to carefully look over what was said during that 
campaign. I can assure you that I consulted the workers and all 
the people in my community well before the Bloc Quebecois 
came up with the idea that it should hold an information session 
in the Gaspé area. If you read the letters sent to the Minister of 
Transport and the local newspapers' reports about the 
involvement of the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the attention he pays 
to this issue, you will see that I was several months ahead of the 
opposition.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I want to point out a common error made by 
partisan members who get carried away by their enthusiasm. 
With all due respect for the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur, I want to tell the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans that the city of 
Campbellton, in New Brunswick, is not in my riding. I know 
that, as soon as he can, he will rise in this House and apologize 
for his allegations concerning employees being transferred in 
Campbellton, New Brunswick.
<P>
	The member probably does not know the difference and has 
not checked the facts, because he would know that Campbellton, 
which is in the riding of Restigouche-Chaleur, is a CN centre 
where some 1,000 employees used to work. The Minister of 
Transport represents the constituents of Acadie-Bathurst. I am 
convinced the hon. member will do what is expected of him in 
this House and rise and apologize.
<P>
	Sometimes, when a member makes a speech on a very 
emotional issue, like the future of the rail system, VIA Rail, and 
so on, he or she can mislead the House, albeit inadvertently. The 
member is not doing so out of spite, but simply because of a lack 
of knowledge. This is why I am pretty sure the hon. member will 
recognize that his statements about the CN transferring jobs to 
my riding are totally untrue.
<P>
	Naturally, when there is a debate and the transport critic for 
the Opposition gets involved, it is very difficult. Often times, 
either he does not remember the facts or he has not done his 
homework adequately, which makes things very difficult for us 
because we have to discuss the facts once in a while.
<P>
	Today's motion refers to a lack of transparency. As you know, 
Mr. Speaker, ten days ago, I was in Winnipeg where we talked of 
transparency, integrity and clearness and, concerning the vast 
debate surrounding the referendum to be held in Quebec, we 
wondered, for example, if the Bloc Quebecois is representing 
the independence or separation option, and again an hon. 
member of the Bloc Quebecois who was there tried to ram the 
sovereignty issue down our throat.
<P>
	In speaking of transparency, integrity and honesty, one has to 
refer to the facts, use the proper words and make statements that 
one is ready to stand up for. One cannot rise in this House and 
use a debate like this one to make up all kinds of stories based on 
nothing at all.
<P>
	That is why I thought we could hold a debate on the national 
vision of Canada which is supported by the Bloc Quebecois 
concerning the rail system, be it for CN, CP or VIA Rail. It 
would have been interesting to hear our friend, the critic for the 
Bloc Quebecois, explain what kind of integrated system across 
Canada, what kind of national system for all Canadians from sea 
to sea to sea they contemplate for this country. It would have 
been very interesting for Quebecers and Canadians to have an 
opportunity to see exactly what kind of system these people 
want for Canada, not only in the context of today's debate, but 
five, ten or 15 years down the road.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the tragic things about this kind of debate is that for all 
kinds of reasons having nothing to do with an efficient and an 
effective transportation system, the hon. member and members 
of the opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, enter into a debate on 
national institutions, on the national transportation system as it 
relates to rail, but with one objective. That objective is to sow as 
much discord as they can and to misrepresent what is actually 
taking place for example in the restructuring of CN.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	As I have said, it is abhorrent that a member would come to 
the House in a debate that they put forward in terms of their 
motion, make an allegation and not correct it when I gave him 
the opportunity to do so as he was sitting in his place. The hon. 
member did not avail himself of the opportunity to stand and 
apologize for having misled the House by suggesting that CN 
had moved employees to Campbellton, New Brunswick, which 
he alleged was in my riding. That is absolutely false. This is not 
something that slipped out. It was a prepared debate; he was 
speaking from a prepared text.
<P>
	The kinds of things we face day in and day out in the House are 
misrepresentation, distortion of fact, inappropriate behaviour 
and then not even the capacity to do the honourable thing and 
stand in one's place to withdraw.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7775"> 7775 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to what we are doing in the railroad industry, let 
me point out to my hon. friend, the transport critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois, that since the government came to power on 
November 4, 1993 there has not been a single request from VIA 
Rail to abandon any service in Canada, with the sole exception 
of the VIA service between Montreal and Saint John. It did not 
announce its decision to change that service because it wanted 
to. It had to because of the abandonment of that service by CP 
that owns the railbed and must maintain it in a condition 
satisfactory for passenger service.
<P>
	To listen to the opposition one would believe that all across 
the country we are faced with serious service cuts to VIA. The 
fact is, and I know it is difficult for the opposition to deal with 
facts when they do not suit its particular needs, that not a single 
service abandonment anywhere in the country has been 
requested by VIA. The only one that took place was because of 
reasons beyond its control.
<P>
	Canadian Pacific and Canadian National entered into merger 
talks that took place from the end of 1993 until the summer of 
1994. There were serious discussions with a focus on merging 
the operations of CN and CP east of Winnipeg. In the early 
summer the responsible people at both companies advised us 
that the merger talks had not produced any definitive, positive 
results.
<P>
	Within days Canadian Pacific tendered an unsolicited bid to 
purchase the assets of CN east of Winnipeg. The government is 
analysing that business proposal and looking at it from a policy 
point of view. Canadian National and its board of directors have 
a fiduciary responsibility to analyse the offer and make 
recommendations to the government. We have said that we will 
respond in due course.
<P>
	Did we hear anything today from the spokesperson for the 
opposition with respect to party's position on the unsolicited bid 
from CP? Have we heard anything about the merger in terms of 
whether they are for it or against it? What are the other 
alternatives? What kind of policies do they have except to say it 
is another example that the separation of Quebec is a better 
option than staying as a member of the federation.
<P>
	We have appointed a committee to look at the 
commercialization of CN. We felt it was appropriate, given the 
fact that there is an unsolicited bid from CP to purchase CN east 
of Winnipeg. That would result in the privatization of all rail 
operations east of Winnipeg to the Atlantic coast. It would also 
have the result of eliminating for all intents and purposes 
competition on rail in eastern Canada east of Winnipeg. We 
could not allow that to happen.
<P>
	What did we do? We checked with the transport committee. 
We asked what its fall schedule was. It indicated it was going to 
be dealing with other issues. As a result we asked members of 
the government to sit on a special task force to look at the 
potential for commercializing CN operations across Canada, 
hopefully with employee participation.
<P>
	We asked the member for Kenora-Rainy River to chair the 
task force. He was an employee of Canadian Pacific before he 
became a member of the House, a man who worked as a railroad 
man, a train conductor, and as a leading representative of unions 
that dealt with railroads in western Canada. We asked people 
from across the country who exhibited an interest in rail 
activities to sit on the panel. They are going to hold extensive 
meetings across the country. We hope people will come forward. 
Members of Parliament on both sides of the House have 
expressed some support, some concerns and some opinions. We 
want to hear what the Bloc Quebecois thinks about the 
commercialization of CN. Does it believe the employees at CN 
would have a better chance of protecting their jobs if some of 
them were owners of shares in a commercialized CN operation 
across the country?
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	We want to know what the options are if the CP bid is 
accepted. What does it do to competition? What does it do to 
service in eastern Canada? What becomes of CN west? What 
happens with commercialization of CN across the country with 
or without employee participation? What are the benefits? What 
are the downsides?
<P>
	What happens if we maintain the status quo on an ad hoc basis 
and keep finding applications before the NTA for rail line 
abandonment in provinces like Ontario, Saskatchewan and 
British Columbia where it is very difficult to get to short line 
operations? What is the position of the Bloc Quebecois on short 
line operations? We know it wants to maintain railroads across 
the country. It does not want to maintain the country but it wants 
to maintain railroads across the country. It is a typical position. 
As we say in French, ils ne savent pas sur quel pied danser.
<P>
	It will be interesting at some point to hear concrete 
suggestions rather than hearing: ``We want to maintain 
everything we have in rail but destroy the country''. Let us see 
what we can find out from the Bloc Quebecois about what it 
really thinks would be important in terms of the future of rail in 
the country.
<P>
	The government believes the time has come. Canadians in 
Quebec, in Ontario, in British Columbia, on the prairies and in 
Atlantic Canada want decisions to be made that provide some 
degree of certainty and certainly provide for an alleviation of the 
burden on the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7776"> 7776 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why we constantly ask Canadians interested in the 
issue to express their opinion. We have begun consultations all 
across the country. There are people in Transport Canada with a 
mandate to consult people and interested parties in all parts of 
Canada in order to find out their concerns and especially what 
solutions they have to suggest and what they can propose to 
protect a railway system which meets the needs of its users.
<P>
	It is always the same story with the Bloc Quebecois. They 
want to keep the whole rail system in this country intact, be it 
CN or CP, they want to maintain all the services provided by 
VIA, but they want to destroy the country, they want to separate. 
They want to maintain all rail services, but they want to cut 
Quebec off from the system that runs east, west and North.
<P>
	At some point, we can ask people to react and give us their 
opinion, but in the end, the opposition must act responsibly and 
put forward concrete proposals and tell us exactly how it sees 
the future. Let us not dream about other countries like France or 
Germany where a system works more or less well. Let us talk 
about Canada. We want to know what solutions the Bloc 
proposes to the railway problems that have existed for a very 
long time. These problems did not start twelve or fourteen 
months ago.
<P>
	The status quo is unacceptable because it led to the complete 
elimination of rail service in Newfoundland and Prince Edward 
Island. As of January 1, 1995, Canadian Pacific will cease all its 
activities east of Sherbrooke. That is a direct result of the status 
quo and, in this debate, it is a non-solution because we have to 
live with the proposed changes every day. For our part, we want 
to assure Canadians that we will propose changes which we hope 
will reflect Canadian reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In that context I would ask members of the House on all sides, 
with all points of view, not to continue to recite the litany of 
woes and ills that we faced in the railroad industry over the last 
couple of decades but to address in a serious way what kinds of 
solutions we should be considering. What alternatives are out 
there in the Canadian Pacific situation for shareholders, 
shippers and employees; in Canadian National for the 
shareholder, which is the Canadian taxpayer, shippers and 
employees; and in VIA where subsidy levels have been reduced 
but are still very tangible?
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I look forward as the debate continues through the day to 
hearing concrete solutions, real suggestions that can be taken 
into account in a pragmatic way by members on all sides of the 
House. If we are to achieve in rail the kind of stability we need to 
underpin a rebuilding economy, we will need the co-operation 
of the management of the railroads, the people who work on the 
railroads and the people who ship and use the services provided 
by  railroads. We will also have to convince Canadians we are 
doing the right thing.
<P>
	Coming to the House, misrepresenting what has been said or 
what has been done and making allegations that are known to be 
incorrect does not make much of a contribution to the debate I 
think Canadians believe should be taking place with respect to 
the future of rail in Canada.
<P>
	In closing I commend members of the task force who have 
taken on the very difficult chore of going across the country, 
listening to people in every part of Canada who have a real 
interest in the future of rail, and asking them specifically what 
they think about the commercialization of Canadian National.
<P>
	What do they think about moving this company into the 
private sector with employee participation, if at all possible? 
What do they believe is important for the future of rail in 
Canada? Is it a service from Halifax to Vancouver? Is it a 
national railroad that provides a core service? Are they 
convinced it is an alternative that should be looked at? Do they 
believe the Government of Canada, in assessing the unsolicited 
bid from CP, should not only be dealing with it on the basis of 
accepting or rejecting but on the basis of the status quo which I 
think all of us in the House agree is unacceptable? Or, are there 
other solutions beyond the CP bid and beyond the 
commercialization of CN?
<P>
	Members of the House of Commons representing the 
government will be going across the country. We have asked 
them to bring that report forward as soon as they can. People will 
know that when the CP bid was presented it had a time frame 
calling for the government to respond in 90 days. We have said 
we do not feel bound by that restriction, but the government and 
Canadian National are actively pursuing a business case 
analysis of the proposal.
<P>
	The government has a duty to look at it from a policy point of 
view because of the implications of accepting the bid. I hope the 
Nault task force, with members of Parliament who have a very 
keen interest in the matter, will be able to get the views of 
Canadians in every part of the country. Decisions will have to be 
made very soon to deal with the real problems that have dragged 
on and on through the last five, ten, fifteen and twenty years.
<P>
	I look forward to hearing from the Reform Party and from 
other members of the Bloc Quebecois. I am sure they will do far 
better than the transport critic who obviously had a difficult time 
in getting his facts straight as he began the debate. As the day 
progresses I am sure we will be hearing some constructive 
suggestions from members of the official opposition, from the 
Reform Party and from other members on both sides of the 
House. Everyone in Canada knows how important a strong 
national railroad system is to the economy and to the future of 
the country.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like you to inform the Minister of Transport that, 
according to our traditions, the remarks I made do not require an 
apology. However, since I consider myself an honest person, I 
would like you to tell the minister that my office is currently 
doing some research to determine if indeed the city of 
Campbellton is located in the riding of Restigouche-Chaleur, 
as the minister said. If so, you may tell the Minister of Transport 
that I will make the necessary corrections today at the 
appropriate time. But I do not think that I need to apologize. In 
any event, with the kind of remarks he makes on a regular basis, 
the Minister of Transport himself is the one who has had many 
opportunities to apologize in this House.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport, who assures us that he 
is transparent, has admitted the fact that the commercialization 
task force chaired by the hon. member for Kenora-Rainy River 
is made up of Liberals only. He mentioned the busy schedule of 
the transport committee. I would like to inform the Minister of 
Transport that around February 18, 1994, when the transport 
committee was set up, I, as official opposition critic 
representing the Bloc Quebecois, asked that rail transportation 
be examined as a priority.
<P>
	At that time, I made reference to the Liberal task force report 
on VIA Rail cuts made in 1989, a report that was signed by the 
Minister of Transport himself. I said that before going any 
further in the abandonment of rail lines, we should consult the 
users and the regions. That is why I asked that rail transportation 
be put on the committee's agenda on February 18. The Liberal 
majority on the transport committee said that such a study could 
jeopardize the CN-CP merger project that was being considered 
at the time. The Liberals asked that the study be postponed. The 
report was to be presented at the end of June.
<P>
	We adjourned in June. Mr. Speaker, I would like you to inform 
the Minister of Transport that on September 19, when the 
session resumed, I asked again if we were going to examine rail 
transportation as a priority since the merger project was at a 
standstill. I was told that airports were higher on the priority list 
and that such a study could hinder the negotiation process.
<P>
	I argued in committee that we could agree not to hear any 
representative of the employees or the management of the 
companies concerned, but that we could hear regional 
representatives who would come and explain to us the 
importance of rail transportation to the economic development 
of a region. Once again, my proposal was defeated by the Liberal 
majority on the committee.
<P>
	On September 29, the minister announced the establishment 
of a Liberal partisan task force to study the issue. If the minister 
is transparent, why did he not  include a representative of the 
official opposition and a representative of the third party on this 
task force?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a well-established tradition 
in this House that when committees are organized, the majority 
has its say. That is a long-standing tradition.
<P>
	As to working groups mandated to do certain things by 
political parties, they are a fairly common occurrence. There 
have been many examples in the past. When either the 
government or the opposition wants to study any given matter, 
they ask for advice on a politically-oriented base. Some 
members of the committee like the hon. member for 
Kenora-Rainy River, who chairs the committee, are 
undoubtedly on the government's side. They have been assigned 
a certain job, so they are in a position to give useful and 
important advice to the government, which has to make a 
decision on the CP proposal, but also has to prepare other 
alternatives.
<P>
	Several means are available to members of Parliament, for 
instance as members of House committees. If, as the hon. 
member just said, the transport committee was not able to 
examine this issue or if a majority had determined for any reason 
that the committe did not want or did not have time to do so, we 
had no choice but to proceed because we had to respond to the 
CP proposal.
<P>
	I do not know whether the Bloc Quebecois or the Reform 
Party would have been willing to be part of a committee set up 
with a mandate from the transport minister, but it is not a kind of 
precedent I am ready to create because the House has its own 
mechanisms for examining issues that are deemed important. 
But political parties in this House also have the right to ask their 
colleagues to look into different matters in order to give advice 
that they consider relevant.
<P>
	There is no duplicity in all of this. It is one way of doing 
things, and it has been around for a long time. I hope we will see 
in this exercise that Mr. Nault has already created an opportunity 
for all those concerned, members of Parliament included, to 
have an input.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	One thing is clear. Opposition members have a golden 
opportunity today to express their views on the CP proposal, on 
the potential commercialization of CN, and on the status quo. 
They would be well-advised to use it to tell us what they think 
instead of reciting problems we have all been aware of for a long 
time and which we are attempting to solve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
promised, I was given, while the minister was answering, the 
electoral map for New Brunswick. Since the minister was right, 
I promise never to mention again that the city of Campbellton is 
located in the riding of Acadie-Bathurst. It is located in the 
riding of Restigouche-Chaleur, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7778"> 7778 </A></B>
<P>
which is represented by one of the members of the partisan 
committee.
<P>
	I do not consider it as an excuse; it is as if I asked the minister 
whether the town of St-Tite-des-Caps is located in my riding or 
in the riding of Charlevoix. In any case, it is in the riding next to 
the minister's, in the area he comes from, and that does not 
change anything to what I said a moment ago.
<P>
	I want to tell the minister that the whole question of this 
party's position on short-line railways and on the unsolicited CP 
buyout proposal will be discussed today by the other speakers. 
You will understand that, in 20 minutes, I could not possibly 
deal with all these topics, but I shall do so in due course.
<P>
	We have heard about the comments he made in early October 
in Winnipeg when he referred to ``railway workers with a grade 
8 or 9 education'' and so on, and his answer to me on this subject 
in this House, an answer that might turn out slightly different 
from reality. If it is true that he made these remarks in the 
context he referred to in his answer to me, I would like the 
minister to explain why people left the room and why WESTAC 
had to apologize for comments that were insulting to the 62,000 
railway workers in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the member is 
suggesting when he talks about WESTAC having to make an 
apology, but I can explain what happened at this meeting in 
Winnipeg which was attended by 150 persons. As far as I know, 
three of them stood up and left because they had interpreted 
what I said as being unacceptable.
<P>
	Before the meeting, people formed a picket line in front of the 
hotel to protest against the appointment of Mr. Nault as 
chairman of the task force responsible for reviewing the 
commercialization of CN. These people protested because they 
found it unacceptable that Mr. Nault had previously worked for 
CP. That was the kind of atmosphere prevailing, and I want to 
read an extract of the speech I made in Winnipeg before the 
members of WESTAC because it is perhaps the best way to 
clarify the situation. My words were as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some of the problems obviously were created by governments 
through excessive regulation and taxation but also by railway 
management, top heavy structures and by labour which are 
involved in agreements that contribute to low productivity and 
complicated archaic work rules.
<P>
	What I want to say today about the labour situation in the 
railways is that I have never blamed people with grade eight and 
nine educations who worked for railways over the last 40 to 50 
years who were able to negotiate these kinds of agreements with 
people who were paid a lot of money to manage our railway.
<P>
	I am not going to point a gun at the heads of the people who 
got the very best deal they could at a time when they were in a 
position to do that. I expressed in this House my dismay that 
anyone would ever misinterpret those remarks as not being a 
total compliment to people who worked hard under difficult 
circumstances to protect their rights and the rights of their 
brothers in the railroad labour movement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion dealing with rail in Canada has three parts, 
one being inaction on the part of the government, one being a 
lack of transparency and one being no vision on high speed rail.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not going to offer a lot of solutions as the minister has 
suggested we do because we are going to deal with the specific 
points raised by the Bloc in its motion. I am however going to 
put out several challenges to the minister which I hope he will 
respond to under questions or comments. If he does not I have to 
accept that he probably reluctantly agrees with the points I 
make.
<P>
	Dealing first with the question of inaction, in some way I 
support the concept the Bloc is suggesting, that there is inaction 
on the part of the government. I have to ask why it is surprised at 
this. The reality is inaction is prevalent throughout all of the 
departments in the government.
<P>
	With regard to transport, first we have to look at such things as 
the Pearson contract and the legislation cancelling it. We asked 
the minister for a public hearing. We did not say that it was a 
good deal or a bad deal but simply how can you condemn 
something that has never been given its proper hearing.
<P>
	First he refuses to do it and then we get word through the 
media the minister said that he is strongly considering having a 
public hearing. Then we have yet another minister, the Deputy 
Prime Minister, saying there will be no hearing. Lo, there was no 
hearing.
<P>
	That was a case where there was a series of actions which 
produced an inaction and questions of who is really running the 
transport department.
<P>
	Then we get into things like the Churchill port and the minutes 
from Ports Canada that said it is closing down Churchill. That 
magically disappeared out of the minutes of the meeting that 
decided that.
<P>
	It was raised in the House. Was the minister responsible or 
was it the head of Ports Canada, who was of course a Liberal 
patronage appointment? The reality is that it was not the 
minister. It was yet another minister who sits nearby who has 
more of a concern about this because of his home province and 
he caused a magic marker to appear over top of those minutes. 
Again I have to wonder who is running the transport department 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7779"> 7779 </A></B>
<P>
and is that some of the reason why we have no real action in that 
department.
<P>
	Then we have human resources. Again this is a new concept 
that the Liberals are raising to a mastery where they produce a 
series of actions which results in no action at all. In the case of 
human resources, right at the beginning of the year they raised 
the unemployment insurance rates. Then through another 
mastery they reduced their own raise, thus cancelling their own 
action to say look at the wonderful saving they have made for 
people. I suggested if they raised the amount 10 times as high 
and then reduced it, they could have had even greater saving. 
Obviously the bottom line is no action at all.
<P>
	Then we have the justice department. The justice department 
talks of reforms to the criminal justice system but there is 
nothing forthcoming. There are no concrete proposals. The 
problems still continue on.
<P>
	We have the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health has 
not only taken no action but has penalized provinces for trying 
to implement these actions. It has penalized my own province of 
British Columbia for one for trying to implement some cost 
cutting changes that would make the health system healthier and 
more effective in that province. Instead it gets the transfer 
payments reduced because it did not march to the beat of the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	Then we have the immigration department and the so-called 
consultations that are going on. I say so-called because people 
are demanding action and they are making very clear what kind 
of action they are looking for. They are going out and selling a 
preconceived government agenda.
<P>
	Then we have the minister of fisheries, the fisheries 
department. Again, here is where we are having another study 
whose only purpose is to provide a scapegoat for the inaction on 
the part of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, soon to be the 
minister of oceans because the fisheries will be destroyed.
<P>
	We have the finance department with no workable plan, no 
indication that the goals it has set are obtainable, goals that are 
too low even if it should somehow magically manage to attain 
them with its current plan of so-called action.
<P>
	This is the general level of action of a government that loves 
to preface many of its statements by calling them action plans. It 
takes more than hollow words to create real action.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	What action has the government taken on rail line 
abandonment? What changes have taken place? There has been 
no action whatsoever to resolve the overtrackage problem in the 
east.
<P>
	Interestingly enough when CN and CP were talking about 
rationalization and merging the two rail lines to form the 
company referred to as Newco, the minister seemed to think that 
was a wonderful idea. However now that one company wishes to 
buy out the other that is not a good idea even though it would 
produce the same general result. In fact it would produce better 
results because there would still be a vestige of competition 
under this new proposal.
<P>
	There is no action to deal with rail line inequitable taxation 
problems. That is certainly a very large problem and a very large 
component of the rail industry's problems.
<P>
	There is no action to deal with the provincial problems 
concerning such things as labour legislation and property 
taxation. Not only are they harming the rail lines as they exist 
right now but they are also among the large impediments in the 
way of attracting private short line operators to take over these 
abandoned lines when the big rail companies can no longer make 
money running them.
<P>
	There is also no action to deal with harmonizing capital 
depreciation rules so that they can compete effectively with 
their American competitors.
<P>
	The next thing I would like to look at is the lack of 
transparency on the part of the government with regard to the 
rail industry. Once again this is something that is prevalent 
throughout all of the departments.
<P>
	Of course we have in transport such things as the Pearson 
contract. When Bill C-22 was brought in we tried to introduce 
an aspect of transparency. Had the government agreed to do that 
we would have supported that bill. All we wanted was the claims 
and the resultant payments going out to flow through the 
all-party transport committee. In that way the claims and the 
resulting payments would be known and transparent and there 
could be no under the table deals. It was refused as an 
amendment at the committee stage and was refused as an 
amendment at third reading.
<P>
	Then there was the wonderful deal that was cut behind closed 
doors by the Minister of Transport with Air Canada dealing with 
the route to Osaka. The minister rose in this House and denied 
directly to me that there was any private backroom deal. He 
continued to deny that for two days after which he admitted that 
in fact he had cut a deal with Air Canada. Transparency? Not a 
chance.
<P>
	In the human resources department again patronage 
appointments are absolutely rampant, even in my little rural 
riding in southeastern British Columbia. There was a one year 
delay in getting anyone to sit as chairman of the board of 
referees because the government attempted to put in someone 
totally unqualified by way of a patronage appointment. When 
that was exposed the government sat on the real appointment for 
over a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7780"> 7780 </A></B>
<P>
year. It was a tremendous hardship for people in my riding  
having problems with UIC. It is another example of lack of 
transparency on the part of the government.
<P>
	The health department is currently undergoing a $12 million 
study. This is not to learn but rather to sell preconceived 
government notions and agenda. This is not transparent and it is 
not acceptable.
<P>
	The immigration department has its own hidden agenda in its 
review board. On the Vancouver immigration and refugee 
review board a member who was appointed by the previous 
government has had a 38 per cent acceptance rate of those who 
appealed through him. In the last four years there have been only 
three appeals to his decisions, two of which were heard. Only 
one was overturned and that was because of a mistake made in 
the translation of the information supplied to him from the 
appellant. It changed the meaning of what he was told. That one 
single case was reversed, no others.
<P>
	Now the minister has implemented a priority goal of a 75 per 
cent acceptance rate. Why is there a goal? There should only be 
acceptance of those who are proper and true immigrants to this 
country. If that is 10 per cent, it is 10 per cent. If it is 90 per cent, 
it is 90 per cent. How can there possibly be a goal if there is not 
some hidden agenda? The other side of it again brings into 
question the transparency of what the government is doing.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	It is the very fact in this case that if one of the two people 
viewing these appeals accepts the application, it is accepted. If it 
is accepted no report has to be written, but if it is rejected a 
lengthy report has to be written. It places a tremendous 
emphasis on accepting, whether or not it is for the good of 
Canada.
<P>
	The fisheries department transparency. It is studying a 
serious, perhaps catastrophic problem of the salmon fisheries on 
the west coast in house instead of holding a public inquiry. The 
problem was created in house by the minister. How can he study 
himself and come up with an objective answer?
<P>
	In the finance department again we are looking for 
transparency. There is an absolute refusal to make a 
commitment on the question of a carbon tax or taxation of 
RRSPs.
<P>
	Justice department is an interesting case where there is the 
opposite of transparency. There is excruciating transparency 
when dealing with such things as the proposed firearms 
legislation. The minister has publicly stated he will not make 
legislation based on head count, but he will in fact do what is 
good for the people, which can be translated into: ``I do not care 
what the people want, I know better than they do''.
<P>
	Now we deal with transport and the transparency there. Well, 
the CN task force has already been mentioned. Do we have a 
problem with that? Is that a transparent, viable thing? Of course 
it is not. There is absolutely no reason that the questions being 
raised by the CN task force could not have flown through the  
transport committee, have had a vestige of all-party input and 
then it would have had some credibility. It certainly would have 
had some transparency.
<P>
	We know that on a recent task force struck under transport 
dealing with the seaway there was a dissenting report. It could 
not do to have somebody offering a different opinion. Even 
though my party did not happen to agree with that dissenting 
opinion it was nonetheless the right of the people in this House 
to make it. This is what an all Liberal CN task force manages to 
block.
<P>
	When looking at what is happening with CN and the offer 
from CP there are three scenarios that could come up, but I 
believe the report they are to make is already written.
<P>
	First, they could come back and say the CP offer is good. That 
releases the minister from responsibility. He can now claim that 
his people went out across the country and they got this endorsed 
and so away they go. It comes back to what we talked about 
previously on other bills where the government consults and that 
is supposed to mean the solution it comes up with is okay. The 
very fact that there is consultation does not mean there was 
anything whatsoever in the final report that had anything to do 
with what people said during the consultation. It does no good to 
have consultations if you do not listen to what people say.
<P>
	The second scenario is that they could come back to CP and 
say: ``We like the idea of you offering to buy out a portion of CN 
except we want you to increase the offer and buy out the whole 
thing''. That is unacceptable because it will remove the vestige 
of competition that still remains under the current CP offer.
<P>
	The final thing they could do is come back and say: ``No, we 
do not want to sell part of it. We want to privatize the entire thing 
and sell it as a total unit''. That also is unacceptable because it 
does absolutely nothing to deal with the problem of 
overtrackage in eastern Canada.
<P>
	I suppose in one respect there is a fourth option which is to do 
absolutely nothing at all. This seems to be a very popular option 
on the part of the Liberals, but I would hope that at least they 
realize it is not a workable solution in this case.
<P>
	We could go on just on the vestige of the CP rail offer alone, 
but I would say one thing to this House. I believe the concept of 
the CP rail offer to CN is a good one. I remind the minister it is 
not considerably different from the concept that he has already 
endorsed which is that of the two companies merging together, 
only in that case there would be an absolute loss of competition. 
In the case of this offer there is not.
<P>
	I would like to touch on VIA Rail because that was mentioned 
in the hon. member's motion. VIA Rail in a word should be 
privatized. An example of an operation that was run by VIA Rail 
in British Columbia and into Alberta is the Rocky Mountain Rail 
Tours. VIA ran this with huge subsidies for a number of years 
and still managed to lose money.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7781"> 7781 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	Rocky Mountaineer Railtours was sold to the Great Canadian 
Railtour Company which ran it in virtually the same context as it 
was being run by VIA, but of course with the aspect of private 
enterprise introduced to it. It must get a return on the investment 
made to VIA. Great Canadian Railtour has fought considerable 
roadblocks put up by the very company that sold it this line and 
has had to fight in court. In spite of all that it has made an 
unsubsidized profit.
<P>
	Can the private sector do better than crown corporations? You 
bet it can. We believe the only subsidies that should take place 
for rail transportation in terms of passenger transportation are 
for remote operations only and only then when there is a 
demonstrated need.
<P>
	It is all well and good to be nostalgic and remember back to 
the days when the rail linked and tied this country together. We 
have to recognize that for all the improvements in technology 
the locomotives may pull more weight than they pulled in the 
old days, they may pull it a bit faster and certainly they may be 
safer, but the general concept of moving people by rail has not 
changed dramatically in terms of the years that have gone by.
<P>
	If we think back to when rail transportation was originally 
introduced alternative methods were not available. Rail started 
before there was any widespread concept of any alternative 
transportation except by horse. There were no aeroplanes, there 
were no buses, there were no passenger cars. As technology has 
moved in other areas the genuine need for rail transportation has 
to be modified.
<P>
	Many of the areas can be handled by private enterprise, 
making a profit without government subsidies where there are 
sufficient passengers to move. That will also resolve traffic 
problems. In remote areas where there are alternatives they are 
probably going to have to look at those alternatives. If there are 
no alternatives that is the only situation in which we should be 
looking at government subsidies.
<P>
	Finally I would like to touch on high speed rail. This has been 
brought up before. The answer now is exactly the same as it was 
then. A $7 billion or $8 billion high speed rail system is not in 
our foreseeable future, not if half of the money is going to come 
from empty federal tax coffers. We have no money for the things 
that are here now.
<P>
	The other side of the House is talking about the need for cuts 
and we endorse that. We know there have to be cuts. Why at a 
time when we are talking about the need for cuts are we talking 
about spending $7 billion or $8 billion on a high speed rail 
system? It is not a national high speed rail system, it is only for 
one single corridor.
<P>
	It has been suggested that half of that money must come out of 
the government tax coffers. If it is a profitable venture as the 
people proposing this would  have us believe, why would they 
want the government, which has a history of losing money at 
everything it turns its hand to, as a partner? On the other hand if 
it is in fact a loser, why would the government associate itself 
with another tax drain?
<P>
	There are solutions. The government will not find them if it 
does not start taking some action on the known solutions. It will 
not find them if it hides everything behind hidden agendas, if 
there is no transparency, if it does not openly and honestly 
involve others and then use solutions provided by these people 
instead of trying to use them to create a justification for its own 
agenda.
<P>
	There will be many opportunities for the minister to hear our 
proposals. Unfortunately in the past whenever the government 
takes a Reform policy proposal, which we are happy to see it do, 
it only takes it piecemeal. It manages to mess it up so bad that we 
are almost reluctant to help the government, unless it lets us 
guide it all the way. I might add we are totally prepared to do 
that.
<P>
	I leave it to the government. If it wishes to refute anything I 
have said, I would be happy to hear it. Failing that I would ask 
the government to become more transparent and start taking 
action to consult with those of us on this side of the House who 
do have solutions. There is no point in our throwing them out if 
the government intends not to use them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was late arriving this morning and I did not hear the 
hon. member's entire speech. I would like to compliment the 
member on his broad approach to many of our national 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Does he not agree that there needs to be some time when any 
department needs to research issues without being transparent at 
the initial time of investigation? Surely in transportation, surely 
in justice, surely in agriculture some research requirements 
need to be addressed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would point out to the hon. member 
that we are not talking about the government's right to do its 
homework. In my opinion the CN task force is not homework. It 
is a study to determine whether the CP offer is good, whether 
there are alternatives, and what should be the policies as a result 
of it.
<P>
	That is the kind of thing done by the Standing Committee on 
Transport and is why we have committees, so we can study 
various proposals. CP has made an offer to buy a section of a 
government business. It is something that government should 
not be doing of course, being in business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7782"> 7782 </A></B>
<P>
	We have had a legitimate outside offer to buy a portion of a 
government service. If that is not justification for it to be studied 
in the committee concept, which is all-party, then I do not know 
when there ever will be a case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it deplorable to see only one 
member of the opposition when such an important question 
proposed by the opposition is before us. Frankly, this shows how 
unimportant the Bloc Quebecois considers this urgent matter. I 
see a few of them coming in. All right. That is good. But there 
are only two of them, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member should not mention 
the absence of members; otherwise, we would spend out time 
deploring the absence of ministers across the way. My young 
friend probably does not know the Standing Orders.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I think that members on 
both sides of the House are rather familiar with the Standing 
Orders. But some distinctions are still hard to make. I accept the 
point of order raised by the hon. opposition whip provided he 
does not mention a member in particular. I thank him for his 
remarks and I would ask the parliamentary secretary to please 
continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a really important debate, 
but members who contributed to these decisions a few years ago, 
in 1989, including the Minister of the Environment of the day 
who is now Leader of the Opposition, are not here to address the 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. We must 
understand, particularly as it concerns the demands on members 
of this House, that members as well as ministers and 
parliamentary secretaries have many duties to perform and that 
their availability is limited by the many committees and 
meetings they have to attend.
<P>
	But I still think that the parliamentary secretary knows the 
Standing Orders very well and that he has become proficient 
since he first arrived here on the hill. So I would ask him to 
respect the Standing Orders and refrain from mentioning the 
presence or absence of any member on either side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member to 
withdraw his comment. Otherwise, all we have to do is, as he 
did, to apologize afterwards without in fact withdrawing our 
remarks.
<P>
	Therefore, I would ask him to withdraw his comment 
concerning the absence of an hon. member. He should withdraw 
that remark or apologize, since otherwise members on this side 
of the House will take it that they can do the same for the rest of 
the day with respect to ministers who might be absent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am not in a position to 
ask any member to withdraw a comment which has not really 
been made in the usual context of non-parliamentary language 
or which could have an impact on a member's integrity or 
honesty.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	This is not a point of order, but I nonetheless appreciate the 
representation made by the whip of the official opposition in this 
matter. I hope all hon. members on both sides of this House will 
show a greater understanding of our rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would still like to thank the 
opposition for proposing to participate in a debate on that 
subject. It gives us the opportunity to clarify some points and 
allegations made by opposition members.
<P>
	First, I feel we should look at the fundamentals of this debate. 
Canada's railroad industry is facing many pressing questions 
and is undoubtedly at the crossroads as far as its future is 
concerned.
<P>
	We must recognize that Canadian taxpayers will pay more 
than $1.6 billion in direct grants to support the transportation 
network this year. Of this total, $331 million will take the form 
of direct grants to railroad passengers service. We feel, and 
everyone agrees, that the role and the structure of Crown 
corporations like VIA Rail should be reviewed from time to 
time. We must remain practical and concentrate on feasible 
solutions because VIA Rail passengers should have access to a 
multimodal, secure, reliable and, of course, affordable 
transportation network.
<P>
	Before moving on to the future of VIA Rail, I believe it would 
be useful for me to give you a brief description of the 
background of the corporation and of its present situation. I 
mentioned earlier that in 1989, the leader of the opposition was 
part of a government which cut VIA Rail services by 50 per cent 
and eliminated nearly 2,500 jobs. Given that the minister who 
was part of such a government is now leader of the opposition, I 
think the onus really is upon the opposition to explain why VIA 
and CN were cut by 50 per cent in 1989. Why did they cut more 
than 2,500 jobs?
<P>
	This is unfortunate. As a matter of fact, the workers, the 
families, Montrealers, good Quebecers and Canadians are the 
real victims of these cuts which were never justified by the 
opposition.
<P>
	I am going to pursue this. Today, everybody wants to put the 
government of Canada on trial. But as everyone knows, we were 
not in power back then and I was not even a member of 
Parliament. Therefore, I would ask opposition members to jump 
at this opportunity to explain to Canadians and to hon. members 
of this House why they have moved for a debate on this subject 
matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7783"> 7783 </A></B>
<P>
	We want answers. We are entitled to ask why we have as the 
Leader of the Opposition a member of the previous government 
which has substantially, we might say, changed the picture of 
VIA Rail and CN in Canada.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to this House that there were 
several other opposition members who were part of the previous 
Conservative government and who, in my opinion, also had 
some responsibility in this matter. They are not here today to 
explain their actions. Nevertheless, they took part in the 
streamlining of CN and were accountable for this 50 per cent 
cutback. We must ask them questions.
<P>
	There is nonetheless the Opposition House Leader who-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Obviously, the hon. member either fails to understand or wants 
to give the impression he does not understand what you said 
about what constitutes proper behaviour in this House. He is 
doing it again.
<P>
	I think that aside from the civilized debate we should be 
having instead of this childish attitude taken by the hon. member 
for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I have no objection to 
his criticizing certain decisions that were made in the past, 
but-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member was 
interrupted on a point of order, which followed a previous point 
of order, but now it seems we are involved in a debate. Again, I 
would ask the parliamentary secretary who has the floor to 
please avoid any references to the presence or absence of a 
member during his speech.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I would like to say to my colleague, the Official Opposition 
Whip, with all due respect, that this is not a point of order as 
such, and we will resume debate with the parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not childish to defend the 
interests of one's constituents, to appeal to the common sense of 
the members of this House, and to state the facts. All this did not 
come out of the blue. I do not believe that the setbacks at CN and 
VIA Rail necessarily started when the new government came to 
power. I think we must consider what happened in the past, if we 
want to find a reasonable explanation for the current situation.
<P>
	I may add that I was very upset back in 1989, when I wanted to 
take the train to go to the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and found that, instead of 
every day, the train only ran three days a week. I found this very 
upsetting as did many of my constituents, and my point is that 
VIA Rail services had been cut by the previous government. 
These cuts were not made by the Liberals but by the 
Conservatives. The point I want to make is that a number of 
opposition members were part of the government at the time. I 
was not and, believe me, I would have objected strenuously to  
the ill-advised policy and position on the future of VIA Rail and 
CN which we saw in 1989.
<P>
	There is a lot of talk about transparency. The opposition critic 
mentioned transparency. In fact, I commend the opposition for 
emphasizing the need for government transparency in this 
respect. However, when they talk about transparency, they 
should not refer exclusively to the present Minister of 
Transport, who was not a minister at the time. When they talk 
about transparency, they should consider all aspects of the 
situation. That is all I ask of the opposition.
<P>
	I do support transparency, despite the criticism aimed at me 
personally and at my efforts concerning VIA Rail and CN 
services in the riding of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
and I would like to know how many opposition members 
bothered to take the train during the past year. I wonder how 
many opposition and government members who have access to 
railway services in their communities and in their ridings have 
taken the train to come to Ottawa.
<P>
	And if any of their members fit that category, I challenge the 
opposition to tell me how many times they took the train to 
travel between Ottawa and their respective ridings. Personally, I 
always try to take the train. Not to the Magdalen Islands, of 
course, where I have to fly if I want to get there within a 
reasonable time frame. But when I go to Bonaventure county, 
three evenings a week I can get directly to New Richmond, 
where I live. It takes thirteen hours by train from Montreal. I 
leave by train at two or three o'clock in the afternoon from 
Ottawa, arrive in Montreal at five, wait for two hours, and then 
take the train to Bonaventure county. However, on some 
evenings there is no service to the Gaspé. Sometimes I arrive in 
Campbellton, New Brunswick, at 4.30 a.m. This means that a 
member who takes his work seriously and who really wants to do 
his share has to be prepared to get off the train at 4.30 a.m.
<P>
	If we want to keep our trains, we have to use them. Of course, 
as we all know, very few people travel by train. A lot more must 
be done in the way of marketing and advertising to convince the 
public and urge opposition members and all members of this 
House to show their support by taking the train as often as 
possible. Many members think it is much easier to fly between 
Montreal and Ottawa, when they travel back and forth between 
their ridings and their work here in the House. Nevertheless, I 
would like to reassure opposition members and particularly my 
constituents that their member of Parliament travels by train and 
is going to travel by train for a long time, believe me.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	We were just talking about transparency. Obviously, we have 
not heard any practical solution from the opposition as is the 
case most of the time, and the federal government is put on trial 
as always. Canada is always to be blamed. Generally speaking, 
they say that nothing is working in Quebec. Yet, we struck a 
committee and  asked opposition members to submit concrete 
solutions. I have never heard the word ``intermodal'', for 
example. I have never heard new ideas to make VIA Rail, the CN 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7784"> 7784 </A></B>
<P>
or the transportation services in Canada profitable. All we hear, 
and it is unfortunate, is that the whole transportation policy in 
Canada is a complete failure. Yet, Canada was built on those 
links.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
The ties that bind.
<P>
	In 1867 when we first began as a small British colony we had 
that national dream. We had that national policy in which 
Canadians came together and said we would go toward the west, 
we would reach the shores of the Pacific and unite Canada as we 
know it today, despite the efforts and pressures to maintain and 
increase our ties with the Americans at the time. We were just 
coming out of a revolutionary war, I should add. There were 
visionaries in Canada at the time. These visionaries were sent 
out to set up that track to cross Canada, to make sure Canada 
would become the country it is today.
<P>
	We all know what position Canada occupies. I do not have to 
remind members. I think the United Nations repeats year after 
year that Canada is the number one country.
<P>
	Of course when it comes to rail policy it is not an easy one. 
Canada is a country that was forged. It was not a country born 
out of revolution and strife. It was a country forged by 
immigrants, minorities of all kinds who came to Canada to make 
a better life for themselves. Thank God it was the train that 
initially brought them here. Today we have air travel, all 
different modes of transportation across this great nation.
<P>
	Maybe it is time because of the financial restraints we are now 
faced with to look into these services and make sure that 
Canadians are getting their money's worth. This is what we have 
been hearing from the opposition all this time.
<P>
	However, we have to find new solutions. Of course we could 
look to Europe. We look at what is happening in France, Japan, 
Asia, Germany and Great Britain. The populations on the 
European continent are much more concentrated than they are in 
Canada. There are approximately 350 people per square 
kilometre in Belgium and there are only three in Canada. It is 
about 250 in France and still France can operate quite a service.
<P>
	After all, if I am not mistaken, Canada is 18 times the size of 
Great Britain, it is more than six times the size of France. 
Canada is a huge country with a population of 30 million. The 
train service we are willing to offer in this country is not 
necessarily the one that is always on par with that of Europe or 
Japan when we think of the Shinkansen and the TGV in Europe. 
The Canadian context is quite different.
<P>
	However, the opposition is probably right in saying that we 
have to look at the TGV. I have heard the Bloc say this a few 
times. However, I should also remind the  hon. member that the 
whole TGV concept was first introduced by the federal Liberals. 
There was an initial committee that looked into the question. It 
said there is potential between Quebec and Windsor. From what 
I am told there is currently a study taking place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, a task force including the government of Quebec, the 
government of Ontario and, of course, the government of 
Canada is reviewing this issue.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	We are told that this is a comprehensive study, a study that 
will reassess the situation and the potential for putting in place a 
high-speed train between Quebec and Windsor. However, I see 
the opposition members, especially those from the Reform 
Party, asking: ``Well, what does this mean for western Canada?''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What does this mean for western Canada? What does this 
mean for rural areas of the country? Should we allow all our 
moneys and all of our expenditures to go into the creation of a 
TGV between Quebec and Windsor? What happens to the have 
not areas of Canada, the maritimes, western Canada, the Gaspé 
Peninsula? I do not think the opposition Bloc members give a 
hoot about having a TGV going all the way to the Gaspé because 
it is not feasible.
<P>
	However, we must make sure that whatever service is in place 
in Canada and despite the allegations of the opposition that 
nothing is being done, we have to provide certain essential 
services in this country. We have to service the rural areas of 
Canada. We have to service the heartland of the nation. I think 
this is the role that all parliamentarians are called to play.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Having said this, I am surprised to hear the opposition tell us 
that they want a high speed train which will serve Quebec, 
Ontario, Windsor, but unfortunately, these people are still 
proposing to us the end of the Canadian federation. They are 
proposing the dismantling of Canada, the separation of Quebec. 
How could we build a railway link between Quebec and Windsor 
with a border between Quebec and Ontario?
<P>
	I hear the opposition laugh, but that is the hard and sad reality. 
We must learn to work together. We must build a railway system 
that will respond to the desires of Quebecers, of Ontarians and 
all other Canadians. And surely, as member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I have an obligation and 
a duty to ensure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7785"> 7785 </A></B>
<P>
that service is maintained in my remote rural riding in the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	It is obvious that the opposition often speaks for the urban 
people, with very little consideration for the remote areas. I 
think that the opposition leader demonstrated that brilliantly in 
1989, when he was among those in favour of the decision to cut 
50 per cent of the railway service in Quebec and all across 
Canada. I think that we should not be afraid to tell these facts, 
and I believe that being in a free country, being a member of 
Parliament-after all, being a member of the House of 
Commons is a privilege-I am fully entitled, despite the 
slanders, the opposition, the allegations from the opposition that 
I am not fulfilling my role as a member of Parliament, to 
denounce what took place in 1989.
<P>
	I believe it is important to take the opportunity to develop a 
Canadian vision and I believe that the dream we had in 1867 is 
still alive. I think that many people in the opposition have 
benefited from the freedom and privileges that were given to 
them as Canadians and one of those privileges, one of those 
links that unite the country is, of course, the Canadian railway 
service as we know it. However, we must get ready for the next 
century.
<P>
	I will end my speech on that point because I wish to give the 
opposition the opportunity to ask questions, questions that 
would not be partisan in nature and would take into account first 
of all the genuine interests of Quebecers and Canadians, that is 
to maintain a service and to help us find solutions. Instead of 
talking of dividing and separating, and accusing federalists, 
instead of saying that Canada is a failure, I invite them to find 
common solutions with us. The official opposition must 
recognize that it does not represent the majority of Quebecers. 
They got 48 per cent of the votes and a majority of seats in the 
Quebec assembly but there are still 52 per cent of Quebecers 
who did not support the Bloc.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	One thing is sure, when they start participating in the debate, 
those people will have to state clearly that they may speak for a 
certain number of Quebecers but not for Quebec as a whole. I 
invite them to take part in the debate, to examine and propose 
constructive solutions for the future of VIA Rail and, of course, 
for the whole of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure the member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
appreciated the fact that he was not interrupted during his 
speech. For his part, he can always be heard yapping in the 
background when someone else has the floor in the House of 
Commons. It makes you lose your concentration, besides being 
impolite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. To say that a 
member is yapping and trying to interfere with the House 
proceedings is quite offensive. I am a democrat, a 
parliamentarian and, as the member for  
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I have the right to 
express my opinion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Once again, with all due 
respect to members on both sides of the House, this is not a point 
of order. The member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I made my point. The member 
invited us to put questions to him and to be constructive in this 
debate. I am going to ask him some serious questions and I will 
ask that he give me clear answers.
<P>
	First, I would like the member to indicate why, in April 1994, 
he refused to take part in hearings on the future of the Chaleur, in 
the Gaspé Peninsula, in his own riding, which were organized by 
Mrs. Cynthia Paterson, a member of Rural Dignity of the Gaspé 
Peninsula? Could he indicate why he refused to hear some 50 
individuals and groups from the Gaspé Peninsula, most of them 
from his own riding, present their briefs? Could he answer this 
question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, we seem to be digressing, but I 
will gladly answer that. I met the workers and Mrs. Paterson in 
February, I believe that was a few months before the Bloc 
decided to organize a consultation of the people.
<P>
	You know, I, too, could invite opposition members to work on 
sustainable developments in the Gaspé Peninsula or elsewhere. 
For example, I worked hard on the Eastern Plan. I really worked 
hard and I think I fulfilled my mandate as an elected 
representative. Nothing is finalized yet. However, speaking of 
railways, I dealt with that in February. Talk to the workers in 
New Carlisle, those of VIA Rail and CN. When there were 
problems, Patrick Gagnon was there. Patrick Gagnon even held 
a press conference with Mrs. Paterson, and that was a long time 
before the public hearings for propaganda, held by the 
opposition.
<P>
	I did my job, and as a member of this House I am proud of the 
result we now have. Because of my efforts, because also of the 
understanding and commitment to VIA Rail shown by the 
Minister of Transport, the service is now guaranteed. I believe I 
did my duty, and do not forget that this was part of my platform. 
I am, first and foremost, a representative of the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. I met with the workers 
long before the opposition realized the importance of a railway 
line. It seems that the opposition wants to redeem itself, because 
its leader was party to a government decision to cut VIA Rail 
service by 50 per cent, back in 1989.
<P>
	This is not a question for me to answer. The Leader of the 
Opposition should come before me, before Canadians, before 
the people of Quebec and of the Gaspé Peninsula, in order to 
explain why he agreed to cut the service by 50 per cent, so that, 
now, the train goes into the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7786"> 7786 </A></B>
<P>
Madeleine  only three days a week instead of seven as it did until 
1989.
<P>
	Where were you, Lucien Bouchard?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> For the sake of all of us 
understanding one another, I will ask once again that, however 
heated the debate here in the House of Commons, however 
strong the feelings held and the desire to put one's views across, 
a member should always be referred to by his or her function or 
riding. Resuming questions and comments.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that the Chair 
had to warn the hon. member eight times already.
<P>
	I have another question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! Quite frankly, I 
could not say whether this was the fourth, fifth, sixth or eight 
time; I did not keep count. At any rate, I am patiently carrying 
out my duty and asking the hon. members to have a respectful 
and parliamentary conduct during debates. That is all. I will 
keep reminding the hon. members to do so, nine or ten times if 
need be, but I must inform you that patience will win out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> As far as the way you conduct proceedings is 
concerned, Mr. Speaker, the past vouches for the future and I 
thank you for that.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the hon. member's speech and ask 
a final question. I would like to know if he himself ever took the 
HST between Lille and Brussels? That is Lille, in France, and 
Brussels, in Belgium. I travelled with the transport committee to 
France and Germany last week, at no cost to the Canadian 
taxpayers as we were the guests of the two governments. We had 
the opportunity to take this train and to see for ourselves that, 
contrary to what the Prime Minister once said in response to a 
question, the HST does not stop at the Belgian border. The 
clearance procedure is the same as for air travel. Planes do not 
land in every European country for clearance purposes before 
flying over the border. Whether you are travelling by train, 
plane or ship, you are cleared upon departure and arrival. It 
would make no sense. Obviously, the hon. member was talking 
through his hat since he had never taken the Lille-Brussels HST.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier in my speech plans to build a cement 
factory in Port-Daniel, which is located in his riding, in the 
Gaspe Peninsula. Does the hon. member realize the importance 
of rail service for the establishment of this factory in 
Port-Daniel, in his riding? I would like to hear his comments on 
this cement factory project which is conditional upon rail 
service being maintained in the Gaspe Peninsula.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting question 
from the Opposition. No, I did not have the privilege of taking 
the high-speed train between Paris and Lille because I did not 
have any money at the time. I was only a backpacking student. I 
think I hitch-hiked. However, I had the privilege of taking the 
Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka a few years ago. Believe 
me, the service was very good, except that Japan Rail has been 
privatized. It is not a profitable operation.
<P>
	Talking about rail service, I would be the first one in my 
riding to be interested. As a member of Parliament, I feel that I 
am the legitimate spokesman for the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. If the hon. member 
opposite is interested in that riding, he should run against me in 
three or four years, if he really wants to become familiar with 
the issues.
<P>
	Of course, there is not only the Port-Daniel cement plant but 
also Stone Consolidated, Abitibi Price and Tembec. Railways 
are used to the tune of $10 million to $20 million in that region 
but, again, we are still talking about the cement plant. Like any 
socio-economic regional development project, this one relies 
on rail service. To reassure the hon. member opposite, who 
sounds like he would like to represent the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, this project requires a 
great deal of study. Several steps must be taken. There are the 
environmental standards set by the Quebec government. I met 
with one of the developers.
<P>
	I come from that area. My father was born in Port-Daniel; my 
family comes from there. Believe me, I am following this 
project with a great deal of interest. True, maintaining 
commercial rail service is important to any medium- or 
long-term economic development project in the Gaspé 
peninsula.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, following discussions among the 
three parties recognized in this House, it was unanimously 
agreed that the next two speakers would be from the Bloc 
Quebecois, after changes were made to today's agenda.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not think that 
unanimous consent is required. However, if you came to an 
agreement among yourselves, it is always better and I can 
proceed. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to talk seriously about the national interest, an 
issue that the member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
has tried to lose sight of from the beginning of this debate.
<P>
	We asked for this one-day debate on railways to consider 
solutions to rail problems and not for partisan questions of what 
happened in the past or concerning individuals who are not here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7787"> 7787 </A></B>
<P>
	In my statement, I will not provide the solutions which the 
minister was asking for because before we propose remedies, we 
must first make a diagnosis, and it appears from the diagnosis 
that I am to present that the government's inaction and inertia 
are mainly responsible for the problem with railways. So I shall 
present this part of the diagnosis and not specific remedies, as 
far as I am concerned.
<P>
	The Canadian government's inertia on rail issues is in strange 
contrast to the dynamism shown by most other developed 
countries in this field. In Canada, our leaders consider the 
railways to be things of the past; as development tools, they 
certainly had their days of glory, but they are doomed to 
disappear. In other countries, the railways are considered 
excellent means of transportation which must urgently adapt to 
current requirements. On this point, I will repeat what the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine said about the 
difference in population density between Belgium and Quebec.
<P>
	I will tell him right away that it is not the Parti Quebecois's 
intention to propose railways for the Far North, whose 
population density is about average for this country, but only in 
the southern corridor, where the density is quite comparable to 
many European countries that are now trying to renew and 
develop their rail system.
<P>
	Our government's inaction on rail transport is essentially due 
to lack of vision, as my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans showed very well. When 
you do not see the source of the problem, it is hard to move. That 
is the trouble which this government, and especially its 
transport minister, have: they see the railways as basically 
folklore.
<P>
	The government does not act. It lets rail lines belonging to one 
of the greatest railway systems in the world be dismantled on the 
basis of purely cost-accounting decisions. The socio-economic 
benefit analysis of a railroad is ignored and replaced instead by a 
cold and narrow accounting analysis.
<P>
	This government does not act. It lets thousands of railroad 
workers lose their jobs. The restructuring of the main providers 
of employment in the country is done without any follow-up. 
The government lets CN's head office, in Montreal, become 
gradually more and more empty, for the benefit of Winnipeg and 
Moncton, but at the expense of the quality of service. A 
company in my riding, Transpotech, can attest to that 
deterioration, since CN moved some of its services from 
Montreal to Winnipeg.
<P>
	The government does not act. It is still dragging its feet 
regarding the high speed train issue, wondering whether that 
project is too costly or not. Yet, a consortium which includes 
Bombardier is convinced of the viability of that project and 
keeps winning major contracts all over the world, except in 
Canada. Do you not think that these people have given sufficient 
credentials to be listened to?
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The government does not act. There is no precise definition of 
Canada's transport requirements for the years to come. While 
foreign governments promote rail service and give it priority, 
this government chooses to ignore the tax and regulatory 
problems which our carriers have to face.
<P>
	The government does not act. It cannot see the environmental 
and economic benefits which would result from a strengthening 
of our rail system. If the government cannot see those benefits, 
the opposition can demonstrate how economic development and 
environmental protection can both be achieved through a sound 
rail policy.
<P>
	This morning, I want to propose new tools and provide data 
that should prompt the government and the Minister of 
Transport to wake up. Of all the various modes of transportation, 
the rail system is obviously the less harmful to the environment. 
It uses less fuel and releases less pollutants, hence contributing 
significantly to the air quality.
<P>
	Statistics released in 1990 show that the percentage of 
pollutant emissions reaches 4.8 per cent for trains, compared to 
18.4 per cent, which is four times more, for trucks. Because of 
its rate structure, trucking has become the main obstacle to an 
increase in train services, despite the social and economic 
benefits of the rail system. This is why I want to compare these 
two modes of transport which, instead of being competitive, 
could be used in conjunction, within a dual-mode system, but 
we will get back to this issue.
<P>
	Figures concerning the difference in pollutant emissions for 
both modes of transportation are eloquent. Let me give you just 
one example: carbon dioxide emissions by trains reach 13.9 per 
cent, compared to 48.4 per cent for trucks, the relatively low 
fuel consumption of trains accounts for the difference.
<P>
	Let us examine the comparisons between both modes of 
transportation. The advantages of the rail system are significant. 
However, one of the main benefits of the rail system, compared 
to trucking, is the fact that trains can carry heavy loads on long 
distances. For example, a study showed that to move 200 
containers across the United States, there would have to be three 
to five engines on the one hand, and more than 200 trucks on the 
other.
<P>
	The intrinsic features of rail transportation thus allow to 
impede road congestion which adversely affects economic 
development. Obviously, if all lines were electrified in Canada, 
train emissions would be markedly reduced. Countries 
concerned with environment protection consider electrification 
of their rail system in line with their sustainable development 
policy. Western Europe has the highest rate of rail lines 
electrifi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7788"> 7788 </A></B>
<P>
cation: 99 per cent in Switzerland, 55 per cent in Italy and 26 per 
cent in the United Kingdon.
<P>
	Canada ranks behind the United States with less than 1 per 
cent in spite of its huge hydro capacity. There could be no better 
example of the inadequacy of our system not only in regards to 
its needs but also to the resources it uses. Air transportation is by 
all means the most polluting. It is more polluting and 
energy-consuming than rail transportation, which brings me to 
the issue of the high-speed trains, which I will address strictly 
from the point of view of environment protection, since my 
colleague for Laval-Centre will later review the whole issue.
<P>
	As we know, the French high-speed train and also other rapid 
trains as the German ICE, the German Trans-Rapid, for 
example, can easily keep up with planes as for the duration of 
long-distance travel.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Thus, with better rates and lower consumption levels than the 
air transportation, the high-speed train in particular proves to be 
an environment friendly alternative while meeting the speed and 
comfort needs of travellers.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the train is very competitive as far as energy 
consumption is concerned. At high as well as at low speed, it 
can, in most cases, use electric power.
<P>
	Any measure aimed at an increased use of railroads should be 
supported by an adequate fiscal and regulatory policy. As things 
stand right now, the railway companies do not get any tax 
benefits resulting from the fuel tax for example. If the 
government wants us to believe it is serious about giving a new 
start to the rail transportation industry, it must first provide for 
tax arrangements which will promote an increased use of the 
train.
<P>
	The railway industry should get the same benefits as its main 
competitor, the trucking industry. It is urgent that the 
government brings its tax measures up to date because, at 
present, they indirectly support the trucking industry while 
railroad companies have to establish and maintain their 
networks themselves. Truck operators do not pay for the 
maintenance and the construction of the roads although they 
contribute largely to the deterioration of that infrastructure.
<P>
	Road transportation is very expensive because roads have to 
be repaired and rebuilt. It is also environmentally very costly 
because it takes up large spaces. A highway requires six times as 
much space as a railway. It was also established that you would 
need sixteen highway lanes to move as many people in one hour 
as you would on two railroad lines.
<P>
	One Eastern Quebec group, the Comité de la protection de la 
santé et de l'environnement, in a brief submitted in 1989, 
provided figures showing the basic advantages of a 
railroad-oriented approach. We tend to forget about them. The 
committee members estimated that the building of one highway 
mile requires 20 acres of land while the building of one railroad 
mile requires only 6 acres of land. The issue is not land scarcity 
but optimum land use.
<P>
	So I explained why, in terms of transportation, we must do 
more to support the railroad industry. At this point, it would be 
useful to consider how this much desired expansion will 
proceed.
<P>
	Many stakeholders in the transportation industry are pressing 
for a national, integrated transportation policy. We need a policy 
that allows for competition and market forces and deals 
even-handedly with all modes of transportation in this country. 
It should also get rid of all the tax inequities that put the railway 
sector at risk.
<P>
	We have an extensive railway network that, although not in 
good shape, could provide some interesting opportunities. From 
a strictly economic point of view, revitalizing our railway 
infrastructure should be the first step, before we consider 
intermodal or multimodal approaches.
<P>
	Actually, users depend increasingly on the combined use of 
several transportation modes. Introducing intermodal 
technologies, including equipment that allows for the quick 
transfer of goods from trucks or ships to trains, will revitalize 
the railway freight industry.
<P>
	Intermodal is the future of the railways. In 1991, revenue 
generated by intermodal activities for Canadian National and 
Canadian Pacific totalled $745 million. This amount 
represented 6 per cent of the total tonnage of railway activity 
and 13 per cent of the total revenues of CN and CP. In the past 
few years, both companies have made substantial investments to 
adjust to new market demands. Taking a comprehensive and 
integrated approach to transportation will support these 
companies in their efforts to go beyond the traditional markets 
of the railways.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The total volume of intermodal traffic at CN and CP in 1991 
was 12.2 million tonnes. Of all activity sectors using intermodal 
transportation, import export is by far the most important one, 
representing half of the total tonnage.
<P>
	In the present context of market globalization, one cannot 
overemphasize the importance of strengthening our import 
export activities. Without wishing to sound like a science fiction 
writer, I think it is entirely realistic to say that the intermodal 
approach is indispensable if Canada and Quebec are to take their 
place in the vast global market that will develop in the 
twenty-first century.
<P>
	To do so, however, we need the railways. This government is 
doing the exact opposite of what is now being done by the 
Europeans. In Europe, decision-makers have understood the 
pride of place the railways should have in economic 
development. Canada uses its railway infrastructures for freight 
and passenger transportation ten times less frequently than do 
most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7789"> 7789 </A></B>
<P>
European countries. Trade within the European common market 
is efficient and effective as a result of a policy that integrates all 
transportation modes, while considering the merits of each one, 
to make them  function as a powerful development tool that is 
able to satisfy both economic interests and environmental 
concerns.
<P>
	The European Commission estimates that between 1990 and 
2010, the volume of freight hauled by trucks will increase by 42 
per cent. Alarmed by road traffic which will eventually be 
totally out of control, leaders of the European Community are 
proposing to transfer, as much as possible, the transportation of 
goods from road to rail and water.
<P>
	Railway transportation of goods is being encouraged by 
European governments concerned by the worsening of 
environmental damage caused by an excessive reliance on road 
transportation. When you consider that in France, in Italy or in 
Spain the volume of road traffic is about 6.5 times that of rail 
traffic, while in Canada the ratio is 1 to 76, you realize that it is 
high time that we should do the same.
<P>
	An integrated transport policy requires the establishment of a 
basic railway network. Such a network, essential and 
specialized, would have to be set up in co-operation with the 
provinces, since they would have major economic interests in it.
<P>
	To be effective, the federal government intervention would 
have to recognize the jurisdiction of its provincial partners in an 
integrated transportation system. Government action must 
balance federal responsibilities in rail transportation and 
provincial jurisdiction in road transportation. Integration does 
not necessarily mean uniformity.
<P>
	In the meantime, while we wait for an all-Canada network, we 
should impose a moratorium on railways to avoid the senseless 
and premature destruction of valuable rail infrastructures. We 
have to stop the haemorrhage of rail line abandonment in 
Canada, and in Quebec in particular. At the rate we are going, by 
the time the transport minister finally realizes that this country 
needs a basic railway network that harmoniously integrates all 
means of transportation, it will be too late.
<P>
	That is why a moratorium is so important. It will allow us to 
analyze the planned abandonment of lines, on an individual 
basis, and mainly to evaluate the potential role these lines could 
play in the future basic railway network we must put in place.
<P>
	The railway industry must be put back on track. There is no 
better way to say it. When the whole world, including our 
southern neighbours, is increasingly relying on railway 
transportation, in Canada, we are increasingly relegating it to a 
bygone era, a nostalgic past.
<P>
	Instead of paying tribute to the memory of the Fathers of 
Confederation, we should do Canadian taxpayers a huge favour 
by stimulating trade through the railway industry. Railway 
transportation is undeniably an essential service.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	It is high time to take advantage of the economic, social and 
environmental benefits of railway use. We need public 
commitment. Sweden and a unified Germany are already 
planning to invest as much in their railway system as in their 
road network. Of course, an eventual public commitment will 
have to be accompanied by measures to eliminate such irritants 
as unfair transportation subsidies and tax exemptions on fuel 
which are not generalized.
<P>
	Most of all, it is high time to put in place a basic network 
integrating all means of transportation, in a co-operative, 
non-confrontational manner. As long as an integrated 
transportation policy has not been given serious consideration, 
the under-utilization of Canadian rail lines cannot be used as an 
argument to justify their abandonment.
<P>
	The status of Quebec in the next century should not interfere 
with this super network project. Europeans have such a network, 
although Europe is made up of numerous sovereign states which 
are all participating in the economic development of the 
continent. With NAFTA around the corner, we must draw our 
inspiration from the accomplishments of the world 
communities.
<P>
	We hope that, in the 21st century, all of North America will be 
connected to a huge modern, efficient, viable, reliable, and 
affordable transportation network that will make it easier to 
move goods and people while respecting the environment. Such 
is the challenge ahead of us. If we do not want to miss the boat, 
now is the time to take action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the presentation made by the hon. member opposite 
and I think that he made very important points on some issues, 
particularly the importance of the environmental impact of 
emissions, a common problem related to heavy trucking in 
Quebec and all of Canada of course. He also touched on 
sustainable development. His transportation costs analysis was 
very interesting and I wish to take this opportunity to commend 
his work on this.
<P>
	This leads me to the following question. The hon. member 
claims to be extremely sensitive to all these issues and talks 
about a corporate national transportation policy. The problem I 
have with this is that a national policy would, of course, be 
applied across Canada. So, I wonder how he would make such a 
plan work if Quebec were to become independent and separate 
from the rest of Canada. Also, in the present context, what role 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7790"> 7790 </A></B>
<P>
would he see Quebec and the other provinces play with regard to 
road taxes? Could they possibly be reduced?
<P>
	He must have more frequent dealings with his Quebec 
counterparts than I do. What is Quebec's position on this issue? 
How can road taxes be reduced? How could Quebec be made a 
part of the Canadian family in relation to a national 
transportation policy? I would like to hear what the hon. 
member has to say on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, although I am certainly closer to 
my colleagues in Quebec City than the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I would not presume to 
speak on their behalf about their proposed fiscal policy on fuel 
taxes.
<P>
	I see that my hon. colleague is very concerned about the lack 
of accountability, in his opinion, of several states in establishing 
a rail network. My colleague has just pointed out to him that the 
train between Brussels and Lille crosses the border without 
stopping. Since I come from that region, I can assure him that 
this did not start with the high-speed trains but decades ago. The 
networks are generally international, except perhaps in Japan 
and Madagascar, which is another island. I did not check.
<P>
	Generally speaking, however, every country that is part of an 
international network is concerned about the quality of rail 
service in the other countries, because the quality of the whole 
network depends on the quality of rail service in each of its 
components.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	If we are interested in the quality of the federal network, it is 
because we think, despite our sovereignist views, that the 
quality of Quebec rail service depends on the quality of the 
North American network in a very general way. Canada and 
Quebec, which is now a province, must of course work together 
to build this great North American network which, in the 
national interest, must be as good here as in the other countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that the hon. 
member comes from Europe. There is no doubt that when we are 
talking about the EEC, the historical context is very different in 
the case of this association of European countries. Let us not 
forget that a war had just ended in Europe; in spite of that, there 
was a common desire to regroup.
<P>
	I should mention for the benefit of those who are listening to 
us that the EEC started with the Group of Six, followed later by 
the Group of Twelve, before eventually becoming a larger body 
with more member countries. Canada does have an advantage 
however in that it already has national policies which are almost 
the envy of Europe, with respect to the way we treat our 
provinces and communities.
<P>
	Once again, I would really like to know how Quebec's 
transportation industry could benefit from separation. 
Everything would have to be renegotiated and I think the 
member opposite will admit that there might be some hesitation 
on the part of the other provinces, and even the United States, to 
negotiate with an independent country.
<P>
	The member should tell us how Quebec could renegotiate a 
national transportation policy in the event of a break-up of the 
country and a tougher stand by Quebec itself or by the other 
provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, if Quebec becomes 
independent, there will be several technical questions to settle, 
and the issue of rail transportation will just be one of them. 
However, the hon. member must understand that, even though 
this issue will come up, it will not be impossible to resolve. It 
will only be one more issue to settle.
<P>
	Among other things, separation will enable Quebec to 
electrify its rail lines, which would increase consumption of its 
national source of energy instead of what it considers imported 
energy, with all the environmental benefits this implies.
<P>
	Also, we could elaborate a policy according to our own 
national interests, instead of watering them down with other 
interests, and not only where rail transportation is concerned, 
but in other areas as well. Everyone knows that, in the rail 
transportation area, Western Canada has always been in favour 
with the government and has received very generous gifts paid 
for by every Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Once Quebec becomes independent, it will not have to pay for 
gifts that do not benefit Quebecers and it will look after its own 
national interests, but always in a spirit of co-operation and 
continuity with Canada and North America.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to take part 
in this debate. I have been asking for weeks that an opposition 
day be devoted to railways. That is why I am pleased to enter this 
debate.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Before dealing with my main topic, I would like to respond 
briefly to comments the transport minister made in the House 
today.
<P>
	First of all, the minister accused the official opposition of 
standing for the status quo as far as rail transport is concerned. 
In other words, the Bloc Quebecois would be in favour of the 
status quo in transportation, and more particularly in railways.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that such is not the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois, and the minister knows it. His comments are sheer 
grand standing for the benefit of his constituency, and they do 
not relate in any way to the subject matter. Those comments 
demonstrate that this Liberal government does not take rail 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7791"> 7791 </A></B>
<P>
transportation  seriously. One clue to that is the comments by the 
Minister of Transport; another is that the government seems to 
rely only on the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine to respond to remarks by 
Bloc Quebecois members. He often seems to lead us off into 
debates that have nothing to do with the debate at hand. Clearly, 
the government does not take rail transportation seriously.
<P>
	As my colleague, the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans pointed out this morning, 
the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for almost a year that the 
Standing Committee on Transport examine the whole issue of 
rail transportation. This has been denied us for all kinds of 
reasons, each one shakier than the other, and this means that 
after a year of Liberal government we are in a worse situation 
than before.
<P>
	I can tell the Minister of Transport right off the bat that what 
the Bloc Quebecois wants is to know where the government is 
going in the area of rail transportation. His responsibility is to 
tell us what direction he is taking, what he intends to do after a 
year in his portfolio. We want the government to protect the 
interests of all Canadians, but more precisely, as far as I am 
concerned, the interests of Quebecers and particularly the 
interests of my constituents, severely affected by the decisions 
the government is taking in the area of rail transportation. I will 
come back to that.
<P>
	We want a real public debate on the future of rail 
transportation. We want real solutions. We, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, refuse to identify as the only scapegoats employees 
of CN and CP and their so-called golden collective agreements. 
When you consider the perks given to the president of CN, 
which were mentioned by my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, and the outrageous benefit 
that a house represents, I think it is rather foolish on the part of 
the government to single out unionized workers for the lack of 
profitability of rail transportation in Canada, especially east of 
Winnipeg.
<P>
	The reasons why I insisted for so long for a debate on this 
subject led me to wonder about the future of a rail network in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	And I will say right away for the benefit of the hon. member 
for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine that my comments 
arise primarily from a concern about the future of the rail system 
in Quebec, linked of course, with North America as a whole.
<P>
	I have been looking at the rail question for several months 
now, and have seen the threat of the slow but systematic 
destruction of its rail network looming over Quebec.
<P>
	My riding, Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, provides the 
perfect example of the sort of hypocritical manoeuvre the 
federal government is planning to carry out in Quebec. The 
abandonment of the line linking Sherbrooke, in the Eastern 
Townships, and Saint John in New Brunswick, is being 
threatened for January 1, 1995. This abandonment was ordered 
by the National Transportation Agency under the former 
government. I mention this again so that the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine will not have to rise in the 
House and blame the leader of the opposition for all the 
decisions taken since the beginning of Confederation.
<P>
	This abandonment would be a real economic disaster for the 
Eastern Townships, with potentially devastating consequences 
for the entire area, and I would go so far as to say for the whole 
of the Eastern Townships.
<P>
	And yet, while we are experiencing a crisis of major changes 
and drastic cuts in the rail industry in Quebec and in Canada, the 
Standing Committee on Transport-and I point this out 
again-has always systematically refused to look at the rail 
question, despite the repeated requests of the official opposition 
representative.
<P>
	We are told that the committee must focus on the future of the 
aviation industry, the future of airports, and that there is 
therefore no time for the future of rail, an industry that in 1993 
employed close to 50,000 people across the country. No time! 
The committee has no time! Realizing the ridiculousness of the 
situation, the Minister of Transport announced, last September 
29, the creation of a task force to examine the possible 
privatization of CN.
<P>
	But to make sure it would not interfere with schemes to 
dismantle the Quebec railway system, the minister took the 
trouble of appointing an all Liberal task force, with only one 
member from Quebec sitting on it. The minister need not worry; 
this task force is not likely to make much noise.
<P>
	The question we must ask ourselves at this point is: why is the 
government so afraid of having Bloc members on this task 
force? Why have such a suspicious behaviour that resembles a 
conspiracy? Upon analyzing the whole issue, the federal 
government's sinister intentions in the railway system become 
clear.
<P>
	I would now like to review briefly the events of the past year 
regarding the rail issue. The minister referred to it this morning.
<P>
	First, there was the statement made by the CN chairman, Mr. 
Paul Tellier, in December 1992, who apparently wanted to 
merge the CN and CP railway systems. This period of a few 
months was referred to as the CN-CP operations consolidation 
period. For reasons unknown to us, since all was done in secret, 
this plan fell through sometime around June 1994.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7792"> 7792 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Then, and it is still on the table, CP Rail presented a bid to 
purchase CN assets for $1.4 billion.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, Bloc Quebecois members have met with 
senior CP executives to clarify the contents of the proposal put 
before CN management and government authorities. We came 
out from this meeting with more questions than answers.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we are particularly concerned about the fact 
that the federal government seems to want to divest itself of 
assets that belong to the people of Quebec and Canada as a 
whole. Regarding the CN railway system, we must bear in mind 
that this is a public company. Therefore, CN facilities across the 
country belong to the taxpayers of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	We are very concerned that a private company like CP could 
buy this system and then do whatever it feels like with it. This is 
the main criticism we, the Official Opposition, are directing at 
the government.
<P>
	As we said in our motion, which refers to the government's 
lack of transparency on this issue, we find it unconscionable that 
the government is making decisions on the future of the public 
rail system, at least the part belonging to CN, without the 
people-or at least the socio-economic stakeholders-, the 
Official Opposition and the Reform Party being consulted on 
and participating in the upcoming decision on the future of the 
rail system.
<P>
	Regarding the sale of facilities to CP, we will need much more 
information and many more assurances from the government if 
it wants us to approve this deal.
<P>
	Most of the Quebec portion of the CP line from Saint John, 
New Brunswick, to Sherbrooke goes through my riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. This line belongs to CP. For 
several years now, we have witnessed CP's ``demarketing 
effort'' to discourage potential industrial clients from using 
their services, as well as the difficulties experienced by local 
people. Their attitude seems slightly different today since CP 
needs people's support to buy CN-But when we see how 
difficult it was in the past to obtain information from CP, we are 
entitled to ask ourselves what will happen when this company 
takes over the whole network in Eastern Canada, and especially 
in Quebec. It would take compelling arguments to convince me 
that this is a good deal.
<P>
	I would like to say a word about the federal government's 
criteria for assessing the networks to be abandoned or sold off.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Everyone agrees that the two main criteria are profitability 
and the public interest. Everyone also agrees that east of 
Winnipeg-and this is not partisan separatist talk, because it 
affects Ontario and the Maritimes as well as 
Quebec-profitability is the criterion used by the  National 
Transportation Agency to decide on the future of a railway or 
branch line.
<P>
	How can local people show that a rail line is profitable? I 
would say that they almost have to prove it foot by foot and not 
for the whole line. I will just give an example to illustrate what I 
am saying. The rail line which concerns me, the one from Saint 
John to Sherbrooke, has a client about 10 km west of Sherbrooke 
called Eka Nobel. This company alone does over $3.5 million of 
business with CP every year to move its merchandise.
<P>
	When the time came to consider the profitability of the 
railway east of Sherbrooke, this customer located 15 km west of 
Sherbrooke was not taken into account. This shows the 
ridiculousness of such a situation where figures are made to say 
what one wants them to say.
<P>
	For the future of railways in western Canada, public interest is 
the criterion used. To prove this point, and no one can challenge 
this, I take the subsidies for shipping western wheat; for the 
current year, about $600 million of our tax money will be used to 
pay for the transportation of wheat in the West. There is no 
equivalent in eastern Canada. This policy is a double standard 
which obviously puts rail service in eastern Canada at a 
disadvantage.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say a word about the future of rail 
transport, since this morning, the minister-as I said and 
repeated earlier-accused the Official Opposition of wanting to 
maintain the status quo. When my colleague who spoke just 
before me talked about a moratorium on abandoning rail lines 
throughout Canada, and especially in Quebec, the reason we are 
asking for a moratorium is not to maintain the status quo but to 
let the local and regional stakeholders and the Government of 
Quebec meet with representatives of the federal government to 
discuss alternatives. Alternatives exist. Later today, some of my 
other colleagues will talk about short lines, which Quebec law 
encourages and permits. To establish a short line, the local 
community must take charge.
<P>
	One of the problems the railway system has to face is the loss 
of interest of the population these last few years. There are 
several reasons for this change of attitude, including the fact 
that the railway companies, the CN and the CP, have chosen to 
keep their operations secret. Because of the way the CP handled 
things in my area, potential users no longer want to do business 
with this railway company, and our people lost interest.
<P>
	So, we need to hold a real debate. This is why I hope the 
speeches made today in this House will not close the debate on 
the railway system, but rather launch a truly public debate on the 
issue, a debate in which the government and the opposition 
should take part and make their position known, to reassure the 
population that the railway system will be maintained and 
expanded throughout Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7793"> 7793 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	On a more specific note, I want to say that in Quebec and in 
my riding, there can be no economic future without a profitable 
railway system, and such a railway system can obviously ensure 
economic development and also be financially viable. To do so, 
we need the co-operation of all the people involved. This is what 
we, in the Bloc, are trying to do and we can only hope that the 
government join us in our efforts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the hon. member's comments. We are discussing a 
national policy, but the previous speaker talked about 
converting Quebec's railway system to electric power.
<P>
	I find it hard to see how we could ensure national 
co-ordination if electricity is used in Quebec but not in the rest 
of Canada. I would really like to know what would be the costs 
of an independent service in Quebec, as proposed by the 
opposition, and I wonder if the hon. member can provide an 
answer to this very legitimate question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect for the hon. member representing 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I realize that he does not 
know anything about the railroad issue and I would hope that, in 
the few hours of debate left, the government will be represented 
by people who have some basic knowledge of the issue.
<P>
	When Bloc Quebecois members, and certainly myself, talk 
about the future of the railway system in Quebec, it is of course 
in the context of a larger network which would include 
surrounding provincial or federal states, including the United 
States. I remind the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine that, during the debate on 
free trade, sovereignists were the strongest and most vocal 
supporters of that option. In fact, Conservative Prime Minister 
Brian Mulroney paid tribute to the current deputy premier of 
Quebec, Mr. Bernard Landry, who travelled across Quebec, and 
even Canada, in support of the free trade accord with the United 
States, back in 1988.
<P>
	Sovereignists are not afraid of economic challenges. We have 
no problem whatsoever with competing. We are well aware that 
we live in North America and we want to develop economic, 
cultural and social links as much with Canada as with the United 
States. In that respect, the railway system is a tool among others. 
My colleague, who has experienced railway systems in Europe, 
made it very clear a few minutes ago. In Europe, railways cross 
borders almost every 600 or 700 kilometres and there is no 
problem. Nobody ever said: ``We will have a network in France, 
but no connection with Belgium, Italy or Spain''.
<P>
	Obviously, when my colleagues and I think about railway 
development, what we have in mind is a network linked to all of 
Canada, as well as the United States. In  fact, the railroad in my 
riding is an international line, since it goes across Quebec and 
Maine, on to New Brunswick. It goes without saying that we 
must think in terms of the whole continent when we look at the 
railway system. We hope to save our domestic network so as to 
be able to connect with American networks as well as Canada.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	As regards the use of electricity, it is one of many options, and 
as good as many others. My colleague was simply trying to show 
that, with a bit of imagination, there are solutions which could 
ensure a promising future for the railways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine made a reference to what 
I said about electrification, so I would like to add that 
electrification is an option that offers tremendous economic as 
well as environmental benefits, for Quebec and Ontario, two 
provinces that produce large amounts of electric power.
<P>
	What I meant is that if Quebec were a sovereign State, it could 
look at the option of electrification more independently and with 
greater emphasis on national interests, I would say, than would 
be the case today, when we have people lobbying to maintain the 
use of oil. I may add that some railway lines, and I have travelled 
on these, use oil on one section and electricity on another 
section. It is not a major problem.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead wish to comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Do I have 
any time left?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Yes, of course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to elaborate on what the hon. member just 
said. Basically, his point was, and I mentioned this earlier, that 
we should look at all the options or at least keep all our options 
open in the railway transportation sector as in all other sectors.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
asked some of my colleagues what position the Government of 
Quebec would take on this matter and what the position of the 
municipalities would be on taxation. He was referring to the fuel 
tax.
<P>
	I would like to comment briefly in this respect, since during 
the past year, I was very involved in working with people in my 
community to raise public awareness of the future of railway 
transportation. I think that important progress was made during 
the past few weeks, and I am delighted to see that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7794"> 7794 </A></B>
<P>
	I also had an opportunity to talk to municipal authorities, who 
told me they had no objection to reviewing their right to raise 
property taxes and to business people who expressed an interest 
in investing in short-line railway companies. In fact, the only 
ingredient still lacking is a clear-cut decision by the 
government and the Minister of Transport to include the public 
or its representatives in this debate.
<P>
	So far, and we see this in the so-called task force set up by the 
Minister of Transport, there is no room for the opposition, not 
for the Official Opposition and not for the Reform Party. As far 
as consultations with the industry are concerned, there are a 
monumental farce, and that is why we are telling our 
stakeholders to boycott these consultations, since their only 
purpose is to let the government hear what it wants to hear. What 
we need is genuine consultations across Canada, and I am 
prepared to co-operate with the government and let our 
intervenors come and say what they think of railway 
transportation and what they are prepared to do to ensure its 
future.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the 
open-mindedness the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead has shown in advocating a 
national railway system from coast to coast, that is to say from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific and, of course, going across Quebec.
<P>
	It is with pleasure that I will be talking today about a critical 
element of Canada's infrastructure, CN North America. CN is 
the largest rail carrier in Canada as well as the largest federal 
crown corporation with assets over $5 billion and revenues in 
1994 forecasted at over $4 billion. CN North America operates 
an extensive network of 18,000 miles and provides about 30,000 
jobs across the country. It serves shippers in 8 provinces giving 
them access to all major canadian ports and to markets in the 
U.S.
<P>
	CN North America has faced several difficult challenges over 
its existence and, more particularly, over the last few years. Let 
me explain, the market for rail has changed dramatically and 
motor carriers now compete vigorously against rail carriers. The 
commodities best served by rail are under growing world price 
pressure and are demanding lower transportation rates. Shippers 
from the manufacturing sector are demanding better services in 
terms of reliability and rapidity.
<P>
	All these factors have affected the financial performance of 
CN North America and resulted in continued losses over the past 
few years. However Mr. Speaker I believe that CN North 
America has begun to take the necessary steps to improve its 
future performance. The company is rationalizing its network. It 
is abondoning the few remaining lines where there is simply no 
traffic and selling to local entrepreneurs the  lines that serve 
local markets and can be operated profitably by a small-scale 
railway company.
<P>
	These regional railways or shortlines are usually more 
responsive to local shipper's needs and consequently provide 
services of equal or higher quality than class 1 carriers. In 
addition, their more flexible work rules allow them to adapt 
quickly to market demands and make them a lower cost solution 
than the traditional class 1 carriers.
<P>
	In addition to rationalizing its network, CN North America is 
currently implementing a major labour reduction initiative. The 
company announced in 1992 that 11,000 jobs would be 
eliminated over three years. That announcement resulted in a 
significant write-down and a loss over $1 billion in that year. 
But it also signalled to the financial market, the company's firm 
intention to control its costs.
<P>
	CN North America is now in the second year of this initiative. 
It recently confirmed that 70 per cent of the cuts have been 
made. This iniative represents an important change in the 
organization that needed to be made if CN North America is to 
become a viable operation.
<P>
	CN North America has also increased its marketing effort and 
is investing to offer shippers the best service available. The 
expansion of the Sarnia tunnel is perfect example of an 
investment that will give the company a competitive edge over it 
competitors in the intermodal market. By investing over $200 
million to expand the Sarnia tunnel, CN North America will 
soon be able to move double-stack containers between 
Montreal, Toronto and Chicago. This could represent savings of 
12 hours for shipments going to Chicago.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Another good example of CN North America's strive for 
improved service is the recent purchase by the company of a 
leading-edge information system that will track individual 
shipments from pick-up to delivery. It will now be possible for 
CN North America and its shippers to know exactly where a 
shipment is and when it will get to its final destination.
<P>
	I am glad to inform the House that CN North America is 
starting to reap the benefits of its ongoing efforts. The company 
earned $186 million for the nine months ended september 30, 
compared with a loss of $41 million in the comparable period in 
1993. The company could earn as much as $225 million profit 
this year, which would break the long series of losses 
experienced over the last few years.
<P>
	However, this year's profit is not yet the happy ending we are 
all hoping for CN North America. The company's debt remains 
at $2,2 billion, a very high level. And the profit in 1994 will not 
be sufficient to reduce the debt significantly because of 
important requirements for capital investment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7795"> 7795 </A></B>
<P>
	CN North America must continue to invest in its 
infrastructure to respond to growing demand and to reduce its 
costs. Higher profit over several years will be necessary to start 
reducing CN North America's debt. Fortunately, the recent 
cost-cutting and revenue-enhancing intiatives undertaken by 
CN North America put the company in a position to reap the 
benefits of the current strong economic growth and establish the 
base for a viable rail operation.
<P>
	We are all aware that on september 22, Canadian Pacific Ltd. 
presented to government an unsolicited proposal to purchase CN 
North America's eastern assets. The offer came a few months 
after the failure of merger discussions between CN North 
America and Canadian Pacific Ltd.
<P>
	You will recall that Canadian Pacific Ltd. and CN North 
America initiated these merger discussions more than a year ago 
in an attempt to consolidate their money-losing operations in 
eastern Canada. The discussions failed when the companies 
could not agree on the value of the assets they were each 
contributing to the deal.
<P>
	The governement is now reviewing CP's bid to assess the 
many implications for the rail industry, shippers, rail employees 
and taxpayers. In particular, government is reviewing the 
competitive implications of the proposed bid for shippers 
located in eastern Canada as well as the likely impacts on 
transcontinental traffic and western shippers.
<P>
	The review will also include an assessment of employment 
impacts of the take over. And government has retained the 
professional service of wood gundy, and investment banking 
firm, to provide advice on the financial aspects of the proposed 
transaction.
<P>
	The overall review is proceeding quickly but the government 
made it clear that it would take all the time required to conduct a 
proper assessment of the offer.
<P>
	This unsolicited bid prompted the Minister of Transport to 
announce on september 29 the creation of a task force on the 
commercialization of CN North America. The task force, 
chaired by my colleague from Kenora-Rainy River, Robert 
Nault, will focus on commercialization of the company, 
including potential employee participation.
<P>
	The task force will seek input from a variety of stakeholders 
in the rail industry, including railway employees, shippers, 
provinces, communities and the railways.
<P>
	To date, the task force has been briefed by senior executives 
from CN North America and other rail industry experts, by the 
Canadian Railway Labour Association and by the National 
Transportation Agency.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Public consultations will start next week on november 22 in 
Ottawa and will be held in a dozen of other cities across the 
country over the next month. The task force is expected to report 
to the minister of transport by the end of the year.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the task force review is only one 
element of government initiatives to streamline its operations 
and review its role to define what must be done by government 
and what could be accomplished by the private sector. 
Accordingly, Transport Canada is currently reviewing all its 
operations to determine what activities could be better 
accomplished by the private sector or in partnership with the 
private sector.
<P>
	In the rail sector, Transport Canada has undertaken a review 
of the industry to determine the key elements impeding 
railway's performance. The objective is to define a strategy 
dealing with these issues that will improve the railways' ability 
to compete and provide efficient and affordable service to 
canadian shippers.
<P>
	Transport Canada has concluded a series of regional 
consultations on the rail industry where shippers, the railways 
and unions were asked for recommendations to improve the 
railways' performance and ability to compete. The discussions 
covered several issues from railway management, labour 
practices to rail regulations.
<P>
	In parallel to the consultations, Transport Canada is taking a 
close look at its regulations to ensure that our transportation 
companies, including the railways, operate in an environment 
that favour efficient use of resources and high-quality service 
for shippers.
<P>
	Obviously, the future of CN North America will be affected 
by all these initiatives. Changes in the rail industry as well as 
changes in the perception of government's role vis-a-vis crown 
corporations would have a direct impact on CN North America. 
It is too early to speculate on what the future of CN North 
America will be. The government has undertaken a series of 
reviews that will all affect the corporation: a review of the 
environment in which the corporation operates; an assessment 
of CP's unsolicited bid, and a review of the potential merits of 
commercializing CN North America.
<P>
	The company has begun to take the necessary steps to become 
an efficient rail operation. The conclusions of these reviews will 
be instrumental in maximising the benefits of CN North 
America's initiatives. The government will ensure that railways 
operate in an environment that allows them to freely compete 
and gives them the opportunity to adapt to shipper's demands in 
an efficient and affordable manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7796"> 7796 </A></B>
<P>
	In this context, the future of CN North America will be 
determined by what is best for the rail industry but also for 
canadian shippers and the canadian people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in debate on the 
opposition day motion concerning the inaction and lack of 
transparency of the government with respect to the potential 
restructuring of Canada's railways.
<P>
	I look upon this as an opportunity to speak about the vision, 
history, and fabric of this great nation. It is difficult not to be 
nostalgic and perhaps a bit sentimental when one speaks of a 
symbol of our heritage, a simple yet binding line of steel that 
forged the country and tied a fledgling nation together over 125 
years ago.
<P>
	What child of our generation can forget running to a window 
to watch the train or the haunting late night blast of its steam 
whistle belching clouds of smoke? The steam, coal and smoke 
may be gone, replaced by diesel turbines and electric motors, 
but the memory lives on. Or, does it? And if it does, for how 
long?
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In preparing for this speech I could not help but recall two 
formative pieces of Canadian literary work, <I>The National 
Dream</I> and <I>The Last Spike</I>. Pierre Berton's comprehensive 
works on CP Rail and the line of steel that brought my home 
province of British Columbia into Confederation are enduring. 
It is hard to forget the concluding paragraphs of Berton's work 
as the last spike is driven at Craigellachie and the tiny engine 
rolls through the mountains, down the escarpment to the Fraser 
Valley meadows, off to the blue Pacific and on into history. This 
is the legend, the lore, and what brought the country together.
<P>
	Nothing is static. While one can reminisce about the past, its 
simplicity and fragile beauty, a country marches on and not 
always as it should. Change is not always improvement. Motion 
is not always progress. Simple men sometimes lack the vision of 
our forefathers and choices are not always the right ones.
<P>
	We are here today to question and debate where we are going 
as a country not in all dimensions but in one fundamental basic 
dimension: rail travel, be it CN, CP or VIA Rail. We are here to 
question our vision, our progress and our choices.
<P>
	Despite what the current administration thinks sometimes 
money cannot buy vision. It cannot, as in this instance, buy 
decisiveness in our rail policy for the country. The fact remains 
that the government has shown complete disregard for a rail 
policy for Canada.
<P>
	As in the 1860s times have changed. The solutions we used to 
forge rail policy in the 1960s and 1970s are not compatible with 
today's problems, including the movement of freight and 
people. While an enlightened rail policy could forge new 
dynamics in transportation in Canada, the current government 
holds any mention of  vision or change in contempt. Worn out 
political hacks at CN headquarters in Montreal work in secret. 
Their vision parallels that of the Bloc's motion of unrealistic $7 
billion to $10 billion rail corridors bordering the St. Lawrence 
River. These are monuments to the greed and largesse of better 
days, not sensible alternatives to the inertia that really grips 
these people.
<P>
	This is not 1860. Government and the public sector are not 
masters of all. There is no bottomless pit of inflated dollars for 
high speed rail corridors. The torch has been passed and the 
notion that the government or the public sector can do it better 
does not pass the litmus test of the 1990s. So-called privateers 
like the Bombardiers who like to innovate as long as government 
dollars are there are not solutions but drains, and no more so 
than in rail policy.
<P>
	The Reform Party promotes a vision that promotes 
privatization and spinoff of federal transport operations into 
private hands. The Reform Party supports the Bloc's motion 
condemning the government's shoddy if not non-existent rail 
policies. Who knows what the future holds for CN or CP Rail?
<P>
	The Reform Party supports CP's recent offer to purchase CN's 
eastern operations. How has the transport minister reacted? It 
has been with scorn, hesitation and indecisiveness. Is this a rail 
policy? What is he waiting for, a better offer? No, he is content 
with the status quo. In many ways this attitude is as dispensable 
as the steam whistle and the clouds of smoke. If the minister is 
devoid of solutions or visions why not open the process to public 
review and scrutiny?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	A ribbon of steel from east to west has become an ever 
decreasing concentric circle where we end up meeting 
ourselves. We are going nowhere. Let us look at VIA Rail, the 
sinkhole of inefficiency. It is one of the biggest money losing, 
overbureaucratised entities in Canadian transportation. This is 
not because of rank and file VIA Rail employees. No, it takes a 
special public service background and mentality to run a 
railroad into the ground and make six-figure salaries while 
doing it.
<P>
	Without question putting VIA Rail in private hands would cut 
costs, revitalize the corporation and its people, and allow it to 
return many passenger routes that have been abandoned or are in 
danger of being cut. It does not take any vision to keep cutting 
and make a few dollars, but in the case of VIA it does take a 
special touch to cut and still lose money.
<P>
	If VIA were to be turned over to private entrepreneurs 
marginal routes could once again be viable, but not as long as 
VIA is publicly owned. Complacency and debt endure forever. 
VIA Rail has exhibited no marketing strategy, business plan or a 
scintilla of vision in its current operation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7797"> 7797 </A></B>
<P>
	Talking about government funded, billion dollar, high speed, 
government run rail corridors ensures more of the same. Why 
are the Bloc and the government afraid to pass it on to those 
better suited and able to run a railroad?
<P>
	If private investors were given annual funding to the tune of 
$330 million, as VIA will receive this year, do we really think 
they would squander it on high salaries for their executives? 
Why is VIA receiving these kinds of grants and still losing 
money while cutting routes and service?
<P>
	Speaking of management, in 1992 CN cut 10,000 jobs and lost 
$1 billion. That same year CP applied for abandonment of all 
lines east of Sherbrooke. Just where are we going? Do we know? 
Eventually the Reform Party could see the government 
abandoning its stake in CN Rail by turning it over to private 
investors. Governments should no longer be in the business of 
directly subsidizing our national transport system.
<P>
	The government is unwilling to admit its policy flaws and 
clings to the good old days of decades ago where throwing 
money at a problem was solving it. In reality we have no rail 
policy and a debt ridden CN Rail still at the trough.
<P>
	However the Reform Party feels that government cannot 
simply abandon its financial stake in the transport industry 
without having the sense to recognize how much revision needs 
to be enacted to bring transport legislation into the 1990s. 
Present legislation harshly though unofficially penalizes the rail 
industry through the present federal tax structure. It behoves the 
government, particularly the Minister of Transport, to rewrite 
rail policy, clear up the anomalies, and set a strategy in place to 
allow investors to enter the arena with clear parameters.
<P>
	To encourage and support this new policy regime, the Reform 
Party suggests the following measures. First, we would 
encourage through tax reforms and low interest loans the 
development of short line rail operators in regions of the country 
where major rail companies are no longer viable or willing to 
provide the amount of capital needed to recreate a viable rail 
transportation industry.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, we would negotiate the reform of the provincial 
component of the property and fuel tax structure for both main 
and secondary rail operators to bring these costs more into line 
with their U.S. counterparts.
<P>
	Third, we would formally recognize through federal tax 
reform the environmental safety and infrastructure benefits 
provided by rail transport as opposed to modes such as long haul 
trucking.
<P>
	Finally, in relation to the last point, we need a thorough and 
fair revision in the overall taxation structure for the nation's 
trucking industry to bring it more fairly into line with the costs 
now being incurred by rail companies.
<P>
	Currently the government gives with one hand and takes with 
the other. Since taking power last year the government has done 
an inadequate job of protecting Canada's rail industry. It is 
mired in the past with no clear vision or policy direction. Unlike 
the Bloc, we feel there should be less and not more public 
participation. Governments should set guidelines and step out of 
the way. Right now no one is pleased with the situation and the 
rail industry is suffering as a consequence.
<P>
	In the 1860s we completed our rail link to the Pacific. In the 
late 1930s and 1940s we tied the country together in 
transcontinental air flight. In the 1960s we completed the 
trans-Canada highway system. Let not these statements of 
vision, courage and capacity be diminished by a lack of coherent 
rail policy in the 1990s.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I failed to ask the member 
for clarification at the beginning of his intervention. Is he going 
to be splitting his time with his colleague? He used 10 minutes 
and I do not know if he is subject to five minutes of questions or 
comments or 10.
<P>
	If it is the wish of the Reform Party I will recognize the 
member for Lisgar-Marquette for the remaining 10 minutes. 
Before I recognize him there will be five minutes of questions 
and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have one question for the hon. member.
<P>
	Some time ago a company called the Great Canadian Railtour 
Company in British Columbia purchased from VIA Rail, an 
operation known as the Rocky Mountaineer. After it was 
purchased, VIA Rail, a government crown corporation, then 
tried to go back on the deal in a number of ways: by 
manipulating the contract, by reinterpreting the contract and 
then later, trying to introduce a competitive service on an 
adjacent line. All of this was against the spirit if not the letter of 
the contract.
<P>
	This would be a concern for people who may be looking at 
purchasing a privatized CN Rail or a portion of it. We would 
have to look at actions of the minister under such things as the 
Pearson contract.
<P>
	In this situation Canadian businesses put together and signed 
a contract with the government which the government 
cancelled, as is its right. We are not questioning that right but 
rather the entire mechanism where the government tried to 
introduce legislation that would ban it from going to court 
seeking redress, whatever proper redress might be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7798"> 7798 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that the actions taken by the 
Minister of Transport with regard to the Pearson contract might 
impact on private companies looking to buy a portion of CN Rail 
or the entire operation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the business community seeks 
many things. One of the things they seek above all else is 
certainty. Also, they need the ability to work in an environment 
where they know the rules and where those rules will allow them 
to clear up any conflicts, particularly through the last court of 
appeal which is the federal and provincial court system. That is 
what we call justice and is what our society is built on.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In my view the whole question of the Pearson contract is 
controversial right now. It is going to create uncertainty in that 
sphere. The only way we will get to the bottom of it is to settle it 
through a public inquiry. We need to clear the air, to create 
fairness and transparency. That is really what we want in asking 
for the CN task force as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with intent to the member's dissertation.
<P>
	I am very interested in the concept of high speed rail 
transportation for the Montreal-Toronto corridor because those 
rail systems would go through my riding. I have had some time 
to examine this.
<P>
	One of the obvious problems is a matter of population density. 
It would appear in looking at similar rail systems in other 
countries-I think of Tokyo and of Paris-that these systems as 
well do not pay for themselves. We have just watched the recent 
unveiling of the London to Paris rail system which is 
encumbered with a huge debt that possibly will never be repaid.
<P>
	The member spoke about privatization. I guess the question in 
the back of my mind is this. Is the current Canadian rail system 
viable as a private enterprise? If it is not viable in its entirety, 
then would he address breaking up the rail system into small 
parts and possibly abandoning the whole rail system in parts of 
Canada?
<P>
	Is that what the member is proposing, that we break the rail 
system up, that if private industry decides it is not viable that we 
cannot get on a train in Toronto and go to British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, several issues were put forward. If 
high speed rail in this part of the world, as opposed to the west 
where I am from, is a very good proposal, then I would suggest 
that if the private sector wants to carry it out, that is fine.
<P>
	It has to be recognized that government can no longer do these 
things. It has to be recognized that the federal government is 
now borrowing money from foreign lenders in order to maintain 
the operations of government. The country cannot afford these 
large projects.
<P>
	Where can we go with our national rail system? We have an 
example of what happened in New Zealand when it privatized its 
railroad. The railroad went from being the least efficient in the 
western world to the most efficient. That changes the economics 
of many of the branch lines and so on. It does not necessarily 
mean that every remote branch line will become economical.
<P>
	As a matter of policy, in a country such as Canada we are in all 
likelihood going to continue to want to have some of those 
remote lines. We can do that through incentives or through 
negotiation.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Whether we are going to do this under the umbrella, whether it 
will be one large rail system or whether it will be broken up I 
suggest is more a matter of private sector economics than it is a 
matter of government policy, or at least it should be. It is very 
difficult to say which is the better way. It will be a matter of 
financial accident in a sense as opposed to a master strategy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege and a pleasure to speak to the motion of 
the official opposition. I agree with their motion when it says 
there is a lack of action of the Liberal government. I somewhat 
disagree when it says there is a lack of transparency. There is a 
lot of transparency and I do not like what I see.
<P>
	When I look at the transportation policy of the present Liberal 
government it reminds me very much of a continuation of the 
Liberal transportation policy of the seventies. I see very little 
difference between that transportation policy and what I have 
seen brought forward to the House.
<P>
	In the 1970s the general Liberal philosophy was: ``If it ain't 
working, close it. Don't try fixing it because somebody else will 
fix it''. I remember very vividly in the 1970s the pressure that 
was put on for the abandonment of some of the inefficient 
railway branch lines. The public was forced to accept these. The 
communities where these branch lines were abandoned were 
promised at that time that money would be saved by abandoning 
these rail lines and that money would be put into infrastructure 
in the road system.
<P>
	It is with great sadness that I report that we have seen none of 
those infrastructure improvements on the road systems. We are 
still waiting. When one comes to the rural communities of 
Manitoba these days, when one wants to drive through the 
countryside in the end of June after the highway department 
people have filled in the potholes with some more asphalt-to 
make sure there would not be a pothole they have put in a little 
extra so there is a bump-and when the restrictions come off the 
highways so that we can haul our regular load and farmers get to 
moving their grain, one will see dozens of farm trucks doing the 
bunny hop from one pothole bump to the next pothole bump.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7799"> 7799 </A></B>
<P>
	We have done this now for 20 years and farmers are getting 
tired of this type of infrastructure. When the Liberal government 
proposed the new infrastructure program that is going to cost the 
general taxpayer about $6 billion, among the first comments I 
heard from my constituents was: ``Jake, make sure that we get 
something done to our road system. We were promised this in 
the seventies and we are still waiting''.
<P>
	It is sad, Mr. Speaker, to inform you that we are still waiting. 
Just recently I checked the infrastructure programs that have 
been approved in Manitoba. I can tell the House that the rural 
communities have about one-half of what Winnipeg South 
Centre constituency received. I do not see any elevator systems 
or big highways. All I see in that area are projects for new 
community centres, new swimming pools and that type of a 
sports luxury infrastructure.
<P>
	It amazes me when I hear the hon. member on the Liberal side 
saying that we have a rail system that binds the country together. 
I must say to him that those rail ties, those pieces of steel do not 
exist any more in our communities. Those rail ties now line 
miles and miles of fence line holding up four strands of barbed 
wire or supporting the boards on a corral fence to keep the cattle 
separate.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	If that is what this government means by binding the country 
together, by abandoning more of these railways instead of 
making them efficient, I do not think I want that kind of unity.
<P>
	The minister asked for input this morning on how to solve 
some of these problems. I think it was made very clear to the 
transport minister and also to the agriculture minister in May of 
this year when the subcommittee on rail car allocations 
suggested that the grain transportation agency should be done 
away with. It was causing more of a problem than a help in car 
allocation.
<P>
	It was also suggested very strongly by every member on the 
subcommittee and the agriculture standing committee that we 
should finally do something about the backtracking. We are 
wasting millions of dollars by backtracking grain, disrupting the 
grain handling system. There is a very simple solution and I 
would like to read a couple of comments out of yesterday's 
<I>Quorum</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The National Transportation Agency estimates 1.1 million tonnes of grain 
last year that landed in Thunder Bay was backtracked to Winnipeg, Canadian 
Pacific Ltd.'s gateway into the U.S. and to Fort Francis, Ont., Canadian 
National's link to the U.S.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These cars are being held up by backtracking and it is costing 
us money. It is a very simple problem to solve.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``It's ludicrous,'' says Tad Cawkwell, a barley grower in Nut Mountain, 
Sask. ``You don't head north if you want to go south''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It amazes me that our railway system and our grain handling 
elevators decide when they get to Winnipeg instead of making a 
90 degree turn into the U.S. to go south they have to go another 
700 kilometres east then come back to Winnipeg and take a left 
turn south.
<P>
	What is the result of this? The result is that roughly 13,000 
hopper cars filled with Canadian wheat, barley and oats destined 
for the U.S. each year take a scenic route that is 1,400 kilometres 
longer than any direct route.
<P>
	What does the agriculture minister say to a problem like this? 
It almost surprised me when I saw it in the paper. It really is a bit 
of a fluke in the system that goes back many years. It simply 
squanders some of the limited resources we have to overall pay 
the costs. Is that the type of Liberal government we have that 
condones that type of policy? I am surprised that we still have a 
transportation system at all if that is our philosophy of a good 
transportation system.
<P>
	I was very pleased this morning when I heard the 
transportation minister quote a speech from Winnipeg on 
October 6. I would like to quote a few other stats that he brought 
forward in that speech. I thought he had a very good handle on 
what the problems really are and I thought he addressed them 
very well. I would like to bring them to this House this 
afternoon.
<P>
	As he pointed out in one of the first statements, U.S. railways 
have higher labour productivity than Canadian railways, 64 per 
cent higher to be exact. The minister does know what one of the 
problems is. U.S. tonnes per mile are about 66 per cent higher 
than in Canada. Why is the government acknowledging that this 
is the case but is not doing anything about it?
<P>
	Simply, my answer to these questions is that we have grain 
companies, we have railways that are lobbying very hard not to 
change the system because it benefits their pockets and they do 
not really care about what happens to the farmers' pockets. As 
long as the farmer grows the grain they know they have to ship it 
and they will continue to bleed us dry for as much as they 
possibly can.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The transport minister went on to explain that this is a bleak 
picture, everyone shares in the problem, not just in the failure to 
respond to changing technology or economic conditions. Other 
problems were created by governments through excessive 
regulation and taxation, by railway management, through top 
heavy structures and by labour, through low productivity and 
complicated work rules.
<P>
	When I see the GTA coming out with figures that tell us that 
for every month during the summer a thousand railway cars or a 
thousand hopper cars were put into sidings and then taken out 
empty, I am beginning to wonder who is really looking after the 
system and how qualified they are to run that system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7800"> 7800 </A></B>
<P>
	When the committee made the recommendation to do away 
with the grain transportation agency that was one of the wisest 
recommendations that committee has probably ever made, and it 
has been followed up on.
<P>
	The survival of the rail industry is critical to Canada, the 
minister continued, but it cannot be a survival at any cost. The 
industry must reinvent itself. How can the industry reinvent 
itself when we have had increased technology over the last 30 
years that never has been really used or has had any effect on 
increasing the efficiency of this transportation system?
<P>
	How can this railway system reinvent itself when it costs the 
railways $6,000 to $7,000 more in just fuel taxes from Toronto 
to Vancouver than it would take for the same distance in the 
United States? The government needs these funds and I do not 
think it is willing to sacrifice them to become more efficient in 
the rail system. It will have to take place somehow.
<P>
	What the minister means by reinventing the system is not very 
clear to me. That is one place where we need transparency. I do 
not think we can run hopper cars without wheels and make them 
more efficient.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to stress, and it was a very 
important point that the minister brought forward, is that rail has 
more than 200 separate kinds of actions or decisions that must 
be approved by the National Transportation Agency. Why are 
those regulations there? Why has government allowed them to 
be put in place. It was mostly through lobbying of provincial 
governments, special interest groups and not by farmers I can 
guarantee that.
<P>
	He goes on to say on the following page, and it is almost 
unbelievable that one would know about these things and not do 
anything, that in Canada the approval process for conveyance 
can take up to six months. In the United States approvals are 
granted in a few days.
<P>
	I think the minister and the government do know what is 
happening in the transportation system and they do know what 
the answers or the solutions are, but the political will has not 
been shown. It amazes me when I see some of the provinces 
leading the way in some of this reregulation or deregulation of 
the transportation system.
<P>
	Manitoba and Nova Scotia have already taken off some of the 
property taxes and fuel taxes to the railways to help the system 
become more efficient and productive. Why can the federal 
government not make simple legislation in this House to help 
along some of the provincial initiatives?
<P>
	Regarding the port of Churchill, when we read about the 
fumbling and the bungling of the issue of Churchill it always 
amazes me why there is a port there at all. Here we have a salt 
water port that would be the envy of the world and every 
government since the 1970s has either tried to destroy it or 
somehow put it in a light indicating that it is not effective or 
efficient.
<P>
	I hope my input into this question is encouraging this 
government somewhat to take some action. Inaction is 
definitely there and transparency can be taken as clear or 
unclear.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my hon. colleague's speech. With some of the 
negotiation currently going on between CN and CP there is a 
possibility that CP may well take over some of CN's track 
system in the maritimes.
<P>
	This may be a little thing but there is one thing that bothers me 
and I wonder if the member could comment. CP changed its logo 
some time ago and it shows the Canadian flag sort of unfurling 
and becoming the American flag. I find that very offensive.
<P>
	In view of the fact that so many Canadians have subsidized 
and paid for the rail tracking system in the maritimes and east of 
Winnipeg, I wonder if the member could comment on the 
appropriateness of having that logo shown over the track system 
that Canadian taxpayers paid for.
<P>
	Second, the member talked about infrastructure and the 
concern for roads in his area. I suggest that the infrastructure 
spending program and projects, although not directly related to 
this debate, are selected by the municipality. Therefore, I do not 
think it is a very fair comment by the member to criticize the 
federal government. He should really be talking to the municipal 
politicians.
<P>
	Third and most important, I listened to the previous member 
from the Reform Party talk about privatization and I hear this 
member's concerns about rail abandonment. These seem to be in 
conflict.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could explain the abandonment of rail 
lines in his riding where it is not economically viable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I can answer all 
the questions because I do not know if I can keep track of them.
<P>
	I think the first one had to do with the logo. If I were to put a 
logo on the CPR, I would call it the sleepy R. I think that would 
appeal to every farmer in western Canada. I think it is only 
because of a lack of scrutiny by the previous government that the 
Western Grain Transportation Act was implemented which gave 
the railways almost a licence to print money. By having those 
huge subsidies they were able to expand into the U.S. which they 
would not have been able to do with some ordinary 
transportation policy.
<P>
	When it comes to criticizing the infrastructure program, I just 
want to ask the member why the ministers on the Liberal side or 
the people involved with the infrastructure program under the 
human resources development portfolio seem to get twice the 
money for their constituencies than any other constituency. This 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7801"> 7801 </A></B>
<P>
holds true in Nova Scotia and also in Manitoba. I think  that 
should be looked at very closely as well as where that 
infrastucture money has gone.
<P>
	With regard to abandoning rail lines, the member knows the 
railway is the most efficient way to move products. A lot of 
these rail lines could probably be repaired instead of abandoned.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by Members 
pursuant to Standing Order 31.

lack of representation of the many fine Canadian artists from 
western Canada, in particular Saskatchewan.
<P>
	One would think that the only western artist since the dawn of

is prominently displayed in the gallery with more than one piece 
of art.

	Great artists such as Kereluk rate only one or two 
representations on the walls of the gallery. Other talented artists 
such as Allan Sapp, Ernest Lindner, William Perehudoff, 
Dorothy Knowles, Rita Cowley and many other artists 
recognized across Canada and some around the world do not 
even rate one.

the issue of whether or not family benefits should be extended to 
same sex relationships under the Charter of Rights and

<P>
	While the Supreme Court is yet to render a decision on this 
case, it is important to remember that all such matters should be 
decided by Parliament and not the courts. It is inappropriate for 
us as elected representatives to leave it to the courts to design 
social policy or for the courts to usurp parliamentary authority 
in these areas. This is a matter for Parliament to decide.
<P>
	This would ensure that the laws of this land are established 
and implemented by a democratic process and not by the 
appointed representatives of the courts. In order to ensure that

Youth Orchestra of Canada. This unique non-profit organization 
which is internationally recognized for the quality of its 
orchestral training is located in my riding of Trinity-Spadina.
<P>
	Since 1960 the National Youth Orchestra has served as a

performance and musicianship.
<P>
	Young musicians use this experience as a launching pad to 
careers with Canadian symphonies. The orchestra is composed 
of young Canadians from diverse backgrounds and geography 
coming together with a common purpose and a willingness to 
learn. By performing concerts across Canada these young 
musicians not only gain essential career training but they also 
gain greater insight into what Canada is all about.

snapshot of what this country is. I would like to take this

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
putting the axe to the ``welfare state'' the government is 
replacing it with the ``entertainment state'' as we can see from 
Team Canada's trip to Asia! Yet, taxpayers are served a lot of 
warmed-up dishes. For example, we witnessed yesterday with 
some surprise the ``re-signing'' of an agreement between 
Bombardier and Power Corporation to work in China, 
something which had already been signed in April.
<P>
	I should also mention the contract for the subway in Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia, ``announced'' with fanfare last week when it 
had, in fact, been signed at the end of September. How can the 
government take credit for it when the cars were already under 
construction at the UTDC plant, in Ontario, long before Team 
Canada's trip? The government is hopping on the train while it is 
already moving!
<P>
	Of course we are all pleased with the contracts signed in Asia 
by Canadian and Quebec companies but we denounce the fact 
that the government is trying to take credit for it, for purely 
partisan reasons. As Confucius would have said ``Travellers 
from afar can brag with impunity''.

<P>
	Those institutions have served the world well. However the 
merit of the IMF imposed discipline on borrowing governments 
is now seriously being questioned. The World Bank's mandate 
of lending to governments is obsolete.
<P>
	The direct alleviation of poverty increasingly is the job of 
private charitable organizations. Private capital flows dwarf the 
resources of the two institutions and effectively guard against 
governmental mismanagement of the economy.
<P>
	These institutions are very expensive. The recently retired 
Canadian director of the World Bank earned an effective annual 
salary in excess of $350,000.
<P>
	I urge the Government of Canada to take a tough stand on the 
future of these institutions at the next G-7 meeting in Halifax in 
March. A good case can be made that their job is done-

<P>
	Recently VIA Rail launched a promotional campaign aimed at 
getting people to take the train over the next few months. Homes 
in Saint John received an envelope in the mail from the rail 
company offering special discounts on adult fares. As well, a 25 
per cent discount was offered when travelling between 
December 15 and January 5.
<P>
	This new marketing campaign is very confusing to my 
constituents. VIA announced the termination of VIA Atlantic as 
of December 15 but announced a discount for travelling between 
December 15 and January 5. Does this make sense? How is one 
supposed to get a discount when there is no train? Apparently 
the discount was not meant for the citizens of Saint John.
<P>
	I urge the Minister of Transport to provide the citizens of 
Saint John with a dayliner so they too can take advantage of the 
great savings offered by VIA. I appeal to the minister to save our

collaborative effort that will be a cornerstone of our tourism

in its green book on social security reform the Liberal

higher education. In the same breath it proposed that the current 
generation of students would have to pay much higher tuition 
fees than their parents did.
<P>
	This is like Walmart trying to win new customers by raising 
its prices. What the Liberals are really saying is that they want to 
turn Canadian universities and colleges into Holt Renfrews with 
most students reduced to fantasizing about what it would be like 
to actually be able to afford to go to such an elite institution.
<P>
	The Liberals now like to parrot the Reform Party's slogan that 
we must cut the deficit so that we do not mortgage our children's 
future. However to ask today's students to pay dramatically 
higher tuition fees and at the same time as future taxpayers to 
pay off the debt accumulated by previous generations would 
have exactly the opposite effect.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, after rejecting Quebec's proposal to maintain the 
military role of the Collège de Saint-Jean, the federal 
government has now been approached by the new mayor of 
Saint-Jean who suggested a moratorium of three years on the 
decision to close the college.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. Since a moratorium would have the advantage of 
allowing discussions among the parties to continue, does the 
minister not think he should agree to the request made by the 
mayor of Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, there are two things we should remember. First, 
keeping the Collège de Saint-Jean open unnecessarily will cost 
taxpayers $23 million annually. This means that three years will 
cost taxpayers nearly $70 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> That is not true!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Second, we now have an agreement with the 
Government of Quebec to keep the Collège de Saint-Jean open 
as a civilian institution. That is the agreement we have now and 
the agreement we want to implement.

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows that existing facilities at 
Kingston cannot absorb an increase in the number of cadets from 
600 to 1,200, which will be the case as a result of closing the 
colleges at Saint-Jean and Victoria.
<P>
	Why does he fail to see there is much to be said for agreeing to 
the moratorium proposed by the mayor of Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, according to the plans that have already been made 
to accommodate 300 additional students in Kingston, we can use 
the barracks at CFB Kingston that are now vacant, so that the 
cost is minimal, and three years from now, we will be back to 
900 students.
<P>
	Consequently, in the circumstances it makes sense to 
concentrate students in Kingston. Since the army has been 
downsized, we no longer need three colleges, and we should now 
use all the resources available at the college in Kingston, which 
is the only one we need.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think there is a clear pattern in the federal 
government's concept of the kind of educational institution that 
should be made available to francophones in Kingston. It means 
barracks for the francophone cadets who will leave Saint-Jean 
and barracks and washrooms across the street for students at the 
Marie-Rivier school. It is a pattern we certainly do not 
appreciate.
<P>
	Before we reach the point of no return, I want to ask the 
minister whether he agrees he should show some flexibility and 
take this opportunity to declare a moratorium of at least one 
year. Does he realize that many people in Quebec and Canada

while the government is still in the process of making up its 
mind in the matter of the construction of the Magdalen Islands 
ferry, it was announced that 300 MIL Davie workers will be laid 
off on Friday. These 300 workers will join the ranks of the 200 
who were recently laid off. It should be pointed out that, in 1992, 
the shipyard employed over 3,700 workers; by Christmas, only 
400 will be left.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Transport recognize that with the 
laying-off of an additional 300 workers, it becomes urgent for 
the government to make up its mind if the last major shipyard in 
Quebec is to survive?

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr.

only one aspect to the problems facing the MIL Davie shipyard, 
that being whether or not it can acquire a contract to construct a 
ferry.
<P>
	If the member would do his homework he would realize that 
contingent upon approval of a business plan by the shareholder 
of MIL Davie and contingent upon the co-operation of the 
labour unions at MIL Davie possibly some transition contracts 
might be helpful but not necessarily so.
<P>
	To try to focus the future of MIL Davie on one contract 
demonstrates a very weak understanding of the complexity of 
the problems facing that shipyard.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, from all accounts members of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board can be divided into at least two camps: the Tory 
appointments led by the chair of the committee, Ms. Mawani, 
and the Liberal appointments headed by the minister's friend, 
Mr. Schelew.
<P>
	Documents have been leaked; confidential conversations 
have been released; and the Privacy Act has been thrown out the 
window. All this turmoil at the IRB is the result of an 
appointment system rife with patronage and political infighting.
<P>
	My question is for the minister. Will the minister now admit 
that the IRB should be completely freed from political 
patronage? Will he establish a more credible process for dealing 
with immigrant and refugee applications?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our government has indeed 
made a lot of appointments with credibility, with experience and 
with integrity, to the point where the press secretary to the leader 
of the Reform Party was quoted as saying in <I>The Toronto Star</I> 
earlier this year: ``A lot of Canadians will be pleased to see this 
point on appointments is a promise from the election that has 
been kept, to make appointments on merit rather than on 
political connections''.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	The system however is far from perfect. We have suggested a 
number of reforms that are currently before the agency and 
program review process headed by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. If the Leader of the Opposition has 
further recommendations we would be pleased to hear them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us discuss one particular appointment then. The 
minister's friend, Mr. Schelew, is accused of bullying board 
members into making decisions which were against their best 
judgment. Then when an investigation is proposed he attempts 
to influence his accusers with information released by the 
minister's own department.
<P>
	Surely this is grounds for the dismissal of this particular 
appointee. Will the minister now ask for his friend's resignation, 
or does he condone this type of behaviour on behalf of his own 
appointees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are being absolutely open 
in following the process. When I received the allegations I did 
not cover them up; I did not hide. I gave them to the chair of the 
refugee board and asked her to review them appropriately.
<P>
	I am now in receipt of a report given to me by the chair 
recommending a certain course. I have requested and obtained a 
response from the deputy chair to those recommendations. 
Before the end of the week we will make a decision based on the 
facts and what is appropriate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are problems with the application of the Privacy 
Act in the minister's own office.
<P>
	Yesterday the justice minister said that he could not release 
the details of his official's advice to the minister of immigration 
on the Schelew affair because: ``It is not the practice of the 
Department of Justice to disclose publicly the advice that it 
gives to client departments''. It seems however that the 
immigration department practice is to release confidential 
advice at the drop of a hat, especially when the hat belongs to the 
minister's friend.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice: Are there two standards of 
privacy in the country; one for the protection of ministers of the 
crown and another for the protection of ordinary Canadian 
citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply reject out of hand 
the inflammatory, biased and unsubstantiated allegations that 
the member opposite has just made.
<P>
	The names were released by a justice lawyer to the lawyer of 
the deputy chair. Advice was sought from the legal branch of the 
Department of Justice. That advice was received and the action 
was in full accordance with the law.

<P>
	In 1986, the federal government asked Quebec to rationalize 
its shipyard activities. Ninety per cent of the rationalization of 
shipyards in Canada has taken place in Quebec, with 1,700 jobs 
lost when Versatile Vickers in Montreal and Marine Industries 
in Sorel closed down.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7807"> 7807 </A></B>
<P>
	Are we to interpret Ottawa's failure to act on the issue of a 
ferry for the islands as a wish to finish the job started in the 
1980s and to deliberately bring about the closing of the last great 
shipyard in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to hear from the Bloc Quebecois just 
exactly what plans the shareholder of MIL Davie has for its 
shipyards. I can tell him that I have been working both with Mr. 
Véronneau, president of MIL Davie, as well as with the previous 
government to find a solution to the problems confronting MIL 
Davie.
<P>
	They will not be solved, as I said to the previous questioner, 
by simply finding one contract to give on one day. If that were 
the solution for this company's problems they would have been 
solved long ago because there has been a series of contracts 
awarded to that company.
<P>
	The challenge for MIL Davie, as with much of the rest of the 
Canadian manufacturing sector, is to become competitive in a 
world in which manufacturing, particularly of ships, is global. 
The Canadian domestic market is not large enough to support a 
shipyard by itself and therefore they must be competitive.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	If we can address that challenge we will succeed both at MIL 
Davie and elsewhere. That is the fundamental challenge and it 
will not be simply solved by awarding a single contract.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplementary question. If we follow the minister's logic, he 
has just announced the closure of MIL Davie. My 
supplementary question is for the Minister of Transport. Are we 
to understand that the Minister of Transport has recently 
decided to transfer the question of the ferry to his colleague, the 
Minister of Industry, in an attempt to cover up his strategy of 
closing MIL Davie to the benefit of St. John Shipbuilding in his 
province?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we have been trying for several months now to explain 
to the opposition members that the situation regarding the ferry 
between the Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island must 
be worked out between Transport Canada and the operator of the 
service, who receives an annual subsidy to provide ferry 
services to those wishing to use them.
<P>
	As far as MIL Davie and the construction of a ship is 
concerned, this is related to industry, to the creation of jobs in 
Quebec. The difference between the two issues is easily 
understood. I hope that with time, possibly in a year or two, the 
distinction will become clear to my hon. colleagues from the

Yesterday passed and no action was taken apart from the release 
of the names of the accusers to Mr. Schelew.
<P>
	This minister has known about the situation since September. 
Has the minister delayed taking action for so long in order to 
give Schelew an opportunity to persuade board members to drop 
their complaints?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

not.
<P>
	I requested the deputy chair to respond to the chair's report. I 
received that response in my office late Thursday. I read the 
response only late Friday night.
<P>
	I made no such promises that any decision would be made by 
Monday. I have the report of the chair and an extensive response 
to that report. I am reflecting and taking advice carefully and 
will be making a decision by the end of the week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
confidential report made against Schelew chronicles months of 
intimidation and veiled threats, references to a friendship 
between the minister and Schelew, Schelew telling members to 
ignore lies that refugee claimants tell because ``everybody 
lies''.
<P>
	This minister has let Tory appointees like Greg Fyffe go from 
the board for no reason at all. Why has he chosen to protect 
Schelew at the expense of individual board members and the 
integrity of the entire refugee process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

facts of the matter this member prefers to politically exploit this

would finance a project with Care Canada to help the people of

how the facility fees in Alberta are different from facility fees 
elsewhere in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act states a province must provide for 
insured health services on uniform terms and conditions and on 
a basis that does not impede or preclude either directly or 
indirectly, whether by charges made to insured persons or 
otherwise, reasonable access to those services.
<P>
	Some of these clinics get public funds because the physician 
fees are paid. Therefore access is precluded or is impeded for 
certain people because they cannot afford to pay the facility 
fees.
<P>
	That is a very big concern of this government. We do not want 
a medicare system which benefits the healthy and the wealthy at 
the expense of the sick and the ordinary Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, private clinics 
everywhere in Canada operate on this principle. For instance, 
Mediclub Montreal conducts executive health exams exactly 
this way. Abortion clinics in seven provinces charge facility fees 
between $200 and $500 paid privately, the doctor's fee paid 
publicly.

	How can there be one set of rules for Alberta and another set 
of rules for everyone else? Good luck.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The United 
States' decision to no longer participate in the control of the 
arms embargo in the former Yugoslavia provoked strong 
reactions among the allies, creating division within NATO and 
member countries of the former Yugoslavia contact group. The 
NATO Council, which met in Brussels this morning, insists on 
solidarity within the alliance.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us what Canada's position is regarding 
the embargo in the former Yugoslavia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that Canada continues to 
believe that it is very important to maintain the arms embargo in 
the former Yugoslavia. The United States' decision does not 
jeopardize this effort, since other countries, particularly those 
which have troops in the area, will be able to effectively 
maintain the embargo.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
can the minister tell us if he will reconsider Canada's 
participation in the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia in the 
event that the United States stands by this decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I just told the member that the United States' 
decision does not jeopardize the arms embargo. However, 
Canada has already indicated, through the Prime Minister, that 
we would withdraw our troops if the United Nations decided to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7811"> 7811 </A></B>
<P>
lift the arms embargo, and other countries have said the same 
thing.
<P>
	France and Great Britain, which have the largest numbers of 
troops participating with us in the peacekeeping mission in the 
former Yugoslavia, have expressed the same opinion. But, for 
the moment, we think that this embargo can be maintained and 
that there can be effective controls to ensure that the United 
Nations mission is not threatened.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
weekend the justice minister again expressed his desire for the 
universal registration of firearms in Canada.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that since the introduction of 
the universal registration of hand guns in the country, the 
criminal misuse of hand guns has actually increased? Will he 
acknowledge this irony?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, but if I may say so, 
I do not believe that response leads logically to the conclusion 
there is not a good case for registering all firearms in Canada.
<P>
	May I point out that the increased use of hand guns for 
criminal purposes in recent years has for the most part first, been 
in urban centres, and second, been because of smuggled illegal 
hand guns.
<P>
	The proposal we will bring forward will deal, among other 
things, with preventing illegal firearms from coming into 
Canada. We will never do it perfectly but we can improve what 
we are doing.
<P>
	Second and very briefly on the subject of registering long 
guns, it should be borne in mind that in rural areas the fatality 
rate for firearms is higher than in urban areas and primarily 
derives from the use of long guns, not hand guns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
justice minister makes our case. The emphasis should be on 
controlling smuggling and that type of thing.
<P>
	Professor Gary Mauser of Simon Fraser University has 
released a report estimating that universal firearms registration 
in Canada will cost a minimum of half a billion dollars and could 
be as high as a billion dollars.
<P>
	Given the failure of present registration programs to stem 
crime and the disastrous fiscal situation of the country, how can 
the minister justify even considering this major new spending 
initiative?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, should the government 
commit itself to a universal registration system, the second 
thing I will do after announcing it in the House would be to mail 
to that person at Simon Fraser a copy of the analysis we have of 
cost.
<P>
	We would never undertake a registration system that cost 
anything like those amounts of money.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	In any event, if the government decides on a registration 
system it will be because our fundamental purpose is to enhance 
public safety in the country.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask about a number of 
contradictions which surround the government's position on 
grain transportation subsidies.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade says that the Crow 
benefit should go and the sooner the better. The Minister of 
Transport says he wants his department to cut the subsidy and 
last week his deputy minister said: ``As far as the Crow is 
concerned, the government has to move in some other 
direction''. Even the minister of agriculture acknowledged that 
cuts must be made but he keeps giving the public signals that he 
is the defender of the Crow in cabinet.
<P>
	My question for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is 
this. Is he defending the Crow benefit from attack? Is he 
prepared today to clear the air and let prairie farmers know that 
it is the federal government's intention to keep grain moving by 
rail by ensuring that the Crow benefit remains-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. minister of agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I dealt with that subject at some 
length in a speech I delivered last week at the annual convention 
of the United Grain Growers in Calgary. In order to save time, I 
will be happy to send the hon. member a copy of my speech.
<P>
	I will tell him what is happening at the present time. As the 
Minister of Transport and I committed some months ago, we are 
presently engaged in a final round of discussions with farmers 
and farm organizations about future reform measures affecting 
the WGTA. Indeed, later today I will have the opportunity to 
discuss that subject with the prairie ministers of agriculture. 
Over the course of the next couple of months the Minister of 
Transport and I will be canvassing all of the major farm 
organizations in the country.
<P>
	Our objective is to finalize the government's position with 
respect to the WGTA so that we might present recommendations 
to our cabinet colleagues early in the new year.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
close to 100 town hall meetings held by MPs across the country 
in the last few weeks, students have been very involved 
participants. They are interested, prepared to debate and know 
the status quo is not an option. Many of them have said to me 
that they need better school-to-work transition, better access to 
training in the workplace and fairer student loan repayment 
schemes.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Human Resources Development what 
concrete initiatives he is taking that can point to a 
post-secondary education system that will really respond to 
today's student needs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
</B><B>Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question.
<P>
	One thing I would like to point out to the hon. member and all 
members is that just today at a meeting of the 15 sector councils 
that are business-labour partnerships, I signed two new 
agreements in horticulture and tourism which will provide new 
school-to-work internships for over 1,000 students, one for 
people in rural communities and the other will concentrate on 
training for aboriginal tourism interns.
<P>
	What is important about this is that the total cost of the project 
is $18 million. The federal contribution is only $5 million which 
shows that because of the partnerships we are able to have a two 
to one arrangement. It shows that the basic thesis that we can do 
more for less and provide better training and educational 
opportunities to our young people is already coming true.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week end, the Minister of Justice declared that he intended

<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice undertake to simplify the 
regulations on the storage, display and transportation of 
firearms and to make them coherent so that ordinary people can 
finally understand and comply with them?

proposals will deal with those issues. We will make every effort 
to simplify. I well understand that the challenge we face is to 
make Canadians understand and comply with safe storage 
requirements.
<P>
	A very important inquest is going on in Quebec right now in 
which a coroner is examining, I think, a dozen deaths to find out 
the connection between the safe storage of firearms and suicide, 
among other things.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official languages, 
the report of the Special Joint Committee on Reviewing 
Canadian Foreign Policy.
<P>
	In accordance with the order of reference, our report 
addresses the changes occurring in the world today and their 
impact on Canada. We all can see that Marshall McLuhan's 
global village is becoming more and more of a reality for 
Canadians. That reality has an impact on their security, their 
jobs and their well-being. The whole world is affected. 
Therefore, Canada's foreign policy is a domestic policy and our 
domestic policy is a foreign policy.
<P>
	Some people would say these changes cause upheaval in 
interests and fundamental values and that Canadians today are 
then faced with significant challenges. Our report contains 
conclusions and recommendations on the principles and 
priorities that should guide our foreign policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7813"> 7813 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, our report suggests a new agenda for what is left of 
this decade and for the beginning of the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new agenda we propose reflects the deep rooted values 
that Canadians want to see expressed in their foreign policy and 
the need to make strategic choices. In fact selectivity and 
criteria for selection are features of the report.
<P>
	The agenda includes: reform of the major international 
institutions of global governance, such as the United Nations 
and the international financial institutions to make them more 
effective, more transparent, more representative and more 
accountable; expanding our concept of security to include 
non-military factors and a greater specialization of the armed 
forces to better support peacekeeping operations; and promoting 
a rules based multilateral trade system and a Team Canada 
approach to trade development and foreign policy in general.
<P>
	The agenda also includes: a greater emphasis on the 
promotion of Canadian culture and learning as a fundamental 
dimension of foreign policy; a strategy for managing the 
complex relationship with the United States of America, 
including better use of the multinational mechanisms; and a 
reformed foreign aid program designed to target assistance more 
effectively to meet human development priorities.
<P>
	Finally the agenda includes: strengthening foreign policy 
linkages with sustainable development and human rights; and 
continuing the democratization of Canadian foreign policy 
through dialogue and education.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the 500 witnesses who presented 
evidence to the committee during the last seven months and all 
those who sent briefs and proposals. We received approximately 
560 briefs. I would also like to thank the members of the team: 
the clerks and their personnel, the research assistants and all 
those who co-operated with us and gave us such a tremendous 
support.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	On my own behalf, I would like to pay tribute to my 
colleagues of this House and of the Senate who worked hard to 
produce what I consider to be an excellent report.
<P>
	The committee members were all struck at the commitment of 
Canadians towards the very simple principle that we should 
build a better world. This report testifies of the fact that when 
working together and in unity, Canadians can make a very 
unique contribution.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, Mr. Speaker, the committee 
asks the government to present a comprehensive response to this 
report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour today to associate myself with the tabling of the 
report of the Special Joint Committee on Reviewing Canada's 
Foreign Policy, especially the tabling of the dissenting report by 
the Bloc Quebecois members on the committee.
<P>
	Throughout the proceedings, committee members honestly 
tried to offer an innovative vision of what Canada's new foreign 
policy could be. For that, I want to thank and congratulate them 
wholeheartedly.
<P>
	I would also like to join my colleague for Ottawa-Vanier, the 
joint chairman of the committee, in thanking all those who 
contributed in one way or another to the preparation of the 
report, especially all the Canadians and Quebecers who made 
the effort to appear before the committee or send in a brief.
<P>
	However, in spite of everybody's good will, the majority 
report is based on an interpretation of the international situation 
we cannot accept. The Bloc Quebecois's dissenting report 
highlights the aberrations and the shortcomings of the majority 
report, offering alternatives which, we believe, are closer to 
what a foreign policy that would be both progressive and 
realistic should be.
<P>
	We especially fault the government for not taking into 
account such fundamental issues as nationalism, the emergence 
of new states and the recent arrival on the international scene of 
many new actors.
<P>
	We also deplore the lack of clear guidelines regarding foreign 
aid, the interference in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction, especially 
education and culture, and their impact on the international 
level.
<P>
	Finally, we find the lack of a chapter dealing specifically with 
human rights inexplicable. Moreover, we cannot endorse the 
unjustified mistrust of the majority report for our main partner, 
the United States.
<P>
	Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I bring this report to your attention, 
hoping that the government will find it highly instructive.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today on 
a question of privilege.
<P>
	I am rising with regard to the premature release of the report 
of the Special Joint Committee Reviewing Canada's Foreign 
Policy. It is my understanding that this report which has just 
been tabled has been in the hands of the media for almost one 
week. It has been the subject of extensive coverage and some 
articles even contain comments from members of the standing 
committee itself. Since this article was published in the French 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7814"> 7814 </A></B>
<P>
language press on November 10 I have been contacted by  
several members of the media asking for my comments as well.
<P>
	Citation 877(1) of Beauchesne's sixth edition states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No act done at any committee should be divulged before it has been 
reported to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``-the evidence taken by any select committee of this House and the 
documents presented to such committee and which have not been reported to 
the House, ought not to be published by any member of such committee or by 
any other person''. The publication of proceedings of committees conducted 
with closed doors or of reports of committees before they are available to 
members will, however, constitute a breach of privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, as a new member of this House I did not feel it 
would be appropriate for me to respond to the media's request 
for fear of being found guilty of contempt of this House. 
Citation 877(2) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Canada, when a question of privilege was raised concerning the 
publication of a committee report before it was presented to the House, the 
Speaker ruled that the matter could not be resolved as in the British practice 
because the motion appeared to attack the press for publishing the 
confidential document but did not attack members of the House for their 
attitude in respect of their own confidential documents, and in missing this 
point, it missed something most important with respect to the privileges of 
the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	Where I would like to draw the attention of the House is to the 
words ``did not attack members of the House for their attitude in 
respect of their own confidential documents''.
<P>
	Leaking of information seems to have become a way of life of 
this Parliament. This was evident in the case of the finance 
committee study on the GST tabled last June. At that time the 
hon. member for Willowdale rose in the House on a question of 
privilege and I refer to your ruling of June 1, 1994 on page 4702 
of <I>Hansard</I> recommending that the finance committee 
investigate the matter itself.
<P>
	I have spoken with the chairman of the committee, the hon. 
member for Ottawa-Vanier and I assure you I will be raising 
this issue at our next meeting.
<P>
	The point I want to raise today is one of personal privilege. 
My privileges as a member of Parliament were breached in the 
sense that the media and other committee members had in their 
possession a copy of the report. They were making public 
statements in the media and referring directly to the content of 
the report. In fact, I had not even seen the minority report 
submitted by the official opposition until it was tabled today.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I recognize my obligations to keep 
reports confidential until they are tabled in the House. 
Unfortunately some MPs chose not to honour this convention 
and spoke to the press.
<P>
	Through my silence and respect for the rules I am afraid I may 
have left a false impression that our party supports the 
government when we have in fact tabled a dissenting opinion. I 
believe we have come to a point where this House needs to 
establish clear and binding guidelines for MPs with respect to 
the release of confidential information. In the event that the 
rules are broken members must know that punitive measures 
will be taken.
<P>
	I would argue that this is a clear breach of my personal 
privileges and shows a clear contempt of Parliament. Therefore 
I ask that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. Should you rule that there is a 
prima facie case I would be prepared to move the appropriate 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member raises a valid point at least in respect 
of his opening remarks when he stated that the practice of this 
House has been that committee reports are confidential until 
they are tabled in the House. I believe he was also correct when 
he indicated it was a contempt of the House for any person to 
release the contents of such a report prior to its tabling in the 
House. Indeed that has been dealt with as a contempt of the 
House on past occasions.
<P>
	I may say that if the hon. member could determine the 
malefactor in this case that person could be brought before the 
House and the contempt purged in the appropriate way. That 
would be entirely appropriate. It could be done either here or in 
the committee and the committee could bring in a report and the 
matter dealt with. Having said that, I assume he does not know 
who the malefactor is and given that we are in a position where I 
do not know that we can deal with that particular contempt of the 
House in this case, or indeed in some others that have occurred 
in the course of this Parliament.
<P>
	However, the second point that his own personal privileges 
have been violated is another matter. I recognize that in 
refraining from making comments until the report was made 
public this afternoon he may have somehow found that his 
privileges have been affected. It is a matter that could be 
studied.
<P>
	I would be happy to have the matter referred to the procedure 
and House affairs committee that I have the honour to chair for 
review. We may have something useful to say on it after hearing 
what he has to say, I do not know. Whether it is a fact of 
substantial interference with his ability to carry on his work as a 
member of Parliament I am not sure.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7815"> 7815 </A></B>
<P>
	I invite Your Honour to consider the point that he has raised. If 
Your Honour finds a prima facie case, I can say that the 
committee will be happy to undertake the appropriate study 
should it come our way.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I treat all questions of privilege 
as being very serious in nature. I will indeed review all of the 
information put before me. With the permission of this House 
and after due consideration if it is necessary I will come back to

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
you are aware, last night I spoke during the Adjournment 
Proceedings. In accordance with Standing Order 37(3) on 
October 28, I informed the Speaker of my dissatisfaction with 
the answer I received from the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
about my question on his letter of intervention to the CRTC.
<P>
	Yesterday prior to 5 p.m. and in accordance with Standing 
Orders 38(3) and (4) the Deputy Speaker informed the House 
that my question would be raised during the late show; reference 
<I>Hansard</I> page 7753.
<P>
	During the late show the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of National Revenue stated, and I quote from <I>Hansard</I> 
at page 7767:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-I am not prepared to respond to the question of October 28th. I am 
prepared to respond to the question of October 24th.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Standing Order 38(5) is clear. Ministers or parliamentary 
secretaries are to respond to the matters raised by members. Not 
only did the parliamentary secretary not respond to the matter I 
raised; she admitted she was not prepared to respond and she 
apologized for not doing so.
<P>
	The matter raised in my question relates to a serious matter 
which was before the House for two weeks. I wished to clarify 
for the House during the late show issues relating to the 
incompetence of the Department of Canadian Heritage and the 
minister's letter of intervention to the CRTC. However I have 
been denied the due process of the Adjournment Proceedings.
<P>
	I am informed that there is no precedent in this regard. 
Further, I have not found one instance where the government 
ever refused to answer a question raised in the Adjournment 
Proceedings. I remind the Speaker that the Adjournment 
Proceedings have been a parliamentary procedure for 30 years.
<P>
	This is an unacceptable precedent for the government to have 
set. In order to redress this procedural breach I request a written 
response from the government to the issue I raised last night and 
ask that the response be given in the House during tonight's 
Adjournment Proceedings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member suggested in her comments that she 
was having trouble establishing the incompetence of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and for very good reason. 
That is because it is headed by a very competent minister and is 
very well administered. I will leave that part of her remarks 
aside and deal with the substance of the procedural point that I 
know she wanted to deal with in her remarks. She got 
sidetracked by these kinds of partisan comments about the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The fact is that the parliamentary secretary who was here last 
night to answer was not the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage who was unable to be present last 
evening. She found herself in a position of having been given a 
set of notes in anticipation of a question on the subject that was 
not hers to deal with and that she had to give on the spur of the 
moment. As it turned out it was the wrong set of notes for the 
wrong question. A mixup had occurred for reasons beyond her 
control.
<P>
	Accordingly she felt it inappropriate for her to attempt to 
come up with an answer to the hon. member's four-minute 
address on the issue. I may say the suggestion the hon. member 
has made, that the answer be given tonight on the late show in a 
special two-minute addition to the late show or a two-minute 
feature for the parliamentary secretary to give the answer, is one 
that is quite satisfactory as far as the government is concerned.
<P>
	I am pleased, if the House agrees it be done, that the 
two-minute address be given tonight. I realize the hon. member 
would not have her four-minute speech before it but she gave it 
last night. We will have the four minutes last night and the two 
minutes tonight and I think everybody will be happy and in fact 
pleased to agree.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It seems we have found a solution to our little 
dilemma. I hope that is acceptable to the hon. member and all 
other members of the House, and it will be so ordered.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to have the opportunity this 
afternoon to speak briefly on the motion before the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7816"> 7816 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I must admit that I was a little surprised and even amazed to 
see the motion that the Bloc Quebecois has proposed to us. On 
the one hand, the Bloc Quebecois often complains; its members 
claim to be concerned about the deficit and the debt and often 
say that we must cut unnecessary spending, we must cut what 
they call waste, a big term which is still undefined and for which 
we have never had a valid explanation.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if the Bloc Quebecois's definition of waste includes 
exceptional expenditures, which the government cannot make as 
a government. We still have to find out the answer.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	Members of the Bloc inform us that they condemn the policy 
of the government in regard to railroad. I go on record as 
profoundly disagreeing with that proposition. As a matter of fact 
I congratulate the minister for having, and I will use the 
parliamentary term, the intestinal fortitude to address some very 
important issues in the area of transport, be it rail, maritime or 
air transport.
<P>
	I never could understand, and the minister put it very 
eloquently in a speech that other members and I heard recently, 
when he said there were airports in Canada that were receiving 
two million passengers a year and getting zero dollars of subsidy 
and there were airports in Canada receiving $2 million a year in 
subsidies and getting zero passengers. There has to be 
something wrong with that system and the minister has the 
courage to address those important issues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The same applies to rail transport. In my region, Mr. Speaker, 
as you well know, we have a rail line joining Ottawa and 
Montreal, the Alexandria subdivision. Trains use that track to 
reach these two big cities. But what happened? In 1986, CN 
threatened to close the subdivision. It was uncertain whether 
trains could run between Ottawa and Montreal, and of course it 
meant the end of passenger transportation between the two cities 
since VIA Rail uses the CN track.
<P>
	Today, there is an agreement between CN and CP to maintain 
the subdivision jointly, and CN and CP trains use the track. This 
increases traffic on it, increases profitability and ensures the 
long-term survival of the line in question.
<P>
	When the news that CN wanted to close the subdivision was 
leaked in 1986, you know what happened. Alexandria Moulding, 
a company in our riding that employed about 200 people, ended 
its expansion plans. Why? Because there was no long-term 
security. Today the minister is on top of these issues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In my opinion the minister should continue in areas such as 
permitting local groups to start up short line railway operations. 
That process needs to be sped up. For instance, if CN, CP or both 
in the case of the Alexandria subdivision because it is to be 
jointly operated, need to shut down part of their operation and if 
there is a group of local businesses, municipalities or whatever 
that can keep that short line operation going, we should welcome 
it with open arms and not spend years and money arguing before 
various boards and organizations. We need to assure that 
whoever operates a short line railroad does so with all the safety 
standards involved and so on. That is guaranteed.
<P>
	The process has to be accelerated to make these kinds of 
things happen. The minister is interested in it; he needs to be 
praised. On the other hand, some provincial governments, 
particularly those of the pink persuasion, our socialist friends 
particularly in Ontario, have established what are known as 
successor rights in the area of railways.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	What have successor rights done? By the way the same thing 
has happened in Saskatchewan, and guess what kind of 
government it has. Yes, some more of those pink dinosaurs as 
well. The pink dinosaurs at the provincial level have established 
those successor rights laws in three provinces. The effect is such 
that some of the short line railway operations cannot get going 
because of successor rights.
<P>
	Here is what happens. In one case in Saskatchewan a small 
piece of rail line was handed over to a local group. That small 
piece of rail line did not need a whole variety of employees. I 
believe it had 18 employees who at that point were in 14 
different unions. Does that make sense? It does not make sense 
to me.
<P>
	Let us use the example of an even smaller short line operation 
that would only require a handful of people. Because of the 
different union contracts a short line operation could not start 
up. It would have to hire staff it did not need. In other words, the 
person operating the breaker would have to be different from the 
person on the train because there are different unions and that 
sort of thing. Therefore people would be standing there doing 
nothing while the other one does his or her operation. Does that 
protect jobs? No, not at all. Instead of having a short line we end 
up having no service at all and no service at all does not give jobs 
to anybody.
<P>
	Perhaps the people in charge of socialist regimes at the 
provincial level should remember that. If they do not they will 
not be in business very long anyway, particularly not in the 
province of Ontario. Their future is doomed about the same as 
that of the government replaced a little over a year ago by the 
excellent government we now have in power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7817"> 7817 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The members opposite are saying that the government should 
start putting in place a high-speed train system in Canada right 
away. In the past, these same members condemned the 
government for making expenditures we could not afford. I have 
a little problem with their proposals, with the logic used by the 
people opposite.
<P>
	First, there is a study under way to determine if a high-speed 
train would be viable. The people opposite ignore the findings in 
these studies, but they want a high-speed train system right 
away and blame the government for not having done so already. 
Wait a minute. Keep this idea in mind for one minute, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	We can only conclude that the members opposite want to build 
a high-speed train, even if it were not viable. Otherwise, why 
would they not wait for the results of the viability study? But no. 
They want to build it, whether or not it is viable, so that when we 
find out that it is not viable, they can rise in the House to blame 
the government for building a system that is not viable and 
wasting money. That is the logic used by the people opposite. If I 
am not mistaken, the railway expert, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, has just told us that it is viable. We 
can conclude that he is referring to a study dating back to God 
knows when. He could perhaps share it with us so that the House 
would be better informed on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are a number of other issues to be addressed. One of 
them is property taxes as they affect railroads. Property taxes in 
Canada generally cost something like 14 per cent of the 
expenditures of railway companies. That has been said by the 
Peat Marwick Stevenson and Kellogg group of consultants. In 
the United States approximately 8 per cent of municipal taxation 
is applied to railways. That is a big difference for railway 
viability. It increases the cost of operating railroads in Canada 
and makes them less competitive.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of things I know the minister is looking at. 
He needs to do that kind of work to make rail lines in Canada 
competitive.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	In the long run if we do not ensure that our railways are viable, 
that they operate properly, the alternative will be no railway at 
all. We cannot continue with a system that inflicts debt after 
debt, loss after loss on the railway companies and expect they 
will be around for a long time. That is not going to happen.
<P>
	We have to make them viable. We have to make them work 
properly and competitively so they can be around, provide 
transportation for Canadians, provide transportation for our 
goods which we export and import into Canada and provide jobs 
for those Canadians working in that very worthwhile industry, 
the railway and transportation industry.
<P>
	That is why I cannot agree with the motion proposed by our 
colleagues across the way. I condemn it and I wish the members 
across would have offered something constructive to help save 
our railway industry in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, 
I do not agree at all with the government whip, especially with 
his anti-union speech.
<P>
	The high-speed train is viable. It will link the two most 
densely populated provinces, the two largest cities, Montreal 
and Toronto. Rail transportation is going through a serious 
crisis. I agree with the motion of the Bloc Quebecois which 
condemns the government's policies concerning the railway 
system and the gradual abandonment of the services provided by 
three companies, CN, CP and VIA, especially since these 
abandonments are occurring mostly in Quebec.
<P>
	Thousands of jobs have already been lost and now employers 
want to reopen collective agreements to reconsider job security, 
fringe benefits and wages and to ask for some more concessions. 
They are acting in complicity with the government and 
especially with the Department of Transport and the companies, 
the employers. In Quebec, the rail transportation unions 
affiliated with the FTQ have joined forces and are doing a 
remarkable job.
<P>
	I just received copy of a brief on the current situation in the 
railway industry prepared by local 4334 of the CAW, the 
Canadian Auto Workers. Quebec is hard hit, because services 
are being transferred to Western Canada. Is this the kind of 
Canadian federalism you want to force on us? Yes, Quebec is the 
province most affected by this crisis in the railway industry. 
Services are being transferred, mostly towards Winnipeg.
<P>
	Would you agree to a moratorium in order to reconsider the 
situation in the railway industry, to set up a consultation 
committee made up of representatives of the governments, the 
unions and the companies to examine whatever remedial 
measures can be taken and to act before the railway system in 
Canada deteriorates further?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, three things ought to be pointed 
out. First, nothing in what I said was anti-union, quite the 
contrary. It is not anti-union to want and try to protect jobs in 
short-line railways. All claims to the contrary are false.
<P>
	Second, as for the moratorium, the hon. member is aware that 
a parliamentary task force has just started a study on the whole 
issue of rail transportation in Canada. This task force will tour 
several Canadian cities and will report to the Minister of 
Transport.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7818"> 7818 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Transport will surely table this report in the 
House of Commons. So, if the hon. member is talking about a 
consultation process, we do have one where parliamentarians 
are meeting with the industry, rail users, employees and 
employers.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there is a task force which is ably chaired by the 
hon. member for Kenora-Rainy River.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in addressing this motion today I would like to address the 
question of rationalization of the Canadian railway network, a 
matter of pressing interest to all Canadians.
<P>
	Until recently rationalization meant only one thing, 
abandonment of rail lines and the loss of direct rail service to 
those shippers who still remain on the lines.
<P>
	The rationalization options for railways and shippers have 
changed in recent years to include short lines and mergers. The 
fundamental realities, the factors which are driving railways to 
rationalize, have not changed; changing logistics patterns and 
requirements, continuing demands from shippers for reduced 
costs and improved services and competition from the trucking 
industry and U.S. railways.
<P>
	The rail share of surface transportation markets has been 
steadily declining since the 1950s when trucking began to 
emerge as a serious competitor for rail services. Railways now 
hold less than a 40 per cent share of this market.
<P>
	The direct consequence of this changing pattern of demand 
has been one of a gradual removal of those lines from the rail 
system that have seen traffic decline to the point at which the 
costs of continued operation of the lines far outweighed the 
revenues generated from the available traffic.
<P>
	The traditional process of line abandonment has always been 
a traumatic experience for both communities and shippers. As a 
result, views on the viability of lines or their future prospects 
have been strongly held and voiced. Rail line abandonments 
have predominantly occurred east of the Manitoba border over 
the past 20 years, principally as a result of the fact that much of 
the rail network in the prairies is protected from abandonment 
until the year 2000.
<P>
	However, it is also in the east that the greatest competitive 
in-roads into the railway's traffic base have been made by the 
trucking industry. I think of my own area of southwestern 
Ontario as being perhaps the best example of that fact.
<P>
	Rail traffic in western Canada is largely bulk or resource 
based and less susceptible to truck competition, while traffic in 
eastern Canada has a much higher manufactured goods 
component which is strongly truck competitive.
<P>
	In recent years intermodal traffic has come to be the highest 
traffic growth area for railways. However, intermodal traffic, 
particularly that in the shorter distance intermodal markets in 
eastern Canada, is highly truck competitive. Again I would cite 
the area of southwestern Ontario as an excellent example of that.
<P>
	While rail line abandonment may have been the traditional 
means of rationalization, it is by no means the only method by 
which class one rail carriers can streamline their systems. Other 
alternatives include selling off so-called short line railways to 
new, lower cost operators, co-production which involves the 
consolidation of traffic from the lines of two parallel railways 
on to one of the lines and abandoning or short lining the 
redundant line, or merger and acquisitions.
<P>
	Following the introductions of the Staggers Rail Act in the 
United States in 1980, American railways accelerated the 
process of rationalizing their systems. In some cases lines were 
abandoned although in many other cases rail lines were sold to 
other operators, producing explosive growth and what came to 
be known as the short line rail industry.
<P>
	The term short line is quite broad and can cover railways 
ranging in size from mere spurs to extensive regional networks. 
In general terms short line railways feed traffic to larger, usually 
class 1 railways, have a lower cost structure than larger railways 
since their labour requirements and arrangements differ 
substantially from those found on larger railways, and offer 
services which are much more responsive to local needs.
<P>
	The short line industry in the United States can be generally 
characterized as successful. The failure rate of short line 
railways is much lower than that experienced in other industries. 
This degree of success in the United States has not been lost on 
Canadian railways or potential short line operators in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately while we have had some notable successes in 
Canada a domestic short line industry has been very slow in 
developing. Although the first Canadian short line, the Central 
Western Railway, emerged in western Canada, the majority 
since that time have been in eastern Canada. Again, one needs 
cite southwestern Ontario as a leading example of that fact.
<P>
	Specifically the Goderich and Exeter railway in southern 
Ontario, some hour north of my own riding of 
London-Middlesex, is one of the premier examples of short 
line railways in Canada. Since its inception the Goderich and 
Exeter serving shippers along its line to Goderich, Ontario has 
succeeded in dramatically increasing traffic hauled by the 
railways and its revenues. The Goderich and Exeter was 
purchased from CN by a U.S. firm, Railtex, which owns some 20 
other short line railways in the United States and more recently 
in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7819"> 7819 </A></B>
<P>
	Railtex also recently purchased CN's Sydney-Truro line in 
Nova Scotia, renaming it the Cape Breton and Central Nova 
Scotia railway, and has embarked on a similar program of 
increasing traffic and revenues and generally improving the 
level of services afforded shippers.
<P>
	One of the key features of short line railways is that their cost 
structure is lower than that for class 1 railways, principally 
because short lines have fewer employees and generally more 
flexible arrangements with their employees which result in 
significantly reduced labour costs. Typically short lines employ 
about 50 per cent of the labour that a class 1 railway operating 
the same line would have.
<P>
	While one of the principal attractions of short line operations 
from the viewpoint of a potential operator has been the ability of 
short lines to structure their operations to make optional use of 
labour, several provinces have recently adopted legislation to 
ensure that labour successor rights would be preserved during 
the transfer of ownership of the rail line from federal to 
provincial jurisdiction since short lines have typically been 
formed within provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario have passed 
legislation which provides for labour successor rights when 
among other transactions ownership of rail lines passes from 
one jurisdiction to another. While B.C. has very few rail lines 
which could be considered to have short line potential and 
Saskatchewan's legislative changes are too new to assess the 
implications, several potential short line operators in my home 
province of Ontario have declined to pursue the purchase of 
short lines in this province in light of the changed situation.
<P>
	Railtex in particular was negotiating with CN for the purchase 
of five additional short lines in Ontario. When the amended 
labour legislation was passed in Ontario Railtex immediately 
dropped the lines from further consideration. For all intents and 
purposes this legislation has stalled the development of a short 
line industry in this province, sad to say.
<P>
	Despite early apprehensions and a lengthy Senate review of 
the proposal by Railtex to acquire CN's Sydney-Truro line the 
province of Nova Scotia now fully supports its short line 
industry. The second short line, the Windsor and Hantsport 
railway, recently began operations in the province after 
acquiring CP's Dominion Atlantic railway line.
<P>
	New Brunswick, having recently adopted new short line 
legislation which could represent a model for others, is close to 
seeing its first short line development with the likely purchase 
of a portion of CP's Canadian Atlantic railway by the Irving 
Group. The line which has been ordered abandoned by the 
National Transportation Agency effective January 1, 1995 will 
likely be operated by Guilford Transportation Industries and 
provide service into New Brunswick and Maine.
<P>
	Another company has recently expressed interest in acquiring 
the balance of the CP line to Sherbrooke, Quebec to add to its 
own rail network in Maine. Quebec for its part has been an 
advocate of the development of a short line industry in the 
province and has introduced legislation to support the 
development of this industry in Quebec.
<P>
	In addition to being close to selling the line near Quebec City 
to a short line operator, CN has indicated that it wishes to sell a 
considerable number of its lines in northern Quebec and the 
Gaspé to potential short line operators. It is expected that CN 
will proceed soon with these transactions. CP has also offered its 
lines between Delson, Quebec, near Montreal, and Sherbrooke 
for sale.
<P>
	What is clear is that our class 1 freight railways, CN and CP, 
not only have other alternatives than simply waiting for traffic 
on lines to decline to the point at which abandonment is the only 
possibility, but they are beginning to move more rapidly to 
spin-off short lines to potential operators while this makes good 
business sense for all partners.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	This does not mean that rail abandonment will not be an 
option since a small number of lines in the east are unlikely to be 
attractive to even a short line operator with a more advantageous 
cost structure.
<P>
	What it does mean is that rail line abandonment is much less 
likely, particularly where provincial governments are receptive 
to the development of a short line industry. While a small 
amount of trackage might end up being abandoned in any event, 
perhaps one-third of the current class one rail system, or almost 
16,000 kilometres of line, would be attractive to potential short 
line operators. The resulting class one system would then 
closely resemble the high density, low cost U.S. rail systems.
<P>
	Another alternative open to CN and CP is co-production, the 
consolidation of traffic from the lines of two parallel railways 
on to the line of one of the railways. Typically the redundant line 
would be abandoned, although there is always the possibility of 
short lining.
<P>
	A current example of co-production is the Ottawa Valley 
Railway which has received National Transportation Agency 
approval for operation on CN and CP lines from a point near the 
Ontario-Quebec border to North Bay via Ottawa. Court 
challenges to the proposal are delaying its introduction. There 
are only a limited number of areas in Canada, however, mainly 
in Ontario, where co-production could be a possibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7820"> 7820 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, railway rationalization is not only inevitable, it is 
necessary. Pressures on CN and CP to reduce their costs mean 
they must adopt innovative, non-traditional means of 
responding to market signals. The key for railways is to find 
rationalization solutions that minimize costs to carriers and 
shippers while at the same time maximizing railway 
opportunities to achieve financial viability and shipper 
opportunities to maintain or enhance their access to competitive 
rail services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks of 
my colleague opposite. I appreciated his interesting list of 
successful conveyances of short line railways to private 
companies.
<P>
	I would like to point out that before we make decisions on rail 
line abandonments with the approval of the government or the 
National Transportation Agency, a serious examination is in 
order because that kind of conveyance has negative legal and 
social consequences on employees despite all that can be said.
<P>
	That is why our party has asked for a moratorium on rail line 
abandonments. There is no overall plan to reorganize the 
railway system, and we blame the government for it. There is no 
plan on which to base decisions to approve or reject requests for 
rail line abandonments and branch line removals by CP and CN.
<P>
	We ask for a moratorium so we can examine the whole issue. 
We agree that companies may not be able to keep some lines that 
no private company can take over because they would not be 
viable. It should be pointed out, though, that the lack of viability 
is sometimes the result of extremely poor service, in which case 
we should take a look at what caused the problem in the first 
place. Is the lack of business actually the result of bad service 
that companies keep that way on purpose, to be able to ask for 
abandonment?
<P>
	That leads me to questions concerning workers. Apparently, 
certain groups in transportation companies have more privileges 
than others. I did not go through their collective agreements, but 
we should enquire about the spending structure of CN when it 
says those privileges should be reduced. For example, CN set up 
a rating centre in Montreal, and, after spending a few million 
dollars to set it up in Montreal, it decided to transfer it out west.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	This morning, my colleague, who is deputy chairman of the 
transport committee, mentioned a shocking case of exceptional 
perks granted to an executive. We should scrutinize all those 
things before we decide that there are cases of abuse, and that 
lines should be conveyed to private companies to alleviate the 
pressure of wages.
<P>
	That brings me to the broader issue of-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. When members 
choose to share their time, they have ten minutes for their 
remarks and five for questions and comments. There is very 
little time left for the hon. member to answer or comment. I urge 
the hon. member to conclude right away, if he has a conclusion, 
so that the hon. member for London-Middlesex may give his 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, since my conclusion would be too 
lengthy, I will be glad to listen to my colleague's answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I will not need much time 
to answer because frankly I did not hear a question. I heard some 
interesting comments from my colleague.
<P>
	He touched on a number of issues and I will simply highlight 
one. He spoke about rail abandonment as something he is not 
anxious to see. Let me assure him that coming from 
southwestern Ontario as I do, coming from one of the most busy 
rail parts of Ontario, coming from the long and proud railway 
family that I do, neither my colleagues nor I are anxious to see 
willy-nilly rail abandonments either.
<P>
	Unfortunately the sad fact of the matter is that there are rail 
lines in the country that make very little economic sense as they 
are currently structured. The minister is to be commended for 
seeking to rationalize the entire system because it is simply too 
expensive the way it is and common sense tells us that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the member for 
the short response. I am close to being back on schedule.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take the floor today concerning the rail system, all 
the more so because the Bloc Quebecois is able to speak today 
despite the government's efforts to exclude the official 
opposition from its study on the privatization of the CN as well 
as from major decisions concerning the rail industry. That is 
why the Bloc decided to devote an allotted day to railway 
transportation. Otherwise, the government would again have 
acted secretly.
<P>
	Today's debate is very important because of the National 
Transportation Act of 1987. As of January 1st, 1993, this act 
allows railway companies to close down as many lines as they 
wish. Of course, such abandonments must meet the National 
Transportation Agency's criteria in order to be approved, but 
these criteria are established according to accounting standards 
instead of socio-economic ones, as they should be. I will come 
back to that in a moment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7821"> 7821 </A></B>
<P>
	We are told the goal of such abandonments is to streamline the 
rail system in order to increase the companies' 
cost-effectiveness and competitiveness. However, we must 
realize that the idea of cost- effectiveness for a railway line does 
not take into account any notion of regional economic 
development. Of the utmost importance is the fact that the 
criteria applied by the government to allow the abandonments 
are very narrow-minded and reveal its lack of vision in 
transportation matters.
<P>
	The National Transportation Agency examines abandonment 
proposals according to criteria which do not take into account 
the economic benefits that can ensue from the operation of a 
railway line. According to one of these criteria, the National 
Transportation Agency orders the abandonment of non 
profitable lines, when there is no way the situation could 
improve in the future. This type of reasoning is based only on the 
railway company's cost-effectiveness and does not consider the 
socio-economic benefits that bring about regional 
development. The other criterion provides for the maintenance 
of a line that is or may become unprofitable.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The agency takes public interest into account before deciding 
whether a line should be abandoned or maintained. However, the 
law is not clear on the public interest criterion for lines that have 
no chance of becoming viable in the future. So far, in practice 
these lines are simply abandoned.
<P>
	Moreover, the agency is required to review line abandonment 
documentation only if abandonment was opposed so that, in the 
absence of opposition, lines can be abandoned without the 
agency having to justify the application. This is directly related 
to regional economic development, which is closely linked to 
the operation of these rail lines.
<P>
	By abandoning some of these lines, Canada loses economic 
benefits that exceed carriers' operating losses on these lines. It 
is imperative that the government consider the total economic 
impact of line abandonment applications, and not only the 
financial data on carriers' profits and losses.
<P>
	The Chibougamau-Chapais-Chambord railway line gives 
us a concrete example of economic spin-offs. The 
Lac-Saint-Jean rail system serves among others 16 businesses 
employing a total of 4,095 people. Abandoning rail lines with or 
without transfers to a railhead in Lac-Saint-Jean would affect 
nine businesses out of 16, which would be faced with imminent 
closure involving the loss of 2,200 jobs. This would directly 
affect three businesses, which would become unprofitable and 
face eventual closure. Only two businesses out of 16 would not 
be affected at all. This would be the concrete economic impact 
of abandoning these lines. Many people would join the already 
crowded ranks of Canada's unemployed.
<P>
	It is unacceptable for a region like mine which already has the 
highest unemployment rate in the country. Rail line 
abandonment, a kind of Trojan horse given to Quebec by the 
Liberal government, will have major consequences on the road 
system. Roads, need I remind you, are a provincial 
responsibility. Clearly, the decision to abandon lines will have a 
direct impact on provincial finances.
<P>
	Line abandonment will significantly increase road traffic, 
which will lead to major cost hikes. In some cases, new roads 
will have to be built to accommodate additional traffic. 
Maintenance costs will also rise. The life-cycle will be reduced 
in proportion to the increase in road traffic, while the risk of 
road accidents will rise.
<P>
	Who will foot the bill and suffer the consequences on the 
economic activity level in these regions? The provinces. Of 
course, the road system will deteriorate more quickly and will 
have to be maintained to ensure its safety and quality.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government should not try to contradict these 
figures. Studies prove beyond any doubt that this is exactly what 
will happen to the road system. Transferring this traffic from the 
railways to the highways will increase annual maintenance costs 
by about 30 to 40 per cent, due to the weight of traffic and the 
carrying capacity of the roads. This means additional 
maintenance costs for the transportation department of about $2 
million a year for just 800 km, which is approximately the cost 
of another 2,200 km a year.
<P>
	As for the exact number of trucks on the road, the Department 
of Transport estimated that the phasing out of rail service 
between Lac-Frontière and Vallée-Jonction since 1982 meant 
that 4,000 to 7,000 more trucks a day used highway 204 in 1989. 
In the Abitibi region, traffic on highway 117 would increase by 
360 trucks a day with the loss of rail service.
<P>
	Two other major studies were done for the Lac Saint-Jean and 
Abitibi regions, to assess the impact of abandoning rail service 
on the public purse. The first study describes various scenarios 
for abandoning rail service in the Lac Saint-Jean region. One of 
these is the complete elimination of rail service north of 
Chambord and the creation of an efficient intermodal 
end-of-line interface in Chambord. It is estimated that this 
would cost the Government of Quebec nearly $700,000 more a 
year. Although very large, this figure does not take into account 
the cost of building the roads which would be needed to increase 
the capacity of this highway system. Neither does it reflect the 
decreased life expectancy of the roads due to the increase in 
heavy vehicle traffic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7822"> 7822 </A></B>
<P>
	The second study considers the abandonment of rail service in 
Abitibi. It is estimated that total abandonment would cost the 
Government of Quebec $3.9 million more a year, even with 
additional revenue from fuel taxes and trucking licence fees 
included.
<P>
	Clearly, abandoning rail lines has a considerable impact on 
the finances of the federal and provincial governments. The 
government should therefore consider developing a 
comprehensive rail-highway policy. Decisions should be made 
in co-operation with the concerned provincial governments, 
since provinces are responsible for the road network and also 
have to bear the consequences of rail abandonment.
<P>
	Beyond the financial considerations, there is also a human 
factor which must be taken into account. Traffic increase has a 
major environmental impact, in terms of pollutant emissions 
and noise, for communities located along highways. This 
increase also raises the risks of traffic accidents. The Société de 
l'assurance automobile du Québec reports a 41 per cent increase 
in the number of people seriously injured in trucks, between 
1988 and 1989. By comparison, the number of people injured in 
privately-owned vehicles dropped 12.9 per cent over the same 
period.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Another study allows us to conclude that an increase in the 
number of trucks on the road can only result in a proportionally 
much greater increase in the number of injuries and deaths.
<P>
	According to the department's submission regarding the 
proposed construction of a railroad for the Laterrière plant of 
Alcan, trains are much safer than trucks. That document 
indicates that, while heavy road vehicles account for eight to 
nine per cent of registered vehicles, they are involved in about 
23 per cent of all accidents. In 1987, there were 1,206 accidents 
involving trucks, compared to only three involving trains, for 
every million tons transported by these two types of carriers.
<P>
	What is of more interest to us is the fact that freeways are four 
times safer than other roads for heavy vehicles. The problem is 
that there are freeways in central areas, but not in remote 
regions. These regions will be more affected by the higher risk 
of accident, on top of also being more directly affected from an 
economic point of view.
<P>
	Railway transport is very important. It will face tremendous 
challenges in the years to come; competition is fierce and our 
society is on the wane. The federal government can no longer 
afford to subsidize unprofitable lines. It must find other ways to 
keep these lines in operation, because what is at stake here is the 
development of our regions.
<P>
	Quebec does not want to see these essential railroads 
disappear and it does not want to foot the bill either. Quebec 
does not want to see its remote regions experience economic 
decline. It wants Ottawa to implement a co-ordinated transport 
policy. Quebec wants  to have a say in the decisions affecting 
railway transportation. It wants policies designed to keep 
carriers financially sound and technically advanced, while 
preserving the existing network to the greatest extent possible.
<P>
	Through the voice of the Bloc, Quebec will make sure it does 
not get taken. The consequences of the Liberal vision on railway 
transport are too dangerous for Quebec's future. This 
government should provide financial support to the 
establishment of short line railways. Indeed, Quebec does not 
want to see more of these lines disappear, since they are 
essential to its economy.
<P>
	The federal government must include the provinces in the 
decision-making process, because they are in the best position 
to take action on this issue. The government must give provinces 
every means to allow them to set up an intermodal rail-highway 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite 
has drawn a rather accurate picture of the situation in the 
regions, especially where people depend on a railway system 
and where such a system is not only a guarantee, but also a tool 
for the economic development of remote areas, like the Gaspé 
Peninsula, large regions in Northern Quebec, the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, and many more, I am sure.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member, because I heard that the 
opposition could be interested in a national integrated policy on 
transportation. If this is true, then Quebec would have to agree 
to meet with the federal government and its provincial 
counterparts to come up with a common position and a real 
transportation strategy that would include rail, road and air 
transport.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I think we need to reach a consensus, a bit like what is done in 
other countries, like the United States, and even within the 
European Economic Community. Why does the Parti 
Quebecois, the political party in office in Quebec, not ask to 
meet with us in order to draft a national policy?
<P>
	As Quebec members in particular know full well, road 
conditions in the province of Quebec are rather appalling. 
Repair costs are very high. It does entail significant expenses for 
Quebec, but if Quebec and the other provinces were to meet with 
us to elaborate a national integrated policy on transportation, I 
am convinced that we could not only guarantee the vital link 
which the rail system represents for remote areas in Quebec, but 
also maintain and reduce the expenses incurred to upgrade the 
road system in la belle province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his 
question which deserves a straightforward answer. Surely, 
Quebec is ready to sit with the other governments to discuss a 
complete and integrated policy for rail transportation as was 
done in the EEC countries  that were just mentioned. These are 
sovereign countries that agreed on a policy, contrary to Canada, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7823"> 7823 </A></B>
<P>
which has not succeeded yet to come to an agreement with the 
surrounding jurisdictions.
<P>
	Therefore, Quebec is certainly ready to take part in the 
decision making process and a sovereign Quebec will not isolate 
itself from the rest of Canada. Thus, I think it is important that 
Quebec has its say and that a consultation and discussion 
process is implemented to get a picture of rail transportation and 
to make the appropriate decisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, we hear 
nothing but demagoguery from the opposition. It says that 
everything will turn out all right provided that Quebec becomes 
an independent country. But we must still recognize the 
following in the railway situation and the jobs that it represents 
for Quebec.
<P>
	For instance, CN pays more than $500 million in salaries and 
benefits in Quebec. There are more than $300 million in 
purchases, more than $100 million in taxes, more than $100 
million in pensions and benefits. Also, we should not forget that 
CN maintains almost 8,000 jobs in Quebec and that 30 per cent 
of all CN employees are in Quebec.
<P>
	It is a fact that 68 or 70 per cent of senior executives are in the 
province of Quebec. To talk about the Constitution and tell us 
that Quebec's sovereignty is the only way for Quebec to pull 
through, particularly in rail transportation, is really giving a 
strange spin to the debate. I have asked the hon. member to 
advise his headquarters that we are ready to negotiate, to work as 
a true federation.
<P>
	I must remind the member that the Canadian federation is a 
resounding success. You should explore this issue with a little 
more thoroughness and honesty, and try to back away from 
separatist and sovereignist partisanship, which does nothing to 
help the future of CN and transportation in Canada, particularly 
in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, if anyone were to ask who is the 
greatest demagogue here, I really could not say. According to 
the facts and figures that were just quoted to us, a certain amount 
of employment is provided.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	However, what the figures do not show is how many jobs 
disappear as certain lines come up for review or are phased out. 
How many ephemeral jobs will come in the place of these jobs 
that are very well-paying? That is the question.
<P>
	As for the Canadian federation, we had a chance to see what is 
was worth during the past century. The federation is like a 
sinking ship. Just look at the deficit, the debt and the rest. I think 
Quebecers already know the answer when they consider the real 
figures, not figures that try to cover up certain facts. Jobs will be 
lost if these railway lines are abandoned, and they will be 
replaced by very ephemeral jobs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I simply want to take this 
opportunity to remind all members to address the Chair. The 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, again, we were talking about VIA 
Rail and CN. In Quebec VIA Rail provides 1,600 jobs, or 45 per 
cent of all jobs with VIA Rail. What does the opposition 
suggest? I really do not understand. They talk about a national, 
integrated transportation system, and then they tell me: If we 
have a national, integrated transportation system, we first need 
independence, in other words, sovereignty.
<P>
	Let us put this into perspective. I ask the opposition to say yes 
to the Canadian federation, yes we can work together, yes we 
want to keep the 8,000 or 10,000 jobs that depend on CN and 
VIA Rail in Quebec. After all, Montreal is the linchpin of the 
industry, and I think they will put these jobs at risk if they insist 
on pursuing a line of reasoning that does nothing to help the 
future of those employed in an industry that is so important to 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will simply comment on the last 
part of the hon. member's remarks. I have just been told that 
Montreal is the linchpin. Yes, but the linchpin is being moved 
elsewhere, as a result of cuts that were never queried, as a result 
of closing and abandoning certain lines, because when they did 
the calculations to close the lines, they added repair costs, 
although repairs were often done in other centres.
<P>
	This means that the figures we have today do not show the true 
picture. I am sorry, but once again, I have to say that Canadian 
federalism does not serve the interests of Quebecers, although 
you may think otherwise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to support what my colleague said about the 
need to renew the railway industry in this country. I agree with 
him that rail transportation is very important to Canadian 
shippers. Canada's rail system is the third largest in the world 
and railways play a significant role in supporting other sectors 
of the Canadian economy and providing jobs for thousands of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Our shippers face intense competition from global markets 
and rightly demand an efficient transportation system to help 
them flourish. Our exporters need lower freight rates to compete 
globally.
<P>
	The railways have taken several initiatives to make them 
more efficient. They are attempting to sell or abandon their 
unproductive lines. For example, CN plans to convey its lines in 
northern Quebec, very likely to short-line operators. CP is 
currently in discussions with the Irving Group about selling part 
of its network in New Brunswick.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7824"> 7824 </A></B>
<P>
	These sales would help to preserve rail access for some 
shippers and free the railways of lines on which they cannot 
become profitable. As my colleague pointed out, federal and 
provincial impediments to the creation of short lines from 
unprofitable lines of the Class I railways unfortunately exist. I 
also agree on including a review of this issue as part of our rail 
renewal effort.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The railways need to make progress on other fronts as well. 
They must continue to improve the service which they provide 
to shippers if they are to compete against truckers and U.S. 
railroads. The railways must also continue to improve their 
relationships with the trucking industry so that the whole 
transportation system can become more efficient for Canadian 
shippers.
<P>
	But the railways alone are not responsible for making this 
improvement. Labour is a key factor in determining the 
competitive position and viability of the railways. A skilled and 
dedicated workforce is essential to the successful operation of a 
railway.
<P>
	As my colleague mentioned, rail workers are among the 
highest paid in the transportation industry. Their collective 
bargaining power, based on the railways' historical importance, 
has enabled them to negotiate very generous wage rates and 
enviable job security provisions.
<P>
	However, these agreements are no longer realistic in today's 
rail operating environment. The railways demand greater 
flexibility in deploying their labour resources than the current 
collective agreements provide. Employees and unions, however, 
want to protect the jobs and benefits which they already have.
<P>
	Management and labour need to come to a common 
understanding of the current situation. The railways are 
struggling to be profitable, which makes it harder for them to 
achieve the efficiency that Canadian shippers will badly need as 
the 21st century approaches.
<P>
	All stakeholders must contribute to the rejuvenation of rail 
transport in Canada, and our government recognizes that it has a 
role to play in this regard.
<P>
	Government must create a sufficiently flexible regulatory 
framework so that the railways can maximize efficiency.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague that the current system hinders the 
railways in several respects. They must go through a long and 
arduous process to implement decisions which, in any other 
sector, could be made on a purely commercial basis.
<P>
	While recognizing the need to take into account the interests 
of shippers and the communities involved, we also should 
consider allowing the railways greater freedom to restructure 
and modernize their networks.
<P>
	Both levels of government need to look at how they might 
simplify the rules under which Canadian railways now operate 
in competition with Canadian truckers and U.S. railroads.
<P>
	Like my colleague, I think that the taxation regime is 
significantly more burdensome for Canadian railways than for 
Canadian truckers or U.S. railroads. The government should 
assess the importance of this factor in making the railways 
profitable.
<P>
	As regards the industry structure, my colleague mentioned the 
government's consideration of the unsolicited CP Rail offer for 
CN's eastern assets, as well as the government task force on CN 
commercialization.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to emphasize that government must 
examine all options for restructuring the railways, bearing in 
mind that corporate restructuring by itself will not solve all the 
problems of this sector.
<P>
	I have pointed to areas for consideration by several 
stakeholders-railways, labour and government-in the efforts 
to renew the Canadian rail sector. The regional roundtables and 
national roundtable on rail renewal, sponsored by Transport 
Canada, which my colleague discussed, will be helpful in 
providing this government with input from stakeholders on its 
efforts in this regard.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me reiterate that this government is making 
a great effort to rejuvenate rail transport, but all parties have a 
role to play. We must all come together to help ensure the 
viability of the railways, not just for their sake, but for the sake 
of the many Canadians who depend on them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate today as someone who is a great 
supporter of rail transportation and a great believer ultimately in 
high speed rail transportation, but within the context of an 
integrated transportation system in eastern Canada. I do not 
believe that ever again we will see one form of transportation 
being used at the expense of others in one part of the country or 
another.
<P>
	In rising in this way, faced with the position of members 
opposite, I would like to explain to the House some of the 
background of the government's position on this very important 
matter.
<P>
	In November 1991 the then federal Minister of Transport with 
the ministers of transport for Quebec and Ontario announced a 
joint study of the feasibility of operating a high speed train 
service in the corridor between Quebec City and Windsor, the 
busiest transportation corridor in the country.
<P>
	That study was to take between 18 and 24 months and the cost 
of $6 million was shared equally among the three governments. 
The decision to conduct the study was based on the 
recommendations of a joint Quebec-Ontario task force report 
that was released in May 1991. The task force concluded that the 
final 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7825"> 7825 </A></B>
<P>
decision on whether to proceed with a high speed rail  project 
could not be made without undertaking more detailed study.
<P>
	The current study includes traffic forecasts, routing, available 
technologies, environmental issues, funding alternatives by the 
private sector and by the various governments that are involved.
<P>
	All of these matters are key parts of making a good decision 
on whether we should proceed with high speed rail 
transportation and if and when we do, how we should proceed. If 
this project is to be successful we need all information that is 
available.
<P>
	The May 1991 report also recommended that the Government 
of Canada should be an active participant in the current study, 
and we are. The objective of the feasibility study is to 
recommend whether government should initiate and/or support 
the development of high speed passenger rail services in the 
Quebec City to Windsor corridor.
<P>
	We know, as do members opposite, that often governments are 
not the best organizations to run projects of this type. Often 
governments are not the best organizations to fund projects of 
this type. Sometimes they are, but it has to be determined. It it is 
not a straight forward decision. If the government should decide 
to do something, the government should pay for it and then run 
it. This study is designed to show what is the best mix, private 
sector-government involvement, including the involvement of 
this level of government which as I said is very interested in this 
project.
<P>
	Members opposite describe the government's current policy 
as shortsighted. In general, to me anyway, shortsighted means 
lacking in long term vision. I suggest that what we need in this 
case is long term vision, not short term expedient decisions. 
Studying the implication and impact of high speed rail in eastern 
Canada is taking the long range, proper view of the issue.
<P>
	Putting in a modern railroad system is not like cutting a 
portage through the bush. It is not something you can set off with 
an axe and do. Likely you end up at the right place. It is a matter 
of great public interest and importance that takes time and 
planning. For that we need information and proper study.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe the federal government is demonstrating its sense of 
responsibility toward Canadians by not rushing blindly into 
deciding the future of high speed rail in this particular case. It 
would be irresponsible to decide on a project of this magnitude 
without having the benefit of all the necessary information.
<P>
	The current study is the largest, the most in depth analysis of 
high speed rail ever undertaken in Canada. Over 30 consultants 
are involved. We must realize this study does not simply involve 
studying rail transportation and various options for that. The 
effects of these proposals on airlines, bus routes, trucking which 
the  member opposite was just discussing and all other modes of 
transportation have to be considered.
<P>
	My own riding of Peterborough is along this corridor. In 
Peterborough there is Trentway-Wagar which is one of the few 
large Canadian owned bus companies. We should nurture 
companies such as that in the same way we should nurture the 
Canadian trucking industry in the same way we should nurture 
the seaway along this route. The Quebec City to Windsor route is 
probably the most dense and complex transportation route in the 
world. The seaway is there. The House has received a report on 
the seaway which is having problems. We need the seaway. We 
need it in eastern Canada, we need it in western Canada.
<P>
	Members opposite were concerned about highways in 
Quebec. I am concerned about highways in Ontario. I do know 
that what we need in this corridor is the proper mix: air, bus, 
trucks and the seaway altogether. That is why this government is 
looking at the impact, the overall positive, we hope, impacts of a 
high speed rail system on all of those modes of transport, their 
effects in eastern Canada and their effects in the whole country.
<P>
	Is properly studying high speed rail for a period of time-we 
are looking ahead to 1995 and then ahead for many 
decades-inappropriate for a project so large with such wide 
implications? I would say not. I would say it is not shortsighted 
to undertake this study. We must look at the real costs and 
benefits over the long term to properly assess the feasibility of a 
multibillion dollar infrastructure project of this type.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our decision on the future of the high-speed train should not 
be based on the apparent short term benefits. The government 
has demonstrated its commitment to deficit reduction. Given the 
very high deficits, governments will want to ensure that any new 
infrastructure project will not require large amounts of public 
funds.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must look at the funds we are going to spend. We must 
look at the amounts that are involved and how those funds are 
going to be used. I repeat that the potential of a high speed rail 
service should be examined in the light of the broader context of 
the overall transportation needs of the whole of Canada.
<P>
	The present schedule of the government provides for the 
tabling of a final report of this study I have described to the three 
governments, the government of Quebec, the government of 
Ontario and the federal government early in the new year. Like 
other members on this side of the House, I look forward to that 
report just as I look forward to our having the best possible 
integrated transportation system in eastern Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to my colleague's motion on 
railway transportation in Canada. I will deal mainly with the 
passenger service and will use the Jonquière-Montreal and 
Senneterre-Montreal lines as an example.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	According to some columnists and some comments we hear, 
when we speak about passenger rail service, we could just as 
well be speaking about a mode of transportation dating back to 
the 19th century and the horse and buggy. We must recognize 
that the passenger rail service is a modern and efficient mode of 
transportation and one chosen by many countries where 
passenger service is particularly efficient. Let met just mention 
Japan, Korea, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, France and even 
the United States where the size of the territory is comparable to 
that of Canada.
<P>
	It is obvious that passenger service has its problems in 
Canada. Population density is very low here. But the rail 
infrastructure is very large in our country. It is the third or fourth 
in importance in the world. Our history was built around the 
railroad. The railway companies either in the West or from 
Quebec towards the Atlantic shaped our history. They played an 
important role.
<P>
	We could say that today Canada's rail infrastructure is quite 
satisfactory and that we are also well equipped in transportation 
facilities to serve train passengers. But there are problems. 
Some lines have difficulties. We all know that passenger service 
is highly subsidized in Canada, but we will come back to that 
item later on. We also know that the limited number of 
passengers creates a problem. Railway transportation represents 
3 per cent of all passenger transportation in Canada and 
approximately 12 per cent of all mass transportation. I am not 
denying that there are serious problems, but before I proceed 
any further I must make two things perfectly clear.
<P>
	First of all, I would like everybody to understand that rail is an 
efficient means of passenger transportation, which has a proven 
track record.
<P>
	In Canada, in 1977, the responsibility for passenger service 
was taken away from CN and CP and given to the newly-created 
VIA Rail. This was a company created by the government, 
which decided that, in Canada, passenger service would be the 
responsibility of this new company. It had no start-up capital 
and no legislative framework, as it was created by Order in 
Council. Consequently, its autonomy, power and independence 
from the government were greatly reduced. The company was 
simply to manage and market railway transportation in Canada. 
It should be pointed out that VIA Rail inherited a fleet of 
locomotives and cars which could fairly be described as 
inadequate. The system had not been upgraded. Some 
equipment was old and in need of replacement.
<P>
	However, VIA Rail got started. It was understood that the 
government would absorb VIA Rail's debts and its operating 
costs. Every year, VIA Rail receives a grant to be able to carry 
out its responsibilities. This grant amounts to around $300 
million a year, but the Department of Transport is planning to 
make cuts in the years to come. It does not augur well for VIA 
Rail's future. In the past few years, a royal commission of 
inquiry on passenger service was set up, which, by the way, cost 
$23 million. I understand that it concluded that the market 
should decide which services should be offered and that user 
fees should cover the entire cost of these services.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	In other words, a line of thought now prevails in Canada that 
views rail transportation as just another service, not even a 
public service, but a private enterprise like any other. If the 
operation does not break even, all it has to do is shut down 
without public authorities having any responsibility in its 
closure.
<P>
	I think that we are facing a crisis. The regions, my region of 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, and Abitibi as well, owe their 
development in part to the railway. One might say that our 
attachment is purely motivated by nostalgia, but it is not so. We 
believe that, combined with other means of transportation, 
railway service can become efficient and cost-effective in 
Canada.
<P>
	Take the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region for example. We 
have a passenger line connecting Jonquière to Montreal. There 
are problems, goodwill problems, although the number of train 
users has increased substantially these past few years. There are 
problems because the train is a little bit like a hidden public 
transit.
<P>
	First of all, there are only three departures from Jonquière 
every week. This means that, in order to travel by train, you 
must have time on your hands or control your own schedule. The 
timetable is not particularly accommodating. Transfers pose 
serious problems. Take me for example. If I want to come to 
Ottawa on the train, I cannot get here in one day. I have to stop in 
Montreal overnight and take the train for Ottawa the next day.
<P>
	Travel time needs to be reviewed. The actual transit time 
between Jonquière and Montreal is about eight hours. That is a 
long time and it could be made much shorter. There is room for 
improvement, given the applicable speed charts and the fact that 
priority could be given to passenger trains over freight trains, 
unlike at present.
<P>
	Some technical problems also need to be resolved. I am 
thinking about ticket reservations. There is no terminal where 
reservations can be made in Jonquière. Every time you go to buy 
a ticket, the clerk has to phone Montreal. You could not find a 
better way to kill the reservation system. As for advertising, 
there is none. I never saw in my region advertising on passenger 
rail service fares or schedules. There are major problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7827"> 7827 </A></B>
<P>
	This could be greatly improved. Last summer, my colleague, 
the hon. member for Champlain, submitted to the Minister of 
Transport a brief pointing out that several municipalities 
between Jonquière and Montreal and between Montreal and 
Senneterre do not have bus service. Rail is in effect the only 
means of public transportation for some communities with a 
significant population.
<P>
	I am thinking in particular of the line between La Tuque and 
Senneterre, of communities like Weymontachie where 570 
people live, of Casey with its 250 inhabitants, of Parent with a 
population of 815. People living along this line need rail service 
to travel to major centres and go about their business.
<P>
	In some countries, passenger rail service is an efficient and 
sometimes viable means of transportation, of which we in 
Canada do not seem aware. The example I gave you involving 
the Jonquière-Montreal line clearly shows that nothing has been 
done to improve services. Nothing has been done to show people 
that this is an efficient means of transportation.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, before closing, because I want to give my 
colleagues an opportunity to address the House on this subject, I 
want to say that Canada, instead of easily putting aside a means 
of public transportation by raising the issue of viability and 
invoking some profit-oriented rules, should look a little further 
afield and realize, for example, that rail service can save energy 
and ensure a good quality of life for passengers. It is often much 
more pleasant to travel by train than to be packed like sardines at 
the back of a bus.
<P>
	There are also savings in terms of physical space used, since 
the alternative to passenger trains is the bus and particularly the 
automobile. Based on what has occurred in recent years and 
what is anticipated in the future, the number of cars will increase 
tremendously. This means that more roads, and more space, will 
be required. There will also be a lot of traffic on these roads. 
This will create a rather major safety problem. If the number of 
cars continues to increase, we will also have to build costly 
infrastructures.
<P>
	If, instead of merely taking a short-term approach, we 
integrate the railway system to other modes of public 
transportation and to motor vehicle transport, we can have a 
modern system which will take into account the needs of the 
public as well as the costs involved. I do not challenge the fact 
that we must reduce as much as possible the costs of railway 
transport and infrastructures, but we have to realize that a 
government subsidy to the railway sector will probably mean, in 
the long term, fewer roads to build and increased safety which, 
in turn, will translate into fewer automobile accidents. This 
aspect should not be overlooked.
<P>
	Some say that cuts must be made in the passenger train service 
because it is not profitable, but let us not overlook the costs of 
highway transport in terms of infrastructures, pollution, 
environmental impact and space required for the construction of 
roads. Every aspect should be taken into consideration.
<P>
	I hope that today's debate will make Liberal officials aware of 
their responsibility and that they will realize that railway 
transportation must not be overlooked when examining the issue 
of passenger transport in Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened over the last little while to members 
of the Bloc speaking on their position. There are several things 
that seem to be fairly common throughout what they are saying.
<P>
	First of all they are still looking for the government to pour 
more money in the form of grants and subsidies into the 
province of Quebec. This is to help with the continuation of rail 
service, a service which across the country is having a 
tremendous problem trying to break even.
<P>
	We have listened while the Bloc on a number of occasions has 
promoted a rapid rail line from Quebec into Ontario. To date 
there is no substantive evidence whatsoever that this rapid rail 
line is financially viable. As a matter of fact any statistics I have 
seen have pointed to just the opposite. It is strictly a money 
losing proposition.
<P>
	Surely the Bloc can recognize the financial position and the 
crisis Canada is in. I really wonder how members of that party 
can stand here day after day and request that the government in 
fact borrow more money to plough into the province of Quebec 
for infrastructure and services. It just does not make sense from 
a purely logical point of view that members of the Bloc actually 
think this money is growing on trees and that they have 
somehow been deprived for the last 20 or 30 years. In fact, 
Quebec has been operating at a transfer payment deficit for 
many years. The funds have not exactly been withheld from the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Now I get to my last point. In addition to all this and the fact 
that the Bloc has requested over and over again that more funds 
be poured into the province of Quebec for infrastructure and 
services, this is the same party whose goal in this House is to 
facilitate the separation of Quebec from Canada.
<P>
	Of all the illogical notions I have ever heard in my life, they 
have the audacity to stand here and ask for more and more 
money to be poured into the province of Quebec, when at the 
same time they are trying to separate from Canada. For goodness 
sake, where is the logic in what they are saying? Will they get 
their stories straight? It just defies logic to sit here and listen to 
them.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7828"> 7828 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not about pouring money into 
Quebec but about pouring money into railway transportation in 
Canada, because we believe it is an efficient way to transport 
passengers and freight.
<P>
	The hon. member takes the accountant's perspective and talks 
about viability, but we suppose we look at Canada the same way 
and ask whether Canada is a viable proposition? Every day our 
Reform Party colleagues tell us that the debt is increasing and 
that we are on the verge of bankruptcy, and in that case, since 
Canada is not viable, why not close it? I say this tongue in cheek, 
and the hon. member knows perfectly well it is not that simple.
<P>
	A country is supposed to provide certain public services to its 
citizens, including education, hospitals, roads and the army, and 
it has to raise taxes and allow for a minimum of administration, 
all of which, if considered from a very short-term perspective, 
could be said to be unprofitable. For instance, is the hospital in 
Jonquière profitable? I have the impression it costs a lot more 
than what people pay for the care they get.
<P>
	So one option would be to privatize. But if we privatize 
hospitals, schools, roads, the army, prisons, and so forth, we will 
get to the point that we privatize the government, and there will 
be no more government, no more country and no more State.
<P>
	I think we should carefully consider all the consequences. We 
should also look at history, and we will realize that since time 
immemorial, public services have been subsidized by the State, 
and that is why the State exists, so it can provide this public 
service, and we believe that in Canada, transportation, including 
highway transportation and railway transportation, which is a 
part of all this, is also a public service and that citizens, 
considering the taxes they pay, have a right to expect 
satisfactory service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the members of the 
Bloc just do not get the truth of this whole thing. Canada is 
almost flat broke, if not already there. We have a $535 billion 
debt. We are operating $40 billion in the hole a year. There is no 
money for increasing services. The only way that can possibly 
be done at this stage is to increase taxes. Quite frankly, this is 
not a viable option. The Canadian people and Canadian 
businesses are taxed to death. They cannot take any more tax 
hits.
<P>
	If we do not get our finances under control, if we do not get 
our deficit under control, if we do not start attacking the debt, 
Canada is going to hit the wall. All these services, the 
transportation services, hospital services, the infrastructure that 
the Bloc members are talking about are simply going to be gone, 
period.
<P>
	This is a time when Canada has to clearly distinguish its wants 
from its needs. What we need is what we can afford to pay for; 
what we want is not what we can afford to pay for. The Bloc is 
talking about wants. The wants side of the thing should not even 
be on the agenda today, considering our financial position.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, when you look at a country, you may 
look at its debt, but you must also consider its assets. Is Canada 
worth more than our present debt of $500 billion? If it is not 
worth more than that, obviously, we are going to disappear. But 
if you look at what Canada is really worth, with all its assets, its 
production, its natural resources, its people, if you add it all up 
and compare it to the debt, I believe that the difference is quite 
significant. My colleague will agree that to look at the debt 
without looking at the assets, is a bit short of good accounting 
practices.
<P>
	With this, I will conclude, Mr. Speaker, that you must look at 
the assets instead of looking only at the debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague for his 
excellent analysis and especially for having explained to the 
Reformers, who simply do not understand anything, that there is 
a difference between an asset and an expense.
<P>
	When you have a productive asset, which will remain 
productive in the long term if you keep investing in it, in an area 
in development at the international level, like a railway system, 
anyone can understand that one day it will make the country 
richer. In other words it is possible to increase the wealth of a 
country and control spending by developing assets.
<P>
	If we listened to the members of the Reform Party, with whom 
I work every day in the finance committee, we would empty nine 
tenths of Canada to fill the remaining tenth, because nothing is 
viable in their opinion. If nothing is viable, I wonder why they 
remain a federalist party. The country has to be dismantled. If 
they do not believe in the country as it is, why do they stay in 
politics? Are they here to improve the situation or to be 
accomplices to a systematic demolition? When it is not the 
railway system which is under attack, it is social programs. They 
started with unemployment insurance, then post-secondary 
education and health. If that is politics for them, hats off!

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> A brief comment from the 
hon. member for Jonquière.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7829"> 7829 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, really, my hon. colleague summed it 
up very well. A country is much more than a bank account, much 
more than an accounting report. That is what we want to do in 
Quebec and we hope to be able to do it soon. At that time, we will 
show the Reform Party that it can work, even with people like us 
who sound like daydreamers, because there comes a time when 
if you cannot dream, you die, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
people may want to destroy the country, but it would be too easy 
to destroy the railway system in Canada at the same time.
<P>
	Canadians were led to believe that Canadian National is an 
inefficient company that does not meet the needs of the people. 
After a bit of research, we would come to realize that CN is 
subject to Canadian legislation which prevents it from being 
competitive and from selling shares. When it needs capital, CN 
must ask banks or individuals for a loan, contrary to Canadian 
Pacific, which can sell shares under these circumstances.
<P>
	But even without a level playing field, Canadian National was 
able to make some very important decisions. The company was 
criticized for building a tunnel which shortens the trip from 
Montreal to Chicago by 12 hours. First in line to criticize CN 
were its competitors.
<P>
	Nowadays, it is easy to rise in the House of Commons and say: 
``We are against any measure taken to save Canadian National, 
only because we are against it''. We must realize that the time 
when Crown corporations in difficulty could get cartloads full of 
money is over. We now have to be efficient and innovative. We 
already know that Canadian National can easily compete with 
Canadian Pacific. I am even convinced that it can do better than 
CP.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another important point is that while CN has been investing 
large amounts in its infrastructure, CP has not been doing this. It 
is normal, faced with the challenge of having to invest in its 
infrastructure, that it would want to repeat history and say to 
government: ``Sell us this company for a dollar. We assure you 
that if you let us take over this crown corporation for a dollar 
you will not lose any more money''. Well those days are over. 
CN is a valuable company in spite of the pressures put on it by 
government. It is an efficient company. Its employees are the 
best in North America. They have indicated their interest in 
making CN work.
<P>
	The Capreol Save Our Rail Committee has been formed in my 
riding of Nickel Belt. The northern route has been faced with the 
challenges that CP initially wanted to merge with CN. This is 
something that is almost an impossibility when we think of two 
competitors that have not been very good friends in the last 
many years.
<P>
	The next option was to purchase CN for a song and a dance in 
the same way that the Quebec City transit system was purchased 
by a very prominent Canadian, and a fellow Sudburian I should 
mention. The story was I am told: ``Sell it to me for a dollar and 
you will never lose a cent again''.
<P>
	I am an Air Canada retiree. I was a victim of privatization. I 
am now the best spokesman for Air Canada that one will find and 
it does not have to pay me to do it. I saw that company grow from 
a company that was harnessed and handcuffed by federal 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I was working at Air Canada, we had a suggestion 
program for employees. If a suggestion led to savings, we got 10 
per cent. We had very good ideas as employees. The sad thing is 
that each time we had a good idea to make the company 
profitable, we were told that Canadian legislation does not allow 
Crown corporations to do these kinds of things.
<P>
	So how can such a company compete on the international 
market? We know now that our competitors are not here in 
Canada but around the world. Global competition requires that 
CN be able to compete on an equal footing with CP, its 
competitor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have mounted a campaign in my riding with the assistance 
of the Capreol Save Our Rail Committee. This campaign will 
grow. Our message is that we are giving Canadians facts about 
the situation of CN. It is not an inefficient company. It is a good 
company and its employees are excellent. It is performing well 
and is presently making a profit in spite of government 
legislation.
<P>
	I would like us to remember that the airline industry 
underwent exactly what is happening now in the rail industry. 
Let us not forget that CP Air was purchased by a smaller 
company named Pacific Western. At that time it wanted to 
merge with Air Canada and then it wanted to purchase Air 
Canada. It is history repeating itself.
<P>
	What was the message of Canadians? The message was that 
we need competition in this country. We cannot have just one 
airline or one railroad because the shippers will be forced to pay 
the fees required of them.
<P>
	Our message to Canadians from the Capreol Save Our Rail 
Committee is: Privatize CN. The employees are signing cards 
indicating their willingness to participate in such a move. They 
want to do this because they know that as long as CN is a crown 
corporation other companies will want to take advantage of its 
good position. The best people who are in a position to take 
advantage of the good position of CN are the employees. 
Therefore, we are pushing for an employee led privatization of 
CN much like Air Canada did.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think it is important to mention that Air Canada expects at 
least to break even and probably to make a profit. And the 
privatization of Air Canada took place during a recession. While 
other corporations were closing in Canada, Air Canada 
succeeded in becoming the great company it is today and, this 
year, it expects to break even or perhaps even to make a profit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If Air Canada was able to do this during a recession, I am 
convinced that CN can do it in an economic upswing. I 
encourage all Canadians to show their interest in participating in 
an employee led privatization of CN.
<P>
	I am not going to dwell on the past as my colleagues from the 
Bloc Quebecois are doing. I will not go over all the injustices 
they speak of. I may indulge a bit by saying that the repair shop 
in Capreol, a modern facility producing more efficiently than 
Joffre, was closed down in favour of the shop in Joffre, Quebec. 
As good Canadians we did not spend all our time crying. We sat 
down and tried to find ways of saving these facilities. We have 
not given up. The employees of these facilities are signing up. It 
is not a firm commitment to purchase shares in CN, but it is an 
indication of their willingness.
<P>
	I urge Canadians, members of the opposition, all members of 
this House to seriously consider the benefits of privatizing CN.
<P>
	As a former employee of Air Canada and as a retiree I know 
the pride and dignity employees develop in a company when, as 
in my case, you work for them for 25 years. In the case of the 
people of Capreol it was for three generations. When you speak 
of pride to a grandfather about how it was when he was on the 
railroad, he asks his grandson or granddaughter what it is like 
today. The pride you develop in a company is something you 
have to live. It is too easy to say that you worked for a company 
for a number of years and you either leave with a good package 
and love the company or leave with a lousy package and 
remember it forever with animosity.
<P>
	In the case of Air Canada it used to belong to CN.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The employees of Air Canada and Canadian National are 
proud people. They are the ones who built the company. One 
criticism I would make of Canadian National is that if Canadians 
have come to think that CN is inefficient, that it loses money and 
makes bad decisions and if my research leads me to conclude 
that the decisions made by this company are good decisions that 
have allowed it to become profitable right after a recession, it 
must mean that the status quo cannot be maintained at CN.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Things must change. Governments have to sit back and try to 
understand and face up to what it is that a government offers its 
population. We struggle to offer our population the social 
services, assistance to the needy, care for the sick, food for 
people who are hungry, while putting millions of dollars into a 
company that can do better on its own. It is time Canadians faced 
reality. We do not print the money any more. Times are hard, but 
we are coming out of them.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The rail system forms part of our national strategy on the 
movement of goods and people. If the railroads have been 
inefficient in the transportation of people it is because of 
government legislation. Let us get those laws off their backs and 
allow them to compete through modern legislation face to face.
<P>
	The competition will no longer be only between CP and CN. 
CP and CN must find partners. They must have the same tools to 
work with because their competition is south of the border. The 
competition is in the trucking industry. Indications are that the 
trucking industry can no longer maintain its past system of 
movement of goods. Our roads cannot handle it. Canadians 
realize they are subsidizing the roads in the same way we 
subsidized the railroads in the past.
<P>
	It is difficult for that truck driver driving at four o'clock in the 
morning realizing he has $200,000 debt on the rig behind him. I 
am a firm believer that if we plan correctly we can develop a 
viable system for the railroads in co-ordination and 
co-operation with the trucking industry. It is reasonable as 
Canadians to expect that everyone should participate and 
everyone should become a winner. The transportation of goods 
in Canada should be a partnership between the railroads and the 
trucking industry.
<P>
	As I conclude I would like to repeat my previous comment. 
The Capreol Save Our Rail Committee has been working 
diligently. A few months ago its members were faced with the 
prospect of losing their jobs. This community is a wonderful 
town. I was at its Santa Claus parade last Saturday. You should 
see the closeness and the unity in that town.
<P>
	In the same breath CP says: ``We will offer you a dollar for 
your company and you will never lose a cent again, but one thing 
we will do the first day we own that portion of CN is we will 
close the northern line''. We are not taking the attitude that we 
will bring government to its knees or we will bring CN to its 
knees. We are addressing this issue in a different, modern, 
Canadian, Liberal fashion. We are meeting and working 
together. We have opponents but we sit with them. We get to 
know them and we learn to work together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7831"> 7831 </A></B>
<P>
	We will offer a solution to Canadians. We will maintain the 
transcontinental line coast to coast at least on CN. We will ask 
that there be legislation assuring that the transcontinental line 
will be maintained. I know that is the desire of CN if it should be 
privatized. By maintaining this line and CP if it can manage to 
do it would be better for all Canadians.
<P>
	We could compete until we learn to complement one another 
in a transportation system that will be the envy not only of the 
rest of North America but of the world. Competitors could learn 
to complement one another instead of competing with each other 
and we could develop a system in co-operation with the trucking 
industry. Imagine that system which would be envied by all.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: In 
accordance with the agreement reached earlier today the House 
will first hear the response from the government to the question 
of the hon. member for Calgary Southeast concerning the CRTC 
which can be found on page 7766 of Hansard of Monday, 
November 14, 1994; the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Justice.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before beginning my speech, I want to inform you 
that it will only be 10 minutes long, to allow my colleague from 
Argenteuil to speak.
<P>
	The motion put forward today by the Official Opposition asks 
this House to condemn the government's lack of action and 
transparency with respect to the proposed restructuring of 
Canada's rail system, and especially its lack of vision with 
respect to high-speed trains.
<P>
	We cannot help but conclude that the government is dragging 
its feet badly, as far as the high-speed train is concerned, so 
much so that we have to wonder whether it is not just watching 
the trains go by.
<P>
	At a time when the government is concerned with meeting the 
challenge of the information highway, it is neglecting to meet 
the high-speed train challenge, a train which would give 
Canadians and Quebecers access to a modern, efficient and 
economical transportation system.
<P>
	The high-speed train is a true revolution in the area of surface 
transportation. It is in some ways a revolution as significant as 
that of the information highway. The Europeans have 
understood that. While the French, the German and the Swedish 
have all opted for the high-speed train, the Canadian 
government has yet to move with the times. Introduction of a 
high-speed train service in the Windsor-Quebec City corridor 
would provide an ultra-rapid means of transportation to some 
10 million people.
<P>
	Fifteen million trips a year require an efficient means of 
transportation. At the dawn of the third millennium, Canada and 
Quebec must develop a means of transport for the future. The 
HST technology is the necessary and logical solution.
<P>
	Initially developed in France, this technology is characterized 
by its profitability, its security, its convenience, its comfort and, 
above all, its speed performances. Based on a revolutionary 
technological concept, environmentally safe, the HST causes 
less noise pollution and greatly reduces energy consumption. 
With its successful performance, it has won a large share of the 
European market for medium and long-distance travel. By 
reaching commercial speeds of 300 km/h, it has become a very 
competitive means of transport compared with more traditional 
ones. The HST is faster, more comfortable, safer and more 
economical than cars. It stands in sharp distinction to air 
transport because it channels the movement of people over the 
entire territory. It helps to make downtown areas more 
accessible. Using existent rail lines, it enters the heart of cities.
<P>
	The HST technology combines three essential conditions for 
the success of modern means of transport: connectedness, 
connectivity and nodality. Given these features, an HST for the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor is not a project which should stay on 
the shelf, but a necessity.
<P>
	Rémi Bujold, the president of one of the consulting firms 
which worked on the HST project, said that this project would be 
profitable if it captured 40 per cent of the market for the 
Toronto-Montreal corridor, which now accounts for only 13 per 
cent of all transport needs.
<P>
	As my colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup said last May, the 
cost-effectiveness of that system rests on its efficiency: ``It can 
link Quebec and Montreal in 85 minutes, Montreal and Ottawa 
in 45 minutes and Toronto and Montreal in 140 minutes, at 50 
per cent of the cost of a plane ticket. That is a real dream''.
<P>
	Given the inaction of the government, my colleague was 
wondering if Ottawa was not more concerned with defending the 
interests of the airline lobby than it was willing to participate in 
a job creating project, one very innovative project from a 
technological point of view and one which would be a driving 
force for the economy of our own businesses.
<P>
	The HST has the support of many groups and public and 
private organizations in Canada and in Quebec. The Bombardier 
multinational, an unquestionable leader in the area of 
transportation, is ready to meet the challenge here in our 
country. That corporation, founded in Quebec, is very 
successful in selling its know-how, its technology and its 
products all over the world. Team Canada just got back from its 
tour and the federal government takes pride in the success and 
the accomplishments of our businesses abroad. But what does it 
do to encourage their development here in Canada  and in 
Quebec? 
<P>

<P>
The Prime Minister is going nowhere and evidently his 
government is marking time.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Several studies have shown that the HST would create 
approximately 127,000 work-years of employment. During the 
construction, with the technological and economical spin-offs 
of such a project, nearly 40,000 additional work-years would be 
created in various sectors. The management and maintenance of 
the network would create another 1,200 permanent jobs. The 
costs of funds for the HST project in the Quebec-Windsor 
corridor are estimated at approximately $7.5 billion over a 
ten-year period. The private sector would assume 70 per cent of 
start-up costs, while the remaining costs would be shared by the 
governments of Quebec, Ontario and Canada.
<P>
	On April 26, Marc LeFrançois, president of the board of 
directors of VIA Rail, made an eloquent speech in support of 
this project. According to Mr. LeFrançois, the survival of 
passenger railway services in Canada will depend on the 
high-speed train project. According to the president of VIA 
Rail, the United States is an accessible market worth many 
billions of dollars. The high-speed train would give our 
businesses broad access to the North American market, where 
the high-speed concept has yet to make its mark.
<P>
	At a time when draconian budget cutbacks have put what is 
left of Canada's and Quebec's railway industry at risk, at a time 
when our major railway companies are becoming less and less 
viable and thousands of workers in this sector are losing their 
jobs, I think it is high time the government showed some 
political and economic leadership by supporting a project that 
would stimulate and generate employment. The government 
should realize that this project is not only possible but 
necessary. As the government keeps pouring millions and 
millions of dollars into the Hibernia project, whose technology 
is not very exportable and, from the looks of it, not very 
profitable and unlikely to generate as many economic spin-offs 
as the high-speed train project, is it surprising that people get 
upset about the Liberal government's failure to act?
<P>
	The government cannot afford to hesitate any longer. History 
has shown that Canada's present geopolitical entity was shaped 
by the railway that connected the Atlantic to the Pacific. This 
episode in Canada's history goes back more than a century. 
Considering the deterioration of Canada's railway network, a 
legacy of the negligence of many successive governments in 
Ottawa, one wonders what the Fathers of Confederation would 
have had to say. They would undoubtedly condemn this 
government's apathy. The government must make a decision 
now about the high-speed train, to prevent inertia from turning 
into inept policy making. The high-speed train project must be 
kept on track. Otherwise, the Fathers of Confederation would 
never forgive them.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened again with some bewilderment to the 
comments of the member of the Bloc and there are a few points I 
would like to make.
<P>
	She says that the government has been foot dragging on the 
high speed rail issue. Quite frankly, given the statistics, given 
the financial prospect, the viability of high speed rail in the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor if I were having to pay the bill believe 
me I would be foot dragging as well. I would not want to get into 
it.
<P>
	The member talked about the success of high speed rail in 
European countries. For many years the high speed rail system 
in Europe has been heavily subsidized by the governments 
where the trains operate.
<P>
	This country cannot afford to get into more subsidization of 
crown corporations or transportation systems. We are 
subsidized to death. We have VIA Rail being subsidized with 
hundreds of millions of dollars. It is interesting that the 
chairman of VIA Rail, a person who is operating a company at a 
huge loss every year, absolutely dependent on government 
subsidies to keep his company afloat, is now advocating and 
promoting a high speed rail system.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	At least if we had some sort of track record with the company 
he operates, his support would at least be somewhat credible. 
The hon. member has talked about the economic factor of high 
speed rail. There is no financial data that support the fact that a 
high speed rail system in Canada, in the Quebec-Windsor 
corridor, could even begin to be financially viable without 
continued heavy subsidization from the government.
<P>
	I would like to talk about one other thing. Where are the 
customers going to come from? Let us say that they did start to 
attract a lot of customers. Someone in the transportation 
industry is going to suffer. Is it going to be the airlines? Are we 
asking the airlines to lose more customers who would travel on 
trains?
<P>
	Statistics and studies have shown that the Canadian people 
have a tremendous love for their automobiles. We are not going 
to change this love for the automobile that the Canadian people 
have simply by putting a high speed rail system in. They are not 
going to overwhelmingly start getting out of their cars and 
flocking to a high speed rail system overnight.
<P>
	If this government were to enter into this thing it would be 
like going to the store to buy a new television set when you have 
no food in the cupboard. That is the state of the economy. That is 
the state of this financial house in Canada. We cannot afford to 
even think of a high speed rail system at this time.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral: </B>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to make a 
definite promise but unfortunately I will not be able to keep it 
since, of course, I will not be sitting in this Parliament long 
enough. However, I can promise you that the day a train will link 
Montreal to Ottawa in 45 minutes, I will be delighted to take it 
with all the others who will want to come to Ottawa.
<P>
	A high-speed train in the Quebec City-Windsor corridor will 
naturally be used by people who live along that corridor. Now, 
that area has a population of ten million people, industrial areas 
and many industries. That project will create almost 130 000 
jobs. It is no small matter. People who work pay income tax 
instead of receiving unemployment insurance; so this is actually 
something fundamental and if the government waits too long to 
act, I agree that some interests have to be protected, namely 
those of air carriers.
<P>
	When a country is in such financial difficulties as Canada, we 
obviously have to make the choices that are the most 
advantageous from an economic point of view. When a mode of 
transportation costs 50 per cent less than transport by air, I think 
that option deserves to be considered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will simply make an announcement. On May 23, 
Canadian Pacific Ltd. filed a request with the National 
Transportation Agency to abandon the 
Saint-Augustin-Mirabel-Thurso line.
<P>
	The hon. member for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, André 
Riendeau from the riding of Argenteuil, Paul-André David from 
the riding of Papineau, and myself, have prepared a submission. 
This document was presented to the National Transportation 
Agency of July 27, 1994. We requested public hearings and a 
five-year moratorium.
<P>
	This is a rare occasion! We got the public hearing we 
requested, which will be held on November 22. Thank you.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., it is my 
duty to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order

	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act to authorize the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee to review the operations of the 
Communications Security Establishment (CSE).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to commence debate on a 
motion that I regard as important. Hopefully it will prove to be 
important to Canadians in the years to come if it is adopted by 
the House. The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act to authorize the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee to review the operations of the 
Communications Security Establishment (CSE).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From here on in I will refer to the Communications Security 
Establishment as CSE; the acronym is a lot easier to say.
<P>
	The motion that CSE be reviewed is not a one-shot deal. It is 
intended that the monitoring continue on an ongoing basis just 
as the Security Intelligence Review Committee now reviews the 
operations of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	The Communications Security Establishment, CSE, was born 
in signals interception and code breaking developments during 
World War II. It was established in 1941 as the examination unit 
of the National Research Council. For the first part of its 
existence the examination unit was given particular 
responsibility for intercepting and analysing the 
communications of the Vichy government in France and the 
government in Germany.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7837"> 7837 </A></B>
<P>
	It is estimated that by 1944 there were about 45 employees in 
the examination unit among whom were some very specialized 
people capable of thinking and communicating in what we call 
ciphers and codes.
<P>
	In April 1975 control and supervision of the Communications 
Security Establishment was transferred by an order in council 
under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer Duties 
Act from the National Research Council to the Department of 
National Defence.
<P>
	The CSE was officially acknowledged finally by the Canadian 
government, as I understand it for the first time, when on 
September 22, 1983 the Hon. Jean-Luc Pepin, then Minister of 
State for External Relations, stated in the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Communications Security Establishment advises on, and provides the 
means of ensuring the security of federal government communications. It 
also provides, with the support of the Canadian Forces Supplementary Radio 
System, a service of signals intelligence in support of Canada's foreign and 
defence policies. I should explain that ``signals intelligence'' is the term 
given to information gathered about foreign countries by intercepting and 
studying their radio, radar and other electronic transmissions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What about the budget of CSE? How much money does it 
spend? Actually we in Parliament who authorize expenditures 
for all government spending do not know because we have never 
been told. The question has been asked but it has never been 
answered.
<P>
	However in 1991 it was estimated by a journalist who was 
well schooled on the issue-he did a lot of research and 
published a series of articles in the Toronto <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>-that the budget in 1991 was about $100 million to $125 
million and that CSE employed about 800 persons.
<P>
	As an aside here, what I know as a member of Parliament on 
the subject has come from a journalist. It has not come from 
questioning in parliamentary committees or in the House. We 
cannot find out here. In order to find this out I had to buy a copy 
of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. That should say something about the 
process.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	What does CSE do in its functions? We should look at that a 
little more closely but not too closely. CSE has a two-part 
mandate: first, the collection of signals intelligence on the 
diplomatic, military, economic, security and commercial 
activities, the intentions and capabilities of foreign 
governments, individuals and corporations. Second, it consults 
on the security of the communications of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	We are led to believe that it is good at both tasks. The first part 
of the mandate is the signals intelligence program, the gathering 
of signals and their analysis, decoding analysis and analysis of 
the data. CSE with the support of the Canadian forces 
supplementary radio system collects, studies and reports on 
foreign radio, foreign radar, and other foreign electronic signals  
emissions to provide foreign intelligence to our government. As 
we will see later, some intelligence data can be and are shared 
from time to time with other governments.
<P>
	CSE maintains signals interception facilities in several 
locations around the world. It uses a set of sophisticated 
technologies to decode and interpret. It uses leading edge 
induction technologies that permit it to read what is on a 
computer screen from a remote location. It uses voice 
recognition technologies and key word technologies which, with 
the assistance of sophisticated computers, are able to analyse 
and retrieve data on subjects and persons.
<P>
	Presumably it intercepts signals to and from locations all over 
the world. At least it has the ability to do so. One would presume 
that it is capable of and does intercept signals sent from Canada 
to other parts of the world and from other parts of the world to 
Canada.
<P>
	I do not read through that list to alarm anyone. It should not be 
a surprise to any member. These technologies and these 
functions are routinely used by most industrial countries in their 
gathering of foreign intelligence. I wanted to put on record that 
these technologies are out there and we are using them in foreign 
intelligence gathering functions.
<P>
	What is the chain of command for CSE? Who is in charge? 
Who does it report to? I guess it is a bit of a puzzle but 
fortunately CSE through its executive and the government has 
been fairly forthright on that issue. It has done it over the last 
few years. It has not hidden it at all.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence is accountable to 
Parliament for the spending of CSE. The minister approves 
CSE's major capital expenditures, its annual multi-year 
operation plan, and with the cabinet committee on security and 
intelligence the major CSE initiatives with significant policy or 
legal implications.
<P>
	The chief of CSE is accountable to the Minister of National 
Defence for financial and administrative matters but to the 
deputy clerk of security and intelligence in the Privy Council 
office for policy and operational matters. There is a two-headed 
management structure in place here. One is the Department of 
National Defence through the minister and the other is the Privy 
Council office, the head of which is the clerk and the political 
head of which is the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I would note as well that the major client of CSE is the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, being 
the major consumer of foreign intelligence data. In addition we 
are told in Parliament that arrangements have been put in place 
to ensure that CSE responds to the government's foreign 
intelligence requirements in a manner that is lawful, effective 
and sensitive to changes in international relationships.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7838"> 7838 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I would note as well that CSE and its administrative head in 
the PCO have appeared co-operatively before the national 
security subcommittee in Parliament. That occurred at the end 
of the last Parliament. The amount of information conveyed was 
a lot less than members had hoped for, but we believe a 
relationship was established at that time.
<P>
	In terms of communication security, the second part of its 
mandate, CSE is responsible for developing standards on 
electronic communications security for the approval of the 
Treasury Board, advising on the application of those security 
policies, and providing cryptographic material and 
documentation to appropriate government institutions. That is 
the coding exercise which prevents unauthorized parties from 
listening to or understanding intragovernment communications.
<P>
	Also it works with international agreements in the 
communications and electronic security and signals intelligence 
programs and approves the release of classified or controlled 
communications security information and assets to government 
and non-government entities.
<P>
	It reports to Treasury Board, when requested, on 
communications security. In fact members of Parliament rely on 
CSE expertise in protecting the security of our own internal 
communications in and around Parliament.
<P>
	CSE provides a research, development and evaluation 
capability on security aspects of computer hardware, software 
and communications systems to ensure information is available 
to the government on the security of its computer systems and 
use in government.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade is the major client but there are other clients 
of CSE signals intelligence data. They include the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service and other government departments with an interest in 
security matters. All those exchanges of information are done by 
a tasking mechanism governed by memoranda of understanding, 
or so we are told.
<P>
	Through the department of foreign affairs CSE exchanges 
signals intelligence data with foreign governments again 
through memoranda of understanding. We have never been told 
with whom. We can only guess.
<P>
	CSE is a full partner in the U.K.-U.S.A. agreement which 
structures electronic signals intelligence sharing among the 
United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada and more 
recently New Zealand. Again memoranda of understanding are 
said to be in place.
<P>
	There are two questions. One is on the efficacy of CSE's 
spending and the other is on the potential impact of what CSE 
does on the rights and liberties of Canadians, given the 
extensive and intrusive powers of CSE.
<P>
	Four years ago members of Parliament completed a five-year 
review of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act. That 
five-year review, after five years of operation, reported to the 
House in a report called ``In flux but not in crisis''. I read one 
excerpt from it that is most relevant:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While the Committee found no evidence of abuse by other agencies, it 
believes that a number of other collection agencies have a substantial 
capacity to infringe on the rights and freedoms of Canadians. The capacity of 
the Communications Security Establishment is a case in point. This 
organization clearly has the capacity to invade the privacy of Canadians in a 
variety of ways. It was established by Order in Council, not by statute, and to 
all intents and purposes is unaccountable. As such, the committee believes 
that the Communications Security Establishment should have a statutory 
mandate that provides for the review and oversight mechanisms for the 
agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The recommendation of the committee, which I point out was 
supported by all parties in the House of Commons, was that 
Parliament formally establish the CSE by statute, and second, 
establish the Security Intelligence Review Committee as the 
body responsible for monitoring, reviewing and reporting to 
Parliament on the activities of CSE concerning its compliance 
with the laws of Canada.
<P>
	There was not an effective response to this from the 
government. In fact of the 117 recommendations in that 
unanimous report of members of Parliament I believe the 
government gave a favourable response to one. Someone once 
suggested it was one and a half, but it was not a meaningful 
reply, to say the least.
<P>
	What is this proposal? Why do I reiterate the recommendation 
and proposal of that five year CSIS review?
<P>
	Let us look at what SIRC does. SIRC does two principal 
things. It deals with appeals by individuals regarding 
complaints they have in relation to security clearance 
procedures and requests for security clearance. That comes from 
individuals in all departments of government. It is multi-agency 
in scope.
<P>
	Second and most important is that SIRC reviews the work of 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service for compliance with 
the statutory mandate of CSIS and the policies that are 
articulated thereunder, and for compliance with the laws of 
Canada. It also looks from time to time at the issue of 
management efficacy within CSIS.
<P>
	SIRC, the Security Intelligence Review Committee, has 
access to all persons and documents within CSIS for the purpose 
of carrying out its role. It does it on behalf of Parliament and it 
reports to Parliament. I and others believe that SIRC is capable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7839"> 7839 </A></B>
<P>
of fulfilling the same  function for CSE with only a marginal 
increase in expenditure.
<P>
	We believe, and I am firmly supportive of this, that if 
Parliament adopted this motion, if the government implemented 
it, it would be a cost effective adoption of the concept of review 
and oversight already adopted by Parliament and working 
reasonably satisfactorily.
<P>
	I want to read something from the McDonald commission, 
which is starting to look awfully long in the tooth but is still 
quoted extensively in these areas. The August 1981 second 
report of the McDonald commission indicates there is a serious 
moral issue involved in the way government deals with security 
intelligence matters.
<P>
	I see my time is running short so I will not read all of it but I 
certainly want to incorporate that reference in my remarks here 
today.
<P>
	I am not saying that the CSE is out there breaking laws now. It 
tells us it is not. However, it does have the means to invade the 
communications privacy of Canadians in ways beyond the 
comprehension of most of us.
<P>
	Why wait for a scandal, why wait for an embarrassment, why 
wait for someone to make a mistake inadvertently, or 
advertently within CSE? Let us develop now a mechanism 
which will cause CSE to know that it is accountable to 
Canadians through Parliament and through the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. Then the universe can unfold. 
Everyone will know what the rules are. Everyone within CSE 
will know who the players are and what the program is.
<P>
	I want to point out that SIRC reports that CSIS is already 
routinely making use of CSE shared data and denoting that in the 
CSIS data base. Therefore SIRC clearly has an interest in this.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	I quote a former chairman of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee, Mr. Ron Atkey. ``We are not looking for a new, 
additional assignment. We have plenty to do. However, we 
cannot fail sometimes to observe the absence of review 
mechanisms in other parts of the intelligence system''. He was 
speaking specifically about CSE.
<P>
	As I wrap this up, I realize that Parliament will have an 
opportunity to continue to debate this issue for a period beyond 
today and that the matter should come to a vote in due course.
<P>
	I ask all members to consider carefully my remarks and the 
remarks of other colleagues, and to make a reasoned decision 
about this when we are called on to adopt this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
allow me to first congratulate the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River, who also happens to be chairman of 
the Sub-committee on National Security, on presenting motion 
M-38 to the House.
<P>
	Who could be in a better position to present such a motion 
than the chairman of the Sub-committee on National Security! I 
believe that this is tangible proof that we need better control. I 
support the motion presented by the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River, subject to some reservations I will 
explain and a few changes I will suggest.
<P>
	When talking about an agency such as CSE, the 
Communications Security Establishment, it is good to give a 
brief historical background. My colleague for 
Scarborough-Rouge River went back to 1941, but I would like 
to review, if I may, the legal instruments which, during the 
post-war era, produced this institution as we know it today.
<P>
	CSE first started as a unit of the National Research Council, 
under Order in Council 54-3535 dated April 13, 1946. CSE was 
the successor to the civilian and military intelligence services 
which, during the war, had worked in co-operation with similar 
British and American services.
<P>
	On April 1, 1975, responsibility for this communications unit 
of the National Research Council passed to the Department of 
National Defence. CSE's mandate was never officially defined 
by a statutory instrument, but it is generally understood that its 
mandate should be limited, by the Privy Council, to Canada's 
external security.
<P>
	While we are entitled to expect that CSE's activities are 
targeting communications from or to foreign countries, or 
relating to foreign embassies, or any communications involving 
at least one foreigner, recent and serious allegations lead us to 
believe that CSE may have intercepted, without any legal 
mandate, with or even without ministerial authority, 
conversations and communications between Canadians, in 
Canada, and that it may even have eavesdropped on leaders of 
the Quebec sovereignist movement who are operating legally 
and legitimately.
<P>
	Since CSE is accountable only to the Privy Council, its 
executives and its agents may have become somewhat too lax. 
Therefore, it seems imperative for the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, commonly known as SIRC, to review the 
operations of CSE, while, of course, maintaining the authority 
of Parliament and of the Sub-committee on National Security 
over CSE's activities.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7840"> 7840 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	However, like Ceasar's wife the SIRC must be above 
suspicion but, unfortunately, this not the case at the present 
time. This review committee is made up of five members. Three 
were appointed on the recommendation of the party which 
governed during the 34th Parliament, the Conservative Party. 
These three appointees are Mr. Jacques Courtois, Mr. Edwin 
Goodman and Mr. George Vari.
<P>
	There are, therefore, more Conservative members in this 
committee than in this House. We can see, already, that the 
Official Opposition is not represented on the committee, and 
this is not acceptable.
<P>
	Another member is Mrs. Rosemary Brown, Chair of the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission. She is working full time for 
that organization and we did not have a chance to meet her when 
the SIRC appeared before the Sub-committee on National 
Security. Mrs. Brown was appointed on the recommendation of 
the New Democratic Party which was then the third party in the 
House, but has now lost its party status.
<P>
	Finally, the last member is Mr. Michel Robert, whose 
qualifications we will not contest. Our only questions are: Could 
Mr. Robert be slightly over-worked, since on top of being a 
member of the SIRC he is also working, at the government's 
request, on a settlement in Oka? On the one hand he must work 
with ministers of the Crown, and on the other he must 
investigate the activities of the Canadian Intelligence Security 
Service. Maybe he should drop one job and concentrate on the 
one he is best suited for.
<P>
	But in order to have a watchdog, a review committee, a 
renewed SIRC instead of the ``circus'' we have at present, it is 
imperative that the current members of the committee resign so 
that new appointments can be made that better reflect the 35th 
Parliament. This way, three appointments could be made by the 
government on the recommendation of a minister of the Crown, 
in all likelihood a Liberal, one on the recommendation of the 
Official Opposition and one more on that of the third party, that 
is to say the Reform Party of Canada. This would be an example 
of democracy in action, since the SIRC, like the Senate, 
remained unchanged after the election.
<P>
	So, I do support the motion before us, but at the condition that 
new members be appointed to the SIRC, especially since the 
current members systematically refused, when testifying before 
the national security committee on September 13, to answer 
questions put to them by the committee on behalf of the House 
of Commons which is supreme in that respect.
<P>
	How could we trust any longer individuals who refuse to 
co-operate with the elected representatives of the people and 
hide behind an overly finicky interpretation of Section 54 of the 
National Security Act to say that they account to the minister 
and nobody else? I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but as long as the 
members of the SIRC  will claim to be accountable only to the 
minister, there will be a serious credibility problem with the 
very institution of Parliament as well as with the House of 
Commons, as a component of the Parliament of Canada. The 
SIRC members must be replaced with individuals who 
understand that, until the contrary be proved, in this country, the 
lawful, fundamental and primary authority rests with the 
representatives elected by the people to sit in this House.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	I will conclude with the following amendment proposal: I 
move, seconded by my colleague from Berthier-Montcalm:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding after the words ``Establishment 
(CSE)'' the following: ``and to table an annual report in the House on the 
aforementioned activities''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the amendment in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak to the 
motion put forth by the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River.
<P>
	The question today is not whether this House should support 
this motion but rather why has it taken so long to be considered. 
More than 10 years ago Parliament passed legislation ensuring 
that the activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
were reviewed by an independent body.
<P>
	Nobody on the government side of this House would suggest 
that CSIS should not have an oversight body. Yet a few weeks 
ago ministers tried to convince this House and all Canadians that 
the Communications Security Establishment did not require a 
review body. In response to a number of questions put to her by 
the official opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister used the 
following response over and over again: ``The CSE has no 
mandate to spy on Canadians''.
<P>
	This response is interesting for a couple of reasons. First, the 
Deputy Prime Minister was not asked about the mandate of the 
CSE. She was asked if it ever spied on Canadians. She refused to 
answer that question, opting instead to refer to the mandate of 
the CSE. Let us look at the mandate of the CSE. Actually, I 
would love to look at the mandate of the CSE but I cannot. It 
does not appear to have one, certainly not by statute.
<P>
	In September 1990 the special committee on the review of the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act and the Security 
Offences Act tabled its report entitled ``In Flux, But Not in 
Crisis''. On page 153 of this report there is the following 
passage on the CSE:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7841"> 7841 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This organization clearly has the capacity to invade the privacy of 
Canadians in a variety of ways. It was established by order in council, not by 
statute, and to all intents and purposes is unaccountable. While the committee 
understands that this agency must be shrouded in secrecy to some degree, it 
believes that Canadians should be in a position to understand what the 
organization does and should not have to wonder whether their rights and 
freedoms have been infringed. The committee has evidence that both the 
RCMP and the service have asked the CSE for assistance and as such, the 
committee believes that the Communications Security Establishment should 
have a statutory mandate that provides for review and oversight mechanisms 
for the agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here we have an all party committee of the last Parliament 
calling for an oversight and review of the CSE. It is not 
surprising that one of the members of that special committee 
was the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River. He 
recognized then that there was a need for accountability and he 
continues to call for that accountability. Unfortunately his call 
has not been heard by members of his own party who sit in 
cabinet.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence believes there is already 
sufficient review of the CSE.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	In response to a question from the official opposition on 
October 24 the minister made the following comments: ``With 
respect to the CSE in particular, it is a fully constituted part of 
the Department of National Defence. The Communications 
Security Establishment reports to the Minister of National 
Defence who is a member of cabinet and who answers to this 
House of Commons''.
<P>
	The minister believes he has firm control of the CSE and that 
his being held accountable in the House is sufficient. Perhaps 
the minister should review the contents of the government's 
response to the special committee report ``In Flux'' entitled: 
``On Course: National Security for the 1990s''. On pages 54 and 
55 of this report the following statement is made: ``CSE is under 
the control and supervision of the Department of National 
Defence''. This is totally consistent with the comments of the 
current Minister of National Defence. ``The chief of CSE is 
accountable to the deputy minister of national defence for 
financial and administrative matters and to the deputy clerk, 
security intelligence, and counsel, in the Privy Council Office 
for policy and operational matters''.
<P>
	Does this sound like a fully constituted part of the Department 
of National Defence like the minister suggests? He only has 
control of CSE's finances and administration. He does not have 
control of CSE's policies or operations. How can he be 
accountable?
<P>
	Actually there is another interesting comment in ``On 
Course''. The previous government stated that it had been 
considering providing the Minister of National Defence with 
some additional capacities for review of the CSE. This 
statement would suggest that even the  minister did not have 
complete authority to review the operations of the CSE. If the 
CSE does not have to answer to the minister, who is it 
accountable to?
<P>
	That is why we are addressing this motion today. In this day 
and age Canadians will not accept comments from a minister 
that everything is okay, trust me. There has to be some form of 
external review.
<P>
	It is well known that I am not a big supporter of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. I feel like my official 
opposition members that there are some real problems with the 
appointment to SIRC but I do feel it is a logical body and is in 
place to perform this review.
<P>
	Canadians recently got their first significant look at the CSE 
with the release of the book <I>Spyworld</I>. It was written by a former 
employee of the CSE and provides Canadians with a glimpse of 
one portion of that organization.
<P>
	When it was released <I>Spyworld</I> created a minor sensation with 
some of its accusations that the CSE had been used to spy on 
Margaret Trudeau, on some of Margaret Thatcher's cabinet 
ministers and on René Lévesque.
<P>
	These incidents are peripheral events in the book. Barely any 
script is used to describe those incidents. However, they did 
emphasize the need for external review for the CSE.
<P>
	It did not appear that anybody was up in arms with the main 
thrust of the book which was that Canada intercepts 
communications for intelligence purposes. It was only a few 
questionable incidents that caused the furore. While electronic 
eavesdropping may be offensive to some, it is a fact of life in 
today's electronic information highway.
<P>
	Is our government outraged at the prospect of other countries 
intercepting our government communications?-no. Instead it 
has taken measures to combat it. Offices are electronically 
swept and phones are encrypted. It is part of today's reality. 
Similarly, no one is overly concerned that Canada may be doing 
the same thing to others.
<P>
	As ``In Flux'' states, this organization clearly has the capacity 
to invade the privacy of Canadians in a variety of ways. This is 
confirmed in the book <I>Spyworld</I> when the author states that 
when CSE employees were testing or tuning their equipment 
they routinely listened to the conversations of Canadians. It is 
that capacity that has to be monitored to ensure that it is not 
abused.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	The best way to ensure that there are no abuses is to open the 
operations of the CSE to external review. I therefore call upon 
all members of this House to support this motion put forth by the 
hon. member from Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7842"> 7842 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was very pleased to second the motion put forward by my 
colleague and neighbour from Scarborough-Rouge River. I did 
so because I believe that as always my colleague has approached 
this matter from a clear, analytical, legal point of view, has 
investigated the situation to his satisfaction and has proposed a 
solution that he believes and I believe to be reasonable.
<P>
	What I want to do in the 10 minutes that I have is just take a 
look quickly at the nature of the motion, why I support it and 
what the problems are that I see. If this motion were to pass it 
would send a signal to the government that the Communications 
Security Establishment should be under the watchful eye, if I 
can put it that way, of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee which is a civilian review committee made up of 
privy councillors. Their current job is to keep a watchful eye on 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	In order to make some sense of this, we have to know what we 
are talking about. What is the Communications Security 
Establishment? It sounds like a very laundered, nice, clean 
phrase. To me it is like a shadow. One can see a shadow if one 
knows where to look but one cannot touch it, feel it, speak to it. 
One cannot get answers from it and that is a problem. Like a 
shadow it can loom large, it can be small, it can move away. Like 
a shadow it can be there when we do not even notice it. I am not 
saying it is a problem, it is a potential problem.
<P>
	What does it do? What is the Communications Security 
Establishment? In order to know what it does, we have to look at 
something called foreign intelligence. What is foreign 
intelligence? I am quoting from the Department of the Solicitor 
General: ``Foreign intelligence refers to intelligence or 
information concerning the capabilities, intentions or activities 
of foreign states, corporations or persons. It may include 
information of a political, economic, military, scientific or 
social nature and can produce information with security 
implications''.
<P>
	From everything I know about CSE, it certainly would fit 
within that definition. It has two functions. Before I get to those 
two functions, I want to remind this House that the CSE does not 
exist alone in the world. There are comparable organizations in 
other countries and it might be interesting to let the House know 
what those organizations are so that we can see where Canada 
fits in.
<P>
	In the United States there is such an agency. It is called the 
National Security Agency. In the United Kingdom it is called the 
Government Communications Headquarters. In Australia it is 
called the Defence Signals Directorate and in New Zealand it is 
called the Government Communications Security Bureau.
<P>
	Communications is the link here but it is not communicating. 
It is listening to communications. The question whose 
communications is it listening to? Might it be our own private 
communications? We do not know.
<P>
	How did CSE come to be? How did the shadow come to exist? 
Was it an act of the Parliament of Canada?-no. It was by 
executive order, by order in council. This is a very significant 
point because it is therefore not a creature of statute and I want 
to refer to that near the end of my remarks.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	Having been created by order in council, what is its purpose? 
What does it do? Well, we are told that it has a signals 
intelligence capability sometimes known as SIGINT, that is 
offensive in nature. I guess that means it is intrusive. It listens in 
on conversations. Then there is an information or 
communications security component sometimes known as 
INFOSEC or COMSEC. These sound like codes to launch 
missiles from a site in Boulder, Colorado. INFOSEC or 
COMSEC is a defensive capability.
<P>
	We are told by Ward Elcock, who at that time was the deputy 
clerk and in charge of at least a portion of CSE, that one of the 
functions of COMSEC deals with security of communications of 
the Government of Canada. It is very important. The second 
responsibility is the collection of signals intelligence which is 
intended to provide the government with foreign intelligence on 
the diplomatic, military, economic, security and commercial 
activities, intentions and capabilities of foreign governments, 
individuals and corporations. I suppose there is nothing wrong 
with that. We want to make sure we are protected in this country.
<P>
	That is what it does, assuming anybody can understand 
INFOSEC, COMSEC, SIGINT, et cetera. Presumably the people 
who work there-the chief as he is called or perhaps it is a she 
now, we do not know-they know what it is supposed to do.
<P>
	One might say fine, we know how it was created. We know 
what it does. To whom does it report? That is a legitimate 
question. Since there is no statute one can assume it does not 
report to Parliament. Guess what? We are right. It does not 
report to Parliament. Presumably it reports to the Minister of 
National Defence. The Minister of National Defence is 
supposed to report to Parliament. The chief, who I mentioned 
before also reports to the deputy minister of National Defence 
for financial and administrative matters interestingly enough, 
and also to the deputy clerk, subtitled security and intelligence 
and counsel, in the Privy Council Office for other matters.
<P>
	What is the missing link? The people of Canada. The missing 
link is this Parliament. Is that a problem? As I see it there is a 
problem. There is no legislative mandate upon which to found 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7843"> 7843 </A></B>
<P>
the intrusive actions of this particular agency, or I should say 
potentially intrusive, on Canadians.
<P>
	There are no written rules by way of statute or regulations. 
There may be written rules that the chief from time to time 
issues or the deputy clerk, or the deputy minister, or the Minister 
of National Defence. If there are written rules in effect they are 
unknown rules, certainly unknown by the people of Canada.
<P>
	Without public scrutiny I maintain there is a credible 
argument to say there are no proper controls. After all if 
everything is done behind closed doors how can one ever know 
if the controls were properly applied? What is more important, 
there is no monitoring to ensure that laws are not being broken 
and that if laws are broken that there is some mechanism to deal 
with that. To me that is a major potential problem.
<P>
	Contrast this to our own spy agency. We do not call this a spy 
agency; we call it the Communications Security Establishment. 
However our own spy agency which we acknowledge is a spy 
agency was created under statute by this Parliament. It was 
given rules by this Parliament. It reports to a minister who then 
reports to this House yearly. It is required in effect to be 
monitored by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, 
which as I said is a civilian agency.
<P>
	I have to ask myself, if it is good enough for our spy agency 
why is it not good enough for our Communications Security 
Establishment? Indeed, this is not some flash that I had. This 
was recognized in the parliamentary committee report ``In Flux 
but not in Crisis'' that my various colleagues have talked about. 
It recommended not only as this motion does that SIRC should 
review CSE's work, but also that CSE should be formally 
created by statute.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	I certainly support both of those recommendations which 
indeed were unanimous. I cannot see any logical basis in a 
democracy not to have the Parliament of Canada through some 
committee review this agency. I am pleased therefore to support 
the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for months now the official opposition has been 
alerting the government about this national security problem. 
The opposition has questioned the government repeatedly in an 
attempt to find out who controlled whom, who ordered this or 
that job, exactly who asked for which investigation, but has 
never been given an answer.
<P>
	And yet some questions were easy to answer. We were just 
asking for the names of people who are paid out of Canadian and 
Quebec taxpayers' money, but to no avail. I personally asked, in 
all sincerity, who was controlling the spies in this country, 
specifically with regard to CSE, but never got any answer. The 
official opposition received no satisfactory answer and neither 
did millions of Quebecers and Canadians. This is clear from the 
newspapers and editorials.
<P>
	Our worries began with the disconcerting revelations about 
the illegal activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service. These were followed by the new revelations about the 
Communications Security Establishment, which only added to 
our fears and confirmed that nobody was keeping an eye on the 
spies in this country, which prides itself on being democratic 
and one of the best countries in the world.
<P>
	After weeks of waiting, what is the government offering us to 
set our minds, and those of taxpayers, at rest? Nothing. Finally, a 
government backbencher was moved to present the following 
motion: ``That, in the opinion of this House, the government 
should amend the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act to 
authorize the Security Intelligence Review Committee to review 
the operations of the Communications Security Establishment''. 
This is a very telling motion, one which confirms our concerns 
and one which, in particular, proves that the official opposition 
was right.
<P>
	First of all, the member is to be congratulated for having 
understood the official opposition's indignation on this issue. 
He is unfortunately one of the few to have understood our 
legitimate concerns, or rather he is one of the rare members of 
the present Liberal government who, upon crossing the floor, 
did not change his position on national security.
<P>
	Need I remind you that when they were in opposition, the 
Liberals demanded exactly what we have been demanding for 
months, that is, more parliamentary control over spy 
organizations in Canada? We only have to read House and 
committee minutes to see that, in their lean years, the Liberals 
were calling for more openness. The times have changed now 
that their bellies are full. True, the carelessness and lack of 
action are typical of current-day Liberals, but it is still amazing 
in this field.
<P>
	I must conclude that we will have to be satisfied with this 
motion when disclosures and allegations of illegal activities by 
the CSE are increasing and suspicion becomes the rule. What 
will this motion accomplish? Will this proposed amendment, if 
it is adopted, reassure taxpayers? Will the proposed amendment 
allow us to find out exactly what the Communications Security 
Establishment does and how it uses the $250 million-which is 
a very conservative estimate on my part-that this federal 
agency spends every year? This is a legitimate question we have 
a right to ask ourselves.
<P>
	My constituents in the riding of Berthier-Montcalm are 
asking themselves this very question, and for good reason. To 
find out the answers, we must look at what the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee or SIRC has done in the past.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="7844"> 7844 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Since the past is an indication of the future, it is important to 
find out how these Sherlock Holmeses of national security, these 
truth seekers, these Colombos of Canadian espionage, these 
watchdogs of House secrecy, operate.
<P>
	But, seriously, before putting an extra burden on these 
part-time defenders' frail shoulders, we must answer these 
questions. Putting the CSE under surveillance is a very good 
idea per se.
<P>
	That is why I can tell you right away that I will support this 
motion. It is the organization to which we want to give this 
monitoring authority that is the problem. It is supposed to 
reassure the elected members and taxpayers, but its chairman 
says that in this service, they never say either yes or no; you will 
agree with me that that is not so reassuring.
<P>
	As matters stand, we must answer no to the questions which I 
raised earlier. You will understand the reason for the Bloc 
Quebecois's amendment about follow-up, asking SIRC to report 
to this House, so that this House can monitor the organization 
which is supposed to monitor the CSE.
<P>
	Although the motion is acceptable to the Official Opposition 
and the law creating SIRC, although flawed, is acceptable, I still 
say to you that if I were the Solicitor General of Canada and had 
this law in my hands, you would not recognize it once it had been 
through my office, it would be changed so much. As the saying 
goes, we make do with what we got, so we must somehow 
manage with the law we have. So why does the Bloc Quebecois 
always have concerns about SIRC? What worries us?
<P>
	I think that my colleague in the Bloc Quebecois, the member 
for Bellechasse, summarized it very well in his opening speech, 
supporting the position of the Official Opposition on this 
subject. It is not the container but the contents of SIRC that must 
be changed first of all!
<P>
	The well-known Conservatives on it no longer have any 
legitimacy. They no longer have any business there. In my 
opinion, they never had any business there because SIRC should 
be non-partisan. But since the system is the way it is, let us keep 
following the rules.
<P>
	Again, as I did in the past, I ask, and I hope they are watching, 
Mr. Jacques Courtois, Mr. Edwin A. Goodman, Mr. George W. 
Vari, and even Mrs. Rosemary Brown, whose party no longer 
exists either, at least officially, to resign so that SIRC will 
reflect the democratic reality of the current Parliament.
<P>
	With a minimum of four new members and an expanded 
mandate, SIRC could fulfill its primary role of watchdog. Its 
monitoring responsibility could then be increased.
<P>
	I am anxious to see the government's position regarding this 
motion. I hope the Liberals will support it, especially since it is a 
motion tabled by a government member, a backbencher but a 
Liberal member. I hope that the Liberals will gladly support the 
motion. If it is carried in its present form, that motion will 
expand the responsibility of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee. Consequently, it is important to get things right 
from the start.
<P>
	I will end by saying that, in SIRC's 1993-94 annual report, the 
author refers to William Pitt's line to the effect that where there 
is no law, tyranny takes hold. Mr. Speaker, I might add that this 
view is based on the premise that we can trust those who are 
supposed to apply the law and especially to monitor it. Thank 
you.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93 the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under an agreement made today, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
because of a misunderstanding will answer a question put by the 
hon. member for Calgary Southeast that was not answered last 
evening.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRTC">CRTC</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last March 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage was approached in his 
constituency office by a constituent whom he had not met before 
and who he has not met since, to write a letter drawing the 
attention of the CRTC to his application for a radio licence.
<P>
	The minister explained to this constituent that as the minister 
responsible, he could not interfere with the workings of the 
CRTC but he agreed as a member of Parliament to do his best to 
ensure that he was treated fairly.
<P>
	On March 15 the minister wrote to the chairman of the CRTC 
in his capacity as the MP for this constituent, asking the 
commission to give the application a fair hearing. This was the 
letter of an MP seeking to ensure that a constituent received due 
process. The letter was not meant in any way to be an endorse-
<P>

<B><A NAME="7845"> 7845 </A></B>
<P>
ment of the licence application, nor was it intended to exert 
pressure on the CRTC.
<P>
	On March 30 the CRTC acknowledged his letter, categorizing 
it as a letter in support of the licence applicant. That 
acknowledgement letter was never brought to his attention. If it 
had been he would have immediately rectified the matter.
<P>
	As soon as he learned that one of the interested parties wrote 
to him in September regarding his ``alleged support'' for the 
licence application, he took immediate action. He wrote to the 
interested party clarifying his earlier letter and clearing up any 
misunderstanding. In this letter dated September 30 he wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My letter of March 15, 1994 to the CRTC simply asked that due 
consideration be given to the application. It is not intended to convey support 
for or opposition to the application. The CRTC is the body mandated by law 
to make independent decisions on all such applications. It is, therefore, for 
the CRTC to weigh the merits of the arguments raised by the applicants and 
the interveners.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Members will note that he took these actions before the matter 
became public. He did his best to clear up the situation, not 
because of public or media pressure which did not exist at the 
time, but because it was the right thing to do.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 25 I asked the Minister of Justice whether 
he would amend article 690 of the Criminal Code to correct 
inadequacies in that section of the code and in the process that 
that section sets out.
<P>
	This is the section of the Criminal Code which allows the 
Minister of Justice to order a new trial when a person has been 
sent to prison wrongly, unjustly, due to a mistake, due to false 
evidence, due to the fact that evidence has been hidden, and so 
on. There have been many criticisms of the article in recent 
years.
<P>
	We are all familiar with how the article has been used. It was 
used in the case of Donald Marshall who was in prison for 10 
years for a crime he did not commit. It was used by David 
Milgaard who was in prison for 23 years and found to have been 
convicted on false evidence.
<P>
	We have seen this happen in other countries too. Recently 
many of us saw the film <I>In the Name of the Father</I> about the 
Gilford four in England, the Irish people who were convicted by 
rigged evidence. It took them considerable time to have their 
case reviewed and to be released from prison. In the United 
States there is a famous case of Rubin Carter who was in prison 
for a long time and then released because it was found that there 
was a mistake.
<P>
	This is the article that gives the Minister of Justice the power 
to order a new trial when it is found that a mistake has been made 
or false evidence or hidden evidence or new evidence has been 
brought to light.
<P>
	But the criticism is that while this is in principle a very good 
process, it is inadequate in that the delays are inordinately long. 
It took a considerable period of time for Donald Marshall and 
David Milgaard to take advantage of that section. The delays 
carried on and on.
<P>
	Second, the whole process is carried on in secret and there is 
no accountability by the Minister of Justice and those who help 
him with these cases with respect to the public.
<P>
	Third, the Attorney General in these matters serves both as the 
judge on those applications and the prosecutor and consequently 
there is a bit of incompatibility.
<P>
	Finally the criteria for what will constitute sufficient new 
evidence or a mistake for release are vague and have varied from 
Ministers of Justice.
<P>
	There have been several proposals to correct this. The major 
ones recently have been put forward by an organization called 
the association in defence of the wrongly convicted. The short 
word for that organization is AIDWYC. It had a conference in 
Toronto last February where they proposed certain changes to 
article 690 to make it more acceptable to take care of those, to 
have the whole process done in a much quicker way, to have it 
more accountable, to have it more objective and so on.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Justice bring in changes to article 
690 to accomplish some of the goals that have been put to him by 
such organizations as AIDWYC?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to inform the 
hon. member that the Minister of Justice is continuing to address 
the concerns of those who have criticized the s.690 process by 
improving its procedures.
<P>
	Several steps have been taken to this effect. The minister's 
decision in the application regarding Colin Thatcher was 
published to make the public aware of how the process works 
and what principles apply to govern the use of the s.690 powers.
<P>
	The department has also published a fact sheet that describes 
the criteria for applying, who can apply, how and where to apply 
and what information applicants need to complete their 
applications.
<P>
	The published information also describes how applications 
are assessed. This information shows that a great deal of work 
goes into the assessment of an s.690 application. To do a 
conscientious and thorough job takes time. Sometimes 
applicants submit additional grounds to be considered for their 
s.690 review. When such submissions are received months or 
even years after the initial application this extends the amount 
of time needed to investigate and assess cases.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7846"> 7846 </A></B>
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member work is currently under way to 
reduce the inventory of applications and to process applications 
more swiftly.
<P>
	Those who say that the process is not independent ignore the 
fact that the vast majority of s.690 applicants were prosecuted 
by provincial attorneys general. Thus, there are very few 
instances in which the Attorney General of Canada must 
consider a case that was prosecuted by his agent. When that 
happens from outside the department counsel are retained to 
assess the application and advise the minister.
<P>
	It is the duty of those who assess the applications to examine 
them conscientiously and thoroughly as it is the minister's duty 
imposed upon him by Parliament to review the applications and 
make the necessary decisions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under Standing Order 38(5) a motion 
to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m. under Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.24 p.m.)
