Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to 
introduce this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It effectively includes Nav Canada under the Access to 
Information Act because information is no longer available to 
critics, ministers and airport managers regarding safety with 
respect to the air navigation system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to divestiture, when the air traffic control system was 
under Transport Canada, all this information was available to 
critics and airport managers to help design and ensure that 
safety regulations were in place.  Now we no longer are able to 
access internal memorandums regarding safety and operational 
condition reports written by air traffic controllers themselves, 
and engineering reports of Nav Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel we are operating at a very distinct disadvantage by not 
having access to this information like we had in the past. 
Hopefully this bill will pass and get the support of all members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
speak to Bill C-33, the endangered species act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost we have to think about what Canadians want 
when it comes to protecting species at risk.  All Canadians want 
to help the environment.  All Canadians want to protect 
biodiversity.  We in the Canadian Alliance care about protecting 
species that are at risk and protecting or recovering critical 
habitat. The Canadian Alliance plan creates the potential for 
this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians recognize that we need a proactive approach to protect 
species at risk that is based on respect, respect for the species 
that inhabit our lands and waters, and respect for those who own 
those lands.  Our plan to protect species at risk is a common 
sense policy that considers the needs of all stakeholders. Our 
plan is balanced, accommodating, practical and workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is committed to protecting and preserving 
Canada's natural environment and endangered species, and to the 
sustainable development of our abundant natural resources for use 
by current and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance maintains that for any endangered species 
legislation to be effective it must respect the fundamental 
rights of private property owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four key areas or issues regarding the bill which I think 
are important are:  compensation for landowners; recovery 
planning for specific species; the role of the Council on the 
Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada; and compliance, 
enforcement and dispute resolution. I will go into detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first area is compensation. Compensation for expropriated 
lands that is not at fair market value is not fair. The species 
at risk act we are debating today hardly touches on the pivotal 
issue of compensation.  There is no clear formula for 
compensation outlined in the bill.  Compensation will be dealt 
with through regulations following the passage of the bill, and 
we know how the regulations work.  The minister has this 
backward.  Co-operation among stakeholders is unlikely unless the 
landowners are assured that any land expropriated for the purpose 
of species or habitat protection or recovery will be expropriated 
at fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area is recovery planning for specific species. 
Recovery strategies should list the activities required.  A 
recovery plan should include estimated costs associated with the 
recovery of a given species or habitat.  Integrated listing or 
recovery planning must be part of the act.  Without such planning 
we will find ourselves listing species we have no capacity to 
protect.  There should be no listing of a species as being 
endangered unless it can be scientifically proven that that 
species is in fact endangered.  Furthermore, there should be no 
expropriation of land unless it can be scientifically proven that 
the species can be recovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is the role of the Council on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada.  In the endangered species listing 
process, the Canadian Alliance supports an independent, 
scientific listing body such as the Council on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada while recognizing the role and 
authority of parliament in recovery planning.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point of compliance, enforcement and dispute 
resolution, is a very important point.  The Liberals should not 
introduce legislation that threatens to use criminal sanctions in 
addition to its power of expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any attempt by government to expropriate private property should 
be subject to the following process.  This process should include 
a review process that offers some form of arbitration and/or 
dispute resolution to landowners.  Where warranted, and only 
after a fair review or dispute resolution process has been 
completed, the expropriation of private land at fair market value 
should be reasonable.  The process should also include that any 
use of criminal law power by government against private 
landowners is unreasonable.  A functional dispute resolution 
mechanism would render the use of criminal law power largely 
unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of producers and landowners believe that the 
government could achieve more through co-operation with farmers 
and ranchers than through threats of punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far I have been discussing the problems that the official 
opposition has with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Surrey Central, whom I represent, are from largely 
metropolitan or suburban areas.  While we are not running the 
risk of having our land confiscated without compensation, without 
reimbursement of fair market value, we do not want any Canadian 
subject to such an unjust treatment.  Many of us in Surrey 
Central own our homes.  We make mortgage payments like everyone 
else.  We would not want the Liberals to swoop down and section 
off any of the area of land that surrounds our homes without 
paying us for that portion of land the Liberals say that they 
have to take from us for obvious reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents do not want me to sit on my hands in the House 
while the Liberals threaten to take huge chunks of land, 
thousands of acres in some cases, from Canadian citizens and pay 
them virtually nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, far from working in a democratic way to help Canada's 
ranchers contribute to our nation's efforts to save our 
endangered species, the Liberals are promising punishment for 
those ranchers.  My heart goes out to the farmers and ranchers 
who are already overtaxed by the government and who are already 
suffering.  They have huge input costs that are the fault of the 
government and its lack of vision.  They have to compete at a 
disadvantage on the world markets thanks to the government's poor 
record on international trade.  The Liberals are now planning to 
take, from what I have been told, sometimes thousands of acres of 
land from individual Canadians without a process of compensation 
and under the threat of criminal charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a note from one of my constituents, David Pope, and I 
would like to read from it.  He said that the offensive penalties 
for actions against plants, animals or organisms that are deemed 
species at risk and the land which makes up their habitat are 
unlike any found in Canadian criminal law.  They range from 
$50,000 and/or one year in jail to $1 million and/or five years 
in jail for each offence and are doubled if repeated.  These are 
not offences of murder, arson, theft or rape but are for harming 
or harassing a plant, animal or organism or destroying a portion 
of its habitat, which is on one's land, and that is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pope went on to say that the above offences are strict 
liability offences and that an accuser need only say “you 
committed the offence and you must prove that you did not”. 
That is a reverse onus, as the lawyers say, and rarely used in 
criminal law. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the usual serious criminal offence a person is assumed 
innocent until proven guilty and beyond a reasonable doubt.  That 
is not the case under Bill C-33.  Mr. Pope further writes that 
the farmer is prohibited from charging them with trespassing. 
They can take anything they like and not pay for it.  Homes can 
be searched under a search warrant which bears no resemblance to 
the usual murder, arson, rape or other serious criminal offence. 
A search warrant will be much easier to obtain.  This is an 
outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the eco-police start asking ranchers or farmers questions 
about the alleged offence the rancher or farmer must give them 
reasonable assistance.  They must answer the questions or be 
charged with obstruction of justice. They will be forced to give 
evidence against themselves.  Once again, under Canadian law an 
accused does not have to incriminate himself but he does under 
Bill C-33.  Yet another civil liberty breached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another provision of Bill C-33 provides statute standing for 
anyone 18 years or older and a resident of Canada to start an 
investigation against a rancher or a farmer for any of the 
offences I have just listed.  Any special interest group or 
anyone with a grudge against a farmer or a rancher can start an 
investigation which may well cost the farmer thousands of dollars 
in litigation fees and fines if not time behind bars. This is 
neighbour turning against neighbour.  Do we really want this kind 
of society in Canada for these kinds of offences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 provides that the accused rancher or farmer can never 
know who started the investigation against him.  He will never be 
able to face his accuser in open court.  Canadians and free 
people everywhere are afforded the right to face their accusers 
in open court but not under Bill C-33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair market compensation is not mentioned in Bill C-33.  There 
is a clause covering compensation but it appears from the wording 
that any compensation received for a regulatory restriction on 
agriculture land use to protect the habitat of species at risk 
will be difficult to obtain and below fair market value.  These 
are the issues of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people I represent believe that there should be a fair and 
democratic manner in which to handle the protection of endangered 
species.  We do not believe that conflict and heavy-handed 
government penalties should be the basis for working out this 
matter.  The government is making a mess of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some recommendations to make with respect to Bill C-33. 
This bill should be based on voluntary co-operation and 
partnerships between the stakeholders and our government.  That 
is possible.  It can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians, including ranchers and farmers in our remotest 
lands, want to protect our environment, our vegetation and our 
animals.  They want to protect flora and fauna.  The people of 
Surrey Central want our government to work hand in hand with the 
stakeholders and have them co-operate and benefit from measures 
to protect our endangered species.  It can be done.  A Canadian 
Alliance government will do it.  This Liberal government is 
trying to do it through the back door, through regulations.  That 
is wrong. 
I know it is wrong because I am on the scrutiny of regulations 
committee.  There are a number of regulations in the pipeline 
which should not be there.  They have been in the pipeline for 
years, some of them for 25 years, because when the committee 
writes to ministers of the crown they will not respond or will 
not respond in a manner that will resolve the issues.  The 
regulations go in circles and keep on existing when they should 
not be there in the first place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government uses bill after bill.  There is very limited 
scope in the bill but a huge number of regulations that control 
the implementation of that act.  This is not the way to go.  This 
is the back door process and that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should be up front and prepare the legislation. 
They should give details on how the protection of these species 
will be achieved but they are not doing that. The people of 
Surrey Central will not support what the Liberals are doing with 
this bill.  We are ashamed of what the Liberals are doing. 
Therefore, we cannot support Bill C-33. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few comments on this extremely important piece of 
legislation.  I will be speaking in favour of the hoist motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that this is a bill that has been rammed through under 
threat by the minister to pull the legislation if there is any 
movement in relation to amendments or adjustments.  That 
certainly is not the way to handle not only a piece of 
legislation that is important and as sensitive as this, but any 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might say that this legislation will become as quickly 
extinct as some of the species if we do not soon get our act 
together and do something about it.  The government cannot ram 
through legislation just because it is an arrogant government in 
power when it affects so many people and so many species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of agencies that have grave concerns about 
what is happening in relation to our existing wildlife.  These 
are not people who are just concerned from an environmental point 
of view.  Many of them are very ordinary citizens who are not 
necessarily caught up in the protective groups.  They are people 
who love what this country has to offer.  They are members of 
industry who realize that even though their livelihood sometimes 
depends upon hurting the environment or destroying habitats, they 
are beginning to be aware only too well that in order to preserve 
our great country and continue to make a living they also have to 
be very conscious of the environment and the habitats that 
surround them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing, as we never saw before, a coming together of the 
different fragmented groups for the purpose of preserving what we 
have and what we are rapidly losing.  These agencies have a 
tremendous amount to offer if we give them a chance, if we listen 
to them and if the committee goes out and hears their 
presentations.  If we pick the best of what each group has to 
offer, if we look at putting together the solid recommendations 
that are coming to us and if we listen to the concerns that have 
been expressed, surely we can come up collectively with 
legislation that will not only do the job but will do it well.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When many of us were growing up in this great country, 
particularly those of us who grew up in the rural parts of the 
country, we remember living in a society where we worked and 
operated hand in hand with nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take time to listen to our elders we hear them talk about 
how they practically lived off the land.  They did that not by 
raping what the land had to offer but by taking carefully as they 
needed while always making sure that there was something left for 
tomorrow because they knew the food they put on the table and 
their livelihood and the livelihood of their children depended on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to the opening up of the country and the days of 
the fur trade, perhaps in those days people thought we had so 
many animals that we could take more than was necessary or more 
than we should to preserve the species.  However they quickly 
learned.  As the animals they were hunting at the time became 
scarce in the areas in which they operated, they moved farther 
afield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could even thank them for their concern about not 
depleting different groups of animals.  They were forced westward 
and the country was opened up, not just because of curiosity of 
seeing what was beyond the next mountain but because these people 
pushed forward, in the fur trade in particular, in order to make 
a living for themselves and in order not to destroy what existed 
closer to the places where they had originally settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should learn from the past.  For years and years the country 
continued to produce the different species that were here 
originally, but it seems that somewhere along the line we forgot 
about it.  With our concentration on opening up great towns, 
cities and building freeways we sometimes forgot the damage we 
were doing to the habitats for a lot of these species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own province of Newfoundland everybody remembers the great 
auk, which is as extinct as the Liberals will be in Newfoundland 
after the next election.  The only people who will survive are 
those who will not run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My great friend from Bonavista—Trinity—Conception must be 
delighted this morning that the effort by the provincial Liberals 
to rid themselves of his colleagues did not work.  The member for 
Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte will be back for a while in the 
House.  The member for Labrador will also be back, I understand. 
Both of them won their nominations handily, as they should.  It 
shows that the other agenda that is working certainly has not 
paid off for those who were perpetrating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin:</B>  Are you still speaking about wildlife? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  I will leave to the member's own 
interpretation as to whether or not I am speaking about wildlife 
because he knows his colleagues much better than I do, but I 
assure him we are not too far from the topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concentrating on the bill itself, when I was growing up in 
Newfoundland, some years after my distinguished colleague for 
Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, it was still at a time when there 
seemed to be an abundance of everything.  As a youth we would 
spend our evenings on the wharves.  We could stand there looking 
at the eels and small cod fish that swam right into the harbours 
and by the wharves.  We used our trolling poles to try to catch 
them.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now almost impossible to find codfish in Newfoundland. 
During the recent recreational fishery that we had in the areas 
where for years there was an abundance we did not see any at all. 
Luckily some bay stocks still exist.  Perhaps, if we are very 
careful, they will regenerate the growth that is necessary for 
the fishery to rebuild.  However with the lack of scientific 
information that is a major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One morning when I was teaching school I was driving toward the 
community where I taught.  I stopped by the roadside to look at a 
small fishing area just off the coast.  I counted 127 boats 
fishing a very lucrative area within a mile of the coast.  In 
this one small place the codfish were so plentiful that there 
were 127 boats.  When I talk about boats I am talking about boats 
from 20 feet to 40 feet, not big draggers but small inshore 
fishing boats.  This fall during late August and September, which 
should be prime fishing time, no one could find one codfish on 
that same ground.  It just shows what happens when we are not 
careful about protecting species that can easily be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country behind most of our rural communities always abounded 
in ducks, beaver, muskrat, moose, caribou and dedicated wildlife 
officials.  Perhaps no thanks at all to the governments as such 
but to the wildlife officials, they took it upon themselves to 
make sure that the herds were protected.  We still have in many 
cases an abundance of wildlife in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to my colleague from Bonavista—Trinity—Conception 
that perhaps in this great country of ours Newfoundland can be 
looked upon as the last frontier.  It is rapidly becoming a 
tourist destination for many people from within and outside the 
country.  In particular we are drawing a lot of tourists from 
Europe, simply because of the habitats that still exist exuding 
different types of wildlife whether it be animal or plant 
varieties.  It is providing a tremendous attraction for people 
who appreciate these things and who come from far away countries 
just to see them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where else in the country can we fly into the capital city as we 
can into St. John's, Newfoundland, and drive in a circular 
direction for four hours and see herds of caribou grazing on the 
side of the roads and see whales— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Whitehorse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  I asked the question and I got the 
answer, Whitehorse.  I believe that, but I also suggest there are 
not many places where we can do it.  When we look to Yukon or the 
Northwest Territories we sort of expect that.   We expect to see 
it.  We do not expect to see it in the rest of the country but we 
can in Newfoundland.  We can drive and see caribou on the sides 
of roads.  We can get out of our car on the other side of the 
road and watch whales in the ocean.  We can watch seals.  We can 
watch ducks fly about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can walk through the various paths in the woods.  There is a 
tremendous trail being developed from St. John's right around the 
Avalon called the East Coast Trail.  A lot of dedicated workers 
are involved and a lot of government money, to the credit of the 
government for investing in such projects.  It is tying together 
not only the historic sites and the culture of the area but also 
giving people a chance to move right into the heart of wildlife 
habitats.  The variety is such that anyone who has not 
experienced it would not believe if we tried to explain.  We can 
stop by salmon rivers and fish when the season is open. 
We can pick almost any kind of berry imaginable as we walk 
through this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After one day we could see caribou, whales, seals, moose, 
rabbits galore running around, and all kinds of species of birds. 
A greater variety of birds than perhaps any other part of the 
country congregate in that small area of the Avalon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have three or four major wildlife reserves.  The Cape Saint 
Mary's Bird Sanctuary is known all around the world.  There are 
also a couple of great islands off a community called Witless Bay 
where a number of species of birds attract attention from all 
over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into the numerous other things in the region I 
could mention, we still have regions in the country where 
wildlife abounds, due to the dedication of the wildlife officers 
and perhaps the education of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have become educated about how important it is to 
preserve.  Many people have seen our wildlife being endangered. 
They have seen some species even become extinct.  They are now 
concerned to the point where they realize that we perhaps have 
one more shot at doing it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is attempting to follow up on legislation 
originally brought in by the Tory government.  In those days the 
bill was given an <I>A</I> rating by everybody.  Now after several 
years the government is bringing in a bill to ensure proper 
preservation of wildlife.  However it is doing so simply based 
upon perhaps what the minister thinks should be done.  That may 
not be and certainly is not what most agencies in the country 
feel should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation should be brought out for public input.  We 
should take our time.  We should listen to the groups and 
agencies that have much to offer.  We have seen a variety of 
groups.  Many of them have not been working hand in hand over the 
years.  In fact they have been operating in opposite directions. 
When we see them willing to come together to effect a piece of 
legislation that will be good for all of them, we will hopefully 
see a piece of legislation of which everyone can be very proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the hoist so that we have time to assess this major 
piece of legislation.  Then when it is finally brought into the 
House for a vote it can be passed unanimously because we will 
know it has the teeth to do what a good piece of legislation 
should do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from St. 
John's for his presentation.  He talked about Newfoundland being 
one of the last frontiers with much wildlife.  He is absolutely 
correct.  It is indeed one of the more beautiful places on the 
planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently it was announced that some logging would be done around 
some very sensitive salmon river areas.  Voisey's Bay has been 
talked about as well as the expansion of power near the Churchill 
area along with Quebec.  What does he think those so-called 
megaprojects would do to the wildlife and the habitat of 
Newfoundland and Labrador? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  The points he raises are extremely important 
ones.  Two major developments are under discussion in the 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  One is the development 
off Voisey's Bay and the other is the development of the Lower 
Churchill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
start of this new political season, I have the pleasure to speak 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois.  I would like to take this 
opportunity to send greetings to the people of my riding of 
Beauharnois—Salaberry and my colleagues here in the House and to 
wish the latter a hot autumn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have new leaders here with us in the House.  We will 
also have several interesting questions on the Order Paper.  I 
trust that the business carried out in the House will meet the 
expectations of the people of Canada, and of Quebec in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 on the preservation of Canada's wildlife is one 
deserving of debate in this Parliament for a number of reasons, 
primarily the fact that it seeks to implement a number of 
Canada's international obligations under conventions it has 
signed, such as the Convention on Biodiversity and others like 
the Ramsar Convention, which is aimed at protecting species and 
preserving the flora and fauna of this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is of particular interest to me because there is a 
wildlife sanctuary in my riding of Beauharnois Salaberry, the 
Haut-Saint-Laurent, which is home to a number of species, some of 
them at risk. 
This is an issue that interests me particularly because certain 
individuals have made representations to me, including those who 
keep various species and want to have the public get to know 
them at the Hemmingford safari park.  They think the present 
legislation is inadequate and should be expanded and improved 
with standards to ensure better species protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would like improved protection, legislation 
ensuring such protection for endangered wildlife, but in a 
debate such as this, it is concerned about the government's 
desire to pass legislation without any possibility of amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently heard the Minister of the Environment say that this 
bill was fine as it stood, as he had introduced it, as it had 
been tabled in the House. 
What is the point then of today's debate, which will continue 
before the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development, if we already know that the government does not 
want any amendments, does not want it improved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, this bill is far from perfect.  We could cite criticism 
by members of the government even, who hope the bill will be 
amended once we have passed it or when we are called to pass it.

June 12: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do nothing to protect species at risk unless this bill 
leaves committee as a good...piece of legislation. The House 
must support legislation that is strong, fair, effective and 
makes biological sense. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Louis, an expert on environmental issues, 
who served as minister of the environment in Quebec under Robert 
Bourassa, said on the same day with respect to Bill C-33, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of being recognized as being the final list produced by 
scientists of the highest repute who have worked tirelessly over 
the last two decades, the list will now be subject to the 
discretion of cabinet— 
</UL>
<He was speaking of the list of species that deserve protection 
and that should get protection under this new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Louis added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that terribly ironic... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not even starting with the roll of the list of the 339 
species identified by COSEWIC. That is a glaring fault in the 
law. Without a listing there cannot be protection. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, this bill needs to be amended, it needs to 
be improved upon, as suggested by two Liberal members. They 
are not the only ones who think that the bill is flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of environmentalists and environmental groups have also 
said that the bill would not eliminate the loopholes left by 
certain provinces. Some of these groups, including the Sierra 
Club, also said that this legislation, which the minister 
claimed to be the strongest in the world, is an embarrassment 
for Canada at the international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Elizabeth May, of the Sierra Club, species at risk 
are not adequately protected under this bill. 
On behalf of her organization and of several environmental 
groups, she said that politicians, not scientists—and this is 
definitely an area where the voice of scientists should prevail 
over that of politicians—have the last word regarding the 
selection of species deemed to be at risk, when we should in 
fact call upon an independent group of experts to make an annual 
list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This criticism from environmental groups should be listened to. 
It should trigger a debate and a thorough examination by the 
members of this House. I hope that the criticisms made by some 
Liberal members, including the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis, 
and by environmental groups will be taken into consideration by 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In something rarely seen when it comes to environmental 
issues, industry is also opposed to the bill in its present 
form. For instance, two organizations, the Canadian Pulp and 
Paper Association, which wished to comment on Bill C-33 as it 
now stands, and the Mining Association of Canada, have indicated 
that the government could have taken a much tougher approach 
with respect to federal lands, public lands and natural areas, 
where the federal government's constitutional jurisdiction is 
not challenged by any of the provinces, particularly by our 
party, the Bloc Quebecois.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the intergovernmental and constitutional 
aspects of Bill C-33.  As my party's intergovernmental affairs 
critic, I feel it is necessary and indeed essential that the 
constitutional issues raised by this bill be tackled at this 
stage of the proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In matters of the environment, the division of powers in Canada 
is such that the federal parliament and the parliaments of 
various provinces have overlapping jurisdiction.  This is 
affirmed in the preamble to the bill. 
But many provisions of the bill proper seem to run counter to 
this division of powers with respect to the environment and, by 
extension, the protection of wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, as in other areas, what we are seeing is a desire by 
parliament and the government introducing this legislation to 
drag in the issue of national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this bill is intended to implement an international 
treaty, namely the Convention on the Preservation of Biological 
Diversity referred to in the third paragraph of the preamble. It 
might serve, as has already happened in the past before the 
courts, the Supreme Court of Canada in particular, to imply that 
there is a national dimension to this bill, since it is intended 
to implement an international treaty and international 
obligations.  Then, because of this national dimension, the 
appropriate legislation for the purpose of implementing these 
obligations becomes the federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois and all the governments of Quebec, one 
after the other, have always challenged this national dimension 
theory. 
The courts have hesitated to apply it, although they have 
sometimes been tempted to broaden the range of federal 
jurisdiction through reference to this theory, particularly when 
the environment is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems this is the case again here, because certain provisions 
in this bill clearly suggest the desire for this legislation to 
apply to the provinces, and apply to them without their consent. 
Moreover, a number of its provisions are along those lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, paragraph 34(2) is the most explicit, and is very 
clearly aimed at having federal legislation apply within a 
province and without the province necessarily wanting this to be 
so.  I will quote this, because it is worth reading in its 
entirety: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
Minister, by order, provide that sections 32 and 33 apply in 
lands in a province— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This relates to the listing of a species of wildlife as 
extirpated species. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—with respect to individuals of a listed wildlife species that is 
not an aquatic species or a species of birds that are migratory 
birds protected by the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal legislation can thus end up being applied in a province 
without the province's consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would indicate that the government has little concern about 
potential overlap between this upcoming federal law and certain 
provincial laws passed in previous years, which have enabled the 
provinces to meet some of their obligations, including 
international ones arising from Canada's ratification of certain 
treaties on biological diversity and the protection and 
preservation of flora and fauna.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the case with Quebec, for example, since it passed two 
important bills: the act respecting threatened or vulnerable 
species and the act respecting the conservation and development 
of wildlife.  The National Assembly considered it practical and 
essential to pass these laws to preserve endangered wildlife in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the Government of Quebec, through its minister of 
the environment, Paul Bégin, has said that Bill C-33 constituted 
only more unnecessary duplication for Quebec and that its aim 
was to put in place a safety net for endangered species and 
their habitats in areas under federal jurisdiction.  This is in 
keeping with the provisions of the constitution and the 
jurisdiction it afforded parliament over the environment, but 
the federal government wanted to do the same thing on Quebec 
soil, which the government of Quebec was not prepared to accept. 
Neither are the duly elected Bloc Quebecois representatives in 
this House prepared to accept it, and their voices must be 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that some provisions of the bill are also likely to 
be declared unconstitutional as they are incompatible with the 
division of powers. 
I am thinking in particular of clauses 36, 39 and 57 to 64, 
which also seek to allow the federal parliament and this 
legislation to interfere with the powers granted to the Quebec 
National Assembly and to the other provincial legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to praise the work of our critic on 
environmental issues, the hon. member for Jonquière, who, in 
this area as in several others, shows not only an interest for 
the environment, but also for the protection of the right to the 
environment, this third generation right whereby we have a duty 
to protect species, to protect nature, plants and animal life 
against the dangers and the harm that man and institutions can 
cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I wish to emphasize the work done by my colleague 
regarding the importation of MOX, a fuel that entered Canada 
against the will of several environmental groups. In fact, MOX 
could still enter Canada through Quebec and Ontario even though 
no real debate, no consultation and no adequate impact studies 
have been conducted to our satisfaction and that of a number of 
other parliamentarians and groups representing the civil 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will not accept and will not support a 
legislation which, we are already being told, cannot be amended, 
even though we know it is inadequate, even in the eyes of 
Liberal members such as the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis, who 
is here with us. 
This bill is deemed unacceptable by several environmental 
groups, by a number of people in the industry, who want the 
federal government to take action in this sector, but only in 
those areas and territories over which it has accepted and 
recognized jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will not accept a federal act that 
creates overlap and duplication in this area, as is the case in 
so many other areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday afternoon, we learned that the government wanted to 
impose another gag—and this sets off bad memories for us; members 
have only to recall the series of gags imposed this past spring 
by the government, which was trying to ram through its clarity 
bill, gag by gag—to prematurely cut off debate in order to get 
its young offenders legislation passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another debate in which the Bloc Quebecois has been 
trying to defend Quebec's interests and its jurisdiction in a 
field where it has shown that flexible, intelligent legislation 
encouraging the rehabilitation of young people was much better 
than federal laws designed to put 12 and 13 year olds in jail 
when what they deserved was a chance at rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not seem to be interested in making the 
effort or urging others to do so, but is instead casting doubts 
on the chances of rehabilitating young people, and thus perhaps 
responding to the people represented by many Canadian Alliance 
MPs today, who are calling for tough measures against young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young offenders bill, like Bill C-33, other bills, programs 
such as the millennium scholarships and others that come under 
provincial jurisdiction, shows just how far the federal 
government is prepared to go, this government which claims to be 
a national government, which wants to be such a government and 
in fact reiterates this in the bill when its speaks of its 
desire to defend Canada's national identity and history, of 
which its natural heritage is an integral part, and shows just 
how unfederal its federalism truly is.  It is for this reason 
that so many of the Quebecers represented by the 44 members of 
the Bloc Quebecois are challenging this federalism and calling 
for their own country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
the hon. Bloc member to elaborate a little bit more fully on the 
scientific input that will not be there when making lists for 
species that are endangered.  If we think of species that are 
endangered, we have to realize that their habitat is endangered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are on the land and share that habitat with the 
animals are scientists, biologists, elders, hunters, fishers and 
trappers.  Those are the people who know the patterns of the 
wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is completely unacceptable and really shocking that there 
would be no input from the scientists who have evaluated the 
patterns and the history of the wildlife and the flora and fauna 
on that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to answer the hon. member's 
question, we share the same concerns.  I hope the NDP will be 
consistent with its view that this piece of legislation is 
incomplete.  It is certainly weak when it comes to defending the 
interests and allowing for better protection of the fauna and 
flora. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very obvious weaknesses is not to want the scientific 
community to have the last word on the wildlife species that need 
to be protected.  In that sense, together we should make sure 
that the government amends the provisions of the legislation so 
that it does give a say, and I would say a final say, to the 
experts on these issues.

We should rely on experts.  That is something that is not unusual 
and something that could be done in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the government will understand that this law is 
imperfect and it should be amended, which is contrary to what the

like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague the member 
for Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has given a very important new dimension to the work we are 
doing on Bill C-33. The new dimension he had to propose this 
morning relates to the division of powers between the federal 
and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the government says, it keeps on violating the 
Constitution Act of Canada. I think that, since the Bloc 
Quebecois was first elected, ours is the only party in the House 
of Commons that stands up for the constitutional right of the 
provinces laid down in the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to give us specifics to prove beyond 
all doubt that, with this bill, the government is once again 
violating the constitution and looking for yet another fight 
with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole constitutional issue is 
taboo. We must not talk about the constitution or wonder if it 
is being upheld or not, and we cannot amend it when we all know 
that it should be amended in order to meet the aspirations of 
many Canadians, including Quebecers, natives and all of those 
who want some of the provisions of the constitution to be 
amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian constitutionalism has failed, and that is why some of 
us do not want to address these issues. They say that these 
issues should not be considered, even in our parliamentary 
debates. And when we go ahead and address these issues, they 
call it “constitutional obsession”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and member for 
Saint-Laurent—Cartierville likes to talk about constitutional obsession when 
we raise constitutional issues and try to stand for the 
interests of Quebec and to protect the current version of the 
constitution, which recognizes the jurisdiction of Quebec and 
the other provinces in some areas, especially in the area of environment 
which is being undermined by Bill C-33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But of course we do not hear about constitutional obsession when 
the minister and some of his colleagues base this bill and other 
pieces of legislation on spending power, for instance, or 
legislative power, because it deals with cross-border issues 
and cross-border pollution. No, they forget all about 
constitutional obsession when they need to exercise their 
federal jurisdictions under the terms of the constitution. 
But there is an obsession with the constitution when it comes to 
protecting and defending the integrity of Quebec's 
jurisdictions, in the House and before parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an obsession. As long as Bloc members are 
sitting in the House, defending Quebec's interests will mean 
defending the respect of the current constitution before the day 
comes, and it will come soon, when we will decide, because of 
the numerous violations of this constitution, to give ourselves 
a country, to give ourselves the jurisdictions which will allow 
us to develop Quebec without having to suffer continuously, 
through parliament, violations of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, to respond to the question of my colleague, I would 
also like to point out that the Supreme Court of Canada is a 
strategic ally of the government and of the Parliament of Canada 
on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory on the national dimension which I mentioned earlier 
is a theory that the Supreme Court of Canada has tried to apply 
in many areas. On the environmental issue, on the transborder 
pollution issue, in the Crown Zellerbach affair, which was a 
very important case in Canadian constitutional history, the 
supreme court went very far in recognizing a federal legislative 
jurisdiction over the environment and the protection of the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the supreme court can use this to enrich and to interpret 
the Canadian constitution, largely in favour of increasing 
federal jurisdiction over the environment, is very disturbing. 
It concerns the Quebec government, which in other matters, 
especially when it comes to passing environmental legislation 
allowing for federal impact studies, has tended to want new 
powers and to expand its jurisdiction in an area where federal 
legislation could be interpreted by the courts in such a way as 
to annihilate the jurisdiction of the provinces and of Quebec 
by enshrining it in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable. If this legislation is not amended so as 
to respect the jurisdiction of Quebec and other provinces, the 
government will not have the support of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Environmental groups and industries which oppose this legislation 
will know that our objection is based not only on the criticisms 
they share with us but on an even more fundamental basis, that is, 
that we do not want this legislation to pass. Parliament must not 
pass legislation it does not have the jurisdiction to pass.

to this very important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my hon. colleague from the Bloc Quebecois Party that 
protection of the environment should never be in isolation.  The 
problem occurs with cross-border pollutants and cross-border 
migratory species, et cetera.  The best way to protect our 
planet's species and everyone else involved in that sphere should 
be co-operation at all levels.  To do it in isolation simply will 
not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party vehemently rejects this legislation because it is 
quite simple.  It is absolute nonsense to say we will protect 
animals and not protect their habitat.  The bill does nothing to 
protect habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies of the New Democratic Party will be the following 
ones: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Identification and listing of species at risk by an independent

primary consideration and not political interpretation of data; 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comprehensive, nationwide natural habitat protection, including 
protection for species that range or migrate over Canada's 
domestic and international borders; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inclusion of stakeholders in development of species recovery 
plans, provision of adequate support to those whose livelihood is 
disrupted by a species recovery plan and provision for just 
transition to workers and communities affected by the recovery 
plans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a much more proactive approach to species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will delve into a little story of an area just outside my 
riding called the Liscomb Game Sanctuary.  Two-thirds of that 
game sanctuary is already logged.   When asked by a group trying 
to protect it, DNR officials in Nova Scotia said “Don't get us 
wrong but our job is to protect the wildlife and not the 
habitat”.  That shows the nonsense of officials in the 
bureaucratic governmental level who do not understand that if we 
do not have a healthy, vibrant habitat for species at risk then 
we simply will not have any species.  Bill C-33 will just not 
allow that to happen.

quite nice.  Every member in the House received one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that organization was highlighting and saying to every 
member of parliament was that it was our responsibility to do 
everything we could to protect the particular species identified. 
If we work together, if we do it from the ground or the waters of 
the ocean up then we can do it.  We can do it very successfully, 
but if it comes from the top down there will be rejections and a 
very futile effort on the part of government when it argues about 
it.  Meanwhile the destruction of our planet carries on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, in Washington state just south of Sumas in the 
Abbotsford area of British Columbia, there are plans to set up a 
new power plant.  Its emissions into our environment would equate 
to about 480,000 vehicles every day.  What does our government do 
about it?  Absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many legal avenues that our government could pursue. 
It could send it to an arbitration board.  It could ask for 
better clarification.  Yet our government sits there and tells 
the state of Washington nothing.  If this plant goes ahead I have 
very dire predictions for the environment, for the health of 
British Columbians and even for the people of the state of 
Washington for wherever that ill wind will be blowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at the history of past Conservative and current 
Liberal governments in terms of the fishery species.  It is not 
an accident that salmon on the west coast and salmon on the east 
coast, cod, and crab stocks off Newfoundland are depleting at a 
very rapid rate.  Many independent scientists are now saying that 
cod off our coastline may never recover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet as we speak there are still terrible ongoing harvesting 
methods.  We are still dragging the bottom of our oceans.  We are 
still dumping millions of pounds of fish over the sides of boats 
every year.  That is an abysmal policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that we will now protect species at risk is simple 
nonsense.  The government and the previous Conservative 
government have no idea what it takes, the leadership that it 
takes to protect our planet.  When we protect the flora and fauna 
and other plants and animals, in essence we are protecting 
ourselves as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unbelievable that the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore 
Petroleum Board issues leases through the province and gives out 
lease permits to oil and gas companies to do seismic work off the 
coastlines of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia.  Once it gives out a 
lease it says the company has to do an environmental assessment. 
It is simple nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that the company has to do its own 
environmental assessment, report back, and nine times out of ten 
proceed as normal.  A full independent, complete environmental 
assessment should be done of those areas first.  Based on the 
discussions and on the parameters of that assessment, leases 
could then be granted if they will not harm ocean or fish 
habitats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the DFO and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
is quite clear:  the protection of fish and fish habitat. However 
basically the cart is before the horse when it gives away 
jurisdiction to an independent board that grants leases before an 
environmental assessment is done.  There is nothing in the 
legislation that reverses that practice.  Thousands of fishermen 
in their communities are very concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that oil and gas exploration and fisheries 
cannot coexist, but we need hard core, scientific, independent 
environmental evidence first to ensure that all fish and all fish 
habitat are protected by the burgeoning oil and gas industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to mention one of the top three books 
I have read, Rachel Carson's <I>Silent Spring</I>.  Unfortunately 
many people in the House probably have not read it.  I know 
government officials have never read it.  It was written in the 
early sixties by an American environmentalist who predicted what 
is happening today:  the decline of species, the increase of 
asthma in children, and the rampant use of agricultural 
pesticides on crops and products throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no coincidence that on Prince Edward Island there are fish 
kills every year related directly to agricultural pesticides in 
its potato fields.  What is done about it?  Nothing, absolutely 
nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to upset farmers.  The salmon river groups and 
the fishing groups are saying that they do not want to upset 
farmers either.  We have to work together not only to be able to 
yield a sufficient crop in the potato industry but to protect the 
waters and the habitat of fish.  It does no good to promote one 
industry at the destruction of another.  That kind of attitude 
needs to change and a more co-operative level has to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I wish to thank some great organizations throughout 
the country that do a tremendous amount of good in protecting our 
habitat for future generations.  The Sackville Rivers Association 
in my riding does a tremendous job of river cleanup, habitat 
protection and everything else, on a shoestring.  The Atlantic 
Salmon Federation is trying to promote sustainable recreational 
fisheries for salmon.  As well it is trying to protect their 
rivers and breeding grounds and ocean stocks in order for the 
salmon to return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the people of the Burns Bog Society in Steveston, 
Richmond, British Columbia.  Those people are trying to protect 
the Burns Bog area for migratory birds species.  Unfortunately 
all levels of government are not really listening to them, but I 
thank those people for their efforts in protecting those species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I thank a wonderful group in Nova Scotia called the Ecology 
Action Centre.  It is a great group of environmental people doing 
it on a shoestring, trying to protect specific areas in Nova 
Scotia like the coral reefs and forested areas so that many 
generations from now can enjoy the benefits of those beautiful 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the David Suzuki Foundation for the great work it 
does not only within Canada but internationally, and of course 
the Nova Scotia Nature Trust.  The Nova Scotia Nature Trust was 
started by a gentleman in Chester named Rudy Haase.  Basically it 
purchases lands from people and tries to protect them for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government and other opposition members that if we 
do not protect the habitat of the specific species we are talking 
about, it is simple nonsense to talk about the back end and say 
we will protect the species without protecting their habitat.  It 
can be done co-operatively with the use of aboriginal knowledge, 
especially of the north.  It can be done with the municipalities, 
the provinces, industry, workers and all associated groups in 
that level working together not only to protect our country but 
to protect our planet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this bill which I believe 
was tabled last April.  It is much awaited endangered species 
legislation.  While all Canadians support prudent measures to 
protect species at risk, this bill simply goes too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of Liberal legislation was introduced by the 
environment minister.  It will have a profound impact on property 
owners.  It will essentially make them criminals if they fail to 
protect endangered species or habitat on their land.  The bill 
gives the federal government the power and the capacity to pass 
emergency orders that will force property owners to halt economic 
activities that may adversely affect the species or habitat in 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, there is no clear formula for compensation outlined in 
the bill.  By ignoring this issue, any hope the minister had for 
co-operation among landowners, conservation groups and the 
government is tossed right out the window.  Compensation for 
expropriated land that is not at market value is simply not fair. 
It will adversely affect ranchers and farmers, just to name a 
few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am familiar with the situation in certain areas of the United 
States where this type of legislation has been attempted. 
Unfortunately it has been to the detriment of endangered species. 
The expression used in many areas south of the border because of 
this kind of legislation is: shoot, shovel and shut up.  It 
expresses the feeling among landowners in the U.S. that it is 
better to quietly dispose of endangered species than protect them 
through less draconian measures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have gone so far as to destroy land or habitat that they 
feared could potentially host or attract endangered species. This 
was to avoid potential problems with their federal government 
down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people with whom I am acquainted have lost their land to 
the federal government.  The land has become the property of the 
state and compensation was never part of the consideration.  This 
just cannot be done to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will, of course, be lots of lawsuits and families will 
attempt to recover the losses they will have by these draconian 
measures.  If our government is interested in that kind of thing 
taking place, where we are constantly in the courts settling 
disputes because we have a constitution and a charter of rights 
that does not recognize property rights, there will be some real 
problems.  The legislation will make these problems quite capable 
of occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ranchers and the landowners in Alberta are good stewards of 
the land and they all have a personal interest in preserving our 
natural heritage.  They want to do it.  There are also over 100 
conservation groups in existence that do an effective job of 
managing millions of hectares of wildlife sanctuaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians recognize that we need a proactive approach to 
protecting species at risk that is based on respect:  respect for 
the species that inhabit our land and waters and respect for 
those who own and work the land.  What we do not need is 
legislation that makes criminals out of all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is committed to protecting and preserving 
Canada's natural environment and endangered species, and to 
sustainable development of our abundant natural resources for the 
use of current and future generations.  The Canadian Alliance 
maintains that for any endangered species legislation to be 
effective, it must respect the fundamental rights of private 
property owners.  This legislation does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensation for expropriated land that is not at fair market 
value is simply not fair.  There is no clear formula for 
compensation outlined in this particular bill.  Compensation will 
be dealt with through regulations following the passage of the 
bill.  How many times have we seen that with this government?  It 
passes the bill then brings in the legislation and socks it to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not have the courage to bring these things 
forward and have them included in the bill.  Government members 
like to slam the door, usually through some kind of hurried 
legislation.  Getting it through is the main thing.  They put 
closure on it and then the regulations will be in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister as well as other ministers in this government have 
this backwards.  If we are going to have good legislation we need 
co-operation among the stakeholders.  This is unlikely unless 
landowners are assured that any land expropriated for the purpose 
of species or habitat protection and recovery will be 
expropriated at fair market value.  If that is not discussed and 
built into the legislation prior to the passage of the 
legislation, we can kiss those stakeholders goodbye.  They will 
sit back and wait for the draconian regulations to come in that 
will make criminals out of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could name other legislation which makes people feel like they 
are the criminal all of a sudden. 
We have law abiding people who feel they have been placed into 
the criminal element because of the government's lack of proper 
consultation and working together with other stakeholders.

the activities.  There should be a recovery plan which includes 
the costs associated with the recovery of any given species or 
habitat.  Without such planning, we will find ourselves listing 
species that we have no capacity to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports an independent scientific listing 
body, such as the Committee on the Status of Endangered 
Wildlife in Canada.  We also recognize the role and authority of 
parliament in recovery planning.  That is our role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Liberals have introduced legislation which threatens 
to use criminal sanctions in addition to its powers of 
expropriation.  Any attempts to expropriate private property 
should be subject to a process and that process should be a 
review which offers some form of arbitration or dispute 
resolution to the landowners.  It does not exist in this 
legislation.  Where warranted, and only after a fair dispute 
resolution process has been completed, the expropriation of 
private land at fair market value is reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of producers and landowners believe that the 
government could achieve its intention in protecting wildlife and 
endangered species through a much more co-operative attitude with 
farmers and ranchers instead of threats of punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government today to look at its legislation and 
recognize the fact that it is not building bridges between all 
these stakeholders who exist when it comes to this kind of 
legislation.  Rather, it is putting up walls of resistance 
because of its constant threats to the law-abiding people of the 
land through this kind of legislation which says “If you don't 
do it our way, we'll sue the tail off you”.  Threatening and 
abusing the landowners to that degree is unacceptable and, unless 
the legislation is amended properly, there will be no support 
coming from this side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1867, when some twenty Fathers of Confederation laid the very 
foundations of Canadian society, they were not in the least bit 
concerned about endangered animals and other environmental 
issues. That is why today, with regard to endangered species as 
well as to the environment, we see federal interference in an 
area under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to environment, as shown by agreements between 
provinces and the federal government, we have come to the 
conclusion that when a problem affects more than one province or 
a neighbouring country, the United States for example, it comes 
under federal jurisdiction. When the environmental problem is 
within a province, it comes under the province's jurisdiction. 
This is well understood and it works well. We must acknowledge 
that sometimes it goes beyond the jurisdictions of more than two 
countries and affects every country on this planet, since we 
breathe the same air and drink the same water.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to endangered species, it must be pointed out that 
four provinces, including Quebec, have already passed strong 
laws, even better than Bill C-33, which is a reincarnation of 
Bill C-65 that died on the Order Paper and was sponsored Sergio 
Marchi, who was then the minister responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989, more than eleven years ago, Quebec has had its own 
legislation to protect endangered animals. Now in the year 
2000 the federal government wants to play an active role and, 
once again to encroach upon areas under provincial 
jurisdiction, again by using its spending authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the point of view of the ordinary citizen, we cannot be 
against Bill C-33 since there are more than 70,000 animal species 
in Canada. On these, 340 are at risk. We must give them every 
chance to survive. We need only think of the peregrine falcon. 
It is estimated that 12 species disappeared in the last few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if I taught ecology in grade eight, all of my pupils 
would tell me that something has to be done. And it is true. 
Well, Quebec did take action and was followed by three other 
provinces, including Alberta. We have our own act, we are 
enforcing it and things are working well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently, the federal government did not care much about 
the protection of species facing extinction on its own land, 
that is in federal parks. But suddenly, it has come forward and 
wants to interfere in an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
Quebec will never accept, as it has already been had with 
overlaps and with direct theft by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should remember that during the war, the federal 
government took over the power to resort to direct taxation, 
supposedly for only a few years. The war ended in 1945, which is 
more than 55 years ago, but we pay more and more taxes directly 
to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-33, the federal government is still trying to 
encroach indirectly on provincial jurisdiction. Worse still, the 
bill purports to protect habitats. 
I agree that the habitats must be protected.  The government of 
Quebec currently protects the habitats of animals, primarily 
those threatened with extinction.  If this bill were passed, 
what about cutting rights, for example, of spruce trees which 
are natural resources and therefore under provincial 
jurisdiction? Well, Quebecers would have to obtain Ottawa's 
approval to cut down a mature forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know federal bureaucracy.  It does not happen in a week. 
It can take two years to get an answer.  We write to ministers 
and sometimes it can take six months to get an answer, an 
acknowledgement.  Getting approval for cutting rights will 
take two, three or four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, Bill C-33 must not be passed as it stands. 
Worse yet, clause 34 of the bill provides that the minister may 
establish jurisdiction over a province by order in council, if, 
after summary discussion, he does not feel that things are being 
done the way he likes, that the province is dragging its heels.

small municipality depending on the province.  Worse yet, we have 
before us another fine example of structural duplication.  It 
usually creates a lot of discontent and costs a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point this out all the time to my dairy producers, who have a 
cow and a quota.  As we know, quotas today are mixed, that is a 
combination of unprocessed and fluid milk.  While the fluid milk 
is under Quebec's jurisdiction, milk used in 
processing to make butter or something else comes under the 
jurisdiction of the department of agriculture in Ottawa. 
So there you are, with two ministers of agriculture trying to 
lead the same cow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Poor cow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien: </B>So we have the same milk, the same cow, 
and two ministers of agriculture.  We will end up with an 
endangered species and two environment ministers, one in Ottawa 
and one in Quebec City.  It will take so long to reach agreement 
that the endangered species will have time to disappear 
completely from Canada or Quebec.  It is not appropriate to have 
squabbles over endangered animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago I experienced a wonderful example of harmonious 
co-operation in Stratford, in the regional county municipality of 
Granit Cambior, Ducks Unlimited, the municipality of 
Stratford and Mayor Gaétan Côté, and the regional municipality 
got together and invested $2.5 million to restore the former 
Sullivan mine sites.  Now that the site has been restored, there 
are more than 170 species which can be found there again after a period of 
total absence.  This was accomplished without the federal 
government and without any squabbling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are enough problems at the present time. 
In the health field, agreement has been reached precisely 
because the problem originated with the federal government, 
which once again wanted to meddle in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.  Fortunately the agreement between Messrs Harris 
and Bouchard managed to overcome the resistance of the Quebec MP 
representing Saint-Maurice, who would not listen to reason and 
was prepared to again stir up things between Quebec and Ottawa 
in order to raise his prestige in English Canada.  We are 
familiar with his recipe: jump on Quebec in order to get English 
Canada on your side.  Fortunately it did not work this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that there is unified opposition to Bill C-33, by all 
opposition parties in this House, the great majority of 
environmental groups, the major companies whose operations 
involve large tracts of land, such as pulp and paper companies, 
and the mining association. 
I would forewarn hon. members that the Bloc Quebecois will do 
everything it can to stop this bill from moving through the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my family have had the privilege, and I count it as a 
privilege, of having lived on the shores of a lake in the Rocky 
Mountains since 1974.  When we wake up in the morning the sun is 
rising over the Rocky Mountains.  There are loons, osprey, 
muskrat, beaver and all sorts of wildlife in the area.  I love 
and respect that part of the country and I really respect the 
fact that I have had the privilege of bringing up my family in 
such an idyllic location.  I therefore speak with a tremendous 
amount of passion about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in the cities who take a look at certain television 
programs or read certain documentation can come to a particular 
perspective.  Sometimes that perspective is accurate but more 
often than not it is inaccurate.  I think for example of the 
situation where we have had the various extreme ecogroups who 
have been involved in the so-called B.C. great bear rain forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such thing as the B.C. great bear rain forest.  It 
has never ever appeared on a map.  It is a pure fabrication and 
creation for marketing to get more money into the coffers of some 
of these organizations.  Unfortunately, what has happened is that 
companies which purchase wood products, softwood lumber and items 
of that type from that area have ended up succumbing to this 
marketing program.  What we are looking at now in the interior of 
British Columbia is that the American extreme environmental groups 
are now silently working and coming toward the interior of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite a specific example.  I will read from notes I 
took in two days of meetings last Saturday and Sunday in the town 
of Revelstoke, part of my constituency.  This city has been in 
existence for 100 years.  It has spawned many great citizens, not 
the least of whom is the member for York South—Weston who was 
born and raised in Revelstoke.  We make note of that very 
profound event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All kidding aside, we have 8,500 people living in this city 
that is completely and totally surrounded.  There are basically three 
valleys which converge at that particular point.  We have a 
static population of 8,500.  They traditionally have treated the 
environment with a tremendous amount of respect because it is the 
environment from which they sustain their living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes that there have been, and some very good 
changes I must say, in the forestry practices that have been 
brought forward by various levels and various brands of 
provincial government, we have seen a rollback in the amount of 
responsible resource extraction in the way of harvesting timber 
and wood products in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, there have been moves to more value added 
products with less actual fibre being taken out of the bush. 
However, there is a limit to how many guitar faces or how many 
violin skins can actually be created and still have an employed 
work base in the area.  However, I should say that on balance it 
strikes me that there has been a balance between the 
environmental concerns and responsible harvesting practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because there has been a downturn and because the area is so 
absolutely spectacular, they have now moved to what we might call 
ecotourism.  We are talking about snowmobile facilities and 
heli-skiing up on many of the magnificent glaciers in the area. 
Suddenly, as a result of the federal Department of the 
Environment red listing the caribou in the area, out of the clear 
blue sky the ministry of environment lands and parks, MELP, has 
decided that it is going to effect a closure for the snowmobilers 
in the area.  This is understandable and would be particularly 
understandable if there was good scientific data and a good base 
to make these judgments.  Indeed, from the notes I read, we have 
to take a look at the caribou in that area under the issue of 
habitat impact, disturbance and wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep hearing that the grizzlies are an endangered species, 
and indeed they are in certain areas of Canada, but in that part 
of my constituency, as in the far southeast corner of my 
constituency, the grizzlies are not an endangered species by any 
stretch of the imagination. 
They are predators that prey on deer and once they run out of 
deer they go after the caribou and the elk.  What kind of 
pressure have the wolves as predators brought to the caribou 
herds?  These are questions that MELP does not seem able to 
answer.  However, this came about as a result of a listing by the 
Canadian Department of Environment.

Revelstoke National Park and Glacier National Park adjacent to 
and between Revelstoke and Golden which obviously offer a 
tremendously undisturbed area for the caribou to go to?  Did MELP 
include in its survey the fact that there was this totally 
undisturbed area?  When we asked that question in the meeting the 
answer came back “In certain instances, yes, and in certain 
instances, no”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the people of Revelstoke, Kootenay—Columbia and all 
Canadians who understand these issues want to know is how are we 
making these judgments, on what basis are we making these 
judgments and have we taken into account all the impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to speak very forcefully in support of the 
responsible use of the environment and the species by hunters.  I 
will read something into the record.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you were to believe the rhetoric of many of the so-called 
modern environmentalists, hunters are an anachronism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that wildlife populations are declining while the 
callous, uncaring hunter goes afield intent only on the kill, 
giving no thought to the future of the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A newly released survey from Wildlife Habitat Canada puts the 
lie to this carefully nurtured image. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The survey reveals that over a 15-year period hunters have 
directly contributed more than $335 million to habitat 
conservation projects in Canada.  While that figure is impressive 
by itself, the study notes that this does not include the hunter 
support given to national groups such as Ducks Unlimited Canada 
and the Nature Conservancy of Canada.  It does not include the 
$600 million in license fees collected from hunters over the same 
period, nor does it include the $600 million that hunters invest 
in the Canadian economy each year on equipment, travel, lodging 
and other related expenses.  It is also important to note that 
these figures do not include the equally significant 
contributions that anglers have made to the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia alone, hunters have, over that 15-year 
period, invested over $106 million dollars and almost 2.5 million 
hours of volunteer work toward wildlife habitat conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An impressive record for a group of citizens who are often 
portrayed by the popular media as a group of uncouth rednecks, 
blazing away at anything that moves and generally desecrating the 
environment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must speak up on behalf of the people in my constituency, not 
just the hunters but the people who, like myself, choose to live 
in the area because we have such a tremendous amount of respect 
for the environment, the ecology and the species.  We must be 
heard and be part of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come forward with this species at risk act, if indeed it 
is the will of the House for us to come forward with this act, we 
must take into account all the issues I have brought forward 
today, and the many more to come, to see that we create a proper 
balance and that we have an understanding of what that balance 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and many of my colleagues who represent people like the 
citizens in my constituency will be standing up for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of 
wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My interest in this bill is twofold: first, a concern for the 
environment and, second, a concern for the effectiveness of this 
legislation. I am also concerned about how the federal 
government wants to get involved in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction and about the centralization process proposed by 
the federal government in that area instead of achieving true 
co-operation and signing parallel agreements with the provinces 
based on what is being done in each of them. 
As we can see once again with this issue, the federal government 
has no desire to take into account the particular situation of 
the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that biodiversity as a whole is the 
result of an evolution process that has been taking place on 
earth for over 4.5 billion years. That process has created a 
large number of living organisms and natural environments, and 
it is important to protect them to ensure a balance on our 
planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These organisms make up the ecosystems that we know. They all 
play a role in the food chain and in maintaining our planet's 
biological balance. However, in recent years, scientists have 
been telling us that certain species are increasingly at risk of 
becoming extinct, and that there is an increase in the number of 
endangered species or species that are at great risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me describe the present status. There are 340 species at 
risk in Canada, 15 are extirpated, 87 are endangered, 75 are 
threatened, 151 are vulnerable and of the 97 whose status is 
being reassessed, 27 will be closer to becoming extinct in the 
coming years. The situation is alarming and we must immediately 
look at what Bill C-33 will realistically allow us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the increasing rate of extinction of some species, as I 
just mentioned, I admit that we are facing a serious problem. 
The Bloc Quebecois is showing its concern by having several 
members speak out against Bill C-33. It is imperative that we 
react quickly but effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before reacting, though, some questions must be asked. The 
Minister of the Environment is telling us that the bill cannot 
be amended. What utter contempt for the committee that will be 
struck to study Bill C-33. What utter contempt for the opposition. 
Today, all the opposition parties have taken a stand against 
this bill; they want some regional issues to be dealt with. 
Environmental groups are opposed to this bill and they want 
some specific changes. 
The Minister of the Environment is ignoring all these 
objections, as well as those made by industries with daily 
activities which impact directly or indirectly on the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some basic questions must be answered. Will Bill C-33 result in 
better protection and can it really be enforced? Will the bill 
really help to increase the protection of our ecosystems and of 
their endangered species? These are the first questions to be 
asked. For me and for a number of representatives of various sectors 
affected by this serious issue concerning the survival of 
endangered species, the answer is no. This is what the Bloc 
Quebecois, through its objections, wants to say to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of a better protection for endangered species is a 
principle the Bloc Quebecois can readily endorse, contrary to 
what the government party would have us believe. Incidentally, 
government members are quite silent today about Bill C-33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not convinced that Bill C-33 will protect endangered 
species any better. We are just not sure. Indeed, we oppose this 
bill because it is a direct intrusion in many areas under the 
jurisdiction of Quebec and other provinces, instead of an effort 
to have a true dialogue with the provinces and true respect for 
what is being done in the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it duplicates Quebec legislation that has been in force 
since 1989, legislation that works just fine and has had a 
significant impact in Quebec. One again, this bill is granting 
the federal government excessive powers at the expense of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the preamble of the bill indicates that the protection 
of species is a shared responsibility, everything leads us to 
believe that the minister has the power to impose his vision 
and the vision of cabinet when he deems appropriate. The 
minister is also putting himself in a vulnerable position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very well aware that there are various lobbies around 
whose job it is to represent the interests of certain companies 
whose actions might pose a threat to certain endangered species. 
Cabinet and the minister are there to decide whether or not the 
legislation should be enforced.  It is very dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, its legislation would automatically take 
precedence over existing provincial legislation, even when 
habitats are entirely under provincial jurisdiction. We know 
that such an approach is unacceptable and will do nothing to 
promote the much desired balance in protecting our threatened 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10 says that the minister may enter into an agreement 
with respect to the administration of any provision of the Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, clause 34(2) under general prohibitions, 
clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
Minister, by order, provide that sections 32 and 33 apply in 
lands in a province that are not federal lands— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the Bloc Quebecois does not agree.  As if that 
were not enough, clause 34(3) states that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) The Minister must recommend that the order be made if the 
Minister is of the opinion that the laws of the province do not 
protect the species. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So cabinet will influence the minister.  By extension, the 
minister and his office may be heavily influenced by various 
companies that dump chemicals into waterways and lakes.  We are 
therefore unable to support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see how the party in power really operates in this 
legislation to protect endangered species.  We know that it got 
a <I>D</I> minus and yet it wants to tell the provinces what to do. 
What a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government fails to get a passing grade when 
it comes to protecting endangered species but it wants to tell 
others what to do, just like the Prime Minister offering advice 
on poverty at international conferences. 
His own government, for the last seven years, has torn away the 
social safety net, has axed the employment insurance program and 
denied the provinces the amounts they need for social housing, 
and these are but a few of the measures it has taken. If I were 
to mention every way in which the federal government has backed 
out of social programs, the list could be very long. Here we 
have a government that is trying to teach us a lesson when it is 
in no position to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the purpose of Bill C-33: the government is 
trying to tell provinces what to do. Some provinces definitely 
have nothing to learn from the federal government, as they could 
be leaders and show the federal government how to be more 
effective on its own lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment is absolutely inflexible: He 
will not entertain any amendments to Bill C-33.  That is what he 
said. 
We know that the pulp and paper industry, some environmental 
groups, the opposition here today and even some members of the 
Liberal Party of Canada have told the minister that this bill 
will bring no real solution without major amendments: They have 
even said that this bill is seriously flawed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two members of the Liberal Party of Canada have also said that this 
measure disregards a list of 333 species identified by a 
committee struck in 1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the government wants to give lessons without knowing how the 
provinces have enforced certain provisions of their own 
legislation on endangered species. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I notice that members opposite seem 
to be a bit embarrassed about this bill because the Liberals are 
making no attempt in the House to defend it.  I am not really 
surprised that they do not want to be associated with their 
handiwork in a public way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement and penalties provisions of the bill epitomize 
the contempt the government has for due process and individual 
rights.  Why does the government always have to use the big 
sledgehammer to come forward with legislation which, we must 
admit, has a wonderful intent?  I am sure its intentions are 
fine. I agree with them but not with the means.  With what the 
government is proposing to do and the jeopardy it will place 
rural people in, our farmers, ranchers and woodlot owners will 
have to live with draconian legislation which contains provisions 
contrary to every historical piece of jurisprudence that I can 
find, and certainly contrary to the spirit of common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that?  Provisions in the legislation for searches 
without warrants of any building other than a dwelling house are 
almost word for word the same as in the notorious firearms 
legislation, Bill C-68.  Even the condition that a warrant to 
search a dwelling may be obtained merely on the basis that there 
are reasonable grounds for believing that entry will be otherwise 
refused are incorporated in this bill.  This bill also copies the 
provisions in Bill C-68 that make it a criminal offence to fail 
to assist an officer searching one's property or to withhold 
self-incriminating information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 86 to 91 must have been written and compiled by the same 
folks who wrote the firearms legislation because paragraph after 
paragraph in the enforcement section are absolutely identical in 
wording to the other bill.  This is not a coincidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that this bill is to protect endangered species.  I think 
it is here to protect a predatory species, namely the lawyers who 
have written it for lawyers.  Lawyers will become fantastically 
wealthy trying to defend innocent landowners against the 
provisions of this insane legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are the provisions for search and seizure and all those 
good things totally contrary to the spirit of Canadian law, but 
the prescribed penalties for killing, molesting or trafficking in 
endangered species will be extraordinarily severe.  This is a 
country noted for leniency for most criminal sanctions, but with 
this legislation an individual may be fined up to $250,000 and/or 
imprisoned for up to five years, even if he does not deliberately 
commit the offence.  Even if it is through negligence or 
accident, these penalties are available.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same penalties are available for “destroying the nest or 
den of an endangered creature” again even through negligence. A 
person who accidentally runs over the nest of a bird which is 
supposedly endangered could be in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I go out on my ranch, which incidentally teems with game, to 
check my cattle and I accidentally run over a species of plant 
which is deemed to be endangered, or even if my saddle horse 
steps on such a plant, under the terms of this legislation I can 
be charged.  I can be charged not for some statutory offence, but 
with a crime. Why does the government want to make criminals of 
ordinary citizens every time they turn around? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implications of the legislation for farmers are really 
alarming.  Equally alarming to the possibility that one might 
accidentally destroy a nest or den is the provision that the 
penalties I have been quoting can be applied to anyone who 
destroys any part of the deemed critical habitat of an endangered 
species.  There does not even have to be any endangered species 
present for this law to come into full force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the indulgence of the House to read from an analysis 
of the bill which was prepared by Mr. David Pope, a prominent 
Calgary attorney who, as I do, cherishes civil liberty and the 
common law.  Here is what Mr. Pope has to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offences and penalties for actions against plants, animals 
and organisms that are deemed species at risk and the lands which 
make up their habitat are unlike any found in Canadian criminal 
law.  These are not offences of murder, arson, theft or rape but 
are for harming or harassing a plant, animal or organism or 
destroying a portion of its habitat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pope then describes the listed environmental crimes as 
“strict liability offences”.  That is to say that an accuser 
need only say that the offence was committed and the person 
accused must then prove that he did not do it.  This is called, 
in legal terms, reverse onus.  It is almost never used in 
criminal law.  In the past it has been virtually unheard of, and 
the test for conviction is much less than the usual standard of 
the criminal law.  This is a dangerous change, especially when 
one realizes that it is aimed directly at ranchers and farmers 
who are usually not seen as criminals in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competent minister has authority to appoint eco-police who 
have the same powers as a peace officer but no training.  These 
eco-police only have to justify themselves to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, since I see my time has nearly elapsed, there is a 
provision in Bill C-33 for anyone 18 years or older and resident 
of Canada to start an investigation against a rancher or farmer 
for any of the offences that we have been mentioning.  Any 
special interest group or anyone with a grudge against a 
particular farmer may launch such a prosecution and can do so in 
complete anonymity.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the act states that the minister may not 
release the name of the plaintiff.  Anyone else in a criminal 
court in Canada is allowed to face his or her accuser.  Even 
murderers have that right, but someone who may have accidentally 
or negligently damaged an endangered species habitat does not 
have that right.  He or she cannot bring an accuser into open 
court face to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the bill can be fixed in its present state. We 
would have to eliminate so many sections to bring the enforcement 
and penalty provisions into line with Canadian custom and other 
Canadian law that we would virtually gut the bill.  I would 
respectfully suggest that that is what should happen.  Perhaps 
that is why government members are not defending the bill.  Maybe 
that is their intent.  I pray that it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the drawing board.  Let us get it right.  Let 
us protect endangered species without beating up on our own 
citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker. it is with 
pleasure that I rise today to speak to a bill as significant as 
this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not deal with the issue of endangered species 
such as the members of the Progressive Conservative Party or the 
NDP. As a matter of fact, it deals with endangered wildlife 
species, an issue that is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are debating Bill C-33. This is a very significant 
bill. Its content and purpose meet a desperate need. As hon. 
members are aware, there are some 340 wildlife species at risk 
in Canada. 
A number of these species are already extinct. Others are in a 
rather critical state. There are 87 species that are considered 
endangered, while 75 are threatened and 151 are vulnerable, for 
a total of some 340 wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this is an important issue not only in Canada, but 
also all over the world. There were several conferences, 
including the 1992 Rio Summit, which brought together 
representatives from different countries who looked into the 
issue of endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental pollution, combined with all the issues related to 
water and atmospheric pollution, plays a role in the extinction 
of animal species. We ought to make every effort to ensure their 
preservation. That is why there was a summit in Rio in 1992 and 
why Canada signed the convention on biological diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, that is what prompted Canada, in 1996, to hold a 
conference to reach an agreement on the environment with the 
provinces. This was the agreement on the protection of 
endangered species, which led to the introduction, by the 
Minister of the Environment, of Bill C-65, an act respecting the 
protection of wildlife species in Canada from extirpation or 
extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation formed the basis of the bill we are examining 
today, Bill C-33. It is more or less the same bill with a few 
changes. In fact, this is the first time that the federal 
government has tried to pass legislation to address the issue of 
endangered species.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government's first bill, but it completely misses 
the mark. We even wonder why the federal government introduced 
such unclear legislation which has drawn so much criticism from 
all sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when the former version of the bill, Bill C-65—and the 
federal government was aware at the time of criticism that the 
bill was inadequate—was introduced, opposition to it came from 
all of the provinces, not only from Quebec, but also from Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, the Yukon and the Northwest 
Territories. 
Everyone in fact was opposed to the principle that seems to be 
reincarnated in Bill C-33, namely the lack of harmonization with 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill represented an approach that did not respect provincial 
jurisdictions and lacked harmonization between federal and 
provincial jurisdictions. We do know that the federal government 
has powers in this area, it has legislated this area, but so 
have the provinces. The provinces have the tools to better 
protect the habitats of endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government does have some degree of jurisdiction, 
but the ideal would be of course to have some degree of 
harmonization between both levels of government. 
However, once again the federal government seems unable, even 
when it would be very important to do so, to agree with the 
provinces. Quebec is not the only province to criticize the 
approach of the federal government under Bill C-33. One must 
wonder whether it is not always trying to create 
federal-provincial conflicts, as illustrated by this piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fair amount of opposition to this bill. Without 
referring to all the clauses—there are 141 of them dealing with 
various definitions—I can say there are two major issues that 
bother us, and that bother all the opposition parties, all the 
environmental groups and even some Liberal members. 
The federal government wants too much power to enforce this law, 
and this puts into question the effectiveness of the law and may 
even threaten wildlife species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to impose its vision, a vision 
which, once again, does not respect provincial jurisdiction and 
which seems to imply that the federal law will take precedence 
over provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is off to a bad start, obviously, because a law 
cannot be effective when it is creates a problem in 
federal-provincial relations. It is obvious that the government 
is not at all on the right track. This is not a political 
matter. It is a matter of responding to a need other countries 
have been aware of for years. Time is of the essence. The more 
we wait before enforcing such legislation, the more endangered 
species will vanish. 
That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, in this bill, the federal government does not 
respect provincial jurisdiction, is seeking too much 
discretionary power and even, which is totally absurd, wants to 
let cabinet rather than experts, people who know this field, 
determine which species are endangered. It is totally crazy to 
play politics with a bill that deals with very scientific data.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to involve people who are familiar with the 
situation.  People who are in the know about environmental 
issues and the protection of endangered species are opposed to 
this bill.  All, or very nearly all, environmental groups are 
totally opposed, because it is ineffective.  It is useless, even 
dangerous, they say.  It is dangerous in the sense that it does 
not respond to the need to effectively protect endangered 
species because instead of protecting them it creates a 
federal-provincial conflict once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even stakeholders such as the pulp and paper industry and the 
mining association are opposed to this bill as well.  Imagine, 
there are even Liberals on the government side who have examined 
this bill, and not just any old Liberals.  The member for York 
North, for instance, was one of them.  On June 12, 2000, she 
said “We will do nothing to protect species at risk unless this 
bill leaves committee as a good, effective piece of 
legislation”.  However, the minister has already said he had no 
intention of making changes to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for York North, who is incidentally very 
involved in environmental issues, also said “The House must 
support legislation that is strong, fair, effective and makes 
biological sense. Unfortunately Bill C-33 is wanting”.  These are 
the words of the member for York North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same day, June 12, the member for Lac-Saint-Louis who, in 
another life, served as Quebec's minister of the environment 
under Premier Bourassa, said “Instead of being recognized as 
being the final list produced by scientists of the highest 
repute who have worked tirelessly over the last two decades, the 
list will now be subject to the discretion of cabinet”.  What 
business does cabinet have interfering in these decisions, which 
must obviously be based on scientific experience?  It is only 
common sense that the experience required should be scientific 
in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Louis went on to say “I find that 
terribly ironic—We are not even starting with the roll of 
the list of the 339 species identified.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a glaring fault in the law. Without a list, there can be 
no protection against this approach, which was why the Sierra 
Club said that, if the bill were passed, it would be an 
international embarrassment to Canada. 
I would also point out that all the opposition parties are 
opposed to the bill, as well as the government of Quebec 
obviously.  Once again, we feel there is duplication and 
interference.  The federal government does not seem to know 
where its jurisdiction ends.  This bill must be killed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be speaking to this bill today.  I agree 
with many of the comments made by my Bloc colleague, particularly 
in the area of interference on the part of the federal government 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  We share a lot of those 
concerns in that area.  The government quite frankly does not 
respect provincial jurisdiction as is set out in our 
constitution.  That is very unfortunate because it is not 
particularly productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about protecting species at risk.  I know that I 
and the people in my constituency certainly take that seriously. 
I know my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance also take this 
issue seriously.  We are concerned about protecting species at 
risk.  The approach the government has taken will not do that. 
It will not be effective in any way in protecting species at risk 
because instead of using a co-operative approach, instead of 
ensuring that there will be fair compensation for any loss of 
property or loss of use of property, the government has taken a 
heavy-handed approach with large penalties and fines and large 
potential jail sentences for those who do not act in the way that 
it lays out in the legislation.  It has used a big stick rather 
than a true co-operative approach which would by far be the most 
productive approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could cite dozens of examples from around the world, including 
here in Canada and in the United States, where a co-operative 
approach has been extremely successful in protecting a species 
which a particular group has decided should be protected.  It has 
been proven to be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United States endangered species legislation has proved 
that this heavy-handed intrusive approach with large penalties 
does not work.  It does not work because people who may find they 
have a species at risk on their property or on property that they 
are using will not report that and will not work with government 
in protecting those species because of the fear of losing their 
property or losing the right to enjoy it or losing income from 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been here seven years and this is the government's third 
attempt to put forth legislation.  In spite of the fact that it 
failed twice before to put forth legislation to protect species 
at risk, it has taken the same approach again, a failed approach 
and an approach which does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about my background and where I am 
coming from in terms of my most urgent concerns with this 
legislation.  In my constituency of Lakeland, in east central 
Alberta, there are many farms.  It is a rural constituency. Also, 
there is an oil and gas industry which is a resource industry 
that is very concerned about this particular legislation as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up on a mixed farm by Lloydminster.  I bought a farm in 
1974.  I took agriculture at university.  I have a bachelor of 
science in agriculture degree.  I bought a farm with 100% 
financing, so I know what it is like to try to make a living on a 
farm.  I know it is extremely difficult.  I know there were years 
when I wondered whether I was going to make it another year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also worked as a farm economist and a business management 
consultant with farmers, first seasonally and then even on a full 
time basis as I farmed to help support this farm.  Too often I 
was at a kitchen table where the children and their mother were 
in tears and where the father was there with a vacant look in his 
eyes because they knew they were about to lose the family farm. 
Too often I was at the kitchen table in situations like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a promise to myself at that time that it would be my 
mission to make sure that things improve for farmers so that it 
did not have to be like that any more.  It is still my mission 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to stand by and allow a piece of legislation 
which takes a heavy-handed approach which will cause farmers 
should it go ahead to lose their farms when otherwise they would 
not and one which will cause a loss of income to farmers which 
they cannot afford.  I am not going to stand by and allow that to 
happen because I came here to fight on behalf of farmers and 
others against legislation such as this.  We all want legislation 
which will work to protect species at risk.  This bill will not. 
It will make things worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have proven over the years that if we co-operate and 
work with them, they will do everything they can to protect 
species at risk.  They have done that and proven it.  This 
legislation is going in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have told me privately that if this legislation goes 
through what it will lead to.  If they should identify a species 
at risk understanding that they could lose their property without 
compensation or should they lose the income from a part of their 
land which has been designated as the habitat for a species at 
risk, knowing that could happen, they are not going to want to be 
particularly co-operative.  There is no guarantee of compensation 
and there is certainly no guarantee of compensation at market 
value.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it will be counterproductive and will lead to them 
ignoring that species at risk or worse.  It will be a negative 
thing and that is not what we are looking for.  The legislation 
simply is not productive.  It is not a positive way of dealing 
with this problem.  It has failed twice before because of that 
and now the government is introducing the same type of 
legislation again.  It will fail again and that is not what we 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about farmers and those in the resource industries who 
will be impacted by this legislation should it pass as it is.  I 
would like the environment minister to explain the situation to 
his friends.  They may have cottages or may have finally, after 
years of work, managed to build the house they want on a shore 
someplace in an ideal spot.  They have worked their lifetime to 
finally achieve this and they value it so greatly.  What would 
happen if a species identified at risk was an found on their 
land?  I want the minister to explain to those people whom he 
does not know what would happen if a species at risk was found on 
the land around their cottages or on some other property they own 
or use to earn a living.  I would like the minister to explain to 
them what would happen in terms of compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister has refused, despite being asked so many times, 
that should that situation arise, should that property be 
confiscated or should the use of that property be limited as a 
means to protect a species at risk, to guarantee that there will 
be compensation at fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message has come across very clearly that there will not be 
compensation at fair market value.  I want him to explain to his 
friends when they lose their cottages or lose the right to enjoy 
it or lose their property or the right to use it for the purpose 
of their business, why he thinks they should lose that right and 
lose their property without at least a guarantee of compensation 
at fair market value.  Yet no such guarantee has been 
forthcoming.  In fact, the message is very clear that there will 
not be compensation at fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a vague way, the legislation talks about the possibility for 
compensation.  It does not say there will be compensation and 
nowhere does it guarantee that there will be compensation at fair 
market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want put into this legislation, not in regulation, before 
it ever passes this House, is a clause which guarantees, in an 
ironclad way, that should anyone lose property or lose the right 
to enjoyment of property or to income from property as a result 
of a plan to protect species at risk, that they will be 
compensated at fair market value.  Along with some other changes 
that will help lead to a co-operative approach to dealing with 
the problem.  Under that kind of situation, we can protect and 
will protect species at risk in a meaningful way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to add some comments to this bill 
which is important and timely.  There are few people in the 
country and in the Chamber who would not have a soft spot in 
their hearts for species at risk in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill aims at its very root to prevent wild 
species in Canada from becoming extinct or lost from the wild and 
to in many ways move towards securing their recovery in their 
natural habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small background to this bill, in 1992 the former Progressive 
Conservative government signed what was then and went on to 
become the first industrial country to ratify the United Nations 
Convention on Biological Diversity. 
That convention included in its body the commitment for 
legislation and/or regulatory provisions for the protection of 
threatened and endangered species.  It was certainly a worthwhile 
cause then and is equally so today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Liberal government introduced legislation to fulfil 
the commitment made earlier by the Progressive Conservative 
government.  That commitment came about through Bill C-65, the 
Canadian Endangered Species Protection Act.  That bill was 
roundly criticized by environmentalists, scientists and 
landowners at the time.  Sadly, because of parliament recessing, 
it died on the order paper at the House committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 is modified and renamed from Bill C-65.  It represents 
the second legislative attempt by the government to fulfil 
Canada's commitment that was made earlier.  According to the 
government, Bill C-33 is intended to complete and complement 
existing provincial and territorial legislation on endangered 
species.  It would also fulfil the federal government's 
commitment under the federal-provincial accord for the protection 
of species at risk, signed in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The substance of the bill calls for protection of various 
species that are named and identified as being at risk of 
extinction.  It prohibits the killing, harming, harassing, 
capturing or taking of species officially listed on a document. 
That list is there to signify those species in Canada that are 
endangered or threatened with the destruction of their own being 
or of their residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The species at risk legislation provides for emergency authority 
to list types of species and to take action to prohibit the 
destruction of critical habitat for those listed species and 
those that are identified as in some imminent danger.  It will 
also provide for the recovery, the strategy and the action to 
identify the critical habitat of threatened or endangered 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there is a need for a holistic approach that will 
identify the species being threatened.  It goes hand in hand to 
say that we have to identify where they live in a strategy to 
prevent further harm and to preserve and complement their 
recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada is 
given legal status under this act.  It will continue to operate 
at arm's length from the government.  It will assess and classify 
the status of wildlife species.  There is a great deal of ability 
for outside participation beyond simple government control. These 
assessments will be published and will be brought about in the 
form of a basis for the minister's recommendations to cabinet on 
the list of wildlife species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Progressive Conservative Party's perspective this is 
where the bill falls down to a large degree.  The final 
determination as to what species will appear on the list is still 
very much entirely in the hands of cabinet.  It is entirely at 
its discretion.  That is fine in some areas, but in this instance 
it is specialized and in need of particular input from 
non-governmental bodies outside government to make this 
determination.  Yet the government has retained exclusive control 
over this list and the determination of this list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to who comprises the working group that is very 
much opposed to the government's preservation and exclusive 
jurisdiction over this decision.  It includes the Canadian Pulp 
and Paper Association, the Mining Association of Canada, the 
Sierra Club of Canada, the Canadian Nature Federation and the 
Canadian Wildlife Federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their position is that they are in much better position to 
determine which species should or should not appear on that list. 
They feel that by cabinet retaining control over this exclusive 
decision it very much remains a political issue when it should 
not be such.  It should very much be based on science, on 
tangible evidence that can be documented and put forward to 
determine whether species fit into the specialized category of 
being on the verge of extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining and pulp and paper industries and environmentalists 
are often at odds with one another.  Some would go so far to say 
they are often at each other's throats.  If they can come to an 
agreement and a consensus that they can work together to make the 
list viable, it is in the country's interest and very much 
something the government should defer to this group.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost trite to say that the Progressive Conservative 
Party recognizes that extinction is forever.  There is no turning 
back when a species has been eliminated from the planet.  As 
such, we believe that all Canadians very much support strong 
legislation that will preserve a species and in some cases will 
take very drastic measures to ensure the preservation of a 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status that has been given or would be designated is 
something that is a matter of scientific fact and not political 
choice.  This is the reason the Progressive Conservative Party 
believes that to be effective the legislation has to take action 
based upon science and based upon evidence.  This is not 
something that is political or partisan.  This is an issue of 
utmost importance.  It has to be placed in the hands of those 
best able to make the determination of what species may be at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also committed to protecting the rights of landowners and 
users who believe that no single individual or entity should bear 
the burden of recovery when the benefits of a species' protection 
for all society are to be appreciated.  There are occasions when 
the natural habitat of a certain species may be very much in the 
hands of a private landowner.  There has to be some accommodation 
and perhaps some compensation involved when the government steps 
in and makes a determination that everything in its power has to 
be done to preserve the species and to ensure that their habitats 
are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we as a party believe the bulk of the decision 
should be left to the stakeholders when designing this recovery 
plan and not to cabinet.  The party also recognizes that if an 
endangered species is found in a given area, landowners must be 
doing something right and should in some instances be given the 
tools to continue doing so or in some instances to make that 
environment right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree, support and recognize that many volunteers and 
voluntary measures have fully endorsed the stewardship as a means 
of providing protection for species in their critical habitat. We 
endorse a graduated approach to the stewardship and a full tool 
kit of materials designed to engage the stakeholders positively 
in the process.  There must be an ongoing process of examination 
of factors such as examination of the habitat of the species and 
monitoring of the numbers of a certain species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again it is obvious that this will be based upon scientific 
evidence that can be gathered in the field by those who have very 
specialized training in some instances.  It is very obvious to 
me, and I suspect to all, that persons have spent virtually their 
entire lives studying certain species.  I know that this is true 
in the maritime provinces of certain species of fish.  I suspect 
it is true all over the world that individuals have made a very 
clear and very strong commitment to the preservation of some of 
our most natural and beautiful species on the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party believes that simply making criminals out 
of landowners will not save endangered species.  We have to 
include the stakeholders, scientists, landowners and governments 
in a role of enforcement.  We cannot leave this decision simply 
in the hands of political masters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one instance where it should be taken out of the 
political realm and based solely on science and individuals who 
have the know-how, the appreciation and the understanding of the 
status of species that may be literally on the verge of 
extinction from the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are four components of the bill, but there are certainly 
problems and areas in which there could be improvement. I hope 
and certainly expect that we may hear from the minister on the 
issue in the very near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One contentious element has been the minister's intransigence 
and unwillingness to yield on this point.  He has said publicly 
that under his stewardship there would be no amendments to the 
legislation, that it would be an all or nothing approach.  Early 
indications now are that he is recanting that position.  We look 
forward to working with him at the committee stage and improving 
this important bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
despite the fact that the preamble to the bill states that 
responsibility is shared between the two orders of government in 
matters of species protection, the bill is not drafted in these 
terms.  It does not reflect the reality, namely that habitat 
protection essentially concerns the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, this legislation would automatically take precedence 
over existing provincial legislation even when habitats are 
entirely under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example.  Clause 34 provides clearly that “The Governor in 
Council may, on the recommendation of the minister, by order, 
provide that certain sections apply to lands in a province that 
are not federal lands”.  In addition, the minister must recommend 
that the order be made if he is of the opinion that the laws of 
the province do not protect the species.  Of course, the bill 
provides as well that the minister does not recommend that the 
governor in council make an order until he has consulted the 
appropriate provincial minister.  Nevertheless, only the word 
consultation is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example.  The choice of terms with respect to recovery 
strategies is also of some concern as it applies to the 
jurisdiction of the provinces in the matter.  Indeed clause 39 
provides that the competent minister will prepare the recovery 
strategy with the appropriate provincial minister to the extent 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to action plans, in which case again, it is 
provided that co-operation will be to the extent possible.  More 
particularly, the entire section on protecting the critical 
habitat allows the government to develop codes of practice and 
impose national standards or guidelines, when the federal 
government has no legal authority over most of the lands 
concerned and no power over the management of the resources in 
these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill encroaches squarely on the jurisdiction of the 
provinces and excludes their making any real and direct 
contribution in the process.  Existing laws are ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just the way it is with so many other recent laws and 
will be the same with future ones, we have no doubt.  This law 
does not respect provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point needs to be raised. 
Most environmental groups are opposed to the bill introduced by 
the Minister of the Environment, even though these groups should 
be the minister's allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most stakeholders feel that the proposed legislation does not go 
far enough. Even organizations representing the industry think 
that this bill will not provide greater protection for species 
and will not help them determine what they should to protect 
species living on the sites of their operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the main problem raised by environmental groups has more to 
do with the fact that the decisions concerning the designation 
of species will be made by the minister and by cabinet, rather 
than by scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lawyer from the Sierra Club strongly condemns such an approach. 
She condemns the fact that such discretionary power about the 
designation of species is given to politicians, not to 
scientists. The minister is being criticized for resorting to a 
piecemeal approach dictated by cabinet, instead of a global 
approach supported by compelling legal measures if an agreement 
cannot be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the position of the government of Quebec, which is 
directly concerned, on Bill C-33? As soon as the federal Minister 
of the Environment introduced his bill, his Quebec counterpart, 
Paul Bégin, said that the proposed legislation was just another 
example of useless duplication for Quebec. Indeed, the Quebec 
minister indicated that Bill C-33 sought not only to create a 
safety net for endangered species and their habitat on federal 
lands, but also on lands all over Quebec, regardless of whether the 
lands are under federal jurisdiction or not.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is a federal responsibility to pass legislation to 
protect migratory species, the federal government has no 
constitutional power over habitat management in provincial 
territory.  Obviously, as far as Quebec is concerned, there is 
no question of the federal government invading areas of 
jurisdiction that do not belong to it and dictating what 
approach is to be used to protect Quebec ecosystems when Quebec 
already has legislation aimed at protecting endangered species 
and their habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec believes in fact that legislation such 
as that proposed by Bill C-33 might be acceptable if it were to 
exclude any species or habitat under provincial jurisdiction and 
were applied to provincial territory if, and only if, the 
province or territory were to specifically request it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec passed its own legislation on this in 
the late 1980s.  In fact, Bill C-33 represents a direct overlap 
with Quebec legislation which has been in place since 1989 and is 
working well, with conclusive results already evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill therefore represents a risk of creating more red tape 
instead of making it possible for limited resources to be 
properly channelled into the right things.  The government of 
Quebec already has legislation in the areas addressed by Bill 
C-33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we recognize that the environment is a shared 
responsibility, it is becoming increasingly clear to us that the 
federal government is ignoring this fact, flying completely in 
the face of genuine environmental harmonization between the 
various levels of government.  It is introducing legislation in 
an area which is outside its jurisdiction and liable to again 
bring about unnecessary duplication in areas which are already 
handled by the provinces and which affect their lands and 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the federal government calls a double safety net, for 
example, two 
levels of government operating in the same area of jurisdiction, 
in fact waters down the accountability of both and needlessly 
complicates the assignment of responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing new under the sun in Ottawa. 
With its arrogance, incompetence, and scorn for provincial 
jurisdiction, Bill C-33 is typical of traditional Liberal 
policy. But let us be fair.  Whales, a protected species, seem 
to be beyond the reach of those whom Ottawa claims come under 
its exclusive jurisdiction, provincial jurisdiction 
notwithstanding.  This was an oversight I am sure.  Henceforth, 
I suppose that whales will sport a maple leaf.  The oversight 
has been corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need hardly point out that our party will be voting against 
this bill, with its fresh demonstration of this government's 
incompetence and arrogance.  Only sovereignty can save us from 
the mess of Canada's federal system.

has tried legislation like this and it is the third time it will

promote confrontation.  Nobody in his or her right mind would 
design a bill that confronts the people in my constituency and in 
the constituency of the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands, who did an excellent job of making this 
presentation.  The bill is as ill-fated as the two former 
attempts.  It will bring about the same animosity among innocent 
people as did Bill C-68, I can ensure hon. members of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from coast to coast agree that it is important to 
protect our wildlife. 
Canadians are enraged when people overfish.  They are enraged 
when animals are hunted out of season.  They are enraged when 
animals are hunted at night.  Canadians aim for conservation. 
These same Canadians are delighted to work with any government to 
protect endangered species.  This agreement must not come from 
the top down as this legislation has.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will make criminals out of people who are completely 
innocent. Within my constituency there are huge areas of ranch 
land.  I suspect that without the knowledge of the person who has 
running cattle on that land, there could well be endangered plant 
species. If by chance that same rancher puts up a new fence and 
unknowingly drills through one of the endangered plant species, 
he is automatically a criminal.  That is the way the bill is 
written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to most laws, although the individual knows nothing 
about the offence, he has to attempt to prove himself innocent. 
This is not like ordinary law where all people are innocent until 
proven guilty.  The fines are so outrageously heavy that if they 
were enacted, the individual would not only have to sell his 
entire herd, but he would have to sell his ranch as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because a lunatic went mad and shot some girls at École 
Polytechnique, the government overreacted and brought in Bill 
C-68.  To this day it has had no value to anyone except to make 
criminals out of a lot of duck hunters across Canada.  It has not 
solved one crime. However, some innocent young fellows were 
denied the right to have FACs for their rifles because their 
divorced wives said they were dangerous people. The government 
brags about taking the guns away from these nasty people who have 
never even had a traffic offence in their lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is going to fail. The legislation will use the 
government's criminal law powers on innocent people.  I wish all 
Canadians would listen to the fear expressed by some 
environmentalists who probably have never seen one of those 
plants.  This small group has encouraged the minister to bring 
this bill in.  Where did the minister choose to announce the 
legislation?  He made the announcement not in the prairies, not 
in a city, not when parliament was sitting, but in the new 
territory of Nunavut during the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time the bill came before the House, Dan Gardner, who 
is on the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> editorial board, wrote “Any 
government that is serious about saving endangered species has to 
compensate landowners for economic losses.  To do otherwise is to 
pit people against animals and when that happens animals lose 
every time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like everyone who is concerned about this to recognize 
that if the bill is passed, co-operation is gone.  If the 
government takes the bill back and consults with people who will 
be affected by the bill, it will get wholehearted co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, in facing 
confrontation, is preaching co-operation.  This bill does not 
co-operate. 
No farmer, no rancher, no farm organization, no cattle 
organization to my knowledge were ever approached by the 
government before it brought in this legislation.  As a result of 
that, it is going to fail.

that property.  That is not co-operation; that is dictatorship.

amendments will make the bill palatable.  Read the bill and see 
what powers it gives to the government. It could destroy people's 
lives overnight.  Property could be seized overnight.

be incarcerated because of the bill.  Am I being extreme?  Not at 
all.  I urge members to read the bill themselves.

them, I know they do not agree with the bill.

I am pleased to rise today at second reading of Bill C-33, an act 
respecting the protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start my remarks, I would like to mention that the 
International Fund for Animal Welfare held a precursory event 
when this bill was introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They allowed MPs to officially adopt an endangered species. 
Dr. Rick Smith, the Canadian director of the international fund 
for animal and plant welfare, gave each MP a certificate on an 
endangered species and an information booklet on its habitat and 
the dangers threatening its survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told members about the following survey: a Pollar survey 
conducted in May of 1999 confirmed that 97% of Canadians 
believed that laws to protect endangered species are 
important.  In addition, 85% felt that Canada's legislation 
should be the most rigorous and complete in the world.  The 
survey results were consistent across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself received an adoption certificate making me responsible 
for protecting the Anticosti aster, a species whose survival and 
recovery depend on global and stringent legislation on the 
protection of species at risk.  The Anticosti aster is one of 
the 313 Canadian species in danger of disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that two of our eminent colleagues from the 
other side of the House adopted well known mammals: the beluga 
and the blue beluga.  For the two of them, the war of the 
belugas would obviously not have happened.  The members have 
only to consult their list.

the decline in biodiversity. One of these factors is the

is also a threat to biodiversity, as is the increase in pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the government has already introduced 
Bill C-65, an act respecting the protection of species at risk in 
Canada which died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can play a role in protecting wildlife 
species under certain statutes such as those dealing with 
fisheries or with our national parks. However no federal 
legislation exists for this specific purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, Bill C-33 would be the first Canadian legal instrument 
dealing specifically with the protection of wildlife species at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that close to 70,000 known species have their 
habitat in Canada, many of which are found only in Canada. The 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, or 
COSEWIC, has designated 340 wildlife species as at risk in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This organization, established in 1978, is composed of 
representatives from every government agency, province and 
territory, as well as four national conservation agencies. It is 
the main player in the protection of species and it is 
responsible for establishing an index of the endangered species 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, through clause 36, the bill forces the provinces who 
identify some species as threatened species not listed as 
endangered species by COSEWIC to apply the same restrictions to 
their own species as those imposed on designated species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so, the federal government is assuming the right to 
impose its own way of protecting species. 
By giving discretionary powers to the Minister of the 
Environment, the bill does not respect the division of powers as 
stated in the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 interferes in an area under provincial jurisdiction and 
excludes the provinces from any real and direct input into the 
process. 
The protection of species can only be effective if habitats are 
also protected, but it is the responsibility of the provinces to 
manage these issues in co-operation with the various 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may be appropriate for the federal government to 
legislate to protect migrating species, this government has no 
constitutional authority regarding the management of habitats on 
provincial lands.

However we do not believe that Bill C-33 will improve the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will speak briefly to Bill C-33 because for the people 
who live in cities and are really driving this bill it is very 
easy to legislate away someone else's property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a moment I will read into the record a letter I received from 
one of my constituents, Earl Campbell, who will be greatly 
affected once Bill C-33 is passed.  He wrote a very good letter 
to the minister on April 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pity we do not have the same rights to property as 
American citizens have.  Our constitution, unfortunately, does 
not give us property rights so it is possible for a government, 
like the Liberal government, to just run roughshod over people's 
property rights.  It can take away something for which people may 
have spent their whole lives saving to purchase some sort of land 
that they could retire on only to find that a government can take 
it away without even giving reasonable compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now read Mr. Campbell's letter into the record which was 
sent to the Minister of the Environment on April 25, 2000.  Mr. 
Campbell indicated that he had read the bill which he had located 
it on the Green Lane website.  He read again the executive 
summary from December 1999 provided by the government and the 
material in a folder that had been sent to him by the minister, 
obviously promoting the bill.

I will continue with Mr. Campbell's letter at this point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that you do not expect that this land use legislation 
is going to affect you personally, or restrict your future income 
or lifestyle, or you would be more concerned with the draconian 
nature of the regulations already proposed, and the absence of 
any appeal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the talk in the world about what you or the Canadian 
government may do for the environment still leaves me in the same 
unenviable position; namely, some of my property is used 
seasonally by species listed in the lists in Sec 129 under 
regulations so far established, ironically enough because I 
protected some of their habitat under my control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 says the minister may compensate individuals whose 
property use may or will have to be changed, making an economic 
difference to the individual owner.  Nowhere does it say the 
Minister must compensate private individuals, adequately, 
completely, and promptly, for loss of use or benefits of their 
lands.  Nor is there any provision for compensating the landowner 
for the costs arising from any damage caused by empowered 
officials entering or crossing private property as an access to 
other property which they may wish to enter or inspect; nor other 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This difference may be small to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not small to me.  It is the difference between careful 
modest enjoyment of my retirement years and a penurious 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that I am not alone in this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, there are powers in the proposed bill which allow the 
Minister (or apparently even persons delegated by the Minister of

would not necessarily ever be publicly debated, either. 
Potentially more dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already seen the effect of such omnibus powers as used by 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  Clearly, any individual 
landowner has to be both vigilant and lucky not to have some 
perceived infringement under these regulations cause a major

some of the threatened and endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, I agree that the government must make the final 
judgement on which species, and even which portions of a habitat, 
must be protected and conserved.  To that degree, I think the 
introduction of socio-economic factors into the factors affecting 
any decision is prudent. The absolute protections as found in the 
United States laws, while they may soften the criticisms of the 
wildest environmentalists, offer no chance for rational decisions 
about the greater public good.  It will still be a political can 
of worms to even discuss a decision to abandon some protection 
somewhere, for anything, I am sure; but the option needs to be 
open. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a heartfelt letter from someone who will be directly 
affected by this bill.  There is something wrong with a proposal 
for a government to take away something that a person has worked 
his entire life to produce:  a retirement farm that could be 
taken from him at a moment's notice, especially when he has taken 
the trouble already to provide habitat for a protected species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the position he took was backed up by a 
<I>National Post</I> editorial dated April 14, 2000.  I am not 
sure I will have time to read the whole editorial but I will read 
it as far as I can.  It is headed “Unsustainable” and reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting endangered species and their habitats makes sense 
educationally, aesthetically, ecologically, even spiritually. But 
for a rancher or logger who finds such a species on his land, his 
immediate thoughts turn to personal risks.   Will he lose 
economically if the government finds out he is working in an 
endangered habitat?  Will his land be seized?  Or just as bad, 
will he be allowed to keep his land, but forbidden to use it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just theoretical concerns.  In the U.S., 
heavy-handed legislation has led to a “shoot, shovel and 
shut-up” mindset, where property owners view endangered species 
as creatures to be destroyed, not preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any workable conservation effort must recruit property owners to 
the environmental cause. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just like my constituent.  From the tone of his letter, 
he clearly supports the idea of protecting these endangered 
species.  All he asks is for reasonable and fair treatment by the 
government.  The editorial compares the situation with the new 
federal species at risk act.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensation for landowners is specifically not guaranteed:  The 
bill says the government “may” choose to pay a landowner for 
taking his property—not “must” or “shall”.  This is no 
trifle;  it is the only line a landowner has to read to know that 
endangered species are his economic enemy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the colleague who went before me from the Canadian 
Alliance, I would beg and plead with the government 
representatives to please read the bill. 
They should think about what it would do to people in their 
ridings who have saved their entire lives to buy property to 
prepare for their retirement and now find themselves faced with 
the possibility of seizure of their land without any reasonable 
compensation.  I ask them to vote against the bill and send it 
back for revision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-33, the Species at Risk 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is far more concerned about the environment when the 
economy is doing a little better.  Fortunately this is the case 
in a number of regions of Quebec and of Canada.  This concern 
ought to be an ongoing one and everyone agrees on that.  There 
must however be effective legislation and measures that have a 
connection with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I must admit to not having done an enormous amount 
of work in this area, but I do have some familiarity with it. My 
colleague from Jonquière is the one who handled this issue for 
the Bloc Quebecois.  I was extremely surprised, seeing all the 
material on this issue, that the government has not managed after 
all this time, for this is not the first time it has tried to get 
such legislation, to get any more support for a bill which ought 
normally to respond to some practical objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting endangered species is a worthy cause, but what it has 
managed to do instead in this case is to unite people against it. 
A number of provinces—if I remember correctly, Quebec, Ontario, 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, and others I cannot 
recall, there is a sixth I believe—already have legislation to 
protect endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is federal intervention, it ought not to have a 
negative impact on what is already in place, or occupy a space 
that would make it possible to better protect our environment and 
our ecosystem and provide all the environmental protection 
necessary.  Like many others, the government of Quebec is not 
really comfortable about this because it looks like another case 
of duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is not because everyone keeps saying it is less 
pertinent. For individuals, organizations, all those involved in 
the field it is not easy to figure out what is going on when 
there are two different pieces of legislation to deal with. Which 
one takes precedence?  Which addresses which particular aspect? 
It is not a very simple matter.  If the information is simple and 
understandable, people will be more careful and more informed, 
and a very healthy pressure will be put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government also wanted to deal with what is under 
its jurisdiction, it could do many things in environmental 
matters. It too could set an example by the way it takes care of 
the environment. It could be more open in its approach to the 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings to mind the MOX that the government tried to 
transport on the sly: the less people are informed, the better. 
My colleague and some people in her constituency managed to make 
the plan public and called for a halt to it. The government was 
forced to say that it would have to abide by its own principles. 
If it had not been for the vigilance of a few people this might 
have been done on the sly. The federal government's behaviour 
is not exemplary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the environment in the broader sense, people in my 
region as well as in northeastern Ontario are very concerned by 
what is coming up. When we talk about Témiscamingue, that is the 
Quebec side, but there is also Timiskaming on the Ontario side, 
with a similar name because of Témiscamingue Lake which straddles 
the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Northeast Ontario will have the great honour of hosting the 
largest dump, or almost, in North America. Out of generosity, the 
city of Toronto has decided to send its garbage to a former 
open-pit mine in northern Ontario; three other regional 
municipalities will do the same, Peel, York and Durham. A minimum 
of 20 million tons of garbage will be sent to northeastern 
Ontario, close to rivers flowing directly into Témiscamingue 
Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not feel concerned, I mention that 
Témiscamingue Lake flows into the Ottawa River and eventually 
into the St. Lawrence River. It is located at the watershed. 
We live at the north-south divide, in an area where two 
watersheds meet. This project will be in the southern watershed, 
just at the very edge of that watershed.

exterior walls of the mine. They will pray that there is no leak 
in the ground. Then, they will pour into the pit water from the 
surface and use it to rinse the garbage, pump it back up and 
treat it. 
This water will then go back in the rivers. To sum up, they are 
going to contaminate pure water and treat it afterwards. This, 
at a time when people worry so much, and rightly so, about 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this project is an environmental disaster, and so 
far the federal government has not made a single comment about 
it. It did not state its position, when its own legislation 
would allow it to do so, because there are interprovincial 
considerations involved and the aboriginal people have land 
claims over the area. It should look after its own jurisdictions 
instead of always trying to duplicate what is being done 
elsewhere and to extend the areas where it can step in. It would 
be nice if it started to use its own powers more efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally I am taking this opportunity to raise the 
awareness of the Liberal members from the Toronto region, 
because I know that several of them are interested in this idea 
of shipping all that waste to our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the environment we must emphasize the notion 
of recycling. The city of Toronto and three neighbouring 
communities will get a bonus for having signed a contract with a 
private contractor. They guaranteed 20 million tons and, if they 
exceed this amount, they will get a $1.50 rebate for each ton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you think that these municipalities will put pressure on 
people to recycle? Do you think they will use common sense? They 
are locked into a 20 year contract with a private contractor who 
will become a major waste manager. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Southern Ontario sends its refuse to the north and does not 
care one bit. It gets rid of the bad odours, etcetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also has a major impact. It is related to the whole issue 
of the protection of species. What would be the consequences on 
our ecosystem, on our environmental balance, not just on our 
waters, of having a mega-dump, the biggest dump in North America, 
in a region like that? I can predict that our region will also 
end up having the largest concentration of seagulls and pigeons 
in North America. These birds also travel and contaminate other 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People back home are extremely concerned. We are very 
concerned about the Ontario provincial government, which seems 
to care little about the environment. We are also concerned 
about the federal government which has so far remained silent 
on this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see a debate like today's, where the government wants to 
assuage its conscience and pass a bill to protect wildlife 
species at risk in Canada, when six provinces are present already 
in this field trying to do the job—it may not be perfect 
what they are doing, but they are trying to follow the right 
path—when I see the federal government introducing a bill that 
does not even satisfy environmental groups that are very attuned 
to the issue, I say to myself that this is definitely not a step 
in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not repeat the arguments made by my colleagues 
earlier.  I would, however, like the government to be a little 
more realistic. It should pass legislation that is practical, and 
existing laws, such as the environment law, which allows the 
federal government to intervene when necessary, should be used 
too, when there is opposition such as is found in northeastern 
Ontario and northwestern Quebec, which is back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to give members a sense of proportion, where I come from, 
5,000 people signed a petition.  They oppose Toronto's proposal 
to ship its garbage out.  Five thousand people at home represents 
a third of the population.  In Toronto, it would take a million 
people to make the equivalent.  I challenge members to find one 
million people to support the proposal to ship out waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see that the government is talking increasingly 
about the environment. It will eventually also have to talk about 
real problems, our over-consumption of certain resources.  We are 
not contributing either to maintaining a healthy balance for our 
environment, and our actions are not helping protect the species 
needed to protect our ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes more than the passage of laws of limited scope and 
considerable confusion rather than positive solutions to go in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by asking the Liberal members to awaken their 
conscience.  They have to take real action.  I hope that in the 
next stages of considering the bill, the government will return 
to a more realistic approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to 
Bill C-33.  If there is one thing Canadians hold very close to 
their hearts it is the concept of endangered species.  They feel 
that this is a legacy not only that they have inherited but one 
that they need to pass on to their children and their 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had at least two opportunities to deal with 
this pressing issue.  Again, unfortunately, in Bill C-33 it has 
failed.  As my colleagues have pointed out throughout the course 
of this discussion, a number of loopholes in the legislation will 
not enable us to protect the most vulnerable species within our 
midst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to understand the scope of the problem. 
In my province of British Columbia only six per cent of the 
temperate rain forests is actually protected.  In our country 
today nearly 350 species are in danger of extinction.  This 
situation unfortunately will only get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons are multifactorial but can be best summed 
up by habitat loss, the use of pesticides, agricultural practices 
and clear-cut forestry practices.  We have seen this perhaps most 
dramatically on the prairies where large swaths of indigenous 
lands have been destroyed.  The outcome of this has been the 
destruction and decimation of many species, from the great ox to 
the passenger pigeon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to deal with this matter in a very 
comprehensive fashion, and I will deal with the solutions one by 
one.  The first and most pressing issue is the protection of a 
central habitat.  My colleagues and I would love to see the 
government take a more aggressive stance in this regard by 
balancing off the protection of habitat with the understanding 
that landowners and property rights have to be protected also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting is that property owners, and indeed the 
private sector, very much would like to see the government come 
up with a distinctive plan to deal with it.  They want rules 
under which they can function.  They also want fair compensation 
for land that is taken away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector is very committed to wanting sensitive 
habitats protected, but it also wants to ensure that its land 
will not be taken away by the government in a willy-nilly 
fashion.  Fair compensation is what my colleagues have called 
for, for a long time.  Perhaps the most reasonable way of doing 
it is by basing compensation on fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always necessary, in fact only in a minority of 
occasions is it necessary, to take away land from the private 
sector.  As we have seen in Saskatchewan, most farmers and other 
private landowners would like to work with the government in 
ensuring that their land is protected and that the land can be 
used reasonably without endangering the endangered species.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let us look at the facts of the Canadian Alliance solution 17. 
Under our solution 17 a family with a mom and a dad and two kids 
would pay no income tax at all on the first $26,000 of income. 
The Liberals are squeezing $6 billion per year from these 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare two families under our proposal.  One family 
earns $60,000 and with solution 17 their taxes would go down to 
about $6,000.  However families with a $30,000 income will have 
their taxes go down all the way to $680, one-half as much income 
but only one-tenth as much tax.  That is a fair progressive 
system, and those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan will work.  It is affordable.  It is good for 
families.  It is good for the economy.  Careful scrutiny shows 
that our plan is far superior to the Liberal plan.  Canadians 
will find the truth and when they vote for us that truth will 
liberate them from years of PC and Liberal tax slavery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in sound fiscal management, not the NDP's urge to 
spend, spend, spend.  I believe that when we circle the wagons we 
shoot outward unlike the Conservative view of pulling together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I believe in the Canadian Olympic dream.  Our team 
will win more medals to come and the 2008 Olympics are coming to 
Canada.  Yes, I am Canadian and I am a Liberal.

want my son to meet Joe Clark”.  This is just an indication of 
the honour and respect that people hold for this man.

meeting their needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we can wait a few minutes so we can be serious before 
the fun of the coming weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give a very special welcome to the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition to this House, and to federal politics.  He will soon 
discover we do things a little differently here on dry land. 
There are no life jackets in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure again to see new leaders of the 
opposition.  In fact the member for Okanagan—Coquihalla is the 
sixth leader of opposition to sit across from me.  It is a very 
dangerous occupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had discussions with my caucus and I want to assure the Leader 
of the Opposition that my caucus will work very hard to make sure 
that he has a long and fruitful career as the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seriously, in the House of Commons politics is very important. 
We may speak in the House from different points of view and have 
different policies and approaches, but anyone who sits in the 
House of Commons is here because that person believes that we are 
working together to make Canada an even better country.  That is 
why I welcome the opposition leader to this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the new Leader of the Opposition is arriving here 
full of good intentions. He will work very hard and put a great 
deal of energy into promoting his ideas. We will have serious 
and sometimes heated debates. But in the end, we will both be 
working to ensure that Canada gets off to a good start in the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to welcome the opposition leader in the House of Commons 
and, as I said earlier, I know that the members on this side of 
the House wish him a very long career as Leader of the 
Opposition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the new member for Kings—Hants, the leader of the 
Conservative Party.  He has been a servant of this House for a 
long time.  I was a minister in 1972 when this young member of 
parliament came from Alberta and immediately made his name in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had a terrific task.  He became my critic when I was minister 
of Indian and northern affairs.  I had two critics at that time, 
the hon. member and the then member from Kingston, Flora 
MacDonald.  I used to call them the flora and the fauna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, more seriously he was an extremely good 
parliamentarian.  He was very effective in the opposition, he was 
always well prepared and he would give it to you very straight. 
However, he was a soldier because he would take it too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He became the Leader of Opposition when he was very young.  He 
also became the prime minister when he was very young.  After 
that he served the nation with great distinction as minister of 
foreign affairs.  I am very happy that he is back with us because 
he is a parliamentarian from the school of Ged Baldwin, Stanley 
Knowles and Jack Pickersgill, people who made their names here in 
the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for me, I am pleased to welcome a soldier with whom I had 
many battles in my life, but for whom I have the utmost respect. 
This is a man who is fully dedicated to public life and 
sincerely committed to making Canada an even better country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the House of Commons has much to gain from the 
return of the hon. member. I wish him good luck. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I join 
with the other members of this House in welcoming the two new 
members from the ridings of Kings—Hants and Okanagan—Coquihalla. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although they are newly elected, these two new members are not 
new to politics.  Mr. Clark's experience as party leader, 
minister and Prime Minister will stand him in good stead here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Day will now be able to defend his ideas in the House, 
ideas I do not share for the most part, but which will lead to a 
democratic debate in the House and improve the quality of the 
debate, since it is through debate that we get a better grasp of 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that we will engage, in the coming weeks and 
months, in vigorous debate reflecting the high level of the 
House, of parliamentary procedure and of our parliamentary 
democracy. 
The arrival of new members in parliament is always an important 
occasion in parliamentary life, because it is the tangible 
expression of the voters' choice.  It reminds us pointedly that 
we are all representatives of the public whom we have a duty to 
defend and whose interests, values and hopes we must express. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that the arrival of the two party leaders will 
help to keep alive this parliamentary tradition so important to 
us and which they will contribute to through their energy, 
talent and determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome these gentlemen to the House and wish them luck. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
rise to participate in that time honoured parliamentary tradition 
of welcoming new members to the House.  I would like to associate 
myself perhaps for the first, last and only time, with the Prime 
Minister of Canada during this session, with the comments that 
have been made to sincerely welcome the new members, the new 
leaders to the House, but at the same time not extend to them too 
much in the way of wishes for good electoral success.  I think 
that is the more honest thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are all aware that the two members who today take 
their positions as leaders of their respective parties are no 
newcomers to politics, no political rookies, and so I will not 
attempt to give them any advice today, or at least not too much 
advice.  For one thing they would not take it anyway coming from 
this corner of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to say a special word to the leader of the 
Conservative Party, as I think Nova Scotians would want me to, to 
welcome him as an honorary Nova Scotian at least for the moment. 
I would only say that if he endeavours to reflect the true values 
and the true hopes and dreams of Nova Scotians in his work on 
behalf of the people of Kings—Hants, then he will have served 
Canadians very, very well indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the new member who has taken his position today as 
the Leader of the Official Opposition, as a member who faced the 
transition from provincial to federal politics as he does now, do 
not be too afraid of the scrums.  Take it from one who knows. 
It can be tough sometimes but it can only get better.

the everyday lives of people there is no shortage of sports 
spectacles or circus entertainment.  So I say with all due 
respect to the Speaker, because I do understand the context and 
the spirit with which the Speaker has said let the games begin, 
let us instead hope that this will be the dawning of a new day in 
the life of this session of parliament.  Let us instead commit 
ourselves to ensure that the real debate begins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have asked whether I think the dynamics of this place 
will change as a result of the two leaders taking their seats.  I 
can only say let us hope so.  Let us hope we see some change for 
the better because in the end, there is only one challenge that 
we all face in common, and that is to try to make the Parliament 
of Canada work for the people of Canada and to ensure that the 
government of the country is accountable to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say congratulations to the two leaders who now have 
joined us in this place. Let us let the real debate begin.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much for your 
warm welcome to the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that this is indeed an historic Chamber.  Much 
history has been written here and much will be written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to first acknowledge those who have made it 
possible for me to be here, and possibly for each of us to be 
here in our own way.  It was in this Chamber that a constitution 
was recognized which was prefaced with a clause that said 
“recognizing the supremacy of God” and by the grace of God we 
are all here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also here by the grace of my wife and my family.  They have 
continued to put up with me through the years, to encourage me, 
to let me know when I am getting too serious, and to let me know 
when it is time to lighten up.  “Take off the pinstripe suit and 
put on a wetsuit” they tell me.  I acknowledge them for being 
such a significant reason for my being here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to acknowledge the constituents in Okanagan—Coquihalla 
who gave to me such a wonderful mandate and such support from the 
farms, the ranches, the towns, the cities and the vineyards of 
that fabulous constituency.  I owe thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, this is an historic Chamber.  I experienced history just 
outside the Chamber.  As a young teenager I stood outside of 
these doors when a flag was lowered and the new maple leaf was 
raised.  At that moment as a young person excited about that 
event, I felt pride and expectation for the future.  I witnessed 
a former prime minister, Mr. Diefenbaker, who stood there with 
tears coming down his cheeks at that moment.  Beside him was the 
prime minister of the day, Mr. Pearson.  I respected Mr. 
Pearson's respect at that moment in time for a great change that 
was taking place.  I learned the power of change but also the 
importance of respect at moments like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also learned outside of the Chamber, down the cement corridor 
that leads to the sidewalk.  I participated in my first protest. 
I was about 15 years old.  I was with a friend.  We circled with 
other protesters.  I cannot remember what the protest was about. 
We joined them because it looked like fun.  As the cameras 
approached I had a horrifying thought:  What if my parents saw me 
on the news?  So I ran and I have been trying to overcome my fear 
of cameras ever since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I say through you to our Prime Minister that we 
will have debates in the Chamber. 
We will have greater debates in the great crucible of the next 
general election.  Yes, my party and I will question his 
policies and I will question his plans.  Sir, I have watched you 
over the years and I want to assure all members that I will never 
question your love and your dedication for this country and for 
the high office which you hold.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the start of a new era, one in which the public wants 
governments that respect democracy, the House of Commons, the

respect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that respect, we will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it will be 
an unusual thing for me to have the last word in the House, at 
least until the next election. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation to the people 
of Hants county and Kings county in Nova Scotia.  May I say to 
the leader of the New Democratic Party that while I am an 
honorary citizen of that province, my 
great-great-great-great-grandfather was not from away. I take 
very seriously the trust that they have vested in me as their 
member of parliament.  I look forward to working with you and 
others in the House to advance the interests of those Canadian 
citizens and the others represented by others here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members of the House would allow me a brief departure 
from parliamentary practice to recognize and thank someone who is 
in the gallery, Scott Brison, the former member of parliament for 
Kings—Hants. There may be less applause for what I intend to say 
next, which is that I fully expect Mr. Brison to be back in this 
place after the next election. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House is aware, the highest tides in the world are found 
in the riding of Kings—Hants, and those tides swept away the 
Liberal Party from Nova Scotia in the last federal election.  I 
can assure you that the tide is stronger than ever now. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want also to congratulate the new Leader of Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition both on his victory in Okanagan—Coquihalla and 
in the leadership process of his own party. I wish him good luck 
in the give and take of democratic debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice he made reference to his family and I can be forgiven 
for making reference to mine.  My wife and daughter are in the 
gallery as they have been with me through 20 some years of active 
public life. I do not want to intrude on the Leader of the 
Opposition's family life, but I noted he said that from time to 
time his family told him when he should lighten up a little bit. 
I can tell him that this House will take care of that.

critic when I first entered the House years ago.  Do not take 
this unkindly, Mr. Prime Minister, but it is easy to be your 
critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House have a parliamentary duty to hold the government 
accountable, and I look forward to that responsibility, but we 
also have a Canadian duty to draw together the diverse interests 
of this truly extraordinary country.  In all of Canada the House 
of Commons is the place that can best claim to represent all 
the communities of Canada.  The nation is here.  I hope to play 
some role in drawing out the better instincts of this nation, of 
having parliament reflect less of our divisions and more of what 
we can aspire to together.

Finance said that he could not take leadership in seeing taxes 
lowered on fuels because there was no provincial interest.  I am 
aware of two ministers of finance, myself formerly being one of 
those, who wrote letters to the Minister of Finance expressing 
interest in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if that could have been an excuse, which it now is not, why 
will the Minister of Finance not commit to seeing these fuel 
taxes reduced? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, since the Minister Finance often takes questions for 
me, I will take a question for him today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a serious problem and we are looking into it.  The 
Minister of Finance has asked the provincial governments to 
collaborate with him.  However, as he has said, we have to make 
sure, as any move has an impact on consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could quote an expert on that who said at one time 
“If we look at lowering the gas tax what kind of guarantees do 
we have that the gas retailers will also drop the price, or are 
they just going to fill in the ditch?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who said that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  It was the Leader of the 
Opposition when he was the treasurer in Alberta. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I am surprised that the Prime Minister did not let one of 
his most loyal supporters answer the question that was put to 
him.  However, I will go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. Leader of the 
Opposition may begin his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not think loyalty 
was such a touchy subject over there. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, the Liberal members gave their support to 
reducing the taxes on fuel.

everyone knows that when a budget motion is moved, if the hon.

ask members of parliament to vote with him. However, there are 
members, as some journalists have told me, who are afraid to 
have an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the point I would like to make at this time. First, 
there is a very good relationship between the Minister of 
Finance and myself. He has been an excellent Minister of 
Finance. Because he is a responsible person, he did not use a 
piecemeal approach. By working with the caucus, cabinet and 
myself, he was able to bring the Canadian economy forward, 
achieve a zero deficit, generate a budgetary surplus—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform the Prime Minister that just this morning 
I spoke with the president of the Canadian Trucking Association 
who informed me that if this motion to reduce the taxes on fuel 
were to pass on Thursday that there would be no truckers' strike.

oil.  The Minister of Finance will be at the IMF and the World 
Bank in the next few days where all the ministers of finance in

increase in the price of oil by the oil producing nations.  This 
where the problems lie at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that this situation will be re-established and the

and desperately need cash flow.  In order to maximize the grain 
farmers' returns, Canada must market and export as much grain as 
possible during this period.  Disagreements between the Canadian 
Wheat Board, the grain companies and the railways are impeding 
the movement of grain at the farmers' expense.  The grain 
industry itself has asked the government for a mediator to help 
resolve these disagreements and disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the transport minister today appoint a mediator to assist 
in this issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the end of August the grain companies indicated that 
in their view they thought the discussions with the Canadian 
Wheat Board had arrived at an impasse.  Although they did not 
provide any detail at that time of what that impasse might 
consist of, the government immediately asked the grain companies 
to provide more detail.  That detail arrived during the course of 
last week.  Their position is being carefully examined at the 
present time and we intend to respond in an appropriate manner 
very shortly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

farmers' needs.  These disagreements could lead to a complete 
system failure just like in 1993-94 and 1996-97.  Those disputes 
damaged Canada's reputation as a reliable exporter and cost 
millions in demurrage and contract penalties, all at the farmers' 
expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Estey and Kroeger reports recommended removing the wheat 
board from negotiations between the railways and the grain

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the finance minister feel good about engineering this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public

across Canada with over 376,000 units insured in 1999.  It

<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it

homelessness crisis is growing as evidenced by the call by 
provincial and municipal representatives who are meeting today in 
Fredericton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the finance minister with a simple

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK184">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-33, an 
act respecting the protection of wildlife species at risk in 
Canada, be read the second time and referred to a committee, and 
of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to recap what I was saying 
earlier, we have now entered a period of one of the greatest and 
largest extinctions of species in history.  In fact, the sixth 
greatest extinction is ongoing right now at a rate that is 1,000 
times faster than the normal rate of extinction, so much so that 
we have about 350 species in Canada, as we speak, that are in 
danger of becoming extinct.  This number is increasing with time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary thrust of extinction is habitat destruction through 
various sources, primarily agriculture and also industry, the use 
of pesticides, clear-cutting, forestry practices, human 
habitation and human activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How we actually protect sensitive habitat is the crux of the 
problem.  We have proposed that the government, rather than put 
forth a weak bill in the form Bill C-33, which I might add is the 
third attempt to bring in such a bill, needs to start addressing 
the problem in a pragmatic way.  Indeed the private sector would 
very much like to work with the government, as we would, in 
trying to develop a plan that would be fair not only to the 
species at risk but to landowners and other stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do it by buying in.  We need stewardship. Groups can work 
with the government in order to steward or shepherd sensitive 
habitats willingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If land is to be taken away or use is to be compromised, private 
interests simply have to be renumerated at free market value for 
the costs incurred.  Those costs need to be given to those who 
are suffering a loss as a result of their private land use being 
compromised.  We also need to look at existing forestry and 
agricultural practices and stop them while using other tools to 
accomplish the same objectives.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Habitat protection is important.  Listing is also important. 
Listing must take place for endangered species on the basis of 
good science.  The government does not do that in this bill. 
COSEWIC, a group of scientists, are very effective at doing this. 
It will give the government a list of species in danger of going 
extinct on the basis of good science.  In this bill the 
government should be obligated to listen to what this group has 
listed and follow its lead in protecting those species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also enforce the law.  Many Canadians would be shocked 
to learn that we are one of the major conduits in the trafficking 
of endangered species' products in the entire world. The reason 
for this is that while we have long borders, we have done an 
appalling job of protecting those borders, not only for 
endangered species' products but many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the government has not supported our hardworking 
men and women on the front lines at our ports means that our 
country is known as a safe haven for people who are willing to 
break the law in an effort to traffic in these endangered 
species' products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result internationally has been that many species, from 
tigers and big cats to birds and indeed plant species, are being 
felled and are becoming extinct.  It is a sad thing when a 
country like ours, with its wild spaces and which prides itself 
on being in favour of endangered species' legislation, has been 
unable to get workable federal legislation and do our part 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced Bill C-475 on April 11, 2000 which dealt with how 
we can have an effective endangered species bill in a very 
pragmatic way.  My bill would essentially do the following: 
First, it would obligate the government to protect species that 
are on COSEWIC's list, i.e. the lists that are there, the species 
that are endangered are based on science, not politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it would obligate the government to work with private 
stakeholders and the provinces to protect habitat.  This is not 
an option.  This has to be an obligation on the part of the 
government to protect habitat.  Failure to do so will ensure that 
these species will become extinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it would obligate the government to work with the 
provinces to remunerate private landowners at fair market value 
where a negotiated settlement simply cannot take place, rather 
than putting all the power in the hands of the minister who will 
remunerate private landowners on the basis of what he or she 
wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I want to talk about is a personal experience I 
had.  The best model in the world for protecting species is the 
province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.  It has saved species 
such as the white rhino, which went from 24 animals up to several 
thousand in a matter of 50 to 60 years.  The reason it did this 
is that it used the private sector to husband these species.  It 
convinced them that they would get more money from their land by 
ecotourism, by hunting excess animals and by other land uses, 
including harvesting plants in a responsible way that had 
medicinal uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome is that the money drawn from these lands is poured 
back not only into conservation, but also poured back into the 
surrounding areas to benefit the people.  We need to have the 
assistance of local people if we are going to protect habitat. 
The best way to do that is to demonstrate to those people that it 
will have a direct benefit on their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we merely argue on the basis that it is nice to have habitat 
protected, it will fail, for habitat and animal species, 
unfortunately, have to pay for themselves if they are going to 
survive.  Where this was done in KwaZulu-Natal, they were able to 
save many animal and plant species from extinction.  They have 
also managed to benefit the surrounding populous.  The outcome 
has been that animals have been saved from the brink of 
extinction, an expanded habitat that has been protected, expanded 
wild spaces and a sustainable use of those areas for other 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of that is that KwaZulu-Natal is now the 
international leader in conservation.  I can only say to the 
minister and to the government that our party will be very happy 
to work with them to this end, but they have to have effective 
legislation that will protect habitat in the ways that I have 
mentioned.  This is not only a legacy that we have been given, 
the endangered species in our country, it is also our 
responsibility to give that to our children and to our 
grandchildren.

pleasure to speak to Bill C-33 on endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the federal government is very concerned about 
endangered animal species.  Unfortunately, it is not as 
concerned about French Canadians, a species which has been 
assimilated for the past 150 years, with the result that it has 
now dropped from 50% of the Canadian population to approximately 
25%.

arrivals to Canada, this means very little. 
But I can tell the lady who is gazing charmingly and wide-eyed in 
my direction that, in case she was unaware, at the time of 
Confederation there were as many francophones as anglophones in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we see the federal government wishing to 
intervene so that endangered species will have the opportunity 
to grow, multiply and survive, something, I repeat, that it has 
always refused Quebecers, whether my colleague likes it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the intention behind the bill is good, except that 
what we have here is duplication and overlap.  What was 
needed—even the preamble to the bill points this out—is for the 
bill to pave the way for consultation with the provinces 
precisely so that this duplication can be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six Canadian provinces, namely Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have legislation on 
this, and a list compiled by scientists and their governments 
establishing which species are endangered or at risk in the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is going to encroach in a heavy-handed way 
on an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. I know that, 
for the member who earlier was yelling like someone caught in a 
barbed wire fence, this kind of debate on respecting legislative 
jurisdiction we have on a regular basis is plain gibberish and 
makes no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say in the House of Commons, in this very parliament, that 
constitutional law and the constitution are nothing, when in the 
mind of members of the Bloc Quebecois the constitution is the 
basic law which governs the relationship among provinces and 
among private citizens, is to show contempt to a degree that 
would not have been thought possible on the part of today's 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution is the law of the land. The Fathers of 
Confederation decided to balance powers. The federal government 
was to have authority over international relations, the post 
office, national defence and the telegraph, which transmitted 
communications from one province to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, precedent after precedent, change after change, 
including legal rulings and mainly the abolition of referrals to 
the Privy Council in London, have turned it into the 
quintessential joke.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada, which has always leaned to the same 
side, has started to set out principles of constitutional law and 
the related rules of interpretation, and as a result our 
constitution has more or less lost all meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you a few examples. We had sections 91 and 92, which 
gave effect to the powers of the federal government and to those 
of the provincial governments respectively. The Supreme Court of 
Canada came up with all kinds of wild theories, such as that of 
unoccupied fields in estate law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time, the federal government said “The province is 
not exercising its right to collect taxes on inheritances in 
estate law”. It is the unoccupied field theory, which means that 
the federal government can interfere as long as the provincial 
government is not exercising its jurisdiction in that field. But 
it so happens that it is a province's prerogative not to exercise 
its jurisdiction in a particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what is happening. Recently, a decision was handed down 
regarding federal interference in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction, such as property and civil law, including estate 
law, with the reference on the gun control legislation. The 
Supreme Court of Canada invented yet another theory by saying 
“Yes, the federal government can still interfere in areas under 
provincial jurisdictions in matters of public safety for 
instance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The construction of high-rise buildings also has an impact on 
public safety. 
Transportation, be it by tractor trailers, trucks, ships or just 
plain surface transportation, can have an impact on public 
safety. One thing leading to the other, the provinces are losing 
all the jurisdictions they kept for themselves when the 
Confederation agreement was negotiated in Charlottetown starting 
in 1864. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have this bill on endangered species. The habitat of 
species that are endangered and on the way to becoming extinct, 
be it a seabed or wetlands, often comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 says that harmonization between provincial and federal 
scientists is desirable. 
Unfortunately, clauses in the bill indicate that the federal 
government is grabbing almost <I>manu militari</I>, <I>proprio motu</I>, the 
right to oversee the whole thing and is asserting its primacy in 
the field of endangered species protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfortunate, because more confrontation is looming. The 
hon. member opposite, who is a champion of confrontation, will 
certainly be involved. Quebec is being told that it cannot look 
after its own resources and the habitat of endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that moderation and conciliation are preferable. The 
federal government should have provided in its bill that, 
following consultations with the provinces, a list of endangered 
species could be drawn up in co-operation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> They went about it <I>ultra petita</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> My hon. friend from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, 
who has been studying law at night, really seems to know his 
stuff. He is using Latin words now. He said they went about it 
<I>ultra petita</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the federal government to get involved and, as usual 
and as was pointed out by the brilliant member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who will get a score in his law courses 
that will put the Minister of Justice to shame, the federal 
government went overboard and used its prerogative to interfere 
in the protection of endangered species.

this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to speak to Bill C-33.  This is the 
third time the government has brought forward endangered species 
legislation.  I was the environment critic when some of the other 
bills came through.  The last bill was so weak that even 
government backbenchers could not support it.  This legislation 
is not much better.  It would appear that the government is still 
going to ram it through and that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to be the whole impetus of the government.  Rather 
than talk about voluntary measures, rather than trying to get 
people to work together to get endangered species legislation 
that is going to work, it chooses another way.  The government 
has chosen the big hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are penalties in the act that are criminal code penalties. 
This means, for example, that a logger is in trouble if while 
doing his normal work of felling a tree and an endangered bird or 
a bug is in the area.  If a farmer drives his tractor over some 
habitat or a rancher allows his cows into an area where there are 
endangered plants they too would be in trouble.  The penalties 
are severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to a number of people who said that if they found an 
endangered species on their land it would be gone.  They would 
not allow the government to see it because it would take away 
their property without compensation.  They cannot afford that. 
That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the greater good, we all recognize that.  There may be an 
area of land for example that has endangered species on it.  We 
all agree we should keep it.  However the person who owns the 
land has to be fairly compensated.  They cannot be expected to 
walk away.  This legislation says that the government may 
compensate, not will compensate.  That is absolutely wrong.  That 
is why it has people running scared and understandably so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also steps on provincial jurisdiction.  It was 
interesting to note what the justice minister said during 
question period about how much the government consults with the 
provinces.  The government has not consulted with the provinces. 
The provinces need to be right in with this.  They need to have 
either parallel legislation or they have to be onside.  Right now 
they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point that is weak is how a species gets on the list.  What 
about polar bears for example?  What is the criteria to get them 
either on an endangered or on an at risk list?  We need to have a 
scientific body to establish this.  COSEWIC is that body and it 
can do a fairly incredible job if it has the criteria.  The 
situation is worse when politicians get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One species that will never make it on the endangered species 
list as long as politicians are involved is Atlantic cod. 
Members know that cod stocks are down the toilet.  The stocks are 
well down and fishing should not be allowed.  What happens?  An 
election is called.  There was a cod fishery on the east coast 
which was just about on its knees.  That is what happens when 
politicians get involved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be endangered species legislation that is arm's 
length from the politicians.  It has to be on a scientific basis 
and not able to be manipulated by the politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the forest industry and spent 25 years as professional 
forester before going into politics.  There was an issue south of 
the border in Washington and Oregon that dealt with the spotted 
owl.  Hon. members may remember that.  However, the issue was not 
the spotted owl.  It was simply a vehicle for people to use to 
stop logging.  That was the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how we get it into legislation, but we need to 
have legislation to protect the species, not for manipulation 
which is what happened for years years in Washington and Oregon. 
It did not have a lot to do with the spotted owl.  It had a lot 
to do with stopping logging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need habitat protection.  That is not in the bill.  How 
can we possibly say that we are going to protect a species yet we 
are not going to protect where it lives?  That is nuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, there are a number of holes in this bill, so many 
that it has to go back to the drawing board.  During question 
period the minister said that he preferred that it go to 
committee.  I suspect that this bill is so flawed that it needs 
to go back to the drawing board.  The environment committee will 
clearly have its work cut out for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is so flawed from the beginning that the actual 
direction needs to be rethought.  I said earlier that impetus of 
the bill is whether it is through voluntary measures by getting 
the provincial and federal governments together with the farmers 
and ranchers and saying this is how we are going to do it or 
having the big heavy hand of criminal justice.  The latter is not 
going to work.  People are just going to plough them under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is bad.  It is so bad that it needs to be redrafted 
and our party and my constituents do not support this 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue of 
wildlife species at risk or on the verge of extinction is 
certainly important.  It is an issue that warrants our finding 
solutions that are both practical and in keeping with the 
constitutional arrangements existing between the provinces and 
the central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the bill before us is that in several respects 
the effects it will produce are not necessarily what we might 
hope for.  In addition, it lands squarely in provincial fields 
of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of members of the House and especially those on the 
government side have the impression that the federal government 
is in the best position to decide what is good for the people, 
for resources and for wildlife.  It has been my experience since 
my arrival in the House, in 1994, that the government has shown 
itself consistently incompetent in all these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough, to resolve the problem, to introduce a bill in 
the House that is supposedly going to protect wildlife species 
on the verge of extinction.  First and foremost there must be a 
complete strategy in place to ensure that what the right hand 
wants to do will not be undone by the left hand.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a few examples of a left hand that is particularly 
gauche in certain areas.  Allow me to remind this House that 
about a year ago, the auditor general announced, after tabling 
his report and researching the matter, that many wild species, 
both flora and fauna, had disappeared from national parks 
managed, as we know, by Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not a fortuitous occurrence.  It was not a matter of 
chance.  It was poor ecological management in the practices of 
Parks Canada.  A commission made recommendations and a new law 
was passed.  We can only hope there will be no other such 
occurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this goes to show that, with its bill, the federal 
government has not proposed anything that guarantees that the 
objectives pursued will be reached. In fact, there is every 
reason to believe that this bill will not solve anything, since 
the problems often lie elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example of a problem lying elsewhere. We are 
going to talk about genetically modified organisms. The idea is 
not, in principle, to genetically modify plants or wild 
organisms. But here is what could and will, for all intents and 
purposes, happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that the whole biological evolution of 
our planet is largely based on genetic mutations orchestrated by 
nature itself through cross-breeding, particularly through 
pollination. What is cross-breeding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows what a plant is, what a flower is, and everyone 
knows that, at some point, the pollen of the flower will travel 
and fertilize another flower to create a seed that will ensure 
the survival of the species. I am, of course, referring to 
plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, cross-breeding will occur and a new species will be 
created. This is how the diversity that surrounds us came about. 
Nature, through selection, has created a balance that allows us 
to benefit from an environment that is healthy, provided we 
protect it adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to genetically modified organisms. I will make 
up a little horror story which, when we think of it, is not 
really a figment of my imagination. Some companies are currently 
marketing graminaceous plants. The farmer plants the seeds, so 
that they will grow and produce fruits. However, while the fruit 
can be consumed, it cannot replicate itself because the seed is 
sterile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather not think about what could happen if that 
sterility feature was somehow transmitted to another species in 
the wilderness. That species would slowly stop reproducing as 
pollen spread that undesirable feature. Some might argue that 
this is unlikely. But nothing is impossible with nature.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our very presence on Earth as human beings is a strong 
demonstration of nature's capacity to yield highly improbable 
results. Nothing proves that if we manipulate genetically 
modified organisms we will not obtain results that are both 
unexpected and unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about salmon. There is a genetically modified 
species of salmon endowed with an incredible growth capacity. It 
rapidly becomes a big salmon. Of course, this salmon is kept in 
fish farms. As long as it stays in its tank, there is no way it 
can reproduce in the wild, in our waterways or our oceans. 
However, fish have often escaped from fish farms and gone into 
the wild. So, I would not see why the genetically modified salmon 
should be unable to escape, as so many other fish have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day the salmon escapes and reproduces, given its incredible 
capacity to grow rapidly and to be bigger than the other fish, it 
will, as the saying goes, eat the smaller fish, the smaller 
salmon, and eventually, wipe out wild salmon, and take its place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not acting responsibly to protect our 
environment. This bill will not change the course of events. Much 
more important measures need to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will give the example of Ducks Unlimited, an 
agency which was not set up through legislation like the one 
before us, but which has done wonders for the preservation of our 
natural environment, and which can be found everywhere in 
America, even in my riding. Its positive action has led to the 
protection of habitats, environments and species. Its initiatives 
should be given help and support on a larger scale, instead of 
the government introducing a bill which, for all intents and 
purposes, is going to upset everybody and most certainly will not 
yield the expected results. The government should withdraw this 
bill.

Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise on behalf of the constituents 
of Calgary East to speak to Bill C-33, an act respecting the 
wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the bill is the species at risk act.  There is no 
Canadian who will not agree to do something about the risk to 
endangered species.  I have received numerous letters from my 
constituents saying that they are concerned and would like me to 
support the bill.  Why?  Because the term species at risk raises 
the spectre that we are in danger of losing a species.  I do not 
think any Canadian would accept that and Canadians would like to 
see something being done about it. When constituents write to me 
they are asking their member of parliament to do something about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Calgary which is very close to one of the best 
national parks in the world, Banff National Park. Its natural 
wilderness is very dear to Albertans as it is to all Canadians. 
People have seen in the past the joys that nature and species 
bring and hence their concern about this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in a land which has some of the best national parks in 
the world, the Ngorongoro crater and the Serengeti national park. 
Over the years I have seen the decline of the wild species 
habitat in those national parks.  It pains me that they were 
roaming there in numbers but today they are on the endangered 
list. There are many reasons that they are on the endangered 
list.  Primarily the loss of habitat has been through hunting, 
poaching and other illegal activities which put those species in 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be extremely shameful for humankind that we would be 
responsible for species being extinct.  Many species around the 
world, even in the Amazon forest and other places, are in danger 
because of the reasons I have stated and it raises the question 
of what do we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the issue has been brought up.  Many species are on 
the endangered list and Canadians would like us to take action. 
Naturally when the bill on species at risk came forward, 
Canadians felt they should support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I do not think anyone in the House could not 
support the bill when it says species at risk.  However the 
Canadian Alliance, as my colleagues have indicated previously, 
has a serious problem with the bill, not with the intent of the 
bill but with the way the bill has been drafted. We would like to 
make our position very clear.  We are not and I repeat not 
opposing the bill for any frivolous reasons.  We support the 
intent of the bill which is to protect the species at risk. 
However, we feel there is a different approach to achieve that 
result and not what the government is proposing in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight some points.  Most important is that 
the bill gives the government the power to expropriate land. Down 
the road it may also give the power to the government to lay 
criminal charges against private landowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has gone one step further and said that in order 
to protect species it is trampling on other rights instead of 
working with a co-operative attitude. The problem with the bill 
is that when the government tries to do something it adds on 
something and it creates a situation where suddenly people are 
opposed to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same with Bill C-68.  We agree with the intent of 
Bill C-68 in that we want to keep guns away from the criminals, 
but the government came along with legislation that will make 
ordinary law-abiding citizens potential law breakers.  That is 
where there is a serious problem with Bill C-33.  It is similar 
to Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will come along and expropriate the land.  The 
government will say to the landowners that it needs to take the 
land because it needs to protect the species and it leaves the 
compensation blank. 
There is nothing in the bill stating how the government is going 
to expropriate the land.  What is it going to give?  Is it going 
to give fair market value?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property rights in our country are fundamental rights. 
Constitutionally we have the right to own property.  However with 
this bill, while the government recognizes that there are 
property rights, it will expropriate. The bill does not go one 
step further to say that there is a fair compensation process. 
That creates a problem because in order to maintain their land, 
at the end of the day the landowners may not be in a co-operative 
mood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a serious flaw in the bill.  We would like to support 
the bill but it is our intention and that of our critic to bring 
forward amendments to the bill.  I hope the government will 
listen to Canadians and amend the bill in such a manner that is 
acceptable to everyone.

am pleased to take part today in this debate at the second 
reading stage of Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, industrial development in our society has had 
and continues to have disastrous and often irreversible effects 
on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous plant and animal species have disappeared, particularly 
since the beginning of the 20th century. However, it was not 
until the last few decades that the need to protect our 
environment and to preserve our environmental heritage has 
become obvious, forcing governments to pass appropriate 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, I represent an urban riding, Laval being the 
second largest city in Quebec. On the initiative of certain 
individuals who understood the importance of protecting the 
diversity of our fauna and flora—and I will gladly take this 
opportunity to salute Jean Lauzon and Michel Aubé for their 
vision and their extraordinary commitment—an organization in my 
riding, Éco-Nature, has worked hard to preserve wildlife in the 
Mille-Îles River area. In co-operation with the Quebec department 
of the environment and wildlife, Éco-Nature has played an 
important role in the protection of endangered species for more 
than 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part of the greater Montreal area where Laval is located is 
already heavily urbanized and development continues to grow. In 
fact, 75% of the north shore of the Mille-Îles River is 
developed, whereas in Laval, on the opposite shore, the figure 
is 65%. 
Of course what relatively intact habitat remains must be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1998, the Mille-Îles River Park includes approximately 10 
islands that have wildlife refuge status. The Mille-Îles River 
Park is a protected habitat in the heart of greater Montreal. 
Every year it is host to tens of thousands of visitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the enthusiasm and skills of many naturalists, the young and 
the not so young get reacquainted with the habitat of turtles 
and the great blue heron. In an idyllic setting throughout the 
seasons, visitors can see beaver dams and species of deciduous 
trees hard to find elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of the kind of results produced by threatened 
species legislation such as Quebec's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned the Quebec environment and wildlife 
department. I must add that since 1989 it has as protection 
tools the Act respecting Threatened or Vulnerable Species and 
the Act respecting the Conservation and Development of Wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec uses these tools to identify species at risk, list them 
as threatened or vulnerable, protect their habitat, and develop 
and implement recovery plans to adequately protect species and 
habitat in a precarious situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might well wonder why have federal legislation.  What is 
this legislation going to add to the administrative measures 
already in place in Quebec?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it is not the first time the federal government has 
tried to slip through legislation dealing with this area.  Here 
is a brief historical overview of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Minister of Environment of the day, now Minister of 
Heritage, announced her intention to pass legislation on 
endangered species.  This raised a general uproar, from both 
provincial governments and environmental groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year later, her successor called a meeting with provincial 
environment ministers. 
This was on October 2, 1996, close to four years ago now, the 
location, Charlottetown, a city with a certain myth attached to 
it as far as agreements are concerned.  The hope was for the 
ministers of the environment to reach an agreement in principle 
on endangered species.  Thus the agreement on the protection of 
endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, when Bill C-65 was introduced, which is sort of the ancestor 
of the bill we have before us today, the Quebec minister of the 
environment and regional minister for Laval, my friend David 
Cliche, rightly found that the federal government's bill did not 
fully reflect the agreement that had been entered into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, the federal government is proclaiming the necessity 
for co-operation between the various levels of government, but as 
usual when it comes time for action it knows but one way of 
implementation: blundering in over the lines of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
In a letter dated December 2, 1996, the Quebec minister of the 
environment wrote the following to his federal counterpart: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor was it ever agreed that ratification of a treaty by Canada 
changed anything in the distribution of jurisdictions and gave 
the federal government exclusive jurisdiction to implement the 
treaty. 
</UL>
<Further on, he added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the pretext of protecting species at risk, the bill is in 
fact an attempt to rewrite or reinterpret the Canadian 
Constitution and the way it gives certain powers to various 
levels of government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the Bloc Quebecois opposed this bill because it 
intruded in provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 died on the Order Paper in April 1997, when the 
election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 is almost a carbon copy of the defunct C-65.  With the 
same pre-election climate to boot, we could even ask ourselves 
whether this bill too will die on the Order Paper for electoral 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill ignores provincial jurisdictions and existing laws, 
such as those in Quebec.  This is new useless duplication in a 
field in which the government of Quebec has proven its mettle. 
As an example of these intrusions, let me point out that clause 
34(2) provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
Minister, by order, provide that sections 32 and 33 apply in 
lands in a province that are not federal lands. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal lands mean lands of the federal crown.  The intent is 
clear.  The prohibitions contained in clauses 32 and 33 of the 
bill can apply to lands under provincial jurisdiction simply by 
ministerial order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, if the minister feels that the laws of a province 
do not properly protect a given species, the minister may 
recommend the governor in council make an order in this regard. 
If this is not meddling in the way the provinces carry out their 
environmental protection responsibilities, I do not know what it 
is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We all realize that the protection of the environment and 
particularly of the threatened species is a key issue. However, 
the federal government cannot take action in that area while 
denying the role that the provinces are already playing. As the 
Quebec minister of the environment, Paul Bégin, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has always behaved in a responsible and appropriate 
manner regarding the protection of the most threatened fauna and 
flora species and it intends to keep on exercising its authority 
in this matter. We will never accept an umbrella piece of 
legislation covering all the initiatives in this area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 only duplicates what certain provinces such as Quebec 
are already doing, instead of harmonizing what each level of 
government could do in its area of jurisdiction. Unfortunately, 
we all know that this is the federal government's way of doing 
things. To believe that a tempered federalism, a federalism 
respectful of the existing jurisdictions is here is just an 
illusion and Quebecers will not be fooled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as an outdoorsman, a guy who spends a lot of time in the 
wilderness, I have a personal interest in this topic and I will 
approach it from that perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spend many hours in the wilderness.  I have hiked, climbed, 
hunted and fished in spots that do not see very many individuals. 
I believe that Canadians have an interest in and a public need to 
protect species at risk.  That is certainly the case in my 
riding, a riding that extends from Calgary down to the U.S. 
border and from the mountains out to the southwest corner of 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of a rancher, a landowner, who in my view 
typifies the somewhat typical western perspective on this.  This 
individual lives west of High River.  His name is Francis 
Gardiner.  He is a big, tall, raw-boned rancher, a guy with a 
cowboy hat and boots.  If you met him on the street you would not 
sass him, but inside him is the softest perspective when it comes 
to species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has a large, beautiful tract of land in the foothills, land 
that has very diverse countryside.  Beaver, deer and elk roam the 
hills to the west.  He has whitetail and mule deer on the 
grasslands.  He and his family have been there a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has been recognized for some of his achievements with species 
at risk.  He has tried to be very natural in his stewardship on 
the land.  It is titled land but he looks upon himself as a 
steward of that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the old days there used to be fires throughout the country 
regularly and the fires took care of the brush.  There have not 
been fires lately.  We are good at preventing fires.  We take 
fire prevention measures there so he has brought in animals that 
will eat some of the vegetation to maintain the grassland because 
the diversity requires that.  His land would have been overtaken 
by brush.  To bring in a bulldozer and push the brush aside and 
smash all the undergrowth is against his beliefs.  This sounds 
kind of corny but he brings in goats for certain periods of the 
year to eat the vegetation and maintain the grassland.  The 
grassland is specific to species that might be displaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francis Gardiner, in my view, is a trustee or a steward of the 
land. Has anybody forced him to do that?  Has anybody pushed him 
with legislation?  Has anybody rammed it down his throat?  Not 
for a second.  He has done this co-operatively and eagerly.  As I 
say, he has been recognized and has just received some of that 
recognition here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other thing that is not often mentioned is that species are 
not static.  There is a change with species.  Raccoons were 
unknown in my part of the country until a few years ago when they 
moved in.  Raccoons have had an impact on other species, for 
instance pheasant.  I enjoy pheasants but the raccoons have had 
an impact on them. 
Here we have interspecies activity.  I think we sometimes from 
our human activities miss that.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the interests of many of the individuals merge. I 
have said that I am an active outdoorsman.  I believe my 
interests merge with those of the industrialist who wants to do a 
sustainable harvest of some of the forests.  I believe that 
unless those individuals and industry look after some of these 
species they will get shut down completely and the harvest will 
not take place.  Of course, the harvest of a forest, if it is 
done properly, results in new growth and that new growth sustains 
and supports species sometimes at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operation is what is necessary.  I will not criticize the 
bill specifically, but I do not believe that co-operation is 
given the highest profile in this legislation. The co-operation I 
look at is the co-operation of a fellow like Francis Gardiner. 
Surely, if there is a species at risk on his property and if he 
is given the opportunity, he will do what he can do to prevent 
that species from being pushed aside.  If he cannot do 
enough—remember I said that this was an overall societal 
good—and it is determined that his land must be taken from him, 
either through the use being taken away from him, or actually 
purchasing the land from him, or maybe even expropriating it, if 
he does not get fair market value compensation it turns this 
steward of the land into an enemy of the species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing that I urge my colleagues across the way 
to do, it is to change the clause in the bill that says that 
compensation may be provided.  Compensation must be provided, if 
the public good says that the land is no longer available to a 
farmer, a rancher or somebody building an apartment building in a 
city, it does not matter what the land is designated for, even if 
it is a a grazing lease.  I cannot stress this strongly enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my colleagues opposite who put blinkers on and say that 
species at risk is the only issue, they know that in other 
jurisdictions there has been the shoot, shovel and shut up 
mentality.  As soon as a species at risk is found, it is shot and 
buried and nobody knows about it.  It is totally against what I 
believe the trustees of the land would do if they felt they would 
be treated properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific process is important when it comes to species at 
risk.  We have a big panel that will decide which species do in 
fact require protection.  That panel should also be given the 
task of looking at how the habitat should be protected.  It 
should also be given the task of coming up with the cost to the 
community at large to protect that species at risk, and when do 
the numbers allow us to back away from the program that is so 
specific for that species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some remarkable successes.  Canada has had a 
part to play in some of those successes.  I think of the whooping 
crane.  We knew how many of them there were in the world but we 
did not know where they nested or where they went for migration. 
Early on in these conservation efforts we used tracking methods 
that were quite primitive according to today's tracking methods 
and we also made some moves in capturing and raising whooping 
cranes and then releasing them into the wild.  This was a 
success story and it was done co-operatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Luckily, the whooping crane did not have a huge impact on 
landowners because they did nest far away in the north where 
there was not very much impact and most of the impact was from 
accidental killing and activity that was inappropriate as they 
went through their migration patterns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hope for species at risk.  There is an increased 
awareness of species at risk.  The Alliance will vigorously 
oppose some of the principles in this bill, especially the one 
with regard to the lack of compensation.  If the government 
thinks that it can take this issue and do it by regulation, it is 
be sadly mistaken because it will lose the goodwill of many of 
the individuals, certainly in my riding of Macleod.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal powers in this legislation get completely away from 
the co-operation I believe is necessary.  A person should be 
encouraged to be trustee of the land and given recognition. That 
is the way we will go.  If land must be taken away, it must be 
taken away in the public good in the larger sense with fair 
market compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on much longer about the bill.  It is an important 
one to people like me and to people in my part of the country. 
It is a privilege to speak briefly in this regard.  I encourage 
the government to look at the issue of compensation because 
surely that is where the bill will fail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise as parliament begins the September 
2000 session. First I want to congratulate the two new leaders 
who were elected and who were introduced in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were elected with a rather strong majority, which means 
they represent two important schools of thought in western and 
eastern Canada. They will have to make their opinions known in 
the debates we will have in the coming months, debates that can 
be heated at times while being respectful of every member who 
sits in this House. 
I think that the arrival of these two leaders from two different 
ridings, one in the east and one in the west, may help the 
government realize that it is not on the right track in many 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the economic side, there is a strong demand for a reform of 
the personal income tax system for middle income Canadians. We 
can also see that the government is making economic decisions 
that are not at all in the best interests of Canadians and 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of health, the provinces have fought hard to obtain 
an agreement, and yet it was reported in the media today that 
the federal government is still trying to say that this 
agreement does not say what it should say. It could simply have 
restored funding at the 1994 level, as the opposition had been 
requesting for a long time, and that would have solved the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been making one blunder after another in the 
arts, in the area of health, as I just mentioned, and in various 
other areas. I hope these new forces in the House will show the 
government that it has to rethink a lot of its legislation, 
including the bill before us today, which deals with species at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the federal government is clumsily interfering in 
areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
We, who are members from Quebec, are proud mainly because the 
Quebec government has, especially since 1989, made extraordinary 
efforts to protect these species, requesting zoning changes in 
some areas and environmental changes to prohibit the dumping of 
some undesirable substances in specific rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec legislation is really helping to protect endangered 
species and supporting the environmental community, which claims 
to be very satisfied. Of course, they want more, they expect 
more, but they have someone to whom they can turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a way for the federal government to get involved, if it 
wishes to do so, in the protection of endangered species not 
under its jurisdiction. 
But why has it, once again, decided to meddle in a provincial 
area of jurisdiction? It is like a disease the leader of the 
Liberal Party has and is now passing on to his members, where he 
gets the urge to forget about the constitution and to infringe 
upon provincial areas of jurisdiction. In this case, it is so 
obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame to see the government members say nothing while 
the Bloc members, all from Quebec, stand up for the interests of 
their fellow Quebecers. We have heard the member for Chambly as 
well as the member for Portneuf talk about the legal issues. We 
all heard of course the brilliant speech made earlier by the 
member for Laval East.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These members are telling us how important it is to look at this 
bill very seriously in order to achieve a greater respect of 
jurisdictions, the provinces' and Quebec's. The fact that we are 
asking this government to respect the constitution it enacted is 
nothing new. It is clear and simple. However, every time we have 
to go back to square one. We have to repeat the same thing over 
and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worse part is that today as we are demanding respect 
for provincial jurisdiction and the Canadian constitution, the 
Quebec members on the other side are not saying a thing. They 
hang their heads in shame. I can see them across the way. 
They are ashamed their party is not allowing them to speak on 
the issue. They have to keep their mouths shut to be able to 
serve in a government, but one that is working against Quebec's 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised to hear that the two new members who crossed the 
floor of the House said “We are crossing the floor to better 
serve Quebec”. Did they change sides to tell the Liberal caucus 
“You are going to change your methods, you do not understand, 
you are going to have to respect jurisdictions, you will respect 
Quebec”. No, they did not. They only crossed the floor of the 
House a few days ago and already they have become meek little 
sheep who wait for a signal to raise their arm and speak, and no 
longer think for themselves. Since they crossed the floor 
somebody else is doing the thinking for them. They now belong to 
the silent party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Liberal party should change its name to the 
“Muffler Party”, as its members' voices are very muffled. 
I think this name would suit them very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore appeal to the members from Quebec across the way who 
say they are defending Quebec's interests.  Ministers of the 
government of Quebec, whether members of the Parti Quebecois or 
the Liberal Party, have always stated clearly that in this area 
the legislation that Quebec has had since 1989 serves Quebec's 
interests very well.  According to Mr. Bégin, who was quoted 
earlier by the member for Laval Centre: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has always behaved in a responsible and appropriate 
manner regarding the protection of the most threatened fauna and 
flora species and intends to keep on exercising its authority in 
this matter. We will never accept umbrella legislation covering 
all the initiatives in this area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the statement quoted by the member for Laval earlier. 
The message is simple: the government of Quebec is telling the 
government in Ottawa that if they each mind their own business, 
everyone will get along.  But who is still promoting discord, 
unnecessary debate and wasted energy?  The answer is this 
government, which has made this its trademark, its raison 
d'être. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the members from Quebec across the way, including the 
member for Shefford who has just, as I mentioned earlier, 
crossed the floor to announce that she wanted to defend Quebec's 
interests, but who is mum on this issue. 
Worse yet, she is getting ready to vote against Quebec in her 
first official action as a member of the Liberal Party when 
occasionally, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, 
she voted for Quebec's interests.  In the case of Bill C-20, for 
instance, she showed courage.  But now that has all gone.  She 
has lost her nerve.  The election is approaching and it must be 
won.  But do voters feel the same way? We shall see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true for the members from Quebec for 
Pierrefonds-Dollard, and Beauce.  What does the member for 
Beauce, who is caucus president, have to say?  As president of 
the caucus in Quebec, he must defend Quebec's interests.  How is 
it that he is silent in the face of such a major assault on 
provincial jurisdiction?  What do the members for Brossard—La 
Prairie, and Lac-Saint-Louis think?  The latter was a former 
minister of the environment in Quebec. 
Never, as Quebec minister of the environment, would he have 
allowed such an intrusion into provincial jurisdiction.  He was 
its staunch defender at the time and, moreover, the one that saw 
the legislation passed in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what kind of shot they give people when they 
become Liberals, but it always has an extremely good sedative 
effect. 
It renders people speechless, they never rise again to defend 
interests, they draw their salary and hope for the Prime 
Minister's help in getting re-elected.

efficiently and effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the hon. members for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, for

up? The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the Minister of

Trade, who are all Quebec MPs, please understand that it is in 
the best interests of Quebec to oppose this bill, to make 
amendments to it if necessary.  At least, have something to say. 
Do not remain silent, earning the label of members of the 
“Muffler Party”.  No, you will surely be something other than 
that, I trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing then, I appeal to you all to wake up at last.  Wake 
up, work with us, so that this provincial jurisdiction will be 
respected and we can avoid yet another federal-provincial

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, who is an excellent 
parliamentarian. We are of course very pleased to have him with 
us in the Bloc Quebecois. He is a man with a lot of experience 
and a sound judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member clearly showed us how sad the situation is, with 
the people across the way not speaking up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of the government House leader, the member for 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell. I am not ruling out the possibility of 
going door to door in his riding with my Bloc Quebecois 
colleagues to tell his voters about the real nature of this 
House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget the prowess of the House leader and the 
current Minister of Canadian Heritage. I understand that, like 
her House leader, she does not support the Minister of Finance, but 
supports the Prime Minister, which explains why she is still a 
member of cabinet. 
Let us not forget how, when they formed the opposition, these 
people felt about non-confidence motions. They desperately asked 
for parliamentary reform and for freedom of expression within 
the political parties. But where is that freedom of expression 
when Quebec MPs must protect the higher interests of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always the same predictable scenario. They cave in, they 
show no political courage, they let the steamroller go over 
Quebec, at the expense of our province's higher interests. This 
must end. Fortunately, the Bloc Quebecois is here. Which party 
is leading in the polls in Quebec? It is the Bloc Quebecois. 
What will be the strengths of the Bloc in the next election? We 
will always be there to protect the interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague, the government House leader, wish to say 
something? No. Just like his own party, he remains callously 
silent when the time comes to stand up for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this in a very cordial way, because here in the House, 
friendship must prevail. However we cannot let the federal 
government interfere once again in an area outside of its 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the government members to tell me something. Who is 
supporting such a bill? The Quebec government is against it. The 
environmental community is against it. Why is the government so 
determined to use such a tool when it could be acting within its 
own jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is acting as if it has taken some very positive 
measures to protect the environment. But what has the auditor 
general had to say about the decontamination of federal lands 
and sites? He said the government is dragging its feet. What has 
the auditor general had to say about the ratification of the Rio 
Convention and especially its regulatory framework? He said the 
government has been tardy in doing so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-289, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (child 
adoption expenses), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is good to see you back after the 
summer.  I know you had a busy one.  I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak to Bill C-289, my bill that was drawn not long ago.  I 
appreciate it being before the House.  Unfortunately, although we 
made a very heavily supported recommendation to the committee 
from people right across the country, the bill was not deemed 
votable.  However I appreciate this hour of debate in the House. 
I know many who are interested in this topic are watching today 
on the network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states in its own summary that its purpose to enact an 
allowance for taxpayers, a deduction for expenses related to the 
adoption of a child that does not exceed $7,000 when computing 
his or her income for a taxation year.  The expenses must have 
been incurred in that taxation year or in the previous two years. 
That is the summary of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the bill would recognize that adoptive parents make 
a significant social contribution to our society by adopting 
children that have a need for parenting, and that this activity 
should be encouraged and supported for the good of children and 
for the good of society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that this is a very important bill and worthy of being 
deemed votable.  Unfortunately we did not get that, but I would 
hope that in the future parliament would entertain doing more for 
adoptive parents.  I think we can all agree that adoption is a 
gentle option to ensure that a child can be placed with loving 
and generous parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However adoptive parents often face significant upfront costs 
when they embark on adoption, and out of pocket adoption expenses 
are not tax deductible.  This bill would be a first step toward 
addressing some of the concerns of adoptive parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoptive parents have unique challenges and expenses when they 
adopt a child.  Even in public adoptions where provinces have 
traditionally covered the related adoption expenses, we are now 
starting to see adoptive parents faced with new fees and ever 
increasing costs such as $1,200 for home studies, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a private or international adoption, couples may 
face costs in the thousands of dollars in legal fees, home 
studies and a number of other studies that they must cover off. 
Such upfront costs may result in the discouragement of couples 
even thinking of adoption.  It would thus serve a larger public 
interest to allow adoptive parents to deduct expenses related to 
the adoption of a child to better facilitate and better encourage 
this act of generosity and love that serves us all so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-289 is essentially an adoption expense deduction bill 
which proposes to allow a taxpayer a deduction of up to $7,000 
for expenses related to adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the bill follows consultation with a number 
of adoption organizations as well as individuals who have 
personally adopted children.  Statistics Canada's national 
longitudinal survey of children and youth has clearly shown us, 
in empirical terms, clear measurables, that an environment where 
there is a mother and a father is an environment where children 
thrive.  Children without parents are at a disadvantage.  I 
believe we should do all we can to encourage families who have 
the desire to adopt children instead of making adoption a 
difficult alternative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to send a message of appreciation for the social 
contribution that adoptive parents make and recognize the 
inequities that adoptive parents face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoption is under the control of the provinces, but Bill C-289 
is a means by which this important institution could be 
encouraged and supported at a federal level through the means of 
a federal tax deduction format.  Bill C-289 therefore is 
constitutional and fulfils another of the guidelines that the 
subcommittee required for a bill to be deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some details of the bill.  As I said, it would cover 
off the legal expenses related to adoption.  Any kind of illegal 
adoption or surrogate parenting arrangements would not be 
covered, but the legal adoption expenses that relate to adoption 
would be tax deductible up to a maximum of $7,000.  The $7,000 
figure was used so that it would be the same as the maximum 
amount deductible for the child care expense deduction currently 
in the tax code, the CCED, which is essentially a deduction that 
recognizes the costs of third party care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the state can recognize these costs, I believe it is 
appropriate to recognize that there are costs specifically 
related to adoption which adoptive parents face.  The adoption 
expense deduction would be available for both domestic and 
foreign adoption.  It would include expenses for pre-adoption 
home study as well as birth parent counselling and travel 
expenses related to the adoption of the child.  All these are 
incurred regularly by adoptive parents today with no recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be available for the adoption of any child under 17 
years old, again matching the CCED provisions.  If any expenses 
are to reimbursed by an employer or by the government, they would 
not be eligible for this tax deduction.  We thought out those 
aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers of adoptions are difficult to attain but the Library 
of Parliament indicates that the total number of domestic 
adoptions in 1990 was about 2,800.  The most recent figures 
available indicate that some 1,800 international adoptions 
occurred in 1997.  The province of Quebec estimates that the 
average cost of an international adoption for adoptive parents is 
$20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paper that the Library of Parliament prepared for my office 
used the assumption that Bill C-289 would not come at a high cost 
to the treasury.  The estimated cost to federal tax revenues for 
this bill, using a $7,000 adoption expense deduction, is 
approximately $5 million at the current estimated adoption 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to sending a message of appreciation and 
encouragement that parliament could send to adoptive parents 
through the bill, allowing adoption expenses to be tax deductible 
would make the tax system more equitable for adoptive parents for 
two reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, biological parents have the pre-natal and post-natal 
costs of having children covered under medicare, but adoptive 
parents have to pay out of pocket expenses related to adoption 
costs directly out of after tax income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, currently fertility treatments are tax deductible. 
According to the Library of Parliament fertility treatment 
expenses are eligible for the existing 17% federal tax credit for 
medical expenses provided for in section 118.2 of the Income Tax 
Act.  Thus it could be argued, and this is straight from the 
document prepared by the Library of Parliament for my office, 
that among those taxpayers who are unable to have children 
naturally the current tax law favours those who seek fertility 
treatment over those who adopt.  Yet it could be said that 
adoption is more socially beneficial since it aims to provide a 
family for children who already exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inherently unfair and poor public policy for expenses 
related to in vitro fertilization to be tax deductible while 
adoption expenses, which by definition relate to a case where a 
child has already been born and is in need of parents, are not 
tax deductible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end I also submit to the House that adoption saves the 
taxpayer money as many children in need of parents would no 
longer be under the care of the state with the related expenses 
that are all paid by the state.  It would result in a permanency 
for the child, which would also result in a stronger society and 
as a whole more healthy child development with a two parent 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This topic has been in the media.  I just make reference to some 
of the statements that have been captured in the media concerning 
this issue.  The Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> on January 4, 2000, in 
an article by Leah Janzen indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with a critical shortage of loving homes for older children 
and those with special needs, Child and Family Services is 
offering paycheques to adoptive parents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not something we are advocating here, but we are 
advocating through the tax system the recognition of the social 
contribution made by adoptive parents.  Ms. Janzen went on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But so far, with about 700 needy children on their waiting list 
and only 125 prospective parents in sight, the gap is still 
heartbreakingly wide. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on April 3, 1999, Derek McNaughton 
wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1997 and 1998, the adoption rate for children from 
overseas countries jumped by at least 30 per cent.  For China, 
the number of adopted children has rocketed upward by 73 per 
cent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, Quebec is the only province providing tax relief for 
adoptive parents.  And in its recent budget, the Quebec 
government raised the allowable tax deduction for adoptive 
parents from a ceiling of $2,000 to $3,000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lady whom I have had some contact with on this topic, Judy 
Grove, executive director of the Adoption Council of Canada, says 
that the issue of tax relief is rooted in how this country values 
children.  She says that politicians from both federal and 
provincial governments are long on rhetoric about the needs of 
children but short on action.  She states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's very shortsighted, adoption, from the view of the state, is 
a cost effective process because kids that are adopted are not on 
the child welfare budget.  If you look at the effect of allowing 
tax breaks, it makes adoption easier and therefore it saves the 
state money. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She makes a very valuable and valid point.  The Adoption Council 
of Canada has also sent a number of letters to my office.  In one 
of those letters on this private member's bill it points out that 
there are more than 70,000 children in foster care in Canada. 
More than 20,000 of these children are available for adoption. 
One of the main barriers, they pointed out to me, to the adoption 
of these children is the financial burden adoptive parents face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most adoptions of Canadian newborns and infants are facilitated 
through private adoption agencies which have fees that range 
anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000, and in some cases even more than 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposed tax deduction will make it more feasible for lower 
income families or those concerned about the costs to adopt and 
care for children.  That just makes sense.  This bill would be a 
public recognition or a statement on the value of the 
contribution those parents are making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about public support?  Do Canadians want Bill C-289 to 
pass?  I would submit that public opinion is very supportive. 
Since I first introduced the bill in the first session of the 
36th parliament petitions of support have steadily been coming 
into the House of Commons.  I have received many e-mails and many 
letters of support with really no media play or public promotion 
on my part at all.  I was actually surprised by the overwhelming 
support I have had on the bill without really publicizing it or 
promoting it in the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In parliament there have been about 4,000 signatures on 
petitions in support of the bill already presented to the House 
of Commons.  I have another 1,000 signatures waiting. I have some 
petitions that I wanted to present here today but I plan to do 
that tomorrow, all in support of the bill.

across the country.  I would also like to thank the many adoptive 
parents who sent me pictures and letters and encouraged me to 
contact other members of parliament to support this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is good legislation.  I urge all members to strongly 
consider making a bill of this kind something the government 
would develop legislation for and that we move to recognize the 
contribution of adoptive parents, especially when we so regularly 
say how important children are and how legislation needs to be in 
the best interests of children.  Recognizing the contribution of 
adoptive parents would go a long way to us taking a step in that 
direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill 
proposed by the hon. member for Calgary Centre would allow 
taxpayers to deduct expenses related to the adoption of a child 
to a maximum of $7,000.  While I am sure that the member opposite 
from Calgary Centre has been motivated to present this bill to 
the House of Commons for all the right reasons, a basic principle 
of our income tax system is that tax relief is not generally 
provided for personal expenses, such as adoption costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government is aware that parents adopting a child 
incur relatively high costs, these and other personal expenses do 
not qualify for tax assistance because they are incurred at an 
individual's discretion in widely varying amounts and types 
depending on the individual's tastes, lifestyle and economic 
status.  The higher the socioeconomic status of the taxpayer, the 
more likely he or she is to incur larger and more varied personal 
expenses.  If these expenses were made deductible, a portion of 
the personal expenses incurred by some taxpayers would be 
financed by taxpayers at large. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When tax assistance is provided with regard to expenses, it 
applies to expenses incurred to earn an income, for example 
child care expenses, union dues or job related moving expenses, 
or to largely non-discretionary expenses, such as higher than 
normal medical expenses. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of child care expenses.  As hon. members 
know, eligible child care expenses are deductible in computing 
income.  The purpose of the child care expense deduction is to 
recognize that taxpayers who need to incur child care expenses to 
earn employment or business income, to attend a recognized 
educational institution or to take an eligible vocational 
training course have a lower ability to pay taxes than taxpayers 
with the same income who do not need to incur such expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care expense deduction provides a tax deduction of up 
to $7,000 annually for expenses related to the care of a child 
under the age of seven and of up to $4,000 for a child between 
the ages of seven and 15. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it would be difficult to separate the personal and 
non-discretionary components of child related expenses, tax 
assistance is provided to families with children in the form of 
a benefit, the amount of which is predetermined, rather than in 
the form of tax credits or deductions for specific expenses. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House may know, the government provides considerable 
financial support to families with children through the Canada 
child tax benefit, the CCTB.  More specifically, the CCTB has two 
components: the base benefit and the national child benefit. 
Under the base benefit families currently receive up to $1,020 
per child.  In addition, supplements of $213 for each child under 
the age of seven where no child care expenses are claimed and $75 
for the third and each subsequent child are added to the base 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional assistance is provided to low income families with 
children under the national child benefit, the NCB.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of July 1999 NCB benefits are $785 for the first child, $585 
for the second and $510 for the third and each subsequent child. 
Therefore, the maximum CCTB benefit is $1,805 for the first child 
and $1,605 for each subsequent child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years our government has proven that it is 
committed to investing the future of our children.  In fact, even 
before the budget was balanced, the government committed $850 
million to the Canada child tax benefit to start building the 
national child benefit in 1997.  In the 1998 budget the federal 
government enriched the NCB by an additional $850 million.  The 
design of this enrichment was set out in the 1999 budget which 
also proposed an additional investment of $300 million to extend 
benefit enhancements to modest and middle income families. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover the budget tabled in the House on February 28 
contained a five year plan to increase benefits under the Canada 
child tax benefit by $2.5 billion annually by 2004. That means 
that the maximum Canada child tax benefit has increased to 
$2,056 in July 2000 and will reach $2,400 by 2004. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the three budgets preceding the 2000 budget, the government 
invested a total of $2 billion a year in the Canada child tax 
benefit.  With the additional investment of $2.5 billion a year 
proposed in the 2000 budget, by 2004 over $9 billion will be 
devoted each year to helping families with the cost of raising 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I also want to emphasize that the significant 
tax reduction measures proposed in the last four budgets were 
especially beneficial to families with children.  By 2004-05, the 
measures in these budgets will translate into a 30% reduction in 
the tax burden for families with children, compared to 22% on 
average for all Canadians.  The measures presented in the 2000 
budget alone will mean a 21% reduction in the tax burden for 
families with children, compared to 15% for all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year tax reduction plan announced in budget 2000 
proposes to restore full indexation of the personal income tax 
system.  This will protect families against automatic tax 
increases and erosion in benefits caused by inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the plan proposes broad based personal income tax 
reductions.  For the first time in 12 years, a reduction in a tax 
rate is being proposed.  The middle tax rate will be reduced from 
26% to 23% by 2004.  As well, it is proposed that by 2004 the 
amount Canadians can earn tax free will increase to at least 
$8,000, while the income levels at which the middle and top tax 
rates begin to apply will increased to at least $35,000 and 
$70,000 respectively.  It is also proposed that the 5% surtax be 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, the 2000 budget proposes a minimum of $39.5 billion in 
personal income tax relief for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was announced at that time that the government hoped to 
accelerate the five year tax reduction plan.  Well, the 
government is now able to guarantee that it will do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government believes that parents should 
receive financial assistance to help them meet the needs of 
their children, and we are giving it to them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it would not be appropriate to ask taxpayers at large 
to subsidize adoption expenses through the tax system because of 
the largely discretionary nature of these personal expenses. 
Therefore, I ask that all hon. members not support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment 
is to allow a taxpayer to claim a deduction for expenses of up to 
$7,000 related to the adoption of a child when calculating his or 
her income for a taxation year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that in 1998 my colleague from the Bloc, the 
member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, 
introduced a bill similar to this one. I believe the only 
difference was that we were asking for a deduction of $10,000 
instead of $7,000. It is the main difference between the two 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a bill my party, the Bloc Quebecois, and myself 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know adoption is a provincial responsibility. However the 
lack of participation on the part of the federal government 
creates a grey area for adoptive parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal tax deduction would not only be a welcome incentive 
for adoptive parents, but also would make the tax system fairer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biological parents are covered under the health insurance plan 
for prenatal and post-natal care whereas adoptive parents must 
pay out of their own pocket the full cost of an adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is odd that the costs of in vitro fertilization are 
deductible when the costs of adopting a child are not. This is 
neither fair nor wise on the part of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children of the World, one of the largest Canadian adoption 
agencies, estimates the cost of adopting a child in China at 
$17,270 per couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, my colleague, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, adopted a little Asian girl.  He has 
confirmed to me that the adoption expenses were over $20,000 
Canadian. These figures include expenses in Quebec and in China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I would like to tell the House about a small 
expense chart that Children of the World sent me. 
It must not be forgotten that when one wishes to adopt a child 
internationally, there are administrative expenses, expenses for 
psychological testing, for parents' birth certificates, marriage 
certificates, letters from physicians, notaries' fees, legal 
expenses, law stamps, the embassy, contacts with foreign 
countries, enrolling with the Canada-China adoption association, translation 
of files into Chinese.  This mounts up to $7,422 
before leaving Canada to actually adopt a child.  To this must 
be added the expenses incurred abroad:  donations to the 
orphanage, the fees of a notary in China, passport fees for the 
child one wishes to bring back, airfare and accommodation, 
totalling $17,270. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should recognize, as Quebec does, the 
important social contribution of adoptive parents in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been observed that half of Canadian adoptions are to 
Quebec families.  This is in part due to the fact that Quebec's 
family policy is far more progressive than that of the federal 
government.

of private and international adoptions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many couples who want to adopt a child think about it twice 
because of all the expenses it entails, which is where this bill 
comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost nine years now, Quebec has undergone a change quite 
unique in the western world: every year, 700 to 800 children 
from all over the world finally find in Quebec a family to adopt 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It obviously would have made adoption easier if the adoptive parents 
were able to deduct from their income, at the federal level, the 
child adoption expenses, not by an amount not exceeding 
$7,000 as is stipulated in this bill, but by double that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about adoption without talking about family. In 
Quebec, we are proud to have an integrated and comprehensive 
family policy. The policy includes among other things a tax 
credit for adoption expenses, family allowance benefits and the 
development of educational services and day care for young 
children, what is commonly known as the $5-a-day day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is also developing a parental insurance program based on 
the needs of families in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it is obvious that the federal government is 20 years 
behind in this area and by quickly passing this bill, it would 
at least be taking a step in the right direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to this bill, which introduces adoption expense 
deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised at the argument from the Liberal member across 
that categorizes this as a personal expense.  I think adoption is 
probably one of the most impersonal expenses anybody can put 
forth.  People will be adopting a child of parents whom they do 
not know.  They will not know the child and they will not know if 
the child is going to be troubled.  If it is an international 
adoption the child could have been denied love, stimulation and 
care.  They will be facing the problems of integrating that child 
into their home and their community.  They could be adopting a 
child that has fetal alcohol syndrome or other problems as a 
result of the parents' actions.  So it is an incredibly 
impersonal expense that a family makes when they decide to adopt. 
We are talking about families and the incredible struggle they 
go through to adopt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen some of my friends go through five years of trying 
to adopt.  What they submit themselves to, no biological parent 
has to.  They have to do a home study in which they are asked the 
most personal, intimate questions one could ever imagine.  No one 
would even want to answer them, but they have to answer them 
because they want to adopt a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They need letters of reference so they have to go to different 
people of good standing in the community and ask if they would 
consider them to be good parents and then get them to write 
letters for them.  They need psychological assessments which at a 
minimum are probably about $90 an hour.  Their religious 
standards are scrutinized.  Their income is scrutinized.  Their 
age, are they too young or too old.  Their health, are they 
healthy and what their family history is when it comes to mental 
health.  I was certainly never asked those questions when I was 
young and having children.  I have four children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My big expense of having children was to buy a crib that lasted 
for all four of them.  If I had to pay out $20,000 or $10,000 or 
even $1,000 per child at that age, I certainly could not have 
done it.  However, we are expecting these people, who will be 
making a contribution to our community and who will be raising 
other people's children as their own, to do so without any kind 
of break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am again really disappointed at the Liberal approach of 
categorizing adoptive parents' desire to have children as a 
personal expense.  It is shocking and hurtful to anybody who is 
willing to go through the expense and the gruelling ordeal of 
adopting a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been mentioned, there are public and private 
adoptions in this country but they both involve huge expenses. As 
I have said, the family has emotional expenses as well as 
financial expenses to go through.  I do not think we should 
promote this bill just because it would save the government 
money. 
I think we should support it because it is the right thing to do. 
We should support it because it would support families and it 
would be a good addition to any children's agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to put forward something seriously it is 
critical that we recognize parents who are willing to adopt.  Not 
everybody is capable of adopting or of seeing those children 
through all the years of adoption.  It is not always easy. These 
families are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just talking to a woman today who has adopted three 
children.  It was an international adoption.  It is difficult for 
families to adopt a child who may come from a wartorn country and 
has been traumatized.  Adopting families do not know the child's 
history or what life holds for them.  I do not have to face those 
questions with my children but we are not willing to give people 
who adopt children from anywhere, who look after them, love them, 
care for them and do all the things that we would do for our own 
children, a leg up or a boost, even in this small way of 
recognizing the initial financial costs of an adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a lot of ways we can not ameliorate or lessen the 
psychological and emotional impact an adoption has on people. It 
is a gruelling test of their character.  Anyone who does adopt 
should be applauded rather than penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a private member's bill that is worthy of support by all 
MPs in the House.  They should stand and say “Yes, we will 
support you in every way we can because your struggles are 
different than ours”.  It would be another addition to our 
criteria as a family and there is just no way that what they do 
could ever be considered as just a self-serving personal expense 
because it is not self-serving.  They have been serving other 
people for decades by including adoptive children in their 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this bill proposes a tax deduction for the costs relating to the 
adoption of a child, up to a total of $7,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the bill's good intentions, I believe that the problem 
of this country's children is far more serious.  Amending the 
Income Tax Act by adding another clause does nothing but 
complicate still further a piece of legislation that is already 
overly complicated and does not solve the real problem.  There 
are 2.5 million children living in poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems that are being experienced by low income families, 
particularly single mothers, require examination by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living in poverty is not easy.  Being unable to provide one's 
children with the necessities of life sometimes pushes certain 
people into making hard decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this country needs to ensure that a favourable 
environment is created to acknowledge the good will of those who 
choose to be parents.  Parenting is not always easy, especially 
in the year 2000, with the high cost of living, and the many 
challenges our young people have to deal with: drugs in the 
schools, finding jobs, even if their parents can manage to find 
enough money for their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Becoming a parent involves many costs. As parliamentarians, we 
have a duty to ensure that parents, that single mothers with 
children can choose. People must first be able to choose to have 
children, but they must also be able to decide to keep their 
children. It is often for economic reasons that young parents are 
forced to give their children up for adoption. We are very lucky 
to always find parents who are prepared to adopt these children, 
to give them a good life, to see that they live in a healthy and 
safe environment with all the necessities of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we have a duty as parliamentarians to make sure that 
Canadians have the necessary tools to provide what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for Calgary Centre really believes 
that the solution to the problems facing children in this country 
lies in tax cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To listen to Canadian Alliance members, one would think that all 
the problems in this country are tax-related. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been been a single mom for a few years, my son and I 
certainly know, as we all know, that we need some form of tax 
reduction.  We also know that there are many single parents out 
there who need a lot of different help.  Far too often the reform 
alliance feels that the solution to every problem in Canada is to 
reduce taxes.  I do not believe that reducing taxes solves every 
problem.  We have to address problems in many directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the changes to the unemployment insurance program 
introduced by this government in 1996, many single parents have 
had difficulty over the last four years because it targeted 
families at the lower end of the scale when it came to income and 
jobs.  We know it has also targeted families living in 
communities dependent on the seasonal industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to the provinces' social transfers have dramatically 
increased the cost of post-secondary education.  What is more 
devastating than to cut off from a teenager the chance to get an 
education which would permit that young person to get job and 
have a future?  As parliamentarians we do have a responsibility 
to make sure that when legislation is passed in the House that we 
are not targeting the ones who do not have a way to defend 
themselves.  It has happened too often in the House that policies 
are made, legislation is passed and we are targeting groups, 
especially women and children, and that is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must recognize parents who have chosen to provide good and 
safe homes for children across the country.  Choosing to become a 
parent is not an easy task.  Every one of us who either has 
children or who knows parents who have children know it is not an 
easy task in today's society with all the challenges that our 
children are facing.  Sometimes both parents have to work whether 
they want to or not.  It is a must today in order to make ends 
meet.  If both parents are working in a region where the minimum 
wage is $5.50 or where there is only a seasonal industry, we can 
just imagine what the children are living on in winter.  I 
believe 2.5 million children living in poverty is way to many. 
It is 2.5 million children too many as far as I am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can address some of the barriers through tax reduction but we 
also need to see a commitment on the part of the government that 
will truly address the real problems of the country: too many 
hungry children living in this very rich country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege as a Canadian 
Alliance member to support my colleague's bill, the member for 
Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the privilege of having several adopted nephews, four to 
be exact, and an adopted niece.  In a counselling role, I have 
worked with couples who were sterile or could not conceive a 
child in the normal way.  It was a big concern to them to have 
the adoption option.  It would also have been a big concern to 
those people to have some kind of support.  Some of them did not 
have a lot of financial means.  They came from lower income 
groups and would have found it to be a a great drain on their 
resources to adopt children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, many parents do proceed at great sacrifice because 
children are dear, special and precious to them, but I do believe 
that it would be of great assistance to have the kinds of measure 
that are in the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-289, as has been said, is essentially an adoption expense 
deduction bill.  We are not talking about an infinite amount of 
dollars that would be allowed as an income tax deduction, as my 
Liberal colleague across the way inferred at a point.  It is 
capped at $7,000 for expenses incurred as a result of adopting a 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members on this side of the House have said, I would also 
agree that this is not a simple purchase of a car or some other 
luxury item.  This rates as an altogether different kind of 
thing. 
These are couples who want to adopt because they are in some 
cases sterile or for various other reasons cannot have children 
by the normal way.  It is not purely a discretionary issue or 
choice as was implied by my colleague across the way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deduction would be available for the adoption of any child 
under 17 years old, matching the child care expense deduction 
provisions.  Expenses to be reimbursed by the employer or by 
government would not be eligible for the tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated by colleagues in the House in response to the 
bill thus far, without doubt adoptive parents would face a huge 
financial burden.  It does not matter whether the adoption 
process is public or private or whether it is in Canada.  When it 
is international it involves travel and involves a great deal 
more in costs as well.  Sometimes these costs are considerable. 
Sometimes they are prohibitive.  Let us consider a few of these 
costs.  Some have been referred to, but I will just reiterate 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are expenses for pre-adoption home study undertaken by a 
couple hoping to adopt.  That first base is as far as some of 
them may get because of the rigours of the whole process.  There 
might be agency fees involved in private adoptions.  Even in 
public adoptions where provinces have traditionally covered 
expenses relating to adoption, we are now seeing adoptive parents 
faced with new fees and ever increasing costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There might be costs for counselling for the birth parents who 
must grieve the loss of the baby if the child to be adopted is an 
infant, or in the case of a mother who is giving up her baby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For international adoptions my Bloc colleague noted considerable 
travel expenses, transportation, meals, lodging and other 
expenses related to the child's immigration into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the judicial expenses.  We know that lawyers are 
not cheap.  There is the adoption order, whether it is a Canadian 
one or a foreign one.  On top of that, international adoption 
orders may require that the couple obtain a recognition order in 
Canada as well so that the foreign adoption order will have the 
same force and effect as a Canadian adoption order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that some couples will have two judicial expenses, 
one in each country.  Let us not forget the legal fees that will 
change hands if there are several lawyers involved in the whole 
process.  I think hon. members get the idea that significant 
amounts of money can change hands in an adoption, especially in 
the case of private and international adoptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec estimates that the average cost of an 
international adoption is at least $20,000.  I believe that it is 
unacceptable that these expenses are not tax deductible.  What is 
unacceptable is that expenses associated with adoptions are paid 
with after tax dollars.  The tax system in my opinion is quite 
unfair in this regard.  It does not provide a tax deduction for 
adoption expenses, even though it provides tax relief for couples 
who become parents through means other than adoption, and I will 
get on to citing some of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Income Tax Act is unfair in its treatment of 
new adoptive parents.  I want to look at some of the 
inconsistencies and the unfairness in the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Income Tax Act makes provision for parents of 
children who are born naturally.  Such parents have the pre-natal 
and post-natal costs of having a child covered under medicare 
across our country.  Adoptive parents, however, do not have 
either the direct assistance of public funds or even the direct 
assistance of a tax break, as we are talking about here today. 
While society pays for the cost of a parent's birthing of a 
child, an adoptive parent has to pay for the entire cost of 
adopting a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as was said before but I think bears repeating just to 
show the unfairness or the inequity, the Income Tax Act makes 
provision for parents whose children are conceived and born as a 
result of fertility treatments which are tax deductible. 
According to the Library of Parliament, fertility treatment 
expenses are eligible for the existing 17% federal tax credit for 
medical expenses provided for in section 118.2 of the Income Tax 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus it could be argued that among those taxpayers who are 
unable to have children naturally, the current tax law favours 
those who seek fertility treatment over those who adopt.  Yet it 
could be said that adoption is more socially beneficial since it 
aims to provide a family for children who already exist.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inherently unfair for expenses related to in vitro 
fertilization to be tax deductible while adoption expenses are 
not tax deductible as things stand.  There is really no logical 
reason for it.  There is no consistency at all in its approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Income Tax Act does allow parents to deduct child 
care expenses.  My colleague referred to that.  It does not 
distinguish between adoptive parents and parents who have given 
birth naturally, or between adoptive parents and couples who have 
used fertility treatments.  They all are allowed that expense 
under the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parents who use day care receive the deduction.  There is 
another matter of parents who provide care at home and are not 
given the deduction, which is unfair, but that is another matter 
for another date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is inconsistent for the government to treat 
adoptive parents and natural parents the same when it comes to 
the costs involved in parenting by way of the deduction for child 
care expenses, yet differently when it comes to the costs 
involved in becoming parents.  I think my colleague, in weighing 
the logic, is thinking he can understand that there is an 
inconsistency in that whole approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no justification for this inequity since new parents 
contribute equally to society regardless of how they become 
parents, whether by adoption, whether biologically or whether by 
in vitro fertilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were a good reason for this unfair treatment then 
perhaps we could justify it, but there is no reason.  No reason 
exists.  New parents contribute equally to society regardless of 
how they become parents.  A child, its needs and its potential 
for contributing to society are the same, whether there has been 
an adoption, in vitro fertilization or a natural birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the logic would suggest that a tax deduction for 
adoption expenses makes as much sense as medicare spending in 
maternity wards and as much sense as the current tax deduction 
for infertility treatments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think of the benefits of adoptions to society.  Children 
who would otherwise grow up without parents gain parents to love 
them, discipline them and teach them, parents committed to them 
for the long term.  The likelihood of positive outcomes for such 
children would be much greater.  It translates into better 
physical and mental health, better grades in school, and a 
greater contribution as adults in the workplace and in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents who adopt love their children.  They make deliberate 
choices and deliberate sacrifices.  Adoption is a positive thing 
for society and it makes sense to encourage adoption by use of a 
tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What loss is there to government tax revenues?  Not very much at 
all.  In fact public coffers would be offset by reduced 
government expenditures in several ways.  It costs money for the 
state to provide care for unadopted children.  Adoptions 
therefore save taxpayer money as the new parents assume financial 
responsibility for the children.  There would be reduced mental 
health costs, criminal justice system costs and prison system 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would also be increased sales tax revenues from the 
parents spending on adopted children.  Once grown, those children 
would be healthy, contributing members of society who would pay 
taxes themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill.  I would move at this point that it 
be made votable by unanimous consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Wanuskewin has asked for unanimous consent of the House that the 
private member's bill now before the House be made votable.  Is 
there unanimous consent?

Speaker, I am encouraged by the debate today.  I thought there 
were some good points made, in particular on this side of the 
House.  I hope they registered with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am struck by the fact that in the House we hear a lot about a 
children's agenda.  We hear a lot about “the best interests of 
children”. 
The bill we are debating talks about children in need of 
adoption.  Some 70,000 children are wards of the government and 
20,000 of them are ready for adoption today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the best interests of children, yet we have a 
government that will not entertain incentives or recognize 
legislation that shows appreciation for the contribution adoptive 
parents make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that talks about $2.2 billion for school 
programs and for children to be cared for in state run 
institutions.   We talk about the child tax credit.  There is 
lots of money through the child tax credit.  I am not knocking 
that. We talk about child tax recognition for infertility 
treatments. We talk about child tax credits and recognition for 
child care expense deductions for those parents who choose to go 
out and work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we will not consider tax recognition for parents who 
probably make one of the largest social contributions possible by 
adopting children who otherwise would never have the benefit of a 
mother and a father.  They are stuck as wards of the state and 
shifted from one foster home to another.  Many of us know that 
the social costs of that kind of damage to a child go on and on. 
We could do something about it with a piece of legislation like 
this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage making it easier for loving parents who want to 
adopt but are faced with financial burdens and financial 
hardships to do it.  We could do something about it in the House 
today if we were to embrace legislation of this type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the House should be about. I am tired of the 
rhetoric about best interests of children and a children's 
agenda, yet we ignore something as simple and as straightforward 
as this legislation.  It is an absolute no brainer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a consensus on moving in this direction from colleagues 
in the NDP.  I heard it from the hon. member of the Bloc.  I 
heard it from members of my own party.  Without too much hard 
work we might even get the PCs on side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the government to think about the opportunity 
they are missing.  We have had enough of their rhetoric about the 
best interests of children and a children's agenda.  Let us see 
them demonstrate it in something as straightforward as this piece 
of legislation which would give a child a mother and a father to 
love them in a family environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that light I would like to seek unanimous consent of the 
House to refer the subject matter of the bill to the HRDC 
subcommittee on children and youth at risk.  There could not be a 
more appropriate place for this item to be discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for

be referred to a standing committee.  Does the hon. member have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in April of this year I raised a question in the House 
of the Minister of Foreign Affairs concerning the impact of 
economic sanctions on the people of Iraq.  I asked the minister 
to finally speak up for the security of the people of Iraq where 
over 500,000 children have died since 1990 as a result of 
inhumane UN sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time after that question the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade issued a strong, powerful and 
unanimous report on the issue of sanctions in Iraq.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report the standing committee, which again I emphasize is 
made up of members from all parties, strongly and unanimously urged 
the government to address on an urgent basis the ongoing 
humanitarian tragedy in Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It noted as well that notwithstanding the adoption of security 
council resolution 1284, the committee urgently pursue the 
delinking of economic from military sanctions with a view to 
rapidly lifting economic sanctions in order to significantly 
improve the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people while 
maintaining those aspects of the multilateral embargo necessary 
to satisfy security requirements and contribute to the overall 
goal of regional disarmament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the committee called for the establishment of a Canadian 
diplomatic presence in Iraq and the continuing pursuit of the 
broader issue of the reform of the use of sanctions in order to 
allow a clearer targeting of military forces and regimes instead 
of civilian populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now been some 10 years since the imposition of sanctions 
in Iraq in August 1990.  They have had a devastating impact on 
the people of Iraq.  The foreign affairs committee noted that a 
United Nations panel established by the president of the security 
council said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country has experienced a shift from relative affluence to 
massive poverty. Infant mortality rates in Iraq today are among 
the highest in the world. Chronic malnutrition affects every 
fourth child.  Only 41% of the population have regular access to 
clean water.  The gravity of the humanitarian situation of the 
Iraqi people is indisputable and cannot be overstated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to appeal again today to the government to finally 
respond positively to this plea from the foreign affairs 
committee, this unanimous call from the committee that includes 
members of the Liberal Party, such as the hon. member for 
Brampton West—Mississauga who has been particularly eloquent in 
speaking out on this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Ten years of cruel sanctions is enough”. This is what a group 
of Quebec NGOs that includes Églises du Québec, Artistes pour la 
paix, the Association québécoise de coopération internationale 
and many other well respected groups have said. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to appeal today once again to the parliamentary secretary 
to rise in his place and tell Canadians why we are prepared to 
co-operate in this genocidal policy, a policy described as 
genocidal by none other than the former humanitarian co-ordinator 
for the United Nations in Iraq, Denis Halliday, who indeed will 
be speaking in Vancouver this Saturday night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The genocide must end.  The death of children must end. The 
barbaric bombing killing innocent civilians must end.  We must 
seek regional disarmament.  We must certainly seek democracy and 
human rights.  This is not support for Saddam Hussein, but there 
are many other dictatorial governments in that regime.  I want to 
appeal to the government to adopt this report, end the sanctions 
in Iraq and do it now.  Too many innocent human lives have been 
taken as a result of these sanctions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
congratulate all the members of the foreign affairs committee 
for their outstanding work, including on the Iraq file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada worked diligently throughout 1999 to re-engage the UN 
security council on Iraq in order to bring about humanitarian 
improvements and the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, it was a Canadian idea to create three panels 
in January 1999 to examine the humanitarian, disarmament and 
Kuwaiti POW issues to review the status of these issues. The 
panel reports were instrumental in the development of a UN 
security council resolution to address the thorny Iraq problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 17th, 1999, the UN security council passed the 
omnibus resolution on Iraq. The resolution calls for the 
re-establishment of a disarmament agency, the UN Monitoring, 
Verification and Inspections Commission (UNMOVIC) to replace the 
Special Commission (UNSCOM) which left Iraq at the start of the 
bombing campaign in December 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution also invokes changes in the scope and delivery of 
humanitarian goods allowable under the current sanctions regime 
and sets clear disarmament conditions for the suspension of 
sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of the resolution began the clock ticking on a number of 
key humanitarian provisions which can be implemented without 
requiring reciprocal Iraqi concessions.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions include the lifting of the ceiling on oil 
exports, the addition of a cash component to humanitarian 
contracts to help with local implementation, and a streamlined 
approval process for humanitarian goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The humanitarian provisions of Resolution 1284 provide practical 
measures aimed at addressing the situation facing the people of 
Iraq. The resolution also provides a road map for the suspension 
and lift of sanctions as well as for increased investment in the 
Iraqi oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a step in the right direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am on my feet tonight on a question on EI changes 
which I asked the minister before the House rose for the summer. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, our party has led the cause and the 
fight on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the government changed the EI eligibility rules in the 
western part of New Brunswick and other parts of Canada. The 
government changed the rules where people would have to work 595 
hours instead of 420 hours.  In other words they would have to 
work an extra month to qualify for benefits.  Many people would 
not qualify for benefits because in my part of the country there 
has been a downturn in the fisheries, in tourism and even in 
agriculture this year. If they did qualify, they would have 
received benefits for 18 weeks and not 28 weeks, which would mean 
that come winter, most people would have no benefits at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus fought it and about a week ago the minister admitted 
that the government had made a mistake and changed it back to the 
old rules.  The only reason the government did that was that we 
fought it right here on the floor of the House of Commons.  The 
government took a position it could not sustain.  It could not 
live with the decision it made to go to a new set of rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight is not over.  The government wants to gradually 
implement changes within a four year period and go back to the 
draconian changes which we were successful in overturning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of things could happen between now and that time.  One 
would hopefully be a change in government.  If that does not 
happen, there is no question we are going to have a change in the 
ministry.  The minister proved on the floor of the House of 
Commons that she does not understand the rest of Canada.  Let us 
assume she does understand industrialized Ontario but she 
certainly does not understand Atlantic Canada and resource based 
economies and seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was punishing seasonal workers. Where were the 
members of the reform party, the Canadian Alliance Party, on 
this?  They could not be heard.  They never showed up in southern 
New Brunswick or in any other part of the country to defend 
seasonal workers, the poorest of all workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fought this with reason and well argued positions.  I called 
a public meeting in my riding. We were successful in bringing all 
the politicians, regardless of political stripe, into the same 
room. All the provincial MLAs who represented the people in my 
riding of New Brunswick Southwest came.  We brought employers and 
employees into that public meeting.  All of us were in the same 
room with officials from the department. Believe it or not, the 
minister herself did not show, but the message was clear that 
neither she nor her department understands seasonal workers and 
the importance of a seasonal workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to publicly thank everyone who came out to help me on 
that issue.  I want to thank the MLAs, the mayors, the 
councillors, the employers and the employees.  It shows what 
people can do when they all sing from the same song book. It 
shows what governments are forced to do when they make a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to raise these types of issues and 
debates here on the floor of the House of Commons where they 
should be raised.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the new EI 
economic regions reflect the growth in our economy, and an 
improved labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we can understand that seasonal workers in certain 
communities are worried about these new boundaries and we are 
sensitive to their concerns.  That is why we have been flexible 
before taking action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 13, the government announced measures to gradually 
phase in changes to the boundaries in the Lower St. Lawrence 
region of Quebec and in northwestern New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reactions to these changes have been favourable.  Normand 
Carrier, the spokesman for the Comité d'étude sur le travail 
saisonnier au Madawaska, had this to say in the September 15 
edition of <I>L'Acadie Nouvelle</I>: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the federal government's announcement was what was expected. 
Another good thing is that the federal government has let us know 
what its policy will be on this issue for the next three years. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the challenges facing seasonal workers call for more than EI 
benefits.  Governments, employers, communities, unions and 
individuals will have to join forces in order to improve work 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are working at the local level and with our 
provincial and territorial counterparts to develop lasting 
solutions.  A number of directions are open to us, the first 
being improved access to training for seasonal workers; the 
second being—and I urge the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest to encourage his constituents to discuss this—greater 
economic diversity in the region; and the third being to develop 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work together in order to come up with effective, 
long-term solutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.42 p.m.)
