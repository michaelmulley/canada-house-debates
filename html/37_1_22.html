</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-285, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (no parole when imprisoned for life). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to reintroduce 
this private member's bill.  It amends certain provisions of the 
criminal code relating to life imprisonment.  It will eliminate 
any provision for early parole, early release or parole 
eligibility for a criminal who is sentenced to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about justice for the families of victims, for those 
who have suffered an irreplaceable loss at the hands of killers. 
For them, knowing that the offender will never walk the streets 
again as a free person will bring a sense of relief and an 
element of closure to a sad chapter in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill sends a clear message to murderers that if they take the 
life of another, they will be locked away for the remainder of 
their natural lives.  Life will mean just that, life.

They are also fed up with seeing so much money go out of their

that Bill C-11, an act respecting immigration to Canada and the 
granting of refugee protection to persons who are displaced, 
persecuted or in danger, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Lynne Yelich (Blackstrap, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour to stand before you in the first sitting 
of the 37th parliament.  I take this opportunity to congratulate 
you on the esteemed position to which you have been elected by 
your peers and colleagues here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I respectfully acknowledge my late parents, John 
and Olga Zdunich, and my husband's parents, George and Katherine 
Yelich.  I also acknowledge my husband Matt and our daughters 
Elaina and Ivana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all whose support and encouragement has brought me here 
today:  my campaign team, the hardworking volunteers, my friends 
and family members, and especially the people of Blackstrap for 
the vote of confidence that they have given me. It is an honour 
and a privilege to represent them in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding I represent is called Blackstrap.  The name itself 
has been a constant conversation piece and a point of interest. 
People continually ask me where the name Blackstrap came from. 
Local legend is that during the years of prohibition a rum runner 
was not aware that one of his kegs had sprung a leak and he 
travelled the valley leaving a trail of blackstrap molasses 
behind him.  The legend is so popular that some people actually 
believe it. The real story behind the name is not quite so 
colourful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until filled with Diefenbaker lake water in 1967, making it into 
a reservoir, Blackstrap Lake was a long, narrow slough filled 
with black reeds.  From atop its steep banks it resembled nothing 
so much as a long black strap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the area of Blackstrap is a 540 hectare provincial park 
with a manmade lake at the centre.  The provincial park is a 
resort area that provides year round activities.  In the winter 
the manmade mountain is the centre of a winter activity sports 
park.  In the summer it provides a place for swimming, camping 
and fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Geographically situated near the centre of the province of 
Saskatchewan, the riding of Blackstrap is bordered on the west by 
the South Saskatchewan River and on the north by the Yellowhead 
highway.  It encompasses over 11,000 square miles, is home to 
approximately 72,000 people and is a riding unique in its broad 
diversity.  This is the riding I call home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My roots in this riding are almost as old as the province of 
Saskatchewan.  My grandparents immigrated to Canada from the tiny 
village of Lovinac in Croatia as part of the massive land 
settlement program of the early 1900s when Sir Clifford Sifton, 
then minister of the interior, offered land to new immigrants for 
settling the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their move to Canada took a huge leap of faith.  They left all 
that was familiar because they believed a better life could be 
found in Canada for themselves and the generations to come.  I 
will always be grateful for the courage they showed and what it 
has meant to me to be raised a Canadian.  Living and working in 
this riding, which was developed almost solely on immigration, I 
know how important it is that we aim to improve our system, which 
I will speak to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has changed since the turn of the century when a bright new 
future could be found with the turning of soil on 160 acres of 
raw prairie land.  At one time the riding of Blackstrap was 
almost totally dependent upon agriculture.  However, as we embark 
on a new century, the face of the prairie economy has changed 
drastically, perhaps no more so than in the area I call home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the riding are examples of how the people of 
Blackstrap have shown their resourcefulness in the face of 
crisis.  There is no other word to describe what has happened to 
the agricultural industry in the past two decades.  One such 
example is the Pound-Maker feedlot in Lanigan, where it decided 
to integrate its existing feedlot into an ethanol plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada as a whole, approximately 55 million litres of ethanol 
are produced each year; 17 million are used in fuel and the rest 
go to industrial uses such as toiletries, cosmetics and 
medications for external use.  The Pound-Maker facility has the 
capacity to produce 13 million litres each year, or one-quarter 
of Canada's total, in addition to being a 28,500 head cattle 
feedlot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few miles away, Drake Meat Processors is a huge 
successful meat processing plant where over 50 people are 
employed in what was at one time a co-operative locker plant. 
They have now developed product lines sold exclusively in 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the riding the pork industry is aggressively expanding 
with the continual construction of new facilities producing 
thousands of pork each year for the Canadian marketplace.  Much 
of this started with innovations by three individual pork 
producers who decided to combine their energies and embark on a 
new direction.  Their start-up barn in Outlook has grown to 
include 17 community based pork operations with a current 
capacity of 500,000 pigs a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers surrounding Lake Diefenbaker have dedicated thousands of 
acres to irrigated potato production.  In Outlook a mint-herb 
processing plant is currently under construction.  The 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool in Watrous has initiated a crop 
development farm where new breeds of canola are bred and tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In almost every community, market gardens have become 
commonplace as the people fight to keep their rural communities 
alive in spite of negative farm incomes.  To their credit, 
hundreds of people in this riding have risen above the challenge 
of the agricultural crisis and successfully built a diverse 
economic base.  I applaud them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the agricultural industry is an important part of what 
makes up Blackstrap, historically and in today's economy, but it 
is not the only industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The magnitude of the different industries that survive and 
thrive are what make this area an anomaly in the prairie economy. 
We are home to five potash mines, the IMC Kalium Mine and the 
Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Mines, PCS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PCS in itself is an interesting study in the opportunities that 
arise through diversification.  At one time, PCS was a money 
losing crown corporation that cost the taxpayers of the province 
hundreds of millions of dollars.  It was privatized in the late 
1980s and sold to employees and other investors.  Today, PCS is 
the world's leading producer of potash and has 20 plants in North 
America, Chile, Trinidad and another underway in Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have six automotive retail businesses in the riding.  When 
the auto mall currently being constructed on the south side of 
Saskatoon is completed, our riding will be home to the largest 
automobile sales group in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the use of community development bonds, the people of 
Manitou Beach and area invested in their own community.  The area 
brought the Manitou mineral spa back to its glory days, not seen 
since the early twenties and thirties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on its natural therapeutic qualities unique to North 
America and found only in two other places in the world, Karlovy 
Vary in the Czech Republic and the Dead Sea of Israel, the 
committee initiated what has grown into a multimillion dollar 
facility.  Today at Manitou Beach there is a convention centre, 
mineral spa and entire resort village that is a tourist 
destination for visitors from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blackstrap is home to a national defence base in Dundurn which 
has the largest ammunition depot in the country.  The Whitecap 
Dakota/Sioux First Nation dates back to the eighteenth century 
and inhabits the northwest corner of the riding.  I should 
mention that it was the Dakota/Sioux Indians who immigrated to 
Blackstrap from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada as a whole, we are all too aware of the problems our 
aboriginal communities are dealing with, yet this particular 
reserve is a powerful example of innovation, prosperity and 
economic stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are forward thinking, inventive, innovative and courageous 
Canadians.  I believe these qualities came with the early 
settlers to this part of the country and live on in our 
generation.  These are the people of Blackstrap.  The people gave 
me a mandate to come to Ottawa and represent their interests. 
They have a message that I brought here with me today.  I would 
be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to articulate to all 
my colleagues in the House of Commons, in all the political 
parties, what the people of Blackstrap riding have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of attention recently focused on what has 
been coined western alienation and talk of separation by the 
west.  It would be easy to get sidetracked.  However, I know how 
important Confederation is to the people of my riding.  I know 
how passionately they love the country.  In fact, my esteemed 
colleagues, I believe the focus on separation is backward.  What 
I hear in my riding is not so much that people want out, they 
want in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people I represent want the message brought here to Ottawa 
that their voices are a part of Canada.  When there is talk about 
equality, there is an intrinsic emphasis put on rights, which is 
not necessarily the message that needs to be heard.  As 
westerners, we believe in balance and the responsibilities that 
come with being a balanced partner in Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Blackstrap want it known that while they willingly 
and lawfully hand over their hard earned tax dollars, they are 
frustrated by continual reminders that the federal government 
does not manage the country's economic situation with the same 
diligence it manages its personal finances.  They want balance 
brought back to the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Blackstrap are frustrated by a legal system that 
has taken the place of what should be a justice system.  They 
want balance in the laws that govern us as citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Blackstrap are frustrated by regional differences 
that are treated as divisions by the federal government instead 
of opportunities for co-operation.  They want to see a balance in 
the regional interests within a federal system that provides the 
opportunity to work together to overcome those challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my grandparents immigrated to Canada, they knew nothing of 
eastern, or western or central Canada.  French speaking and 
English speaking Canada was not an issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They came to Canada because they believed in Canada and what it 
represented, hope for a new future, opportunity, room to grow and 
contribute.  Thousands of people just like them took what Canada 
had to offer and built a country that has a distinctive label of 
being the greatest country on this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personally sponsored refugees and worked with many 
immigrant families.  The Canada they see is the same Canada that 
beckoned my ancestors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope and pray that those of us in the House will never lose 
sight of that vision of the gift it is to be a Canadian and that 
they will work co-operatively to build on the initial framework 
that our country's forefathers put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak to Bill C-11, the citizenship and immigration bill, 
we will address how to improve our existing system.  We will work 
on answers to my constituents' questions, such as why does it 
take so long for people with skills to immigrate to Canada?  How 
can we clear these backlogs?  I have spoken to dozens of people 
with stories of how long it took to get their spouses to Canada. 
Why is the department cutting staff?  How can we stop illegal 
human smuggling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents in Blackstrap certainly appreciate the value of 
immigration, as does my party, as a positive and dynamic force, 
one that is vital to the economic and cultural growth and 
diversity of our country.  We must continue Canada's longstanding 
humanitarian tradition of resettling genuine refugees.  Canadians 
have concerns about our present immigration system.  We need to 
restore public confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying that holds particular significance for me and 
my family.  It sums up what I feel is the essence of what 
immigration should and can be.  The saying is coined as follows: 
“Croatia gave the strength, Canada the opportunity“.  That 
statement reflects the importance immigration has had for my 
constituents.  I will endeavour to work very hard on their 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the privilege of addressing the 
House today.  I look forward to the years ahead as we work 
together for the people who have put their trust and faith in us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Blackstrap on her 
maiden speech.  There is no doubt that she brought a very clear 
and concise message from her constituents in Blackstrap.  We now 
know in the House and across the country how Blackstrap received 
its name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was moved to hear that her roots originated in Croatia.  There 
is no doubt that Croatians, like other immigrants who came to 
this country, believed in it.  They came here at the turn of the 
century and have made a valuable contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Blackstrap comes from Saskatchewan and I am from 
Manitoba.  These two provinces have tended to lose their 
population base.  This fact is common knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the member for Blackstrap is, how can 
increasing immigration to Saskatchewan help the province in its 
future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Lynne Yelich:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would help a great 
deal.  Immigrants who have come in have been a valuable asset. We 
have well educated people coming in as refugees.  They are 
genuine refugees who were in Croatia during the war in Bosnia. 
They have contributed so much.  We need to increase the number of 
immigrants because they come with such strong values and 
principles and are a real asset to our province.

Speaker, I too want to congratulate my colleague for Blackstrap. 
We had a representative from Blackstrap in years gone by and I 
never found out just exactly how Blackstrap got its name.  I 
thank her for the illumination on exactly what Blackstrap is all 
about and how it got its name.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that the constituents of Blackstrap chose 
the hon. member to represent them.  Not only does she look good 
in this place but she actually has a very strong voice.  I was 
particularly taken by the comparison she made between Croatia, 
her ancestral home from way back, and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she said something to the effect that Croatia gave them 
the strength and Canada gave them the opportunity.  That is an 
absolutely fantastic statement.  I wish she could explore it a 
little further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a multicultural nation made up of people from all 
kinds of countries of the world.  Could it really be that Canada 
has become as strong as it is and has become the peacemaker it is 
because of these various nations?   The nations gave the 
individual strength and Canada gave them the opportunity to 
demonstrate to the world what multiculturalism can mean to Canada 
and the rest of the world.  Would the hon. member like to comment 
on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Lynne Yelich:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say 
where that originated from.  Some people immigrated here from 
Croatia with my in-laws at the turn of the century.  They worked 
very hard.  Living in Saskatchewan at the turn of the century was 
pretty tough.  It was very lonely and very cold.  However they 
endured.  They had a very large family.  They had 12 kids.  They 
will be very proud that I have mentioned this in the House.  All 
those children have become very successful and many live abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When their parents passed away that was their tribute to them. 
Their parents never really had a lot of material things but they 
appreciated Canada, how good Canada was to them, and the 
opportunity Canada gave to them because they had nothing in the 
old country but rock.  They came here for opportunity and Canada 
gave it to them.  As I mentioned in my speech, there were no 
special interests, not because of their colour, race or 
background.  They were given an opportunity because they had the 
will and a good work ethic. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House to speak to Bill C-11 for the NDP. 
First, I thank my colleagues who spoke earlier, our current 
critic of immigration and refugee policies, the member for 
Winnipeg North Centre, and the member for Winnipeg Centre. Both 
members did an outstanding job in presenting the concerns and 
position in the NDP about not only the former Bill C-31 but the 
current piece of legislation before the House.  They have done a 
very good job in working with local and national organizations to 
understand what some of the fundamental concerns about the 
proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from Vancouver East I have to begin by saying that I 
represent a riding, like other members of the House, which is 
symbolic and reflective of the cultural and ethnic diversity of 
Canada.  Vancouver East is a community that has been built on 
immigration, something of which we are very proud.  It has been a 
community that has welcomed working people from around the globe, 
people who have sought to come to Canada to provide a better 
opportunity, to look for a better quality of life and to provide 
a good future for their kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day in my riding of Vancouver East, whether it is in 
Strathcona, Mount Pleasant, the downtown east side, 
Grandview-Woodlands or Hastings-Sunrise, I meet families who are 
first generation, sometimes second or third generation, who have 
established their new roots and homes in this community.  I am 
very proud to represent a riding where that kind of diversity is 
actually valued.  It is an enrichment of our community that 
people of many different backgrounds, languages and classes have 
come to Vancouver East to make it their home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are probably few countries in the world where immigration 
and refugee policy is as significant and as fundamental as it is 
in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am an immigrant myself.  Like other members of the House, we 
came to Canada because we knew it was a very great land. We came 
because our parents brought us as children and we established 
ourselves here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies and legislation enacted by the government and 
debated in the House go to the core of what we believe as 
Canadians.  One of the concerns that we have expressed in the NDP 
is that the legislation the minister has now reintroduced is a 
reflection of the public mood that has become more negative about 
immigration and refugee policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight one issue in particular because it is 
something that is very pertinent to Vancouver and to East 
Vancouver.  More than a year and a half ago we saw the arrival of 
what has been commonly referred to as the boat people, economic 
migrants who are becoming involved in human smuggling out of 
desperation.  They put themselves at grave risk and danger. They 
travel huge distances in very dangerous conditions, seeking a way 
to escape the environment they are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience we had on Canada's west coast has been reported 
widely in the media: the arrival of about 600 so-called boat 
people from the Fujian province of the People's Republic of 
China.  It was very interesting to see the reaction in the media 
and the general public mood around the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are concerns about human smuggling.  We have to prevent 
these kinds of situations from taking place.  In working with 
local organizations I visited some women who were detained in the 
Burnaby women's correctional facility.  At that time about 33 
women were detained in jail.  They had not committed a crime. 
They had not been charged with anything.  They were incarcerated 
because they were considered to be at risk for flight if they 
were released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In visiting those women in jail I was very taken by the 
situation they were in.  They had inadequate access to legal 
representation, to appropriate cultural language interpretation, 
to phone calls and to any connection or visits with their 
children who had been taken away and placed in care.  It may 
surprise some people to know that more than 18 months later there 
are still about 25 individuals incarcerated in British Columbia 
as a result of arriving on Canada's shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for us to look back historically at events that 
happened 40 or 50 years ago when people arrived and were not 
allowed entry.  We can look back and say it was racist or 
xenophobic, that we had a fear of others arriving, but when it 
happens in contemporary society today it is something that is 
very worth debating in terms of how we react to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns of my colleagues in the NDP and I is that we 
feel much of the response from the government is based on a very 
strong reaction to the arrival of the boat people.  I find it 
unacceptable that 18 months after they arrived individuals are 
still incarcerated and trying legitimately and legally to file 
their applications for refugee status.  We have a concern that 
this is an underlying pinning of the bill.  It is a bill that 
seems to be based more on keeping people out rather than 
acknowledging the incredible role immigration has played in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very concerned over the last few years that the 
government's own targets for levels of immigration are not being 
met.  It is very easy to play to fears in the community.  It is 
easy to dramatize and highlight individual cases of refugees 
where there have been illegalities and where people needed to be 
deported rather than focus on the incredible positive 
contribution of not just new immigrants but of refugees to the 
country.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill does have some measures that provide for 
family reunification, the NDP believes there should be a much 
greater emphasis on family reunification and expanding the family 
class.  We should be saying that Canada welcomes people from 
around the world, and that we should not be so suspicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deal with hundreds of cases in my riding every year of 
families who are desperately seeking assistance in order to get 
through the system as it exists today.  I am sure we have all had 
cases where we really feel the frustration and the anxiety that 
people have gone through in trying to deal with the system. 
Officials have incredible discretion in denying people and in 
deciding whether a family member can come to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a campaign in my riding called once in a lifetime.  It 
was actually an idea that the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration floated around about a year or so ago.  She suggested 
that there might be a special provision, a once in a lifetime 
provision, whereby any Canadian would be able to sponsor someone 
who would not normally qualify in a family class.  Unfortunately 
the idea was just dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local organizations in my riding, such as Success, collected 
more than 15,000 signatures in support of the idea of once in a 
lifetime.  Then it was dropped like a hot potato by the 
minister.   However, I decided to keep the idea going.  We 
actually had a petition and a campaign on once in a lifetime, 
which received tremendous support.  The reason we received 
support is that the current definitions are so narrow and 
restrictive that it becomes very difficult to undertake family 
reunification under the present policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the other concerns we have, which have not been 
addressed in the bill and which we will be following up on when 
it reaches committee stage, are the problems around the live in 
caregiver program.  I have had cases in my own community where 
women who have come into Canada through the live in caregiver 
program have basically been exploited.  They have had their 
rights violated and have been placed in very vulnerable and 
precarious positions because of this special provision by which 
they gained entry to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the current legislation fails to address the 
gender issues that are involved in the live in care program.  It 
bears a thorough examination to ensure that women who are coming 
here under the live in caregiver program are not being exploited 
by the system or by the situations in which they find themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also expressed concerns about some of the provisions in 
the bill that, albeit an improvement over the status quo, 
need to go much further.  I have met with organizations in my 
riding that have done a lot of work and analysis on the 
provisions for same sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the minister and the government are finally recognizing, 
along with other changes in legislation that have come before the 
House, that we need to treat same sex relationships with the same 
kind of legal provision and equality that we treat any other 
conjugal relationship, unfortunately in the current bill these 
provisions are contained in the regulations and not the bill 
itself.  I have had this expressed to me as a concern in terms of 
it leaving the community still vulnerable to any future changes 
in regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other matter I want to speak to involves refugees.  It was 
very timely that yesterday the Caledon Institute and the Maytree 
Foundation, under the sponsorship of a human rights committee of 
the Senate, brought a very notable and prestigious speaker, 
Professor Goodwin-Gill from Oxford University, to Parliament 
Hill.  He came to speak to a number of people who were assembled 
yesterday about Canada's practice of violating a UN convention as 
it relates to the status of refugees in this country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045
<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Goodwin-Gill, an internationally renowned expert on 
refugee law, has taught at Carleton University, so he is very 
familiar with Canada's legislation and how we process and treat 
convention refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He expressed grave concern about the practices that have taken 
place in Canada which deny people access to travel or deny them 
other resources and programs within Canadian society based on 
their refugee status.  He zeroed in on the fact that Canada does 
not meet its international obligations under the UN convention, 
in particular articles 25, 27 and 28 having to do with refugee ID 
documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel this is a very serious situation.  For those members of 
the House and of the Senate who were present yesterday at the 
speech by Professor Goodwin-Gill, I hope very much that what he 
said to us will be reflected in our debate and will be reflected in 
the amendments once the bill reaches committee and there is an 
opportunity to receive amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To dramatize the real experience of convention refugees in 
Canada, present at the meeting yesterday was a young woman who is 
a convention refugee.  I believe she was originally from northern 
Somalia.  She is the mother of four children.  She described to 
us with a great deal of candour and honesty the feeling that she 
had of being in prison because she could not access the things 
she needed to provide for her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She cannot put her teenage children through post-secondary 
education because she cannot afford to pay for it.  She works but 
earns a low income, so neither she nor her children are able to 
access the Canada student loans program.  She is established as a 
convention refugee, but because of the way we treat convention 
refugees she and her kids cannot access post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are illustrations and examples of what it means to live 
with the kinds of policies and procedures we have had in place. 
Having the bill before the House is an opportunity to redress 
some of those situations and to look at the real experience of 
what happens to refugees in the country and to say that we will 
not put up more barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the real tragedy of the situation is that there is abuse 
in the system, as we heard yesterday.  There is abuse in every 
system in the country, but in this area the abuse becomes the 
reason for setting up very punitive barriers and rules that then 
deny the vast majority of convention refugees full status in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the wrong way to do business and to approach the issue. 
We should recognize that the vast majority of convention refugees 
are here as positive contributors to the local communities in 
terms of work, in terms of enrichment, in terms of volunteerism, 
and in terms of all the things we would characterize as being a 
part of society.  To place barriers before people and make it 
more difficult for them to become fully participating members of 
the community seems a very negative attitude and something that 
definitely should be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP have very strong concerns about the bill.  We want 
to be constructive in the way we approach the bill.  It is a very 
significant piece of legislation.  It was long overdue for 
changes, but those changes and how they impact on Canadian 
residents who are here now in terms of bringing over family 
members from another country, or on people who wish to immigrate 
to Canada, are obviously of great significance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take the time to be thoughtful about the bill.  We 
should make sure it is not just a response to what is being 
fuelled in the media in a very negative way in terms of 
characterizing refugee claimants and to some extent immigration 
generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House we should have the courage to stand and 
say that we want Canada to be a place that welcomes people.  We 
want the system to work fairly.  We want to be able to find ways 
to provide family reunification.  More than that, we want to look 
at some of the historical wrongs that have been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the flashpoints of our history in immigration has been 
the head tax.  There has been an ongoing campaign.  People in my 
riding of Vancouver East have been very involved in trying to 
eliminate the head tax.  They also want recognition of the 
historical wrong that was done and to seek redress for it in 
terms of community contribution and compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we can do that I have grave concerns about what the new 
bill will be and whether we will be repeating the kinds of 
policies we have had in the past.  Our history is based on racism 
and fear of others.  Somehow we must change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very important.  We have very serious concerns about 
it.  We want the bill to be a positive instrument that will 
support and strengthen Canada's immigration policies in a way 
that is fair and equitable and does not further stigmatize or set 
up barriers against refugee claimants.  We want it to send a 
message that Canada is a welcoming place that truly works for 
diversity and cross cultural understanding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if you will 
permit, I would like to make a few remarks in order to correct 
the comments my NDP colleague has just made on the immigration 
and refugee status bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, it is true, has a long tradition of immigration, which 
built our country, which also built the riding I represent in 
the House, Laval West, where a large proportion of the people 
came to Canada as immigrants and then brought their families here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has for generations recognized the 
importance of family reunification here in Canada. This bill the 
government has introduced in the House continues this tradition. 
We have inherited a responsibility toward those who have come 
here to help them to reunite their family, to build a family 
unit here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that children 22 years of age will now be 
permitted to be included in the family and therefore to be 
reunited with their parents here in Canada.  It also provides 
that persons who are the last members of this family and remain 
in their country of origin may come to Canada as well.  This 
often means that an older mother or father living elsewhere, 
alone in an apartment, in a house or in a village, may now join 
the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make this correction, because we are maintaining a 
very strong Canadian tradition, which is to continue, in a 
humanitarian and family spirit, to rebuild families here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to make another correction about the hon. 
member's comment to the effect that Canada has not been meeting 
its own immigration levels. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was indeed the case for several years. However, this year, 
much to the satisfaction of everyone, the government has met its 
immigration levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our new approach to immigration, which includes the new 
bill before the House and the regulations that will follow, we 
are now opening the door wider, so that an increasing number of 
immigrants can come to Canada and settle here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to point out that this bill perpetuates a great 
Canadian tradition, which is to maintain a society governed by 
the rule of law. 
For this reason, those who want to come here as either refugees 
or immigrants must meet certain criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, our role is to open the door to those who want 
to settle here, but also to protect Canadian citizens, including 
against certain immigrants who break the law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly welcome the 
comments of the hon. member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that some provisions of the legislation before us, 
Bill C-11, are an improvement over the existing legislation.  The 
provision that allows for family reunification for children based 
on a wider age limit is certainly an improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I was making and the concern we have in the NDP is one 
that has been expressed to me by many organizations that deal 
with immigration rules and policies on a day to day basis. 
People in such organizations really see the system as it is. 
They are concerned that the overall definition of family class is 
still very restrictive in terms of the kinds of family members 
who can be sponsored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of once in a lifetime was generated because we 
had restrictions on how we define family class.  There was and 
still is a great momentum within the community to see a broader 
definition that would allow for family reunification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say that we must have some definition, that we must be able 
to define the family in some way.  That is very true.  However, 
in western society we tend to make such definitions very narrow 
and very linear, whereas in many cultures where immigrants come 
from the definition of family is much broader.  We really need to 
look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will respond to the other point very briefly in terms of the 
quotas.  It is true, because I saw the announcement and the press 
release and so on, that this year, for the first time in many 
years, Canada met its target in terms of applications that came 
to Canada.  If one looks at it in a longer term, overall we have 
done a very poor job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope there is a real commitment from the government to not 
only meet the targets but to look at the targets.  If we read any 
study about immigration we will see that it contributes to our 
economic activity, to our economic strength and to the strength 
of the community.  When we say that we should open the doors 
wider, I hope the member would agree that we should look at the 
target and say that it should be increased.  However, if we look 
at it over a number of years we have not been meeting the target, even 
though we might have last year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Vancouver East for her 
comments and her warnings to Canadians in terms of how the media 
reports issues dealing with immigrants and refugees. 
I agree with her wholeheartedly, because one thing we do not want 
to do in this country is reignite any kind of anti-immigrant 
fervour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member began her speech by saying that there are possibly 25 
Chinese boat people—I guess that is the term we use—still being 
detained.  The fact of the matter is, as indicated in the debate 
yesterday on this bill, that only about 600 out of a total 
population of about 24,000 immigrate to Canada.  There is no 
doubt that the media does not send out the facts to the Canadian 
public so that Canadians could understand how many people we are 
talking about.  Also sometimes there tends to be a loss of 
balanced reporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the hon. member for Vancouver East what solutions we 
should put in place to help the media so they become more 
informed as to how they report these instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very important that 
we as members monitor what happens in the media.  I would agree 
with what the member has outlined in terms of particular 
situations such as the arrival of the boat people.  The amount of 
media scrutiny and sensationalism it received was quite 
incredible to behold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we as members comment on these issues we have to be very 
aware of that and take the time to look beyond the headlines and 
make sure we are communicating the real situation.  Some of these 
people are in very desperate circumstances and get set up as 
targets.  They get set up as scapegoats.  This is an example of 
the idea some have that, the whole system is failing and 
we have to get tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member, along with other members of the House, 
will consider this the next time we have a flashpoint and a 
situation we are asked to comment on.  I hope we will be 
thoughtful in our responses and not contribute to a backlash 
which can easily take place when the media gets hold of the 
situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government is bringing 
Bill C-11 before us for debate.  Its title states that it is “an 
act respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in 
danger”.  This bill would replace the existing immigration act. 
The minister claims that the bill would provide clearer 
legislation to ensure that Canada's immigration and refugee 
protection system is able to respond to international challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's handling of immigration has not developed a lot 
of confidence in our country.  If we listen to talk in the local 
coffee shop or on open line radio, the national mood is clear: 
the government does not have a great administrative reputation. 
It seems the Liberals cannot administer a system that has the 
confidence of average Canadians, especially when we think of 
fairness, adequate protections or a system that is well run. 
Nevertheless, I am pleased that the government seems to be trying 
to improve things with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims some rather lofty things in regard to the 
bill.  The minister says that the bill provides for objectives 
that reflect the values of Canadian society.  That is a big one 
to swallow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next claim is that there will be effective reporting to 
parliament through a complete consolidated annual report.  There 
will also be agreements that facilitate co-operation with the 
provinces and foreign states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill outlines a description of the major classes of foreign 
nationals:  economic class, family class, convention refugees and 
persons in similar circumstances.  There is a recognition of 
Canada's commitment to the principle of the best interests of the 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an attempt at a clear, objective residency requirement 
for permanent residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the objective of a strong refugee protection program 
that incorporates the protection grounds of the Geneva 
convention, the convention against torture and the grounds of 
risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is talk of a more efficient refugee determination process 
through greater use of single member panels.  Additionally, a 
refugee appeal division within the immigration and refugee board 
is described, to enhance fairness and consistency in decision 
making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are supposed to be tightened ineligibility provisions for 
serious criminals, security threats and repeat claimants who seek 
access to the refugee protection process of the immigration and 
refugee board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a formalization of a pre-removal risk assessment to 
review changed circumstances related to risk of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also outlines inadmissibility provisions for criminals, 
persons who constitute security threats, violators of human 
rights, and persons who should not be allowed into Canada because 
of fraud, misrepresentation, financial reasons or health 
concerns.  The bill attempts a clear detention criterion with 
authority to further clarify detention grounds in regulations. 
There are also enhanced procedures for dealing with security 
threats through admissibility hearings and the security 
certificate process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are offences for human smuggling and trafficking, with a 
maximum penalty of life in prison.  There are penalties for 
assisting in obtaining immigration status by fraud or 
misrepresentation.  There is also an immigration appeal system 
that is supposed to enhance effectiveness while maintaining 
fairness and legal safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all big claims.  Unfortunately, the House has heard 
those things before from the government and in past parliaments. 
However, here we are again, trying to improve the legislative 
base for a system that has a poor reputation across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we must try to do better as a nation.  We have some 
suggestions for how the bill can be improved, for we come at this 
problem from a principled base.  The Canadian Alliance affirms 
that it supports genuine refugees and immigration where it is a 
positive source for economic growth.  We in the Canadian Alliance 
see Canada as a land built by immigrants and we will continue to 
welcome new immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support sponsorship for immediate family members.  Our 
immigration policy takes into account Canada's economic needs. We 
have promised to introduce greater fairness and security into the 
system, including enforcement of sponsorship obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on record to work co-operatively with the provinces on 
the settlement of immigrants.  We also want to protect the 
integrity of the valuable contribution made to the fabric of 
Canada by millions of law abiding immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, greater attention must be paid to realistic, 
enforceable processes so the average immigrant's good reputation 
will not be jeopardized by non-citizens who engage in criminal 
activity.  We are committed to solving the legal and logistical 
problems to speedily deport offenders and perpetrators of fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We affirm Canada's humanitarian obligation to welcome genuine 
refugees and are proud that our country has offered a safe haven 
for distressed people from across the world.  However, to ensure 
fairness and end queue jumping, we have been saying for a long 
time that Canada must do better at deporting bogus refugees and 
other illegal entrants and there must be enhanced deterrent 
penalties for those who organize abuse of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also ensure that refugee status is arbitrated 
expeditiously, consistently and professionally.  That requires an 
improved legal base and sufficient resources.  We are committed 
to ending the abuse of refugee claims as a fast track to gaining 
the benefits of landed immigrant status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a system in which we can all have confidence.  That 
will only happen when there is a good legislative base for wise 
administration, one that is thoroughly professional rather than 
political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 claims to make these things more efficient, reduce 
lineups and provide more security, both for residents of Canada 
and for immigrants.  However, without a more accountable system 
and a far more communicative department, none of this will ever 
be a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there are no real measurable and accountable 
standards for the operation of our overseas offices.  The 
standard health tests need to be updated and the credibility of 
reports needs to be thoroughly background checked.  Visa officers 
need better training in order to be equipped to spot fraudulent 
applications and criminals and also themselves in regard to being 
beyond local corruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overwhelming fact of the department is the lack of staff to 
operate at a functional level.  Perhaps a full departmental audit 
is needed for classification structure, employee supervision and 
promotion and the appropriateness of overall staffing levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is supportive of current immigration 
levels, but we would like to see immigrants more fully in the 
careers they were trained to do in their countries of origin. 
Medical doctors should not be driving taxicabs to make a living 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see Canada attract the best and the brightest, 
not just those who show up at Canada's door.  Can we not change 
general operations from being reactive to becoming more 
proactive?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the expedient reunification of family members.  We 
support and reaffirm our policy of taking in our fair share of 
genuine refugees.  We would work with the provinces for policies 
on the settlement of immigrants, whereby settlement money should 
follow the person rather than government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports deportation of undesirable 
individuals without delay in the cases of criminal activity and 
non-compliance with the Immigration Act.  Bill C-11 purports to 
do this, but the recent supreme court decision complicates 
Canada's immigration defences.  There is no indication in this 
legislation to deal with the supreme court ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what the Liberal government tries to sell about the 
new legislation, the lofty goals are an impossibility without 
better enforcement, accountability and management.  Staffing 
levels needed to fulfil mandates seem completely inadequate.  As 
well, there are problems operationally.  We have seen a stream of 
people coming into our constituency office because of 
immigration.  The immigration hotline does not work, as it is 
overloaded.  My office has to communicate to our embassies around 
the world since the department is not doing its job on basic 
information requests.  Local immigration offices are not 
responsive and they are not giving the service needed in 
community relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An MP's office should be involved in only very special 
circumstances and should not be an extension of the immigration 
department.  I also suspect the department is heavy with Ottawa 
mandarins who do not spend sufficient time in the field 
throughout Canada or abroad to fully appreciate the operational 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We engaged this immigration debate to be constructive because 
Canadians have asked us to do so.  It must be noted that when we 
as a party began to seriously reflect the national mood in the 
House years ago, specifically about the incredulity and apparent 
ineptness of the government in managing the immigration system, 
we were attacked as being racist.  However, despite the lies 
about us, we persisted and now it is socially acceptable in the 
House to point out the administrative foul-ups by the department. 
Formerly it was a taboo subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems were so grave and monumental that we took the abuse 
and kept raising the issues we were being asked to raise.  Now it 
is acceptable to require the minister and the department to 
justify to Canadians their mandate and performance, without being 
called racist, at least by those who are honourable.  The auditor 
general certainly has been critical of the immigration 
department.  Consequently we have continued to bring the voice of 
the community to this Chamber.  The government has slowly 
recognized that legislative improvements are needed, and the 
voice of the community is at least recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless we must be very careful to assess the motives and 
the honour of anyone who would dare to say about the Alliance 
that there is any whiff or nuance of xenophobia in our party 
policy or from our members of parliament.  Sadly the pejorative 
term xenophobic hysteria was directly ascribed to us by a member 
of the NDP yesterday in the House.  That term means having a 
morbid dislike of foreigners.  It reminds me of the outrageous 
meanspiritedness of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
directed at my party during the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, beyond the finger pointing, we can observe, with our 
counterparts from the U.S., Australia, China and Europe, that 
there is indeed a real desire to move together toward solutions 
such as a United Nations agreement to fight against human 
smuggling.  We cannot allow those who traffic in human beings to 
succeed by misusing our refugee protection programs.  Under law, 
legitimate refugees, those at risk if returned, should be allowed 
to stay permanently albeit through due process.  Those who are 
not refugees should be removed quickly.  That was not the 
experience that the minister gave to British Columbia in the last 
few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that it is possible to uphold the charter of rights and 
freedoms, not just for some people some of the time but for 
everyone in Canada all of the time, and yet still be able to 
control our borders.  For sadly, in the international people 
trade we must admit that capacity creates its own demand. 
Consequently we need streamlined procedures that are fast but 
still fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration has been a positive force in the life of the country 
for centuries.  It has made us who we are and it will make us who 
we will be.  Canada has historical accomplishments with 
immigration, as we have and continue to be mostly a land of 
destination rather than a land of departure for the 
disadvantaged.  Yet in our society, as personal accomplishment is 
achieved Canada suffers a brain drain to the United States 
because of the mediocrity of governance under which we suffer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship and Immigration Canada's mission is to build a 
stronger Canada by deriving maximum social and economic benefit 
from the global movement of people, maintaining Canada's 
humanitarian tradition by protecting refugees and others in need 
of humanitarian protection, defining membership in Canadian 
society and supporting the settlement and integration of 
newcomers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the department must evaluate the international and 
domestic events that could affect the benefits of immigration. 
For example, changes in the push and pull factors for 
immigration, source countries, the qualifications of prospective 
immigrants and domestic labour market circumstances all have an 
impact on the level and mix of immigrants seeking to enter 
Canada, as well as their settlement needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the social and economic conditions that newcomers 
encounter upon arrival can have a major effect on whether 
newcomers successfully integrate into the Canadian way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International migration is related in many complex ways to 
basic environmental stability.  The scarcity of resources such 
as famine and energy sources, environmental degradation such as 
pollution and deforestation, natural disasters such as 
earthquakes and epidemic diseases, and severe climate changes 
such as drought and flooding can displace large numbers of 
people and be important push factors for international migration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perceptions of Canada's abundant natural resources, wide 
open spaces and clean environment have also played a role in 
attracting newcomers, in addition to the broader consideration of 
a somewhat democratic society and an economy that offers a 
measure of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization means that international travel and migration are 
likely to increase.  From an environmental perspective, increased 
mobility increases the potential risk of new foods, plants and 
organisms being introduced into sensitive ecosystems.  There is 
also the risk of new strains of disease spreading more quickly 
between populations.  Although these issues are of serious 
concern and are subject to various domestic and international 
screening processes, the risks must be balanced against the 
benefits of globalization and the freer international movement of 
goods, services and people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the recruitment of highly skilled workers means 
that Canada should benefit from skills and technologies. 
Similarly, international students can be agents of technology and 
knowledge transfer.  Immigrants also bring with them different 
values and practices that offer positive and new social 
perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Attaining a sustainable future requires a commitment to a 
healthier environment and an economy that can enhance the social 
well-being of Canadians.  Only through the recognition and 
consistent consideration of the web of issues that I mentioned 
can we develop a beneficial legal context for immigration 
make the informed choices necessary to build Canada's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is pro-immigration.  We hope the 
government will accept our amendments for improvement in 
operational accountability and transparency so that there 
develops greater political legitimacy for the operations year in 
and year out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's lofty goals for the bill are rather great.  Let 
us hope that there will be more than sound and fury from the 
government and that resources and professionalism will be 
greatly enhanced so we have a system of which we all can be 
proud. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his address.  There is one 
issue that keeps coming up, which I think he mentioned in his 
remarks: What do we do with these smugglers of humans in the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question whether some of the things that have been put in this 
bill to address smuggling of humans will be effective.  In order to 
define a person, the person has to come into our country and we 
have to be able to detain that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, what do we do with bogus refugees?  How long will that 
take to come to an end before we can get them out of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member expand on some of his comments concerning 
people, such as the snakeheads, as they are sometimes called, and 
the leaders of people smuggling rings?  Could he also comment on 
what we can do to address the issue of bogus refugees and how we 
can handle them more quickly to get them out of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with an 
international problem.  Certainly Canada must step up to the 
plate and be part of that international solution.  We also must 
have a proper legal base at home to be able to use due process 
and still maintain our sovereignty, protect our borders and send 
the appropriate message around the world that Canada will no 
longer be the soft touch for human smugglers, 
the principle of that being that capacity creates its own 
demand If there is a loophole it will certainly be pursued by someone 
who has a malevolent agenda.  That has been somewhat our history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is struggling with it.  I compliment the 
government for making an effort to recognize the international 
context that we need to pursue these issues with our neighbours, 
but also to provide a more appropriate legal base for processing 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of it is simply resourcing.  We need the ability 
to hold various hearings and to follow our legal base.  We must 
not only say that we have a great system with rhetoric and 
political headlines, we must also provide the people to fulfil 
the mandate that we expect.  It is the same as when we say that 
we will do peacekeeping abroad but we do not give our soldiers 
the equipment.  Those defending world peace around the world and 
those defending our borders here must also be given the 
appropriate resources to carry out the mandate that has been 
given to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked with some of the senior officials out in the regions 
who were frustrated by trying to get the Ottawa mandarins to 
actually come out and live and breathe the life of the 
immigration world in their local offices or in the foreign 
missions.  There is still, very much, an old bureaucratic, top 
down, executive management approach in Ottawa.  The minister can 
do a lot to set the tone of having a much more modern, 
accountable, responsive department.  Those using modern 
management science, as well as properly resourcing, can then 
respond to the issue and end the problem that capacity creates 
its own demand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening to my colleague and I agree fully with his 
comments concerning a legal base.  That is very important and I 
believe this bill will accomplish that.  The bill will never be 
perfect but it will certainly be a great advancement compared to 
what we have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point he brought out is true because I have 
experienced the same thing.  The department is overwhelmed with 
work and does have staffing problems.  I hope that in the near 
future the kinds of resources needed will be brought to the 
department.  We all agree that our immigration policy will 
probably be one of the most important achievements of this 
parliament.  It will ensure that we have the legal base to get 
things completed as fast and as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that no matter what organization, be it government or 
private enterprise, there is always an element of bureaucracy.  I 
am sure that as clear as we can make this bill and improve upon 
it maybe we can eradicate some of these irritants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I basically agree with what you have brought forward.  I hope in 
our parliamentary committee we will be able to iron out the 
irritants as we go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before I invite the hon. member to 
respond, I would remind members on all sides of the House to 
please make their interventions through the Chair, not directly 
across the floor to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, my comments are about 
trying to develop a more collegial approach, a cross party 
approach to make a good bill that will serve Canada's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must compliment the minister for being in the House yesterday 
throughout most of the debate.  There were indications of a sense 
of co-operativeness and a willingness to listen to suggestions 
from all parties.  We have many stakeholders on this issue. 
Believe it or not, we even have what we call the immigration 
industry.  There is a whole set of hangers on, a professionalism 
of people who make their living from the immigration industry. 
They all have a lot to say about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we pass the bill at second reading it would be pretty well 
unchangeable because of that second reading vote.  The ability of 
the committee to actually make any amendments is very limited. 
I would hope that opposition amendments would be accepted and 
that the minister, perhaps based on further testimony, would be 
prepared to bring in his own departmental amendments that 
recognize some of the deficiencies that the various stakeholders 
will bring in.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is the local constituency office.  My office 
should not be an extension of the immigration department, but I 
have a heart for my constituents when they come in very upset 
that they cannot seem to communicate at all with the immigration 
department.  We try to discourage unnecessary intervention by our 
office.  We try to outline the timeline of 18 months or more 
before they will even hear an answer on certain things.  We are 
able to help some constituents in that regard but there is a 
tremendous demand from the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest workload that I have is on behalf of constituents 
who come into my office with various frustrations or complaints 
about the immigration department, and that should not be so.  The 
immigration department should be fully resourced so that it would 
be only on the rare occasion that the ombudsman role of the 
member of parliament in the local community would be necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the hon. member 
talk about immigration and our ability to protect our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of these people leave these third world countries because 
of desperation and economic needs.  There is a root to this 
problem, and that is with international trade.  We must ensure 
that trade agreements in other countries contain proper 
environmental, labour and health standards so we can build up 
those standards and these people will not have to become illegal 
immigrants to escape the poverty that they are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree that part of the problem should 
be in our trade deals, that we should ensure that those people 
have their basic human rights adhered to, as we do in this 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that the tone 
that is being suggested is a negative one.  I think that really 
does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem for the third world is to provide a trade and 
economic highway for them to earn their way out of poverty rather 
than continuing to prescribe, give a loan or say that they have 
to conform to certain standards.  As they are able to earn and 
raise their standard of living, then we are gradually able to 
address those other issues.  It has to be more of an open face 
rather than a prescriptive, top down, negative one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill 
C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to preface my remarks by saying that I, like many people 
in the House, am an immigrant.  Back in 1968 my parents moved my 
brothers and me to Canada.  At that time, they had a choice of 
moving to a number of countries.  At great personal sacrifice to 
them, they chose to move to Canada.  They had the option to move 
to the United States, Australia and a few other countries but 
they chose Canada because they wanted to give their boys a 
better future.  Indeed it is a debt that I could never repay. 
Canada has given myself, my family and my brothers a 
future that could never be surpassed anywhere in the world.  It 
is a debt that I could never repay to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 I joined the then Reform Party with a view to doing a 
number of things.  One of the things that attracted me to this 
party was the pragmatic view to improving our immigration system. 
I think the fact that this caucus has the most ethnically diverse 
caucus in the House reflects the fact that the now Canadian 
Alliance strongly supports a strong, effective immigration 
policy.  That is something that perhaps is not widely known 
because we have been accused of doing something very different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party believes very strongly that immigration is one of the 
pillars of Canada.  Waves of immigrants over the years have 
ensured that Canada is a leader in so many areas.  These 
immigrants have contributed to Canadian society in ways that are 
countless and too long to articulate in any one speech.  It is 
something from which we all benefit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately over the years our immigration system has declined 
so that it does not enable Canadians to have the best immigration 
system they deserve.  Indeed it does not enable people who wish 
to come to the country to have the best opportunities to 
immigrate to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in an immigration system that is fair and effective; 
that enables true refugees to come to the country; that believes 
in true and rapid family reunification; and that believes in an 
onus and emphasis upon the independent class of immigrant, the 
ones that built the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I will address in this speech, as my colleagues 
have done.  The member for Dauphin—Swan River has given the 
government constructive and effective solutions to ensure that 
Bill C-11 will do all that we ask and what the Canadian public 
demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue I want to deal with is the issue of refugees. 
The riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca had the refugees who came 
over from fujian province a summer ago.  It was a big issue for 
all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some ways that we could improve the system.  The first 
one is to try to differentiate between true and false refugees at 
source.  Individuals who come to the country, and indeed most of 
the people who are false refugees, actually come by plane and 
through our airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that we have about 30,000 false refugees.  They 
are economic refugees, and frankly who would blame them?  Many of 
us would do the same if we were in their shoes.  However, it is 
our responsibility to differentiate between true and false 
refugees.  One thing we could do is to ensure that it is up to 
the people who are claiming refugee status to produce their 
identification.  Rapid identification at entrance to Canada is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for a 90 day hearing in the IRB.  That is too 
long.  People deserve a rapid hearing and a rapid identification 
and determination to assess whether or not they are true or false 
refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the independent class of refugees.  We need to 
put a greater emphasis on it.  A little while ago I was looking 
at the list of professions required by Canada.  It was shocking 
that it has not been updated in a long time.  One profession that 
is glaringly absent is nursing.  Nurses are not on the list, yet 
our country is faced with a crisis in nursing.  We need to update 
that list of professions and skills required to build what the 
minister wants and what we all want: an effective skills set 
within our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Refugees should be assessed for that in an effective way and 
those people should be expedited to come to the country.  Let us 
update the skills set to make sure it is equal to the needs of 
our country.  It has not been done for a very long time.  I hope 
the parliamentary secretary takes that back to the minister.  It 
is wanted on the ground.  It is wanted in the country.  It should 
be done as soon as possible so that we will have a better 
immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of charter of rights, when people come to the 
country they are protected by our charter of rights.  They have 
the same protection as Canadian citizens.  No other country in 
the world allows that to happen.  We should protect all 
individuals who come to the country under the same basic norms 
that protect all citizens of the world, the norms of human rights 
guaranteed under the UN charter.  Those basic norms of human 
rights should be provided for everyone in the country, 
particularly so for individuals who are immigrating to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human smuggling is an international problem.  It is linked with 
international crime gangs.  These people are criminals and we are 
very happy that the minister put extra penalties in the bill. 
There are $1 million in penalties to individuals who are 
profiting from the human misery that goes with human smuggling. 
The people who are engaged in this activity are organized 
criminals.  They are profiting from human misery.  We need to 
work with our partners on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suggestion for the government.  The summit of the 
Americas is taking place from April 20 to April 22 in Quebec 
City. Since this problem is an international problem, it should 
be placed on the floor of the summit.  Let us have a 
transhemispheric approach to the trafficking of human refugees. 
Let us work with our partners, work with international legal 
offices such as Interpol, and use the CSIS and the RCMP.  Let us 
work with other nations so we can block this at source.  It will 
require a multinational approach to deal with these individuals. 
It should be raised at the summit of the Americas.  It is a good 
start to expand into other countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the NDP asked a very good question on the 
issue of dealing with a lot of the economic refugees.  Economic 
refugees would not be coming to our country if they had strong, 
stable economies where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just returned from Colombia with the secretary of state, who 
did an excellent job there representing Canada on the issue of 
tariffs and the issue of freer trade.  It is extraordinary that 
we claim we want to improve the situation in many of these 
countries abroad, and yet we engage in tariffs and blocks to the 
ability of those countries to provide for themselves.  We block 
their ability to have a strong economy, and yet we claim we 
want one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were honest about trying to improve the situation in 
impoverished developing countries, we would eliminate barriers to 
trade for them as well as for us.  We would eliminate the 
tariffs.  We would provide for freer trade.  We would eliminate 
double taxation laws which say that if a company wants to invest 
in another country it is not only taxed in its country of origin 
but also taxed in the country it works in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absurd.  That should not be allowed.  If we removed 
these obstacles to economic trade we would have fewer economic 
refugees.  Then developing countries would be able to improve 
their lot at home and require less trade and less emigration from 
their countries.  They would be able to provide for themselves 
and develop a strong economy, which would provide for regional 
and international security, if they are allowed to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the summit of the Americas from April 20 to April 22 let us 
show some leadership.  Let Canada bring this issue to the floor 
of the summit.  Let us talk about freer trade.  Let us talk about 
a transhemispheric free trade zone.  Let us remove those barriers 
to trade and let us enable these countries to stand on their own 
feet.  That is the best thing we could do for decreasing economic 
refugees that wish to come to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governance and corruption are issues of an international nature. 
We have to work with our partners in dealing with issues of 
corruption.  My colleague from Alberta is doing innovative 
groundwork on dealing with corruption.  He is working 
internationally, as well as with members of the government and 
other parties, on putting together an integrated plan on dealing 
with international corruption.  We could be leaders in governance 
and anti-corruption laws, which would help to improve economic 
security and global security for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of CIDA and development, we should be focusing on 
primary health and education in developing countries as well as 
placing a greater emphasis on microcredit, small loans that 
enable individual people and small groups to get up on their own 
feet to provide the commerce which provides security in 
impoverished areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have raised the issue of criminals time and time 
again.  Why should criminals be allowed into the country? 
Recently we have heard repeatedly of criminals who have come 
through our borders because of our complete and utter lack of 
ability to secure our borders and to differentiate and identify 
them from those who are true refugees.  We are not working with 
Interpol.  There is a lack of communication among CSIS, the RCMP 
and Interpol.  As a result individuals who are criminals are 
allowed to come into our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has legitimately criticized Canada for not 
being able to secure its borders in this fashion.  As a result 
many of those people have gone to the U.S.  It is telling Canada 
to get its act in order, to secure its borders, and we will all 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When individuals who are wanted by Interpol are found at our 
border we should arrest them, put them in jail and send them back 
to their country of origin where they can engage in a fair trial. 
Canada must not and cannot become a haven for criminals, which is 
what has been happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of health testing, the list of diseases that we 
test for is 40 years old. 
It is the responsibility of the department to secure the health 
and welfare of all Canadians and people who wish to come to 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigrants and Canadian citizens do not want diseases to run 
through our country.  Let us make sure that people who wish to 
come to our country are tested at their country of origin and 
that we upgrade the list of diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also bring to the attention of the government another issue 
which was raised before, the issue of listening to the hard 
working people in the department.  They are a wealth of 
information.  They are the ones in the trenches who bear the 
brunt and interface with the people who want to come into Canada. 
They deal with the wishes, desires and the laws of Canada.  They 
are getting it from both sides.  They are finding it very 
difficult.  The good side is that they are a wealth of 
constructive information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been raised in the House before, but I ask the 
secretary of state and the minister to listen to those employees. 
They should not listen only to the many qualified ambassadors but 
should listen in an unthreatening environment to embassy staff 
who have to deal with these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have great ideas on simplifying the system.  They can 
provide information in a secure fashion to individuals who want 
to know how they can immigrate to Canada.  This is basic 
information.  I know there are some very good reasons it is not 
provided, but by not providing it a great deal of work is created 
for many MP offices across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is avoidable by simplifying the system to ensure that we 
are listening to our people on the ground.  The minister could 
have an anonymous suggestion box.  It could be sent directly to 
the minister's office through normal diplomatic channels.  In 
that way effective simple solutions could be put forth that would 
enable us to have a more effective immigration system. This would 
certainly make our lives easier as MPs and make the work of hard 
working staff a lot easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a land of opportunity.  We have an obligation to work 
with our partners to ensure that we have an effective immigration 
system which puts a greater emphasis on the independent class of 
immigrants so that we have a true refugee system.  This would 
also enable us to have a system that is fair to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue we are continually confronted with that I think is 
grossly unfair to people who immigrate to Canada is the period of 
time they cannot work.  Why do we not allow people who are 
immigrating to Canada to work when they get on our shores?  The 
best social program we could ever have for anyone is a job. These 
people want to work.  They want to work hard.  They want to 
contribute to the country they wish to be a part of.  Let them 
apply.  Let them work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were keen on dealing with true refugees we would seek them 
out through sources such as Amnesty International and others that 
provide effective and accurate information on people who are 
truly persecuted and are in danger and wish to live their 
countries of origin.  We could do the humanitarian thing by 
providing a safe haven for them in Canada.  We could seek out 
those individuals and provide them a home under our refugee 
banner.  If we do that, we will be saving lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also become an effective tool in improving the lot of 
countries.  I address issues such as tariffs and free trade.  We 
also need to deal with the World Trade Organization.  Many 
individuals and groups complain and vehemently oppose the WTO. It 
is interesting to listen to what they are saying.  Many 
individuals who are opposed to the talks in Seattle, the Davos 
talks that occurred and many others, are the ones who are 
complaining about the people who are trying to do exactly what 
they want.  They are the ones who are talking about environmental 
protection.  They are talking about safe standards for workers. 
They are talking about labour codes.  They are talking about 
improving the lot of individuals in developing countries. 
However part of the reason we are seeing a lot of individuals 
complaining is that there is a lack of communication and 
transparency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few days ago in committee we spoke about this with a 
group from the Bundestag, the German elected house.  It asked us 
why people were complaining about the WTO and other 
organizations.  It wanted to know if free trade was that bad. No, 
free trade and fair trade is good.  The problem is that we do not 
have a transparent process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party supported a movement by the Bloc that would have 
ensured that free trade agreements would come to the House for a 
transparent and public analysis of what was in these agreements. 
I will go further than that.  I suggest that the government could 
do a lot to dispel and decrease opposition to its efforts to 
improve free trade, which the Canadian Alliance supports.  It 
could ensure that discussions, which have taken place behind 
closed doors, become publicly known.  It could bring those people 
who are complaining about the free trade agreement into the 
decision making process.  It could listen to what they were 
saying and act on it.  The government could make its position in 
these talks public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we make what we do public and transparent we will have far 
fewer complaints.  At the end of the day many of the people who 
are complaining will know that the people who are meeting behind 
closed doors at the WTO, the MAI and in the Davos talks are 
actually trying to pursue a common agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I hope that the government listens to the 
constructive suggestions that have been put forth by members 
across political parties, that it listens to its own members and 
acts.  The bill is not good enough.  There have been constructive 
solutions put forward to build a strong, effective immigration 
policy for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, after listening to that intervention I am reminded of 
the questions at hand.  Do we really believe in immigration? 
Do we think it is an integral part of domestic and foreign policy 
for our country?  Do we have the proper approaches to address 
immigration as an issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite talked in generic, general and wide 
conceptual terms about the importance of immigration and how 
countries can deal with it.  Essentially it is divided into two. 
Either we think of it as a problem on an international basis and 
invest a lot of resources domestically and in foreign 
development, or we receive people here out of generosity and 
other good, valuable and altruistic reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is what the bill is addressing.  That is a 
debate for another time, perhaps in this place or another place. 
The issue in this bill is how we make the procedures once a 
decision has been made to open our doors to others.  Presumably 
we have done that.  Statistically, we have been relatively 
generous in keeping our doors open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In part it is a self-serving generosity.  Today's headlines in 
some of the newspapers indicate that we are approaching a 
shortage of one million skilled workers.  Where do we go?  Where 
do we get them?  We will raid other countries that have such 
skilled labourers because domestically we have not been able to 
address that.  However, when we do that raiding, when we invite 
people to come to make a contribution and play a role in our 
country, then we have a particular procedure and a process 
whereby these people are qualified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is designed to address that.  I have not 
heard that from members of the opposition.  I want to ask a very 
specific question of my colleague opposite.  Will he address the 
issue of criminality?  Nobody but nobody that I know of wants to 
deal with criminals in the country.  We do not want them here. No 
one wants them anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the definitions of criminality and illegality is that 
people try to evade and avoid supervision and the vigilance of 
authorities that are legitimate.  In other words, they are 
underground all the time and look for ways to circumvent the 
system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that we do in this country, which I am a 
little embarrassed by and maybe the member can address it, is 
invite families to come to Canada.  They bring their very young 
children and their newborns.  If we think in terms of what we 
define as children and how we address them, most of these 
children are between the ages of seven to fourteen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These children grow up in our environment.  They do not become 
citizens for one reason or another.  However, when they get into 
their late teens or early twenties and fall afoul of the law, 
they find themselves in jail.  As soon as they have served their 
time and paid their dues, the first people they meet when they 
come out jail are the enforcement officials for the RCMP.  Then 
they are shipped off to wherever they came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite has been so eloquent in his concept of 
global justice, human rights and rights of individuals anywhere 
and everywhere.  How he would address that particular problem? 
It is a lot more common in Canada than we would care to admit. 
We are exporting criminals that we have trained.  Could the 
member address that in a very specific way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I was specific 
for the last 20 minutes on a number of issues.  The hon. member 
asked a whole litany of questions and addressed a number of 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he began, he spoke about allowing independent class 
immigrants.  We are firmly supportive of that.  We need more of 
them because with the demographic changes in our country, we 
cannot hope to have the number of skilled workers in our 
workforce that our economy requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that we are not raiding other 
countries.  People come in from other countries and people 
leave to go to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is an effective way of ensuring that these people 
are allowed to come to the country.  Right now, a lot of skilled 
people who want to come into Canada are not allowed to, which is 
shocking.  I mentioned one specific example and that was nurses. 
They are not even on our list of required professions and skills. 
As I said to the government in my speech, it needs to update 
that list of skills because it does not reflect the needs of our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of criminality, individuals who have committed 
crimes in this country should be sent back to their country of 
origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, through the RCMP and CSIS, needs to work with Interpol 
at the entrance to our country to ensure that people who are 
wanted by Interpol are apprehended and sent back to the country 
where they are wanted.  We do not do that enough and we should. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I came to Canada in 1956 from 
Holland with my family, as did the hon. member.  We left for 
purely economic reasons.  This country gave our family, like is, 
a tremendous uplift and a wonderful life.  I too would 
like to thank Canada for the opportunity it has given us, as did 
the hon. member from Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the aspect of trade with the third world 
countries and with other countries in order to lift their 
standards.  He is right; trade is the way to do that.  However, 
when we discuss trade deals should the environment, human rights 
and labour standards not be negotiated prior to any commercial 
agreements on the trade deals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that he was in Colombia.  He must know the 
standards of the third world countries, especially like Colombia. 
In the last 16 months 192 trade unionists have been slaughtered 
there.  He knows that is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the things that the NDP has mentioned time and time 
again.  If we are going to have trade deals in a hemispheric kind 
of way, union and labour rights must be protected and 
environmental standards must be met.  The people can then build 
themselves up so they can stay and live in their countries and 
become part of the global economic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that would be a way to go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I absolutely invite the 
hon. member to cross the floor and join the Canadian Alliance. He 
has eloquently spoken about what my party stands for.  He spoke 
about free trade, fair trade, environmental standards, labour 
laws and labour protection.  Indeed, I know the hon. member would 
work shoulder to shoulder with us to ensure that free trade 
agreements that come to the floor of the House will involve all 
of that.  That is what free trade and fair trade must be about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
impressed with my hon. colleague from the Canadian Alliance.  I 
came on my own to Canada in 1968 when I was 19.  I chose this 
country because of what it was and what it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made some comments about Canada taking a 
leadership role among American countries meeting in Quebec.  He 
proposed that we should reinforce our borders.  At the same time 
he proposed freer and fairer trade.  I agree with him but 
something is bothering me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invited 225,000 new immigrants to Canada last year.  Could 
the member expand a little on what percentage of those were 
smuggled into Canada?  I want to remind him that in European 
countries, especially within the European Union, there is freer 
movement.  More people are leaving countries and settling within 
western Europe than in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the current estimates are 
about 30,000 individuals who come into the country as false 
refugees.  More than 95% are travelling through our airports, 
many of whom have destroyed their identification papers at origin 
and arrive here without them.  That is why I said that one of the 
challenges the department needs to address is that people who 
come to this country claiming refugee status, the onus should be 
on them to identify themselves.  There are, of course, extraneous 
situations that would not allow that, but that is what needs to 
happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to Bill C-11, which deals with immigration.  This 
is an extremely important topic for the various parties, 
although differences can be seen in the speeches made so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to add my voice to that of our immigration critic, the 
member for Laval Centre.  I will not make the same points she 
did because, in my view, she gave an excellent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to speak as a member of the subcommittee on human rights. 
This subcommittee has not yet begun its work, but we are 
interested in the problem. The House will understand my 
sensitivity to the issue, particularly the situation faced by 
refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Refugees are people who have involuntarily left their country 
because they had no other choice in the circumstances.  Often, 
they do so under rather dramatic conditions.  Having read on the 
topic and followed the newspapers, at least since I became an 
MP, I am aware of certain problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to respond to the comments made by the member who 
preceded me to the effect that some people are not even able to 
produce identity papers.  In some situations, when refugees 
leave their country, they do so in a panic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are being pursued, or feel they are being pursued, 
they are not always in a position to prove their identity or to 
provide some document or other.  Such situations must be given 
careful consideration.  When the person coming after you is 
armed, you do not always have the time to go home looking for 
the documents you need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pointing this out because yesterday I was in a meeting 
where people were describing the difficulties experienced by 
people currently in Canada who had come as refugees and did not 
have documentation they needed from their old country in 
proving their identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fairly exceptional situation which should be brought 
to the attention of the House.  Some people have been here for a 
dozen years or so.  They have refugee status, but not the 
documents to prove it.  This means they cannot return to their 
own country obviously, because they left it after they were 
persecuted or felt they were.  So they cannot go back.  They 
obviously cannot visit family who remained there.  Neither can 
they have members of their family coming from their old country 
visiting them here.  In certain cases, they can simply not 
travel abroad, even to a country that has no link with their 
home country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the loss of the usual entitlements of a citizen of 
Canada or of Quebec.  For instance, they have greater difficulty 
finding work or obtaining a work permit, as it is very complicated, 
and they are not entitled to university bursaries and scholarships. 
The person I referred to and with whom I spoke yesterday was a 
woman whose children were of university age but, lacking 
documents and unable to obtain them, did not qualify for student 
loans or bursaries under the same conditions as any Canadian or 
Quebecer could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the situation despite the fact that, under the 1951 
United Nations Convention on Refugees, countries accepting 
refugees under these particular conditions must issue documents 
entitling them to certain rights, restoring their rights, but 
such is not the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of Canada often tells us we are living in the 
best country in the world.  I beg to differ, in this connection 
at least, when this government is not capable of respecting the 
international convention of the United Nations relating to 
immigration that has been in place since 1951. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House, I have often questioned what point there was to 
having laws or regulations if they are not applied.  In this 
case, however, what is involved is a treaty, but an 
international convention.  Canada is not applying the rules the 
convention requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite the committee members, including my colleague 
from Laval Centre, who assured me she would bring up this kind of 
case, to make sure that Canada respects international treaties. 
Before passing any new legislation, or while doing so, like this bill, 
which makes considerable changes to the system, this is something 
we must take into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second aspect.  I would point out that sometimes, and not 
this morning, not today, certain people speak of Quebec 
sovereignists as somewhat xenophobic.  I am not saying that I 
have heard such a thing today.  I would, however, like to 
testify to the fact that Quebecers are very welcoming to 
refugees.  Throughout our history, we have always given a very 
proper welcome to refugees, including the latest waves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proof, yesterday I just happened to read Pierre Bourgault in 
the <I>Journal de Montréal</I>.  He is a staunch and very persuasive 
separatist and makes no effort to hide the fact.  He offered the 
following thought.  If the rules on refugees are too tough, if a 
closed door attitude is adopted, will western countries such as 
Canada not in fact see an increase in the numbers of illegal 
immigrants crossing their borders?  People wishing to flee their 
country would have no choice but to use the services of 
professionals and professionals means criminal organizations 
and so forth.  The result achieved would be the opposite of the 
one sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, and this is true with any piece of legislation, we 
must always be on the lookout for the down side.  Mr. Bourgault 
quite rightly pointed out this risk.  Furthermore, when we read 
the backgrounders provided when the minister introduced the 
bill, we can only be amazed at the hard line she takes.  She 
talks of closing the doors, of making this bill tougher in 
response to the public perception in certain quarters that 
Canada is a preferred point of entry for criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not questioning whether in fact criminals manage to slip 
past the IRB and are perhaps already here.  In connection with 
this problem, I think that what are needed are removal 
provisions in the bill for the cases when this comes to our 
attention. Clearly, we must not encourage this sort of activity. 
At the same time, if we put too much emphasis on this aspect of 
the problem and if we shut the door too much by tightening the 
rules, we may get the opposite effect and prevent genuine 
refugees whose lives are threatened because of their political 
or religious convictions from entering Canada. Or we may prevent 
people whose rights, as recognized by the Canadian Charter of 
Human Rights, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms 
and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, are violated 
from entering Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to add my comments to those made by my colleague 
yesterday. I am concerned about another aspect of the bill. Many 
people come to my office, to all members' offices, to bring up 
immigration matters. Perhaps we see only one aspect of the 
issue, namely the most problematic cases. After close to eight 
years, I have come to realize that, depending on the cases 
reviewed by a board member or by any other person, 
interpretations may differ. 
I am not saying it is necessarily the case with all those who 
currently hold these positions, but if one looks at past 
appointments, one wonders about the need to continue to make 
such political appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, this is one area that requires a great deal of 
skill, impartiality and training, because it involves highly 
judicial and legal issues. In the future, we should make sure 
that, above all, such appointments are not political ones. I add 
these remarks to those of my colleague and I am sure that she 
shares them with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should deal with the appointment process. We need 
a tighter process that would at least give the impression 
that the system is very impartial, very fair and more effective, 
particularly in light of the number of claims pending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I am told that there are 400,000 people in the 
world who are awaiting a response on whether they will be 
accepted into Canada.  Obviously, this is not just refugees, but 
the whole spectrum of immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are extensive delays in obtaining a response. I wonder why 
Canada—and the bill is still not clear enough in this 
regard—despite the warning from the UNHCR about imprisoning 
minors, continues to imprison large numbers of children and 
teenagers automatically when they are refugees without 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there is child labour in a number of countries. 
Then, when they arrive in Canada, the best country in the world 
according to the Prime Minister and certain hon. members over 
there, they face the possible imprisonment as refugees, just 
because they are minors and because it would appear that we are 
not fully prepared to take them in, because they lack documents 
and we lack the staff to examine their files promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the points I wanted to raise. I do not want to extend 
my speech needlessly. I would like to remind hon. members in 
conclusion that we are amazed at the hard line attitude taken 
when this bill was introduced, when it is so important for both 
Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Bloc Quebecois members agree with the principle 
behind the bill, we feel that Quebec's authority with respect to 
immigration is not clearly enough defined.  This is where we 
have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, Quebec signed an agreement with the federal 
government allowing it to select its own immigrants, so-called 
economic immigrants.  At the present time, however, authority 
for refugees is left entirely to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I repeat, we are very open to cases of this sort, if 
only out of a sense of humanity.  Quebec is very aware of what 
is going on in certain countries and in certain circumstances. 
However, the Bloc Quebecois feels that it would be a good idea 
to spell out Quebec's authority under the immigration agreement.

Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for his very helpful comments. 
The issues he raised are challenging to both the standing 
committee and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver East pointed out this morning that 
there are apparently about 25 so-called migrants that have no 
status and are therefore detained on the west coast.  Canadians 
do not agree that we should be detaining migrants for long 
lengths of time because of lack of identification on the person. 
We know that people who hop on airplanes that come to Canada must 
show identification.  In fact, that is the responsibility of the 
carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the mission statement of the Immigration Refugee 
Board: on behalf of all Canadians it is “to make well reasoned 
decisions on immigration and refugee matters efficiently, fairly 
and in accordance with the law”.  Perhaps the role of the board 
has to be enhanced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think that the vehicles currently in place 
need to be changed so that they address the issue of trying to 
figure out where migrants come from and who they are? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not an immigration expert. 
My comments are influenced by what I see as an MP.  I have been 
here for eight years and this is not my first mandate, as I 
think it is for most members of the House.  As MPs, we are 
obviously exposed to those having problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the time, the people who come to see us are not 
criminals.  They have already settled in Canada and want to 
bring in members of their family.  Their concern is to reunite 
their family.  Often, as MPs, we are in a position to learn, 
through their neighbours or others in the community, how they 
are behaving. The majority of cases are entirely legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not telling the member that I am an expert in the rules of 
immigration and I have no aspirations to become an immigration 
commissioner.  I trust the members of the committee from all the 
parties, especially my colleague from Laval Centre, to bring up 
these matters in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for giving me the opportunity to address a 
point I had overlooked in my remarks, the opportunity to hear 
witnesses.  This is an important bill, and there are all sorts 
of groups in society with opinions.  There are experts in this 
area.  They do not come just from the world of government but 
from civil society as well.  They live in Canada and run into 
this sort of case daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest the time needed be taken and no attempt be taken 
to upset the various stages, since these are delicate cases. 
The Immigration Act is not changed every year.  We should 
take the time necessary now in committee to ensure we have the 
best possible legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière said that a part of the bill was 
tough. He is right. There is a part that is very tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the part that seeks to prevent people from illegally 
entering Canada, including those who use forged documents and 
criminals who want to come here. We must obviously be very 
vigilant and these provisions of the act are tough, but this is 
necessary, because if we truly want to ensure an immigration 
process that will serve our country well, we must ensure that 
those who arrive here go through the legal channels and are 
properly checked and identified. The act is tough in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else which we must not forget. The hon. 
member was right when he said that there are over 400,000 
unprocessed claims. 
This is why we introduced a new bill. It is precisely so that we 
can have a system that is much more effective and efficient, a 
system that will reduce delays. Indeed, the main objective is to 
have a system that will adequately meet our needs and also 
reduce these delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, when I began addressing this 
bill, I said that I was adding to what my colleague for Laval 
Centre had said, focusing on one point that had attracted my 
attention, that is, undocumented refugees. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is worth focusing particular attention on those 
who come undocumented.  The hon. member across the floor spoke 
of those with forged papers.  He is right about that: checks 
must be made.  I will not name any particular countries, but in 
certain countries that are experiencing war or other crises—the 
circumstances vary from place to place and from situation to 
situation—sometimes it is pointless to ask for documents, 
especially if the person belongs to a group feeling oppressed by 
a rival group seen as the opposition, because no documents will 
be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to voice a caution.  The lack of documents should 
not make an application inadmissible.  Some humanity ought to 
come into it. 
Take the case of guerrillas; it is not always governments that 
oppress their citizens, sometimes it is parallel groups, 
militias.  As hon. members are aware, there are all manner of 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the subcommittee on human rights, I am concerned 
about people in terrible situations.  When groups arrive, 
families with young children, they need to be treated with some 
humanity.  I have pointed out in particular that they must not 
be detained an unnecessarily long time, the children in 
particular.  This is contrary to the international rules of the 
United Nations High Commission for Refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if the legitimacy of certain individuals' situations 
is accepted, if the fact that they are undocumented is accepted, 
they must not be left for ten years without any new documents 
from the Government of Canada. 
I have even heard someone describe feeling imprisoned, unable to 
travel abroad, unable to bring other family members, who had 
managed to get out of their country, here because of a status 
that was in some ways that of a citizen without any rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deplore such situations.  No one here will be surprised at my 
point of view, as a member of the subcommittee on human rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
ask a brief but important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has barely touched on the fact that the government 
has not used the great opportunity the introduction of this 
immigration bill gives us all to allow the agreement to be 
amended, to at least allow Quebec to have a say and decide to 
have refugees instead of leaving this entirely up to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I think this would be 
warranted, since where do one third of refugees to Canada go? 
They go to Quebec.  The numbers warrant it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-11.  Earlier 
in the debate one of the members from the government side asked 
for specifics.  I am here to provide some.  My riding is one of 
the areas with the highest rates of immigration.  I have helped 
many individuals get into the country 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak to that aspect today.  I will speak to how the 
refugee system has failed us and how criminals take advantage of 
it.  I will also talk about what can be done in legislation to 
fix the situation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already heard from members opposite that these kinds of 
things have to get fixed, but in all fairness I do not think the 
government is headed toward fixing this problem.  I also do not 
think it has the desire to do so.  I will point out several 
specific cases with regard to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate you on your appointment to the chair, Madam 
Speaker.  I will go back a ways on immigration and talk about how 
criminals abuse the system.  I choose to talk about criminals 
because I spent a lot of time as justice critic and now as 
solicitor general critic on these kinds of issues.  I seem to be 
one of the few who is fighting them.  I have spent many hundreds 
of hours fighting these kinds of cases on behalf of victims. Each 
and every time I have been involved in them, I have been asked to 
intervene on behalf of the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to an article that appeared in a trade magazine printed 
in Central America, the United States and Mexico.  I raise this 
because it emphasizes in my mind how other countries think of us. 
The following paid ad appeared in the magazine:  “Guaranteed 
immigration to Canada with the purchase of a Fleet Rent-a-Car 
franchise.  Total investment of $50,000 Canadian, approximately 
$30,000 U.S.  You are guaranteed”, and the word guaranteed is 
underlined, “immigration to Canada even with a criminal 
record”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pursued the particular ad because it gave an address on 
Bathurst Street in Toronto and a phone number.  I had an 
organization interview these people under the auspices of being 
from another country and having criminal records.  Sure enough, 
they validated exactly what they said in the ad.  They 
essentially said that they could fix it up for those with a 
criminal record who wanted to get into Canada.  Then they were 
asked questions about how such people could get into Russia, 
England, Canada and so on.  The most outstanding point was: 
“Just get your foot on their soil and you are in”.  In fact 
that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently spent some time with police in an area well known for 
its drugs.  We stopped and picked up three Hondurans.  They were 
asked for their papers.  All three individuals came to Canada 
illegally.  One had been here for 10 months.  He had two criminal 
convictions and one outstanding charge for trafficking.  One was 
here for something like six months.  He had an outstanding charge 
for trafficking.  One had just arrived in Canada, I believe under 
a train car from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where these young men are selling drugs to 
our kids, sending the money back home and not being deported. 
Therein lies part of the problem with our refugee system.  I will 
go through the reasons it has to be fixed.  I have no illusions 
about it.  I have spoken to these issues time and time again in 
the House and they do not get fixed.  I am putting on the record 
today that the problem still exists and I do not think the 
propensity is on the other side to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fellow from Cuba came into our country a very short time ago. 
I was asked by parents to look into the situation because they 
had an underage child.  I should say that the child used to be 
underage but both the Conservative and Liberal governments took 
it upon themselves at one time to change the age of consensual 
sex from 16 years to 14 years.  This child, who is now legally 
able to have consensual sex is 15 years old and the fellow who is 
dealing is 32.  The parents asked me to intervene, so I did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not sure how he got into the country.  Nobody was ever 
really sure.  Once he found out that I was on the job on this 
particular issue, I knew what would happen.  He was advised to 
apply for refugee status.  Word gets out pretty fast to apply for 
refugee status and get into this morass that lasts forever and 
keeps a person in this country, so first of all I applied as an 
intervener at the refugee hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He, at his discretion, tried to keep me out of the refugee 
hearing.  I had to apply to the refugee board to get into the 
refugee hearing.  I had to fight that battle.  I won that.  It is 
preposterous that a Canadian citizen cannot sit in a refugee 
hearing at his or her own discretion and that an individual 
applying for refugee status in Canada, regardless of whether he 
or she is a criminal or not, has the option to kick out a 
Canadian citizen.  That is just preposterous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I won the right to be in the hearing.  In the refugee hearing, 
since I was allowed to be there, I was my own intervener.  I am 
not a lawyer.  I have only picked up the basics of this through 
self teaching.  In the hearing I was passed a document—from the 
right source—that identified this fellow as being wanted by the 
FBI in the United States for trafficking.  He was wanted in 
Nevada and California. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There he had a 15 year old child from Canada, the parents did 
not want him, we did not want him, he was trafficking and the 
Americans were after him.  We found out that he had been living 
in the United States for four years, but at his own discretion 
when the heat was on in the United States he skipped across the 
border to Canada to say that he was applying for refugee status, 
solely to avoid the law in the United States, not as an applicant 
from Cuba, although that is what his application said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fought this in the refugee hearing.  I asked what we were 
doing to ourselves and why did we not ship this fellow the next 
morning over to the States and let him pay his dues, but no.  We 
had more than one refugee hearing.  We were to have numerous 
refugee hearings on this guy.  The parents were beside 
themselves, not quite understanding why it was that Canada was 
even entertaining a refugee hearing in the first place, much less 
a refugee hearing on an individual who had been living in the 
United States for four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As time went on we actually won the battle and the refugee board 
declared that he was not a genuine refugee.  After the board did 
so, I said to the refugee board that the guy had better be put in 
holding because he was going to jump.  No, the board did not want 
to do that because then his rights would have been violated.  So 
the board told him he was not a refugee and what did he do?  We 
do not know where he is today because he skipped, exactly as I 
told them he would and exactly the way it has happened countless 
times when I have fought these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person has to wonder what bright light comes on at the 
immigration and refugee hearings such that people will not listen 
to reason.  I recently found out as late as last week that this 
person has absconded with the young girl.  The parents are 
wondering why we even entertained the refugee hearing in the 
first place, much less not holding the guy once he was declared 
deportable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with that philosophy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn to more examples.  There is a fellow by the name of 
Chander in my riding.  He arrived in 1996 as a visitor from India 
and quickly got married.  He beat up his wife several weeks 
later, but he was married and figured he was going to stay in 
Canada.  I was asked by his wife to intervene.  The moment I 
intervened, this individual, charged with assault and in Canada 
basically under false pretences, applied for refugee status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just the common thing to do. 
I have even heard immigration adjudicators say that if a 
deportation fails the person can always apply for refugee status. 
It is used for the wrong reasons by some people.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This individual started to fight.  He tried to kick me out of 
the hearing.  I had to fight to make sure I stayed in the 
hearing.  I did that.  It was the same thing.  It was the same 
advice they get from all their legal aid lawyers.  It was 
identical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fought the case all the way to the refugee board and the 
board found that no credible or trustworthy evidence was 
available on which to base a convention refugee claim.  I said he 
had better be kept behind bars because I could tell the board 
where he was going and that he would not be around on the day he 
was to be deported.  He has gone.  We are not sure where he went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a little law that says if everything fails on 
the application and if a person returns to his or her country and 
comes back here after 90 days, he or she can re-apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About six months later I got a call, from Calgary this time, not 
Abbotsford, British Columbia.  Guess who re-applied for refugee 
status?  By luck I found out.  Had I not found out, it would have 
been clear sailing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we went through it again.  He applied to kick me out of the 
hearing.  He did not want the public involved.  He had the right. 
I fought that and won.  We went to the refugee hearing in 
Calgary, fought there and won a second time.  For the second time 
I advised that if the person was to be deported he should be 
locked up because he would disappear and he would claim again 
somewhere, maybe in Halifax next time, who knew?  That could not 
be done because that was against his rights.  Today we again do 
not know where he is.  Very likely he has already had another 
refugee claim that I have not heard about, or he is about to and 
I may not hear about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is used and abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Get the logic he used.  This fellow even claimed that he was a 
refugee from India—a democratic country yet—because he was 
being persecuted.  He failed in his refugee application, then 
came back and had the audacity to lie at the second refugee 
hearing.  He said he went to India, stayed a while and came back 
in.  He was asked if he was persecuted there.  He was asked why 
he would go back if he would be persecuted.  He did not have an 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going on every single day, time and time again every day 
in our country.  I cannot believe how preposterous this system is 
getting.  Yet when we stand up here and talk about an immigration 
act, there is no mention of these difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our sorrowful areas where we see a lot of drug use and abuse, 
on the downtown east side of Vancouver, we have many individuals 
trafficking in drugs who are non-Canadians.  Some of them have 
not 2 or 3 charges and convictions but 20, 30 and 40.  I have the 
records.  They are not deported.  They are selling drugs to our 
children and they are not deported.  If we try to deport them 
they claim refugee status, and the deportation and refugee boards 
do not talk to each other.  One will say that is their business, 
not ours.  Then when they jump over from deportation to refugee 
board application, the refugee board says yes, that is our 
business and not theirs.  However, it is the business and concern 
of all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are many genuine people coming into the country as 
immigrants and as refugees, and we are happy for that, there are 
those who are blatantly abusing the system.  It must be dealt 
with. 
It cannot be dealt with by tabling legislation and not talking 
about it.  It cannot be dealt with by someone like myself 
standing up and trying to defend the rights of victims who have 
been abused while someone else over there is saying I must be a 
racist because I am talking about the immigration system not 
working.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to speak about these issues on behalf of 
victims, some who have been raped by some of these individuals. 
One individual, a friend of mine now, was raped by a man from El 
Salvador.  He was ordered deported.  We shipped him out to El 
Salvador on the condition that she drop the charges.  She agreed 
in order to get him out of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After he was escorted out—we flew him to El Salvador—she was 
getting gas for her car in my community six months later and 
guess who was gassing up beside her?  The very guy who raped her, 
who we shipped out.  Do members know what he did?  To avoid being 
deported again, he stood up with his legal aid lawyers, two of 
them this time, and said he was a refugee.  We went through the 
whole process for two years.  For two long years this girl went 
through this.  He was one of those individuals, by the way, who 
refuse to take a test for HIV; that is her problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House wants specifics from the other side, I have them 
and dozens more stories like this.  I am not trying to paint a 
picture of a terrible, chaotic system.  I am telling the 
government for the umpteenth time in the House of Commons that 
there are problems that need to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims are hoping that we in the House of Commons do something 
about it rather than standing up and saying that all is well, 
that we want everything to continue on the way it has been with a 
couple of changes.  There are people who need our help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals in our country and in all other countries see us as a 
haven.  That is not made up.  All we have to do is pick up the 
FBI directory or the CIA documents in the United States.  They 
will tell us that criminals see Canada as a haven, because once 
they get here they are entitled to the charter of rights and 
freedoms and they get legal aid if they get into trouble.  What 
is the worst that can happen in Canada?  Conditional sentence, 
suspended sentence, stay of proceedings, charges dropped?  Even 
if they do a couple of years in prison they are seldom deported. 
We can look at the disgusting track record on that.

has presented the very negative down side.  Undoubtedly there 
were difficulties in the past.  I am not denying it, but these 
are extreme cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, more than 8,600 people who entered the country

</I></B></P><P align=left>What our colleague has brought before us, unfortunately, does 
happen.  They are extreme cases.  Nobody in the House wants to 
see people abuse the system like that.  We know it can happen, 
and I am sure it has happened in other countries, but we are 
coming in with new legislation.  We will be much more efficient 
and we will try to eliminate the extreme cases, but we cannot 
think that it will be done overnight and that we will have a 
completely flawless system.  No one in the world has a flawless 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is the answer.  They 
should write that down because that is all those members say. 
This is not about extremes.  It is about law abiding Canadian 
citizens becoming victims of individuals who come into our 
country.  In my area it is not an extreme.  I cannot dream up 
those cases.  Is the member saying that this case and dozens of 
other cases in my immediate area are extremes or isolated 
incidents?  They are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I have is that when legislation comes into the 
House that we do not like we are called extremists, bigots 
or whatever.  Those kinds of comments filter out the reality of 
legislation.  The reality of legislation to a victim is much 
different.  What happens in the House of Commons is a lot 
different from what happens on the street.  I know because I 
spend a fair amount of time on the street, and I would suggest 
that perhaps the member should as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford 
for his heartfelt and passionate work on the issue and his 
advocacy of victims' rights and reform of this system, which 
continues to grind away with the Liberal government being utterly 
indifferent to the impact it has on people's real lives.  The 
government says extremes, but I say that they are real people, 
not extremes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most frequent comment we hear in the debate from members 
opposite and from members of other parties on the problems in the 
system and the enormous holes that exist, for instance, in the 
refugee system, is to discredit all immigration and therefore to 
create, they suggest, a kind of hysterical anti-immigration 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague not agree that is a completely irresponsible 
argument and that, if anything, what diminishes Canadians' 
attitude of generosity and openness toward new immigrants is 
precisely the abuses of the system to which he has referred? 
Would he not agree that it is by correcting such injustices and 
inequities in the system that we can best create an attitude of 
openness and tolerance toward the many hundreds of thousands of 
new Canadians who come to this place lawfully and contribute to 
our prosperity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague is 
absolutely correct.  The other side of the House believes that if 
we do not address the issues precisely the way they do then there 
is something irresponsible in the way we talk to issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of the last election and the comments by the 
immigration minister who basically said that people associated 
with the Canadian Alliance were holocaust deniers, racists and 
bigots.  That would include my mother who lost her first husband 
in Italy during the war.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perpetuation of that kind of thought leads to mistrust on 
the part of all Canadians, not just some Canadians.  I think 
those words coming from the immigration minister were perhaps 
even more noticeable since the individual who said them is a 
minister of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  She should be fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  My colleague from Calgary states it 
quite plainly.  Most people in the country thought she should 
have been fired or at least when cabinet was reorganized she 
should not have been given the job.  She represents a thought 
process that should not exist but which is perpetuated by the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about real life gut issues that affect people on 
the street and victims in the country, we are treated with a 
wall, a barrage, like Holocaust deniers.  Where the heck did that 
ever come from other than from the mouth of the immigration 
minister?  I thought it was really disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is absolutely correct when he says that the 
promotion of those kinds of words leads only to degrade our 
nation not just a political party.  When we talk about words like 
extreme, there is nothing extreme in anything I said here today. 
I guarantee my colleagues in the House that if the victims I 
talked about today were in the House we would hear one heck of a 
lot more from them than from me about how badly the system is 
operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes the reflection, as my colleague says, of a whole 
system gets tainted by smaller problems within the whole.  I was 
suggesting that to make the whole system work well, look well and 
operate well, we have to fix all parts of it not just some of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I just cannot resist the observation 
that it really does not further the tone of this debate to have 
the member opposite preach to the converted, the member who 
questioned him, and repeat all these things about the unfortunate 
remarks that were attributed to the minister of immigration.  We 
should leave that behind.  Whoever brings it up, we should leave 
it behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the debate on to a point for the member 
that perhaps puts us back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member see any merit in perhaps revisiting some of the 
charter decisions that had such a profound effect on Canadian 
immigration policy?  I am thinking specifically of the Singh 
decision of 1984 which, as members may not be aware, was a split 
decision.  Only three justices ruled that a person who lands in 
this country should be entitled to all due process, ruled in 
terms of the charter, and the other three justices ruled in terms 
of the Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So in fact there was no majority under any single legislation, 
much less the charter, that supported the supreme court's 
decision that was later interpreted as a fundamental charter 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member's thoughts are on that.  Is this 
something that perhaps we should encourage the government to 
revisit and to test before the supreme court once again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad my colleague 
brought that up because the Singh decision in 1984 was the 
benchmark for immigration.  To a large extent, I think it tends 
to discredit the whole immigration system because of that one 
aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals coming into the country should have certain rights 
and privileges but not the same rights, privileges and 
freedoms as Canadians.  I do not think it applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, I was sitting in an immigration office one day 
when some individuals jumped ship.  Without regard to their 
background, and because of the Singh decision on all their rights 
and privileges, a medical person was there, two lawyers jumped on 
it as fast as they could, and three or four other people were 
there saying that they would help them. 
There was an individual there from the welfare office promising 
to pay right away.  I thought wait a minute, slow down a bit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter of rights and privileges must be revisited.  I agree 
with the member.  I would be open to a long discussion on that 
subject.  It is very timely and necessary.  Society has taken the 
charter of rights much too far today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will start by congratulating you on your appointment 
to the chair.  It is a real honour for me to be able to speak to 
this piece of legislation, Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first talk about what Canadians want from an immigration 
system.  Second, I will address what they do not want.  Then I 
will go through the legislation and point out 28 different areas 
that must be focused on and seriously looked at, at committee 
level.  Those areas must be examined and in many cases modified 
through amendments to make the legislation something which serves 
what Canadians want and helps prevent what they do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do Canadians want?  They want a system that works first for 
economic and independent immigrants.  The current system clearly 
does not work well.  Any one of us as members of parliament could 
point to individual cases and lots of them.  In each constituency 
across the country there are hundreds of cases where the system 
has failed people and where it has taken them too long to work 
their way through it.  The result has not made sense.  These are 
not isolated cases.  They are very common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system in the past worked extremely well.  I think about my 
constituency.  I think about the immigrants who developed the 
area of Lakeland constituency.  In the latter part of the 19th 
century immigration to Canada began with immigrants from Britain 
and then expanded to include Germany and almost every country in 
western Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the late part of the 19th century we had a Lebanese 
settlement which is still prominent in Lac La Biche and in parts 
of our constituency.  They are a well established part of the 
community.  They have helped build the community.  In the late 
19th century and in two other instances, after the first world 
war and the second world war, we had Ukrainian immigration from 
eastern Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These immigrants have built our country.  I think we all 
recognize this point.  Every member of parliament could point to 
his or her constituency and to how immigration has worked in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not learn from what has happened and what has worked 
in the past so that we can build a system that will work better 
in the future?  That is what Canadians want in terms of 
independent categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also want a system which will reunite families 
quickly.  When families are separated, either because family 
members have come as refugee claimants or have come under the 
independent categories, Canadians want a system which will 
reunite families quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, every member of parliament in his or her constituency can 
point to dozens of situations where a member of a family came to 
the country and where a spouse or dependent children have not 
been allowed to come.  The process has taken months and even 
years in many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to situations in my own constituency where husbands 
and wives have been waiting to be reunited for more than three 
years.  Canadians want a system which will allow that to happen 
much more quickly and in a fashion that is expected from a well 
developed country like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also want a system which will accept genuine refugees. 
There is no doubt that Canadians support accepting genuine 
refugees.  I have heard nothing but support for that from people 
from across the country.  They want it right now.  They know our 
system is failing genuine refugees. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, fewer than 5,000 of the 23,000 refugees that we 
accept each year are actually chosen from camps overseas where 
they have been designated as refugees by the United Nations.  We 
bring in fewer than 5,000 of those people a year, and most of the 
people we bring in are not actually from camps.  They are brought 
in from overseas, but they have been rejected by the system in 
another country.  Very few actually come in from camps each year. 
Canadians want the system to focus on genuine refugees, and it is 
not doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want a system which would allow abuse of our 
immigration system.  Canadians do not want that.  They do not 
want queue jumpers abusing the goodwill of our country and 
pushing aside others who would go through the system properly. 
That happens all too often.  We all know that and I do not think 
there is any real doubt about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want people, who are not genuine refugees and 
who have been rejected by the system, to be allowed to stay in 
our country.  Yet that happens.  While our official acceptance 
rate for refugees is something like 50%, which is many times 
higher than the rate of most other countries, only 15% of all 
people who come to Canada claiming to be refugees are ever known 
to leave the country.  That is what makes Canadians angry about 
our system and about the way the government allowed our system to 
fail.  That is what Canadians do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read into the record the Canadian Alliance policy on 
immigration.  The Canadian Alliance is a new political party.  We 
are only slightly over a year old, so we do not have policy that 
is completely fleshed out in a lot of areas.  There is a lot of 
work to be done.  We are looking forward to our convention about 
a year from now where we will have a lot of policy fleshed out in 
a lot more detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is exactly what the Canadian Alliance policy book says 
about immigration.  I am proud of it and I want Canadians to know 
about it.  I do not want the misinterpretations and the false 
statements made by members of other political parties, by the 
media or anyone else to be allowed to stand, because they should 
not stand.  Here is our policy: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see Canada as a land built by immigrants and will continue to 
welcome new immigrants.  We support sponsorship for immediate 
family members.  Our immigration policy will take into account 
Canada's economic needs and we will introduce greater fairness 
and security into the system, including enforcement of 
sponsorship obligations.  We will work co-operatively with the 
provinces on the settlement of immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to protect the integrity of the valuable contribution 
made to the fabric of Canada by millions of law abiding 
immigrants.  We will not allow their good reputation to be 
jeopardized by non-citizens who engage in criminal activity and 
will speedily deport such individuals once their sentence has 
been served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We affirm Canada's humanitarian obligation to welcome genuine 
refugees and are proud that our country has provided a safe haven 
for distressed people from across the world.  To ensure fairness 
and end queue jumping, we will immediately deport bogus refugees 
and other illegal entrants, and will severely penalize those who 
organize abuse of the system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That refers to people smugglers, people traffickers and that 
kind of thing.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will ensure that refugee status is arbitrated expeditiously, 
consistently and professionally.  We will end the abuse of 
refugee claims as a fast track to gain the benefits of landed 
immigrant status. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Canadian Alliance policy on immigration, and I am 
proud of it.  This policy came from the membership and all our 
members support it.  I think we had the support of roughly three 
million Canadians in the last election.  I am not sure of the 
numbers but 25% of all Canadians supported us in the last 
election.  I think every one of them would be proud of our 
immigration policy.  It is something we should all be proud of 
and I do take pride in it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now get a little more specific.  There are 28 areas of 
the bill that I believe require careful scrutiny by the 
committee.  Now 28 is a large number, and every one of them is 
important, but I have only targeted the ones that I feel are 
important.  As my time allows, I will quickly go through and 
point out the areas that must be carefully scrutinized by the 
committee.  The committee must also have expert witnesses come in 
to present their views.  This information will be valuable to 
make the legislation better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the objective section of the bill, which is at the very 
beginning, says, in general terms, that what the immigration act 
is based on is new.  That is one of the things that is new about 
the legislation.  It is important that it is carefully discussed and 
scrutinized by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the aspects of the new bill concern some very specific 
areas while other areas are very general and cover many different 
clauses of the bill.  I wanted people to understand that as they 
are listening to these comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I will deal with charter considerations.  Clause 33(d), 
without much doubt, seems to be offering Canadian charter 
protection to non-citizens.  No other country in the world does 
that.  People who are not Canadian citizens and who do not even 
live in our country would be granted protection under our 
charter. How could a country do that?  That protection is in the 
bill and it needs to be carefully scrutinized and changed as 
required.  I encourage the committee to look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third very broad aspect of the legislation deals with what is 
actually in the legislation and what is left to regulation.  A 
regulation can be changed by a minister or by department 
officials who tell the minister to change it.  It can also be 
changed through order in council at any time without ever passing 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation is very general and leaves far too 
much to regulation.  There would be a void of accountability 
resulting from the legislation.  That will become very obvious as 
I move ahead in my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth general area is the federal-provincial agreements and 
the consultations with the provinces.  The agreements are 
referred to in the bill but there are no assurances that the 
provinces will have to go along with what the federal government 
proposes and what is put forth in regulation.  The government 
only says that it will listen to the provinces on these issues. 
It will not necessarily demand the approval of the provinces.  I 
think that is a concern.  When we have an issue such as this, 
which has such a profound and direct impact on each province, the 
provinces should have a real say in what is in the immigration 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth point is the whole area of economic immigration which 
is the backbone of our immigration system.  The independent 
categories of immigration consist of people who can very quickly 
add to our economy and make our country a stronger and better 
place to live.  It is the guiding principle in the selection 
process that I will refer to first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it of great concern that the single most important and a 
valuable component of Canadian immigration, the economic 
category, is only dealt with by a single sentence in the bill. It 
is hard to believe that there is only one sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single sentence in clause 12(1) would be the guiding 
principle on which countless regulations would be developed.  The 
law in fact would be created through regulation.  It is not in 
the bill.  This is a real concern to me.  How can we hold 
departmental officials, the minister and the cabinet accountable 
if there is no assurance that changes will be made by passing 
them through parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully understand and accept that certain aspects of any 
legislation have to be left to regulation, but the balance in 
this legislation is way out of line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth area deals with the attempts made to streamline the 
immigration process.  I have listened to new immigrants from one 
end of the country to the other, particularly from the greater 
Toronto area.  Half of all immigrants settle in the greater 
Toronto area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually set up a task force there over the past few years and 
had input from hundreds of new immigrants.  Having listened to 
them, I found there was a recurring theme.  People said that immigrating 
to Canada takes a painfully long time; the system does not work 
well; it is bureaucratic; and the people they deal with just do 
not seem to care.  These were common sentiments.  I am sure every 
member has heard these sentiments from people they have met or 
helped who had gone through the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not address in any way the effectiveness of the 
immigration department.  It places no legislative requirement for 
setting or meeting stated immigration goals.  How do we know 
whether we are succeeding if we do not have the goals clearly 
laid out in the legislation?  It is not here and I think that 
certainly creates a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guiding principles on family class immigration is the seventh 
point.  The bill is excessively vague on who could be considered 
family.  Only clause 12 actually defines family.  The details are 
left to regulation through clause 14.  That is the fact of the 
bill.  As with the economic class, there are a few guiding 
principles regarding the family, which are laid out pretty much 
in one sentence in the legislation.  Subsequently everything else 
would be left to the interpretation of the bureaucrats, the 
minister and the cabinet of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Relying on regulation to guide Canada's immigration policy has 
failed thus far.  It has failed Canadians and the people applying 
to come to our country alike.  We must change the system so that 
we have clear principles laid out in the legislation which define 
the family, and I would encourage the committee to ensure that 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth point is family class immigration reunification.  It 
is important and goes along with defining a family and family 
reunification.  It is important to determine whether a situation 
is actually a case of family reunification.  If grandparents are 
brought to Canada, for example, when the majority of the family 
still lives in the country of origin or in another country, is it 
family reunification to bring the grandparents over to live with 
one child in Canada?  That question has to be examined very 
carefully.  It will be important for the committee to look at it 
and determine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ninth point is a more narrow one.  It is the issue of the 
common law spouse provision.  In keeping with the first draft of 
the bill, Bill C-23, and this is the third draft, the minister 
has included a provision to define a family member as a common 
law spouse.  This raises more questions than it answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the immigration department has a very difficult time 
verifying a legitimate marriage.  The department cannot deal with 
the huge problem of verifying whether a marriage is a marriage of 
convenience to accommodate immigration or whether it is a genuine 
marriage.  How on earth would we deal with that when we allow a 
common law marriage to be used under the bill?  It is an 
administrative impossibility and an administrative nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tenth point is the authorization to enter and remain in 
Canada, the dual intent as it is laid out in the bill or the in 
Canada landing class.  The legislation outlines a provision which 
would allow for that depending on the regulation.  We do not know 
how wide or narrow it might be.  It would allow a foreign 
national to enter Canada with the dual intent of visiting and 
then immigrating later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the same section of the bill would create an in 
Canada landing class.  This was taken out several years back 
because when it was in place it created a nightmare.  It is 
exactly the same as it was 15 or 20 years ago in the old 
Immigration Act.  The last major situation was created about 11 
years ago in 1990. 
This exact situation led to a mass amnesty for anyone who came 
into the country illegally by the immigration department.  These 
amnesties have not served us well.  We are letting everyone in 
those situations, no matter what their background and without 
scrutiny, come into the country.  This change would lead to the 
need for another amnesty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only dealt with 10 out of 23, but I know I will have a 
chance to deal with the legislation in the future.  I will close 
with a 30 second comment which has to do with the suitability of 
the current immigration minister to remain as minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She made comments about three million or more Canadians who 
supported the Canadian Alliance.  She referred to Canadian 
Alliance members as racists, bigots and Holocaust deniers.  I 
question whether that person has any right to remain as a 
minister of the crown, particularly the minister of immigration. 
I want her fired.  I expect nothing less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a question for the hon. 
member.  In his speech he mentioned immigration based on economic 
requirements.  I believe those were his words.  Years ago his 
former leader raised that issue and it caused a lot of concern 
throughout the country about what it basically meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member clarify again exactly what it means when 
he stands and says that immigration should be based on either 
economic levels or economic requirements?  I just wanted to give 
him the chance to clarify.  Is he saying, and I do not think he 
is, that we should base immigration levels on our economic 
requirements or a wider parameter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member 
asking this question.  It gives me a chance to clarify a large 
misunderstanding that I left in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about having a system which targets people who can 
add very quickly to our system and to our economy.  This is one 
of the stated goals of the current immigration system.  It is a 
stated goal in the new bill.  There is nothing there to indicate 
that anything would be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answering the question I refer to the ninth recommendation of 
the immigration task force report.  The information came from 
people who came to Canada over the last 20 or 30 years and some 
who came in the last year or less.  They are the people who have 
dealt with the system in a way that leads them to understand what 
some of the problems are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They put forth a specific recommendation which I think would be 
of huge benefit.  I see nothing innovative in the legislation 
that reflects what these people put forth.  They described the 
following common problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration consultants, be they lawyers or non-lawyer 
consultants, go to Pakistan or India, two major countries from 
which we accept immigrants, and put on a seminar for maybe 300 or 
400 people.  They tell people that Canada is a great country, 
which is true, and they also say some things that are not quite 
as true.  They say, for example, that engineers in Pakistan or in 
India can just come over to Canada and immediately become 
engineers.  That is simply not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget as long as I live an experience I had. Three 
or four people told me that if they could find the consultant who 
told them that, they would do serious damage to the individual 
because it had made their lives hell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would improve the system if people coming to Canada knew what 
they were coming to.  They should understand the workplace in 
Canada and what is expected there.  The task force recommended 
that as part of the immigration act there should be a requirement 
that people immigrating to Canada in economic categories, not as 
refugees, which is another issue, be tested on their knowledge of 
the Canadian workplace. 
I suggest this would save a lot of heartache and would actually 
increase the economic benefits that we receive from immigrants. 
This is one of the recommendations that would have a huge impact. 
We would not have people coming here expecting to be engineers 
and finding out that they have to work at Future Shop and, in 
many cases, never becoming engineers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us who have made a point of talking to cab drivers in 
Ottawa and in the greater Toronto area have heard a lot of 
stories about people who came to Canada expecting to take a top 
end job but ended up driving cabs.  There is nothing wrong with 
driving a cab but when one expects to be an engineer or in 
another profession and one is forced to drive a cab to make a 
living, it is very painful.  It often tears the family apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once people have immigrated to Canada or to any other country, 
there is no going home.  They have cut their ties and often have 
sold their properties.  They have told the people around them, 
their family and friends, that what they have is not good enough 
and that they want better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ensure that people have a clear understanding and can 
accept what they are coming to then I think we will have a much 
better immigration system and one which will lead to maximum 
economic benefits for the country, but we need to make that one 
change.  There are many other innovative changes that could have 
been made but none are in the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend my hon. colleague for his comments and the 
passion with which he addressed the question.  It was excellent. 
He has obviously done some very serious study of the bill. He has 
28 or 30 different items that should be addressed by the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understanding that he has such a complete knowledge and an 
intimate recognition of what is involved in the legislation, I 
wonder if he could address three issues.  He has touched on all 
of them but I do not think he has gone far enough and I would 
like to give him the opportunity to expand further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues has to do with the abuse of the system by 
people who immigrate to Canada.  Another issue has to do with the 
abuse of the loopholes in the legislation by people in our 
embassies, in foreign countries or perhaps in Canada who are 
abusing the consulting services they provide and the good faith 
people place in them.  They are supposed to have superior 
knowledge and they sort of mislead people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final issue, which really gets to the heart of the issue, is 
the question of where the accountability is in the legislation 
when the minister of immigration can make the kinds of statements 
that were made in the last election campaign.  I would like the 
member to address those three issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member is too kind in 
his comments but, believe me, I always appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of accountability, when the minister referred to the 
three or four million people who supported the Canadian Alliance 
as racists, bigots and Holocaust deniers, she lost her 
credibility, and it is clear that she should not be in this 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the system, the auditor general made some 
interesting comments less than a year ago in his report on the 
immigration system.  He made a lot of statements that were 
profound, but I will quote from one.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, we are very concerned about the Department's 
ability to ensure compliance with legislative requirements in 
this area. We noted serious deficiencies in the way it applies 
admissibility criteria related to health, criminality and 
security. It is somewhat disappointing to note the limited 
progress it has made since our 1990 Report. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general made almost an identical report in many 
areas back in 1990 and he noted in his 2000 report that many of 
the same problems are still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability is not there in legislation, it is not there 
in practice and it is not there in the way the department 
administers it.  It is one my biggest concerns. 
Even if it were a good piece of legislation, if the 
administration does not improve and if the accountability does 
not improve then our immigration system will not be any better. 
That answers the first question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of abuse of the system, it was interesting to hear an 
NDP member refer earlier to the roughly 6,000 people who came 
from China by boat the summer before last.  She said they were 
economic refugees, that they had come here to better their 
situation.  If they wanted to come as economic immigrants they 
should have come through our immigration system, but she seemed 
to think it was fine that they came claiming to be refugees when 
they clearly were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN convention definition of a refugee says clearly that 
someone coming to improve his or her economic situation is not a 
refugee.  I was shocked to hear the member's statement. If a 
person comes here claiming to be a refugee he or she should be a 
refugee as laid out in the UN convention.  Canada has expanded 
that quite broadly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people did not fall under any definition and the member 
seemed to think that was fine.  I have a huge problem with that. 
I call that abuse of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the third question on the loopholes in our foreign offices 
and so on, there was a document leaked to me about a year ago 
when I was immigration critic that made it very clear that there 
were many problems in our foreign offices that have to be dealt 
with, and the auditor general agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will begin my speech at the point where my 
colleague from Lakeland left off, and that is the comments made 
by the immigration minister during the election.  I do not think 
they are worth repeating, but I think it is worth repeating that 
the minister has done the House, the level of political discourse 
and herself a disservice.  I hope that not only members on this 
side disavow themselves of such comments but that government 
members would say publicly the things they are saying in private 
about their colleague's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to work for approximately two years on the 
citizenship and immigration committee.  It was a very rewarding 
experience.  We did a lot of things together, had a lot of heated 
debates and challenges about different things.  Madam Speaker was 
a part of those debates for some of that period of time.  My 
colleague from Lakeland was our immigration critic for a great 
deal of that time and brought a lot of salient points to the 
table in discussing immigration matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus on the bill and some of the shortcomings I have 
noticed in my examination of it, some of which will be expanded 
upon by my colleagues and some of which have already been noted 
in debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are some things in the bill with which we do 
agree.  I give credit where credit is due. There are very few 
things in any piece of legislation  on which we would have 
wholehearted agreement among all members in the House.  In 
looking at clause 3 in the overall objectives of the bill, we 
support immigration and the purposes that are set out in terms of 
enhancing our country and allowing individuals to come from other 
countries.  Canada is built upon the framework and foundation of 
people coming from other countries and other jurisdictions to 
make their homes here.  We acknowledge that and we want to 
continue in that vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do notice there are some shortcomings in the bill.  We are 
hoping that the minister would acknowledge those shortcomings in 
committee.  Those of us who have been around the House for a 
great deal of time are somewhat disheartened when we know from 
past experience that the suggestions we bring forward have been 
dismissed out of hand.  In some ways we are a little discouraged 
that the positive changes being presented by members of the 
Alliance, by other members and perhaps even by members of the 
government might simply be dismissed.  That is a bad thing. 
Rather than look at things through a partisan lens, we should 
work together wherever we can in a non-partisan way to find 
solutions to problems that are obvious to all of us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has acknowledged in subclause 3(2)(a) of her bill 
that the act recognizes the refugee program is in the first 
instance about saving lives and offering protection to the 
displaced and persecuted.  We would agree with that.  We would 
submit to the minister and to members on the government side that 
so many individuals have misused the process within the 
immigration system that it desperately needs to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of refugees around the world are in need of our 
protection.  They are refugees and therefore do not need to go 
through any kind of process.  The government needs to recognize 
that individuals in refugee camps are already refugees due to 
something that has happened in their home nation and would 
therefore be candidates for protection in Canada.  I do not see 
that acknowledged in the legislation.  There needs to be a proper 
screening process in place.  We have been calling for that for a 
long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee a couple of years ago I raised the idea of 
eliminating the tax on refugees when they came to Canada.  It is 
referred to as the right of landing fee.  An interesting process 
occurred with respect to the idea I brought forward.  We had a 
debate in committee on the idea.  It was generally supported by 
committee members on both sides of the House until it came time 
for the recorded vote.  It was like somebody had taken a hatchet 
and driven it directly into members of the committee on the 
government side, severing the good working relationship some of 
us had for up to two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden accusations and disparaging remarks were being 
made toward me and my colleagues for bringing the motion forward 
to which they had agreed previously in committee and privately 
announced their support for the elimination of the head tax for 
refugees.  However government members came in and voted the 
motion down by a vote of eight to seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an awakening process for me to learn that is how things 
work around here.  A good idea, if it is proposed by members of 
the opposition or even by a government backbencher, will be 
trounced and never see the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost a year later the minister made the same change.  I am 
thankful she did.  That is why I suggested it in committee and 
brought it forward.  I watched the government vote it down and 
then watched the minister implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must get beyond that kind of working relationship in this 
place if we are to do the people's business.  We need to get past 
the idea that a good idea cannot come from the opposition side 
or, in the minds of opposition members, that a good idea cannot 
come from the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It rarely does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  We need to find ways to work together. 
My colleague says “It rarely does”.  In many ways that is true 
because we have had many years of dysfunctional relationship in 
terms of how we do business around here.  That needs to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance is the advocate of that change.  The Alliance is 
the advocate of positive change in all areas including how we 
govern ourselves in relation to this bill and other bills, and 
how we change the way we do business in parliament.  We invite 
others to join us along that journey because we are committed to 
it and will continue to work hard for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada are telling us it is time for change.  It 
is time for a change in the way the business of the nation is 
done.  Canadians want to see that reflected in the House of 
Commons, the place where 301 representatives are sent to debate 
pieces of legislation and to make the rules and guidelines that 
will be set in place not only for now but for our future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very serious difficulties with the bill.  Another 
problem I see with it is one of the principles it is built upon: 
voluntary compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's bill is framed within the philosophy that we will 
set a framework in place and encourage people to comply with it. 
If they do not comply with it there are some outs for people that 
are not good for the safety of our country or the well-being of 
those who come here to be new citizens.  There needs to be a look 
at the use of discretion within the Immigration Act and at which 
individuals and departments are able to use that discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about discretion in a case I know about personally 
regarding a man I met from Afghanistan who came to Canada.  His 
name is Sharif Karimzada.  The secretary of state has knowledge 
of the case as well.  The individual came here as a refugee. He 
was deemed to be part of a regime under subsection 19.1 of the 
old act.  There was no right of appeal for him to be able to 
explain his situation.  He was categorically put in that box and 
determined to be inadmissible to Canada regardless of anything he 
did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has attempted to address that in section 25 of the 
Immigration Act.  That is what I am reading between the lines.  I 
would like to find that out from her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be some discretion in terms of inadmissibility 
because this person demonstrates that the system is broken.  We 
allow people into the country who, we find out later, should not 
have been allowed in and we exclude others.  That is why we need 
to take a close look at the bill.  That is why the Alliance will 
point out options for the minister, hope that she implements them 
and will continue to be the voice for change not only with this 
bill but throughout this parliament and for the future of our 
country.

bill until I had a chance to look at the estimates for this 
department that just came out today.  It is quite interesting 
that a department with as many problems as this one has had in 
the past few years has $61 million less in its budget this year 
than last year.  What really scares me is the section that talks 
about managing access to Canada.  I will read that section: 
<UL>

travel by combating illegal migration, including trafficking in 
people, while facilitating the movement of legitimate travellers;

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the government have taken heat in the last few 
days for a mobster who got into Canada and whom we did not find 
out about for months and months.  Now we have him in a jail and we are 
looking after his welfare and his dental programs and all the 
other things the average Canadian cannot afford.  He got into the 
country improperly, obviously.  We should have caught him at the 
border.  He is one of the most wanted people in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the number one Chinese criminal in the world sitting in 
a jail in Vancouver. 
He was living here for quite a while and taking the airplane 
regularly down to Windsor to play in the casino and gamble his 
money away.  He is the number one crook in all of China.  Seven 
of his buddies were executed just the other day.  We know he will 
never leave this country because we now have a law that says we 
will not deport anybody who will be put to death.  There is not 
much question that he will not last 24 hours if he goes back to 
China, nor probably should he based on what he has done there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have an 11 year old girl, somebody's daughter, smuggled 
across the border in British Columbia with two men and a woman 
who we knew were crooks.  The police knew who they were.  What do 
we have in the budget?  We have $61 million for defence, but that 
is not the important part.  The important part is going to the 
managing access to Canada section of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the budget was $171,953,000.  This year it is 
$142,187,000, just about $30 million less for a program that is 
already a failure.  We will have lots of time over the next 
little while to look at the estimates to see where the government 
is spending more money but in a country that has a serious 
problem with people getting into it illegally, the government is 
spending $30 million less next year on a program that could 
prevent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side and on the other side have sat on an 
immigration committee that said we should have scanners at 
different places around the world.  Immigration critics on this 
side have been saying that since 1993.  We even got the Liberals, 
the NDP and the Bloc to agree a few years ago that we should have 
scanners in some countries.  I think, Madam Speaker, you might 
have been on that committee when we were looking at the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ran a program in Malaysia at one point with scanners and RCMP 
and immigration officers.  It stopped many people from coming in. 
We saved millions of dollars because we stopped people at the 
source instead of waiting until they got to Canada and giving 
them all these rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute scandal to hear the story about that 11 year 
old girl.  Prostitution is the most terrible thing that could 
happen to any of our children.  That young girl and those three 
crooks should have been stopped at the border where she should 
have been taken aside and handed to the proper authorities to 
make sure she did not get into that life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chinese Mafia hit man who was in Vancouver would never have 
got into the country if we had proper checks and balances.  The 
hit man in Quebec City that the minister is getting into so much 
trouble over would not have got into Canada if we had a proper 
system of checks and balances in that area.  What is the 
government's solution?  It wants to cut $30 million out of the 
program.  Canadians will be outraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not usually help that minister too much with anything but 
we will try to help her now to get some money back in her 
department and get the program fixed.  Canadians should not have 
to put up with this program.  They should not have to put up with 
crooks and criminals coming into the country on a daily basis. 
Canadians are sick and tired of it.  When they hear the news 
today they will be outraged, and so they should be.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK64">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 21 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-5, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, although I have addressed the House on a few occasions 
and have asked some questions, this is the first opportunity I 
feel I have had to recognize the results of the November 
election: the support and confidence that was placed in me by the 
constituents of Windsor—St. Clair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge their support and all of the work my supporters 
did for me, the canvassing and phone calling.  It is difficult to 
put that into words.  There are certain specific groups I would 
like to acknowledge as well.  I will start with my family, my 
wife of 31 years and my three children who were very active in my 
campaign and have been strong supporters of mine both in this 
past election and in the two previous times that I ran.  I 
acknowledge that publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of other groups were of particular support to me.  The 
labour movement in the city of Windsor is very strong and a great 
deal of those members came out and supported me, both on election 
day and in the campaign leading up to the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another group I specifically want to mention. I 
promised that I would give it credit as one of the significant 
groups that made the difference in the outcome in my winning or 
losing since the results were very close in my riding.  That 
group is the citizens who at one time worked in the United States 
but then came back to live in Canada in their retirement years. 
They were faced with a significant change in the tax regime put 
in place by the government.  They feel very keenly about this 
travesty of justice and intend to pursue it.  I will also pursue 
it on their behalf until that travesty of justice is remedied.  I 
wish to acknowledge those people who supported me throughout the 
campaign and voted for me on election day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak to Bill C-5, which in common parlance has 
become known as the endangered species legislation.  This is not 
the first time the legislation has been before the House.  In 
fact the original bill was put before the House in 1994.  The 
government in both its red books and throne speeches has 
constantly promised the legislation.  Here we are seven years 
down the road, in fact eight years from the time it was first 
elected, and we still do not have the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This procrastination and inaction unfortunately is all too 
typical of the government's record on the environment.  It is not 
a good record whatsoever.  We have not seen any new environmental 
legislation since 1993.  There have been some amendments but no 
dramatic changes in the regime governing and protecting our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have absolutely no legislation right now that in any 
meaningful way protects our endangered species.  That is 
interesting.  If we look at the polling the government has done, 
there is extremely strong support in Canada for legislation to 
protect our endangered specifies.  A recent poll conducted by 
Pollara, which was commissioned by the federal government, found 
that 94% of Canadians in all regions support federal endangered 
species legislation.  More important, one should note that 74% of 
people living in rural communities support mandatory, not 
discretionary, habitat protection legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that we have broadly based support from 
environmental groups, labour unions, scientists and industry 
spokespeople calling for strong and effective endangered species 
legislation, we still have none as of right now.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us in the form of Bill C-5 is basically, with 
minor changes, the same bill that was before the last parliament 
as Bill C-33.  Interestingly both Bill C-5 and Bill C-33 are 
substantially weaker than Bill C-65 which was introduced by the 
government back in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on good, solid scientific evidence at the present time we 
have 354 endangered species.  It is a stark reminder that our 
natural heritage is under threat.  The rate at which species 
disappear is historically at an all time high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worldwide we are experiencing more extinctions of natural 
species at any time in our history since the disappearance of 
dinosaurs.  The current extinction rate is over 10,000 times the 
natural rate.  To put it another way, historically an average of 
two to three species per year became extinct due to natural 
causes. Currently this year and in the previous few years about 
two to three species disappear every hour, all because of human 
causes. At the present rate scientists are telling us that we 
could lose 25% of the earth's species in the next 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at Canada.  We have our own problems.  In the 
past 150 years 27 species have become extinct.  Let us compare 
that to the figure I gave earlier.  At present 354 endangered 
species or at risk of extinction are on our list.  The list is 
growing every year.  An additional 40 species have been added in 
the last two years, since 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country we have been waiting for almost a decade for the 
legislation.  In 1992 at the earth summit, Canada committed to 
establishing legislation that was specifically aimed at 
protecting our vulnerable species.  Canada was one of the first 
signatories to that accord.  Yet here we are in 2001 and we are 
still reviewing the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the bill before the House is fundamentally weak. 
Let me turn to one of the major weaknesses of the legislation. We 
were promised by the Liberal Party and by the government that the 
legislation would protect the species at risk.  What we have now 
is not a shall bill, that is we shall protect, but a maybe bill, 
that is we may protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains rampant discretion in favour of the minister 
and the cabinet.  All that it requires the government to do is to 
consult and report.  It does not require it to protect when push 
comes to shove even one species.  They could take these 
consultations from the scientific community, from the rest of the 
country, and could ignore them. Given their history, that is 
likely what they will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 is much weaker than the legislation of our partners in 
the United States and even in Mexico.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back again to some of the public surveys on what the 
country is prepared to accept in the legislation.  Most Canadians 
have told us that they are prepared to accept economic 
consequences in order to protect our natural species.  Eight out 
of ten Canadians advocated placing restrictions on industries 
that pose a threat to endangered species and they are willing to 
accept the limitation of activities, such as forestry, mining and 
even tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress for a moment and talk about my own region.  In 
the riding beside mine we have the smallest national park.  About 
10 years ago it became obvious that we had to limit the number of 
people allowed into that park.  We had to cut the number in half 
because of the danger it posed to some of the fauna in the park. 
The public accepted that.  There was an educational process and 
the general community understood the risk the park was at and 
they accepted the fact that they would have to curtail their 
activities in the park and the number of times they could go 
there.  It was not easy for them to do but they did accept it.  I 
suggest that is true for the rest of the country.  We are 
prepared to take those losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go to the three points that I wish to cover in terms 
of the weakness of the legislation.  The first and foremost 
weakness is the lack of habitat protection.  It is estimated that 
humans are responsible for almost all the species extinctions 
that occur, but that within that framework habitat loss is 
responsible for over 80% of the species' decline in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this legislation is passed it will not protect habitat at 
all.  I will compare that situation to the United States and 
Mexico.  In both cases they have passed legislation that not only 
protects the species but also protects their habitat.  Our 
legislation is simply proposing to make that protection 
discretionary in the hands of the minister and the government. If 
species are deemed worthy of protection then we should be 
protecting them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, every 
MP in the House knows or should know how often people walk into a 
member's constituency office and ask for assistance on 
immigration matters.  It happens every day.  It is part of an 
MP's job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riding offices in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver easily receive 
2,000 to 3,000 requests per year.  It is a well known fact that 
constituency offices of ministers of the crown receive even more 
requests than ordinary MPs, often from neighbouring ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also well known that inquiries with a MP's constituency 
office on the status of an immigrant file are processed as a 
routine matter and hardly ever brought to the attention of the 
MP, who is usually busy in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore most unfortunate that some opposition members' 
lack of familiarity with this aspect of a MP's regular 
constituency function has led to a smear campaign against the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services who, as we all

years of unfair subsidies from the United States and Europe have 
placed Canada's agricultural sector at a severe economic

once flourishing industry is failing fast.

Canada's last agricultural tractor facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Versatile Tractors was taken over by John Buhler, 350 
workers have been laid off and the remaining 250 employees have 
been on a bitter strike over basic job security issues.  Worse 
than that, Buhler now threatens to relocate the plant to Fargo, 
North Dakota, taking with it a $32 million loan from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government allow a company to assume such a loan 
without requiring repayment if the company leaves the country? 
Are we to stand idly by and allow $32 million of Canadian 
taxpayer money to create jobs for Americans in Fargo, North 
Dakota? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call it economic treason to abandon Canadian workers in this 
way.  I demand that the government recall the loan before John 
Buhler steps across the border to Fargo, North Dakota, and save 
those jobs at Versatile Tractors for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

he probably does not realize it so rather than go into the 
details I would be delighted if he would speak to the government 
of Alberta and ask it if it is prepared to treat natural 
resources in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland differently than in 
Alberta.  I would appreciate it very much if he would speak to 
the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and indeed the 
province of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and ask them 
if they are prepared to do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very open regarding this but it requires provincial 
consensus.  I can tell the member that consensus does not exist 
and did not exist when he was the provincial treasurer of 
Alberta. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

Minister of Industry who, when he was premier of Newfoundland, 
wanted the discussion opened on this.  That is who he should be 
talking to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the minister asked these other provinces individually if 
they are willing to have a discussion about economic hope and 
opportunity for Atlantic Canada?   He may be surprised with the 
response.  Has he done that, will he do that or has he decided on 
his own that the future economic hope of Atlantic Canada will 
just be based on the whim of federal Liberals? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yes, I have done that with the other provinces.  Again, 
as the hon. member knows from his previous incarnation as 
treasurer of Alberta, I did it at a federal-provincial finance 
ministers meeting when he was there.  He knows I have done it and 
I am certainly open to doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

want to reopen discussions?  Is that what he is saying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hear clearly today what the result was when he asked each 
and every one of the provinces, as he has said he did.  Which 
provinces said no to discussions, absolutely ruled them out, and 
which ones said yes?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

requires, and indeed the other regions of the country that have 
sought it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have discussed this with the provinces over a number of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

Mr. Speaker, in fact it was extraordinary; that is for sure.  On

quotas.  I recognize there are many people could be disappointed 
when quotas are assigned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last week the minister for multiculturalism tried to 
justify a Correctional Service Canada job advertisement that 
accepted applications from Indians only.  Other races were not 
even eligible to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an advertisement here from the human resources 
development department that also uses discriminatory policies 
which exclude certain races. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister say to people who are denied the right to

<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

about racism.  They talk about reverse discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe special measures are necessary.  It is not about 
reverse discrimination.  It is about reversing discrimination. We 
want to ensure that all Canadians can see themselves in the

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the minister does not understand 
that it is not possible to discriminate in favour of someone on 
the basis of race without discriminating against someone else on 
the basis of his or her race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the ad right here.  It specifically says that people who 
are aboriginal are excluded, as are non-Caucasian people or 
people who are non-white.

does the minister say to qualified Indians who were denied the

the program was to help the needy with a cheque of $125”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election the NDP leader told Canadians that people 
earning more than $60,000 a year were rich.  As an MP, I earn 
more than $60,000.  To my great surprise, this weekend when I 
went back to my constituency a cheque from the finance minister 
was sitting in my mailbox for the home heating fuel rebate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister admit to the House that his program of

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is that over 99% of the cheques which have gone 
out have gone to the needy and to those who actually need it.  We 
said there would be flaws.  I did not realize the flaw would be 
quite this big. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason I can give for the hon. member having received a 
cheque is that it was given to him before he was a member of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam,

crediting home heating rebates but not handing out flawed cheques 
like this finance minister.  There are better ways to do this. 
The finance minister is ignoring the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inefficiency in this is astonishing.  The cheque sent to me 
is dated January 31, 2001, more than two months after I was 
elected to the House of Commons.  This kind of inefficiency 
drives Canadians insane because it is totally unjust.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. As discussed at the parliamentary leaders' 
meeting, I would like to request the unanimous consent of this 
House to move the following motion: 
<A NAME="LINK214">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-209, 
An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (Public

the Standing Committee on Finance as opposed to the 
Standing Committee on Transport and Government Operations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>An error occurred when the bill was added to the order paper,

it.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK216">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from Febuary 26 consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
intention in the three minutes that I have to prove the 
odiousness of the situation this government is forcing upon us in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has just forced us into something unacceptable, closure on 
closure.  Here we are debating a motion whose aim is essentially 
to reduce the role of the opposition in this House and to prevent 
us from tabling amendments to bills under consideration, as we 
have done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so, after three hours of debate on this important issue—the 
amendment of the standing orders, a change in the balance of the 
parliamentary powers of the two sides of this House—the 
government invokes closure.  Three hours of debate on a matter of 
such importance, a change to the standing orders, and the 
government decides we have talked too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How else should we understand this approach other than to assume that 
the government is now on a very slippery slope?  Not only are we 
seeing the government's arrogance following the election, an 
election no one could justify holding in any case, in a sort of 
mandate the government has drawn for itself from the public to 
support all of its initiatives, not only have we had over the 
past few days meaningless responses during oral question period, 
but now we do not even have any ministers present in the House 
to answer questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only one minute left, but how can I say in the space of 
one minute how awful a situation the government has put us in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to debate any more.  It is refusing 
to debate with the opposition.  It sees itself as the calm centre 
of truth.  It refuses to remove its blinders to see what the 
people we represent want.  It has decided to impose closure in 
the most awful way possible, that is, by forcing us to play a 
partisan role and rule on the merits of the amendments we put 
forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite you, Mr. Speaker, to turn your attention first 
and foremost to the 200 amendments the government itself has put 
forward in respect of its own bill on young offenders.  Perhaps 
you will find some of them useless. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am glad to be able to finally get a few words in edgewise on 
this particular motion, although I understand the passion of the 
hon. member for Elk Island when it comes to these things and the 
fact that he had at his disposal what I have never had in the 
House, that is, the temptation of unlimited time.  He used it 
well in going after the government for the perfidy of this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly struck myself by the way in which the 
government House leader attempted to use, or misuse shall we say, 
the McGrath committee report of 1985 to justify what he was doing 
yesterday when he moved Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who do not know what we are debating 
and do not know what we just imposed closure on, and because I 
actually had some Liberal members ask me prior to the vote what 
it was they were voting on, let me just say that this is a motion 
that would enable the Speaker to select amendments which would 
come to a vote at report stage rather than having, as is the 
practice that has developed, all the amendments that are 
submitted by members put to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2, which would have the effect of eliminating the 
strategy used both by the Bloc and the Reform in the last 
parliament, is a motion which comes forward by itself without any 
other parliamentary reform and is a measure that is designed to 
address only the government's concerns in this regard.  It is one 
of the reasons why I find it so offensive.  It is not 
parliamentary reform when only the concerns of the government are 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 would correct a problem that the government sees as 
a problem, and a problem that I think we all see as a problem. 
However, the problem is that this is not the only problem and it 
cannot be solved all by itself without creating a whole lot of 
other problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just quote from the McGrath committee.  The government 
House leader referenced the fact that I am the only surviving 
member in the House of that special committee on reform of the 
House of Commons, the only one left on the parliamentary reform 
island.  It says this on page 38 of the McGrath report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the report stage is not used constructively. The 
report stage was introduced into the legislative process as part 
of the procedural reforms implemented in 1968.  One of the 
results of those reforms was the reference of the majority of 
bills to standing committees following second reading.  The 
report stage was designed to provide opportunities to members not 
involved in the committee stage of a bill to propose amendments 
when the committee reported the bill back to the House.  Thus, an 
MP that was not a member of the committee dealing with the bill 
would not be deprived of the right to propose amendments.  It was 
also designed to enable the government to introduce last-minute 
technical amendments.  It was not envisioned, however, that the 
report stage should provide a means of reopening the entire 
committee proceedings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far so good.  I would say the government and the opposition 
are literally and metaphorically on the same page here when it 
comes to report stage, but then the committee report goes on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of using the report stage as an obstructive 
tactic— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something which the government objects to and has now 
moved to address as a result of the report stage becoming an even 
more obstructive tactic than it was when the McGrath committee 
reported, because when the McGrath committee reported we had not 
had the experience of hundreds and hundreds, or indeed thousands, 
of amendments being moved.  Rather, we had only experienced 
report stage with perhaps 150 to 200 amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the report: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—has developed because of the frustration of the opposition 
parties with the manner in which controversial bills are 
frequently dealt with at the committee stage.  The report stage 
has become, in the words of one member, a vehicle for vengeance, 
a method of retaliation against what is seen as a stubborn 
refusal by government to make any concessions to opposition views 
when amendments are proposed in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations we propose regarding the report stage should 
be seen in the overall context of reform of the legislative 
process. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the key words:  the recommendations we propose.  They 
went on to propose something like what the government House 
leader has put before the House, saying that the recommendations 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>should be seen in the overall context of reform of the 
legislative process. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we have here is one recommendation, isolated from 
the overall legislative context the McGrath committee talked 
about, and proposed as a measure adequate in and of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument today with the government is that this is totally 
out of keeping with the recommendations of the McGrath report, 
because what was the overall context of reform of the legislative 
process that we find in this report and in the context of which 
the McGrath committee said it would be okay for the Speaker to 
resume the power of selecting amendments for voting at report 
stage?  The context was part of an overall package of 
parliamentary reform in which the committee process, particularly 
that process having to do with dealing with legislation, was to 
be de-partisanized as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, legislation would not go to standing committees at all. 
Legislation would go to special legislative committees which were 
to be chaired by chairpersons who were selected from a panel of 
chairpersons selected from all parties.  We actually tried that 
for a while.  That system was in place here for a number of years 
and a number of opposition members developed good reputations as 
good and fair chairs of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was that context of sending legislation off to committees 
that would be chaired in some cases by opposition members, but in 
all cases by people selected because of their known reputation 
for fairness.  That is why they were selected to be chairs of 
these special legislative committees, instead of having been 
selected as standing committee chairs often are now, that is, 
because of their loyalty to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These would be committees on which we would not have 
parliamentary secretaries acting as coaches to the government 
members, telling them what to do and playing the role of thought 
police and reporting back to the minister in case anyone had an 
independent thought.  These were to be entirely different sorts 
of committees.  They were to be committees that were seen as a 
departure from the very kind of system we now have and which we 
returned to at a certain point in the eighties as a result of the 
fact that the Mulroney government got tired of parliamentary 
reform and took back some of the reforms that it had been willing 
to try in the early years of its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current prime minister suffers no such idealism, either 
early or late in his mandate.  He is not even willing to give 
things a try.  What we have here is an attempt by the government 
House leader to do exactly the wrong thing when it comes to 
parliamentary reform, to address only those things that are of 
concern to the government and to dress it up as if it is a 
concern of all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is a concern of all parliamentarians that we should 
be reduced to the spectacle of voting throughout 24 hours or 48 
hours.  I do not think any of us felt good about that, either 
physically or in terms of how we thought the Canadian public 
viewed that particular exercise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it remains the case that this does arise out of 
legitimate frustration on the part of the opposition, even though 
I did not agree with the Reform Party's position on Nisga'a and I 
did not agree with the Bloc Quebecois when it came to Bill C-20, 
the clarity bill.  That is beside the point as far as I am 
concerned.  The fact is that the government was not willing to 
permit the kind of debate that both these parties thought was 
appropriate to the significance of those particular issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that when it came to Bill C-20, the clarity bill, the 
way in which the government conducted itself on that particular 
issue was particularly abhorrent.  We not only suffered closure 
here in the House, but we suffered closure in committee.  We were 
given only a couple of weeks to consider a tremendously 
significant piece of legislation with respect to how our country 
might some day be negotiated away, God forbid.  Yet this was all 
supposed to happen within a very short time framework.  Witnesses 
who should have been heard were not.  Members of committee from 
the government side were openly lamenting the fact that they 
could not do their job properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in response to all this that from time to time the 
opposition decides it is going to use whatever procedural 
loopholes exist to wreak a certain kind of parliamentary and 
political vengeance on the government.  It is not that effective. 
It is not something that yielded the Bloc a whole lot more votes 
in Quebec, as far as I can make out, in the election on November 
27.  Nor did it did lead to a breakthrough on the part of the 
reform-alliance party.  These things do not have any great 
political virtue in the big picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, here we are talking about parliamentary reform.  We are 
talking about parliamentary culture.  It is wrong for the 
government to insist that only its problems, only its 
frustrations with the current set-up, are the ones that must 
receive immediate attention.  I am disappointed that the 
government House leader did not try to craft even a small 
package.  It would not have had to cover the whole gamut of 
parliamentary reform and all the things that we could properly be 
considering if we were trying to put together the package on 
parliamentary reform.  However, it could have addressed some of 
the concerns members of the opposition have, for instance, with 
respect to time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the dying days of the last parliament there were discussions 
about creating some kind of mechanism whereby if the government 
wanted to move time allocation on a particular motion, at least 
the minister responsible for that piece of legislation would be 
answerable to the House for a couple of hours as to why it was so 
important that this legislation had to go through right away. 
That might have been one thing the government could have done. 
There are others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we find is that in some respects not much has 
changed, because I am using the language of the McGrath committee 
of 16 years ago all over again.  Significant legislation is not 
dealt with properly in the House.  In fact, there seems to be a 
kind of inverse relationship.  The more significant the 
legislation is, the less properly it is dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If legislation dealing with dog licences were in our 
jurisdiction, we would take all kinds of time with that.  The 
legislation would be given to a committee which would take its 
time, call witnesses, hear from dogs, whatever.  The committee 
would travel around the country.  However, if it is something 
like the clarity bill or the Nisga'a agreement or the Canada 
pension plan reform, and the list goes on, if we have two days of 
debate, wow.  Imagine two days of debate in parliament.  We would 
have two days of debate on something significant, but four days 
of debate on something insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the record of the government.  The more significant it 
is, the more the government wants to whisk it off, get it off the 
floor of the House of Commons, get it into committee and turn it 
over to the trained seals.  The government will not be open and 
will not listen to amendments.  Then it will bring back the 
legislation and expect the opposition to be in a good mood when 
we get to report stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not in a good mood by the time we get to report stage, if 
we have had time allocation on second reading and if we have had 
a committee process that has been time allocated itself, as it 
was with Bill C-20.  We are not in a good mood by the time we get 
to report stage and we should not be.  We have a right not to be 
because we do not feel that things have been dealt with properly. 
Sometimes we see the kind of tactics the government is moving now 
to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not against, in principle, the Chair having the power to 
select amendments.  I never have been.  I signed the McGrath 
report. I have cited other instances.  On other occasions I have 
argued that the Speaker should have this power.  I have also 
argued, Mr. Speaker, that you, the Chair, should have the power 
to do something about the abuses against parliament committed by 
the government, not just by the opposition.  The Chair should 
have the power to refuse time allocations, if that time 
allocation comes at a time when there has not been sufficient 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion had some balance to it, if it had given the 
Speaker discretion over government abuse, government tactics, 
government misuse of procedural loopholes, at the same time as it 
did the same for the opposition, then maybe members might have 
heard a different speech from me today.  Instead we have this 
lopsided thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This along with electronic voting is supposed to be 
parliamentary reform.  Close a major loophole for the opposition, 
bring in electronic voting as pursuant to what was promised in 
the throne speech and the government has its package.  I hope 
that is not all there is to it.  I have some feeling from the 
government House leader that that is not all there is to it. 
However, it would be hard to come to any other conclusion on the 
evidence at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the NDP is very much opposed to this particular 
motion and we hope others members of parliament are as well. 
Perhaps somewhere on the government side somebody will decide 
that he or she wants to make a speech in favour of balanced 
parliamentary reform instead of just defending this one-sided, 
unilateral, dictatorial, measure which has been introduced by the 
government House leader.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would very much like to attach my own remarks to 
those of the previous speaker, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, as a dean of the House and as a member of 
the McGrath committee which he referred to in his remarks.  He 
certainly has the moral authority to speak on this particular 
issue and does so with great insight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the government in the House is seeking to alter 
the standing orders of the House, and do so with an instrumental 
note to the House and to the Speaker, by banning what he calls 
repetitive and vexatious amendments at the report stage.  As was 
alluded to, this is but one approach and one attempt to deal with 
an issue that arose in the last parliament over flooding the 
order paper with amendments, amendments that the government House 
leader has chosen to describe as frivolous and vexatious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I reviewed the remarks of the hon. government 
House leader, I noted that in the text he referred to 
consultation.  We in the opposition have become somewhat 
accustomed, unfortunately, to token consultation, wherein we are 
advised after the fact that the government has taken a certain 
position on an issue and then receive a perfunctory phone call 
simply to inform us that this has happened.  This is the type of 
consultation that occurred in this particular instance.  This is 
why, as is certainly evident from the tone of most speakers on 
this side of the House, there has been particular offence taken 
to the manner in which the government has chosen to proceed on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are obviously other avenues the government could have 
pursued, not the least of which was real consultation.  I find it 
passing strange and the worst type of irony when we talk about 
the use of closure on this issue.  I point out with great 
emphasis that time allocation was brought in on the very first 
piece of legislation which came before the House upon the 
resumption of this the 37th parliament. 
That in and of itself puts a very clear shot over the bow of the 
opposition about the government's intentions on parliamentary 
reform, let alone co-operation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarks by the previous speaker on this issue as they 
pertain to the government's future goodwill is very much in 
jeopardy, particularly with respect to what remaining powers 
there are for members of opposition and members of the government 
side to express their concern, let alone their opposition to what 
the government has chosen to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly review what took place that led to the point 
where we are now at.  As a new member of the House of Commons, it 
certainly was not one of my proudest moments to stand here and 
vote repetitively for hours on end.  To draw the broader analogy, 
it is fair to say that it was not a proud moment for parliament 
at all.  However, it is what led to that point that is very much 
at the heart of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the sheer and utter frustration that members of the 
Chamber feel in their ability to not only express their concern 
and their opposition but to even interact with members of the 
government, particularly cabinet.  The government has chosen to 
go about this in a fashion that essentially cherry-picks from the 
Westminster tradition; that is to borrow a single example that 
suits its cause.  I am talking about the specific motion that is 
before us which is very much borrowed from the British tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reviewing it in its broader context, it ignores, and the 
government House leader certainly ignores, the fact that there 
are other powers that exist in the parliament of Great Britain 
that allow the Speaker of the House to deny the government's use 
of closure or a motion for time allocation.  Similarly, the 
Speaker has within his powers the ability to order cabinet 
ministers to come before the parliament, to be accountable not 
only to the House and the members but also to the country.  We 
have rarely, if ever, seen that particular exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, what we have become accustomed to is important government 
announcements being made across the street in the press gallery. 
We hear about them again after the fact.  Yet the press and the 
Canadian people wonder aloud why it is that parliament's role is 
being diminished and its relevance questioned.  It is very much 
attributable to the actions of this administration, the 
government, by choking and cutting off the ability of the 
opposition to question what it does.  Even members in its own 
party do not have the ability to question its policy decisions 
and its legislative initiatives.  The government has cut that 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of being repetitive, we saw in the Speech from the 
Throne the government's vague reference to modernizing parliament 
through the use of electronic voting.  We know the result of 
that.  There will be less interaction with government, less 
direct accountability and certainly less direct democracy.  There 
will be no ability to give and take on the floor of the House. 
Further evidence of modernization is to take away one of the last 
remaining instruments that the opposition had to hold up the 
government and at least slow down its rapid move to bring in new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will interrupt my own remarks to indicate that I will be 
splitting my time with the right hon. member for Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practices of government are extremely bizarre when looked at 
in terms of the encodified manner in which it has presented the 
motion.  The government is unable to put this motion before the 
House in both official languages.  It is not possible for a 
committee of this House to draft a report and have it brought 
back to the floor of the House of Commons to declare what this 
House wants to do and what the rules will be when it is borrowed 
from the Westminster practice.  As we know, those particular 
rules of practice are not available in both official languages to 
this Chamber. 
It also troubles us greatly to think that the government appears 
to be foisting upon the Parliament of Canada unstated and foreign 
guidelines that come from another chamber.  That is to say, are 
we to take our direction from Great Britain now, as in the past?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly ironic that the oldest parliamentary democracy 
in the free world will dictate how we modernize our particular 
rules of procedure.  This is something surely, as a sovereign 
country, we should be pursuing on our own.  Does the Minister of 
Justice rely upon the criminal code of Ireland?  Does the 
Minister of National Defence look favourably upon other countries 
to decide upon his own? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that the government did have other options 
available to it.  It could have pursued this in a different 
fashion.  It chose not to.  The minister in bringing forward the 
motion speaks for cabinet.  Did the cabinet agree to surrender 
our entire independence on this?  If it did, it should resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter that should be decided by all members of the 
House, not the executive branch alone.  To suggest otherwise, 
runs contrary to the basic tenets of democracy.  To suggest that 
the cabinet alone decides how this place should function is 
offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a problem.  The House leader has a problem. 
The House itself has a problem.  If there is to be a repetition 
of the destruction of our report stage process, as this motion 
could potentially do, we have to deal with it in unity.  We have 
to deal with it collectively.  This is not the solution, to bring 
it in and to impose closure.  It is certainly not the language 
that the House should understand or tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has already given its Speaker full power to select the 
amendments at report stage.  That power currently exists. 
Restating it is a way to skirt around the real issue.  If there 
is any doubt that this is the accepted way to alter the 
jurisprudence and preserve our national self-respect, then we 
should be engaging in a far more involved process than that which 
we have seen.  The House can do better than say that we just do 
it because Great Britain does it.  We need a made in Canada 
solution.  The standing committee should get on with the work 
necessary to bring that about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest again that the reason behind this has very much to do 
with the government's desire to avoid any kind of delay in the 
reintroduction of the youth criminal justice bill.  It is doing 
this because it feels that it might be embarrassed again by not 
being able to introduce one of its top ten priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn the floor over to my hon. colleague, the right hon. 
member for Calgary Centre, to conclude our remarks and our 
position on the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to express my appreciation to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for sharing his time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about a made in Canada solution.  This should also be 
a made in parliament solution and it is not.  It is one that is 
made by the government and imposed upon the House of Commons. 
That is not the way we will achieve change in this institution 
that bears the stamp of legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking part in the debate because there is an extraordinary 
opportunity now for us in the House to make changes that will 
make this a much more effective parliament.  It requires some 
leadership on the part of the government.  Unfortunately, these 
early actions indicate that it is not prepared to undertake the 
kinds of changes that are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader characterizes this as a single, very 
confined issue.  It is not.  It is part of a pattern of driving 
democracy out of the House of Commons and of turning this 
parliament and, I regret to say, turning the Speaker into a 
simple servant of the government.  It reverses the whole history 
and the whole idea of parliament.  It reduces the accountability 
of the government.  More seriously perhaps, it reduces the 
independence of the Speaker of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that some means must be found to ensure that 
parliament can act.  However, there is also no doubt that the 
opposition must be able to delay actions which it thinks is 
wrong.  That is what parliament is about.  There ought to be 
limits on the power of government.  That is why we established 
the rules of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the tactics of the Alliance Party on the Nisga'a bill 
and the tactics of the Bloc Quebecois on the clarity bill have 
caused legitimate concern on the part of the government.  They do 
to all parliamentarians.  It is not the first time these issues 
have arisen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the Speaker was never asked for a ruling 
on the correctness of the tactics that were followed.  I suspect 
that the government was fearful of an unfavourable ruling by the 
Speaker and therefore remained silent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is no risk of an unfavourable ruling by the Speaker 
because the government, by this motion, is telling the Speaker 
what it is that he is supposed to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of discussing the issue as a whole parliament, as we 
should be, the government is moving now to instruct the Speaker 
not to accept amendments that the government considers to be 
frivolous.  It does that, just so it is clear, without the 
support of any other party in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When parliaments change their rules, the problem is to ensure 
that the changes are perceived as legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The traditional way of reaching a consensus is through 
committees made up of representatives from all parties. This is 
definitely not what happened here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a change imposed by closure. There was no consultation, 
no attempt to arrive at an agreement. The result is that the 
House now finds itself with a rule that will not be perceived as 
legitimate, for decades to come. This change to the Standing 
Orders of the House of Commons is all the more difficult to 
accept because it concerns directions given to the Speaker of the 
House, in spite of the objections raised by minority parties 
here, and because it imposes restrictions on these minority 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no longer anything to prevent the Prime Minister's 
office from asking the Liberals to muzzle the bothersome House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has just elected its Speaker, a Speaker in whom we 
have put all our hopes that he would honour this House. But the 
first thing that the Prime Minister of Canada does is to tell the 
Speaker how to perform his duties. The Prime Minister's action 
grossly undermines the authority of the Speaker of the House of 
Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are better solutions than rule changes by closure.  The 
Chair could be asked for a ruling or rulings on the basis of 
existing procedure.  If necessary, a committee could be asked to 
devise new guidelines written for the House and known to the 
membership of the House.  Members who are not part of the 
leadership struggle and not part of the everyday battles in the 
House could be asked, as parliament has asked them before, to 
address the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these options have been examined, nor was there an 
attempt to find a solution by consensus.  Instead, change is 
imposed by closure on the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, the government is cherry-picking U.K. 
procedures.  I, by the way, find it very ironic that a government 
that made such a to-do about repatriating the constitution should 
now be down on its knees bowing and genuflecting to the house at 
Westminster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we not an independent nation able to establish our own 
rules?  The government in the U.K., in its rules, is much more 
balanced than this government is proposing to be here.  What the 
government is doing is choosing U.K. rules that suppress members 
of parliament without having any of the counterbalances, such as 
the power of the speaker in the United Kingdom to refuse a motion 
for closure or time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fairly certain that a British speaker would have refused 
to put the present closure motion on a change to the rules after 
just two hours of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speaker in the U.K. also has the opportunity to insist that 
ministers attend the house and make statements there and not run 
off to the press gallery.  The speaker can extend or restrict 
debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the rules of the house of commons in Britain, if we 
want to look at the whole picture rather than simply cherry-pick 
the rules that limit the powers of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most serious about this is the government's attack on 
the Speaker.  By adopting this course of action, it is giving the 
impression that the Speaker is to be a tool of the government. 
It treats the Speaker as though he is still a backbench Liberal 
member of parliament.  It tells the Speaker what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be realistic.  It is not the whole House that is denying 
the Speaker's right to exercise his own judgment, it is the 
cabinet that is issuing the order and using its power of 
discipline and fear to bring its backbench members into line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was, Mr. Speaker, as you would know, to the great regret 
of all of us, an infamous speaker in the House 40 years ago, René 
Beaudoin, during the pipeline debate. 
He lost the confidence of the opposition and of the Canadian 
public because he seemed to be taking direction from the 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion raises the risk that every subsequent Speaker of the 
House could become a René Beaudoin.  It creates the possibility 
that every subsequent Speaker of the House could become a simple 
servant of the government of the day instead of a servant and 
defender of the whole House of Commons.  It corrodes the 
impartiality which is at the heart of the authority and the 
legitimacy of the Speaker of the House of Commons.  It makes the 
House of Commons of Canada a simple subcommittee of the Liberal 
Party of Canada.  That is simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government asks us in this motion to accept its definition of 
what is frivolous.  This request is from a government whose 
definition of propriety allows the Prime Minister to lobby a 
crown corporation to give money to one of his friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The St. Laurent government, let me make the point, could have 
dismissed as frivolous the objections that led to the historic 
pipeline debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trudeau government could have dismissed as frivolous the 
amendments that ultimately forced its patriation package to the 
Supreme Court of Canada where the Supreme Court judged that the 
package broke the constitutional conventions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mulroney government could have dismissed as frivolous the 
amendments to the Patent Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government could dismiss as frivolous amendments 
that would make the ethics counsellor report to the whole House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's definition of frivolous will naturally differ 
from that of the opposition.  Who should decide in an unfettered 
way in a case like this?  The Speaker of the House of Commons 
should decide, using the Speaker's discretion and the Speaker's 
judgment, but that will no longer be possible after this rule is 
changed by closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weakens the whole House of Commons.  It weakens the 
parliamentary system.  It is a step backwards and it should be 
opposed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil (Beauharnois—Salaberry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of the debate on this motion is very specific, and that 
is what we must look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After everything that has been heard in the House recently, I 
think we have reached the point where the record really needs to 
be set straight.  We must really dot the <I>i</I>'s and cross the <I>t</I>'s,<I> 
</I>because the impression is being given that the House, at some 
point, is being used by certain people not to improve the work 
of MPs in the House or in parliamentary committees, but to 
prevent debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I interpret this as the result of the fact that certain people 
often talk just to hear themselves speak, but no attempt is made 
to let others say how they think a bill could be improved. These 
people take advantage of a loophole in the Standing Orders to 
block debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the House should allow all members to express their 
views in order to improve a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem right now is that members keep accusing the 
government of wanting to gag the House, but there is no doubt 
in my mind that the House is run not by the government but by a 
Speaker elected by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government House leader, the leader of the 
government party and the leader of the MPs who are in the 
majority in this House, speaks on behalf of his members, as the 
leaders of all opposition parties in this House speak for 
theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the leader of the Liberal majority in this House rises and 
tables a motion, he does so on behalf of all members and not on 
behalf of the government, as there is a tendency to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When ministers are in this House, they are answerable to the 
House.  They are across the way from the members of the 
opposition, who can question them.  It is not, however, the 
ministers of the government who run this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House is, in fact, independent.  It is run by a Speaker 
elected by all members of this House.  There is, however, a 
standing order which establishes the framework of intervention

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves: Is the House leader of the majority 
bringing in a motion to amend the Standing Orders of the House 
of Commons?  No sooner asked than answered, and the answer is 
no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion is not to amend the Standing Orders of 
the House of Commons.  It is to enable the Speaker to use the 
power vested in him, specifically to make a choice of 
motions, which has not been done for some time, a number of years, 
nearly thirty in fact, in the name of tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are debating today has a purpose. It is not to 
contest, not to speak of closure and not to say that the House 
leader of the party with the majority wants to amend the 
standing orders.  There is a reason this motion was introduced. 
The role of an MP is to take part in a debate, to improve a 
bill.  We have established a procedure in the House and in all 
legislative assemblies in the provinces and the different 
governments for the very purpose of enabling members to 
intervene, to debate a bill or a motion tabled in a House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure is as follows.  A bill is introduced, sent to a 
committee, a standing committee or the appropriate committee 
considers the bills clause by clause, motions are made and then 
a vote is taken in committee. 
When the bill is brought back to the House at report stage, we 
should not try to do what is indirectly impossible, because the 
amendments are to be moved in committee.  The amendments 
rejected in committee must not be introduced in the House as 
well at report stage.  In other words, we cannot do indirectly 
what we are not entitled to do directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is when the Speaker can intervene to choose to permit or 
reject motions, to group motions.  When we see, because the House 
has been around for a number of decades, what is being done today 
with the legislation on young offenders, for instance, we get to 
the point where we say “Enough, already”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the 3,133 motions in amendment that were 
brought in, 400 of which, namely Motions Nos. 2,646 to 3,029, 
were aimed at changing the date of the coming into effect of the 
act. These motions were moved by 44 MPs. At some point, given my 
age and my experience, I tell myself that I do not want to spend 
my time, and that is not what I was sent to this place to do, voting 
all night long, night after night, on trivialities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the motions moved by former MP Jean-Paul 
Marchand, Motions Nos. 2,657 and 2,658, proposing different 
dates for the coming into effect of the same provision of the 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an abuse of time. I could go on. There are about 100 
motions on the duration of a provision of the act. That is how 
things went during that whole debate. When we reach report stage 
and motions are brought in that have already been rejected in 
committee, someone must put his foot down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when the Speaker must use the discretionary power that 
was vested in him upon the recommendation of a committee which 
reviewed the Standing Orders of the House of Commons back in 
1968. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then—there had probably not been any abuse at that 
time—things have slipped. The sole purpose of today's motion 
is to reconfirm the power of the Speaker of the House to select 
the motions that will be debated at report stage. What we are 
asking today is that the Speaker proceed as he was expected to 
when the current parliamentary procedure was adopted, some 32 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion is not to gag the opposition or to 
change the rules of the House. 
It only seeks to support the application, by the Speaker, of a 
custom, a tradition or at least an amendment to the rules 
intended at the time to allow the Speaker to keep things under 
control, to prevent debates from getting out of hand and to 
avoid having motions dealing only with punctuation symbols such 
as commas, semicolons, exclamation marks, question marks and 
periods.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what this motion is all about. In addition, motions must 
seek to improve the bill or to amend it to make it easier to 
implement, and not merely to interfere with procedure. For these 
reasons, I will support the motion of the government House 
leader.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to explain some of the problems with the 
particular motion.  It is interesting that the government 
suggests that the Speaker would not select for debate a motion or 
series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or vexatious nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seldom can one suggest in the House of Commons that an amendment 
or motion is not repetitive, frivolous or vexatious in nature. 
Much of what is said in the House of Commons is repetitive for a 
reason, that 301 members have a right to choose what they talk 
about.  It is my right to talk about the same thing as any one of 
my colleagues here.  It is the right of any one of my colleagues, 
regardless of party, to table an amendment that is similar to any 
amendment I table.  After all, that is what they were elected 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government once again is showing that it wants to manage the 
affairs of the nation from the Liberal Party's point of view and 
not from any other party's point of view.  I would be surprised 
if government members in the House, and backbenchers in 
particular, are even willing to go along with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about making changes to reform parliament. 
It suggests that this is maybe one of those reforms because the 
House of Commons in England does something similar.  The 
government does not have its act right on parliamentary reform. 
It cannot pick and choose a cafeteria style selection of what 
would be in its favour and deem it to be parliamentary reform. 
That is just not the way it is done.  It has to look at 
parliament as a whole and select all the things that need change, 
not just some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Dewdney—Alouette.  We should understand that we have made many 
attempts in the House to bring about parliamentary change.  We 
have asked, for instance, about questions and comments after 
speeches. Rather than somebody standing and taking five to seven 
minutes to pose a question, why could it not be done like 
question period?  Why could the allocations not be made like 
that?  What is wrong with looking at that?  The government says 
it is not necessarily in its favour so it will not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should allocate total speaking time in the House of 
Commons based on the number of seats of each party.  The 
government says it has not done that before.  Why do we not have 
sanctions or penalties for those who leak reports from 
committees?  The government says it has not thought about that. 
It is a problem but it does not want to do that.  Why do we not 
have all committee business in public rather than hidden behind 
closed doors?  The government says maybe we should talk about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the chairs of committees should be allocated on the size 
of the parties involved in the House of Commons rather than the 
awkward approach of having a majority of Liberal members on the 
committees.  Of course they select their own chairs so committees 
are biased at the very least.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members say that it might negatively affect them as 
the government but that they will bring it in anyway because it 
is something that is done in England.  They say that the Speaker 
should not select for debate a motion or series of motions of a 
repetitive, frivolous or vexatious nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked why we did not have people on committees for longer 
assignment periods.  The government responded that it had not 
done that before.  We said that maybe the committees should be 
televised so they would be open to the public.  It said that even 
though the house of commons in London and other areas like the 
United States do that, it did not know if that could be done 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about papers and reports coming from committees?   Maybe 
they should be debated in the House of Commons.  The Liberals 
say that they do not want to do that because it may bother them a 
bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the parliamentary calendar?  Perhaps we should change 
that.  Everyone knows that Friday is a useless day in this place, 
but we are not supposed to say that.  The government does not 
want to make a change there.  However, it says that it does one 
little change, it does not want this frivolous nature stuff that 
may modernize the House of Commons.  It says that it will make 
that change today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about making all private members' motions and bills 
votable?  If it is good enough to come to the House of Commons 
for debate then why is it not votable?  It is in other 
jurisdictions, like the British house of commons.  Why do we not 
bring that in here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason these things are not brought to the House of Commons 
as changes is that it does not suit the government members.  It 
does not allow them to commandeer the issues and to control 
debate.  It does not work to be in the House of Commons and come 
from a region like mine and want changes in here unless one is a 
part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants something changed it can do it and it 
can say that it is doing it because it wants parliamentary 
reform. That is hogwash.  The government does not want 
parliamentary reform at all.  It wants what is good for 
government.  That is what it is looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that all we are trying to do with our 
amendments is to hold up debate time because the time will be 
spent voting.  That too is hogwash.  Voting time is done after 
debate time.  What this does is allow probably one of the best 
uses we could make of our time.  Rather than voting time, 
standing for hour after hour, we would have debate time.  However 
we cannot have debate time in the House of Commons any longer 
than the government sees fit or it calls time allocation, which 
shortens debate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons is largely dysfunctional.  It is still way 
back in the 1950s and 1960s on some of these issues.  The 
government is even whining about televised committees.  It is 
whining about electronic voting that is all over the world.  It 
says that with electronic voting, which means pushing a button, 
the whip will not be able to see who is voting for them and who 
is voting against them in their own caucus.  That is hogwash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reconfirms in my mind that the government has no 
initiative and no desire whatsoever to reform parliament.  This 
is all about government control in a House of Commons that is 
very largely dysfunctional and will not change until the 
government changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is disappointing that we are having this debate 
today, so early into the new parliament.  We are talking about a 
closure motion.  We are talking about the government using its 
majority to change the standing orders so that it might have more 
power, more control over the way debate occurs in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell a quick story as a member of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. The Alliance, with 
colleagues from other parties, suggested that we try having a 
secret ballot vote for committee chairmanships in this 
parliament.  It is a fairly minor step toward changing the tone 
and inserting a bit of democracy into the committee structure 
where we spend so much time doing parliamentary work. The 
government voted that motion down and said that it could not 
proceed in this piecemeal approach, that it would not be right, 
and that we need to look at a parliamentary reform package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no parliamentary reform package coming from the 
government side.  It is using the argument it used to defeat our 
motion.  It is proceeding in a piecemeal fashion today with this 
motion and it is truly disappointing.  It shows the government's 
arrogance.  It uses its large majority to stifle what it does not 
like to get what it wants, and that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is one that should be defeated by members. 
Unfortunately I do not think it will be.  Over the last eight 
years the government has used its majority to reduce the 
opposition's role in debate and stifle debate on dissension in 
its own ranks among caucus members.  It has everything to do with 
consolidating power and more power for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is supposed to be the keepers of this place, the 
ones who would move forward in a way that would protect democracy 
and establish the framework for rules of debate in the House, not 
only for now but for the future.  Yet the government is going 
down the opposite road.  It is forgetting the lessons it learned 
in opposition when it spoke about such moves by a majority 
government.  It is forgetting that one day it will no longer be 
the government, some day in the future, hopefully sooner rather 
than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>l guarantee government members will look back on this day of 
debate and ask what they did.  They took away an opportunity for 
opposition members to raise legitimate concerns and in effect 
they will be railing against the motion one day.  It is 
unfortunate that they are not moving in a non-partisan way to 
make the House a better place, a place where debate is meaningful 
and individuals can bring forward ideas and suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government backbenchers will be severely limited in the 
amendments they can bring forward to their own legislation. There 
are few tools available right now for government backbenchers. 
This is one more that is being removed from them in their ability 
to table amendments to government legislation. I expected 
government members would be bringing forward this point in debate 
today and not supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs meeting 
today the member for Mississauga Centre, a respected member who 
does good work in the House, said that there should be a review 
of the entire workings of the House of Commons.  She said that it 
was time for parliamentary reform.  I agree with her, as do other 
members on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forward some positive proposals.  I know my 
colleague from Langley—Abbotsford worked long and hard for many 
years on the topic of parliamentary reform.  It is something we 
are continuing to work on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our House leader brought forward these proposals, the 
government's response was that they were half-baked and not even 
worth considering.  What does that say about the government's 
real intention when it comes to parliamentary reform?  Its 
actions speak louder than its words.  The government's actions 
here today show that it is not interested in and not concerned 
about structuring a framework that would make this place work 
better so we could work together on issues we agree on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we will disagree on some things, but there must be a way 
for us to signal to Canadians that we will move forward in a way 
which demonstrates we are more concerned about what happens in 
the country and in the framework we put in place for our citizens 
than we are about our own political careers.  We want to 
structure the framework for today and for tomorrow in Canada and 
we have that opportunity.  I believe Canadians are telling us 
that it is time for us to move on parliamentary reform.  Much to 
our disappointment, the government's reluctance in this matter 
demonstrates to Canadians that it has no will to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance have put forward 12 concrete 
proposals in our “Building Trust” document, some of which I 
would like to highlight briefly and some of which have been 
mentioned by my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one would be to allow more free votes in the House of 
Commons.  We have put in place this motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House shall not consider the vote on any motion to be a 
question of confidence in the government unless the motion is 
directly related to the government's budget or the motion is 
explicitly worded as a question of confidence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could put that in place.  It is a concrete proposal that we 
are suggesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one is one which we have brought forward.  We 
borrowed some phraseology from the Liberal red book having to do 
with the ethics counsellor.  We brought that motion forward and 
it was defeated by the government.  It was part of our proposals 
for parliamentary reform that the ethics counsellor report 
directly to the House.  We know what happened.  The Liberals 
voted down their own red book promise on that particular item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third item is to create a new standing committee on privacy, 
access and ethics: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To facilitate the work of the House and to increase the 
accountability process of government, an additional standing 
committee should be created and chaired by the opposition, whose 
mandate would be to review and report to the House on all aspect 
of the Acts and Reports of the Privacy and Access Commissioners 
and Ethics Counsellor. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something we could do.  We could put that in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth item is the introduction of candidates for the 
election of the Speaker.  The rules should be amended to allow 
and require candidates to speak in an open forum before the 
election of the Speaker begins.  That is something that actually 
did happen this time, but not as a convention of the House or as 
a change to the standing orders, which is what needs to happen. 
My colleague from Langley—Abbotsford was instrumental in putting 
that process in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth point in our plan is the appointment of the Clerk of 
the House through a non-partisan committee.  That appointment 
would be ratified and approved by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth point in our plan is in regard to the appointment of 
officers of parliament.  We think the standing orders should be 
changed to require the government to subject all candidates under 
consideration for these high offices to a committee review.  The 
committee would also be free to recommend candidates of its own. 
As is the practice now, the ultimate decision would be made by 
the House and would be decided by the adoption of a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh point deals with the election of standing committee 
officers by secret ballot.  As I mentioned, this was brought 
forward and voted down already.  It is disappointing because this 
is a concrete proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth proposal in our plan is for less government control 
over standing committees.  This would allow for a more 
independent standing committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ninth point deals with order in council appointments.  We 
believe that a committee should have the authority to cause a 
vote to take place in the House ratifying or removing an 
appointment made by the government.  A committee report 
recommending the removal of an appointment would cause the 
appointment to be withdrawn unless the government responded by 
introducing a motion reinstating the appointee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tenth point is one which we are discussing today and that is 
time allocation and closure.  We are actually discussing closure 
and we think there need to be changes in that process, one of 
which would be to allow for a question period prior to a minister 
moving closure or time allocation.  We think that is fair.  The 
Speaker should only allow time allocation motions to be put 
forward if he or she is satisfied that the motion does not 
infringe on the rights of the minority.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my time is growing short, I will briefly mention the eleventh 
and twelfth points.  The eleventh point is about spending 
accountability.  We need to make sure we have accountability in 
the way the government spends money.  Lastly, we need to improve 
debate in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forward some concrete solutions in a concrete plan 
for change in this place.  We hope there is a will among 
government members to do this, government members who are afraid 
that their actions are speaking louder than their words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we will stand in this place and advocate for positive 
change time and again because we believe the will of the people 
in the country is for us to do so.  We will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
On such an important precedent setting motion such as this, is 
there no way under standing orders that I could get the Chair to 
acknowledge the lack of numbers of Liberals in the House when we 
are debating such an issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I will take a moment to 
think about this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that he cannot allude to the fact that 
some members are absent, therefore this is not a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before making my comments and observations, I would 
simply like to reread the motion, because we have heard many 
things, particularly from members of the opposition parties. 
The motion introduced by the government House leader has been 
somewhat distorted.  This motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage and, in 
exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be guided 
by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the United 
Kingdom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job today is to limit your role but to increase 
your responsibilities, but the amendment moved should also 
considerably speed up the work of the House and thus improve its 
effectiveness for the general well-being of the public, which we 
are all here to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a question of correcting a flaw in our parliamentary 
procedure which arose over the years in the course of daily 
practice, rather than through any rule.  We are all familiar 
with the practice of delaying as long as possible the passage of 
a bill which, for various reasons, does not meet with the 
approval of our own constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say our own constituents, I am speaking from the point 
of view of individual members and sometimes of a particular 
party. 
As I said, we are very familiar with this practice, the purpose 
of which is simply to delay passage of a bill as long as 
possible.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all honesty, we have to acknowledge that there are many among 
us, on both sides of the House, I have to say, who use this 
practice and not simply to abuse procedure.  We are not laying 
blame on anyone here.  Our actions in this House are all 
motivated by the mission we have been given: to serve our 
electors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the aims of a given political strategy, they are in 
accordance with the hopes of those who chose us to defend their 
interests to the best of our ability. 
Nevertheless, the end does not always justify the means, because 
in order to look after the interests of one, we sometimes, even 
often, neglect those of others.  We necessarily impinge on 
precious time that should belong to the House as a whole in 
order to administer the affairs of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, the major parliamentary reform of 1968 provided for 
this eventuality and gave the Chair the authority to strike it. 
However, your predecessors, Mr. Speaker, have tended bit by bit 
to give way to the expression of democracy to the point that, 
over the years, this trend has become a parliamentary tradition 
and the practice has taken root.  It is clear that in many cases 
it has been nothing more than an abuse of the practice.  I 
repeat: it is clear that in many cases it has been nothing more 
than an abuse of the practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the minister mentioned that the proposed amendment was 
not the result of a unilateral decision. After consulting with 
parliamentary leaders, we recognized the situation and the need 
to correct it. However, the way to correct it remains 
problematic. There were a number of options, but they did not 
allow for targeted solutions on other rules that had to be 
changed. Therefore, the minister simply chose to go back to the 
comprehensive reform of 1968, which offers the best solution in 
that it allows us to solve the problem without having to amend 
other rules that have proven their effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it is simply a matter of reaffirming the powers that the 
Chair already has, but that it no longer exercises to better 
protect freedom of expression. I really want to emphasize this 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition claims that, through this motion, the powers of 
the Chair will be restricted and even constricted. That is not 
so. In fact, the motion strengthens the powers and the authority 
of the Chair. This is at the core of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the standing orders, once a standing committee of the 
House has completed its review of a bill, a process that already 
includes amendments, the bill goes back to the House for what is 
called report stage. In other words, the standing committee 
submits a report on its review of the bill in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that when a bill is reviewed in committee, public 
consultations take place and any committee member can propose 
amendments or changes which, in his or her opinion, will improve 
the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This applies equally to a government bill and to a private 
member's bill that has succeeded in getting through the House for 
referral to a standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the appropriate time for members, particularly those who 
were not on the committee, to express their opinion on the bill 
and propose amendments they would like to see made, provided of 
course that they have given written notice of them.  The only 
exception to this rule is bills relating to supply or ways and 
means motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the reform in 1968, there have been a variety of 
amendments in the standing orders relating to the report stage, 
on the length of speeches in particular. However, if the original 
intent of this report stage was mainly to broaden the debate, it 
was not in any way intended as reconsideration of what has 
already been considered by the committee.  Yet that is exactly 
what is happening at present, and has been for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are well aware, the present strategy consists precisely in 
repeating in the House the arguments that have already been 
raised in committee, and that have already been the subject of 
discussion, exchanges of views, debates and comments in the 
committee.  It even happens that certain arguments are knowingly 
advanced before the standing committee responsible for 
considering the bill as a means of bringing them before the House 
as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last major procedural reform had taken that into account. 
The standing orders conferred upon the Chair the power to group 
together the amendments proposed in order to avoid repetition and 
also to judge the merits of the amendments and thus their 
admissibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practice, however, our Speaker's predecessors bowed to the 
benefit of the doubt and, gradually, out of concerns about 
limiting freedom of expression, they delegated their decision 
making power to the House as a whole, with the negative results 
we are today attempting to correct with this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This power comprises all the rights necessary for the solution 
we seek.  The Speaker therefore has the right to reject a motion 
the committee has already declared inadmissible, unless he 
personally believes that it merits attention. If he deems it 
appropriate he can call upon the motion's sponsor for sufficient 
explanations to facilitate his decision. 
He must retain only those amendments which, for a variety of 
reasons, could not be debated in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, to shorten debate, he may group together motions which 
concern the same topic or are in some way similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, two criteria come into play: the content of the 
proposed amendment, and where it fits in the bill.  It should be 
pointed out, however, that the Speaker is not required to voice 
an opinion on the purpose or substance of the proposed amendment, 
or even comment on whether it merits discussion.  His sole task 
is to decide whether or not the amendment is in order according 
to the rules of procedure on admissibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with this aspect of the rules of procedure, the 
British parliament has an imposing jurisprudence, built up over 
many long years of experience, which, I am sure, would serve as a 
very valuable guide to our Speaker.  The responsibility is heavy, 
however, I agree. It presupposes what are sometimes some very 
difficult situations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind the fundamental 
reason for the existence of this chamber:  to serve, to the best 
of our abilities, the public, which has put its trust in us to 
improve its living conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a question of a responsibility we must all assume for 
the collective good of society.  I think that this proposed 
amendment to our parliamentary procedure will make our job and 
the Speaker's easier and will enable us to exercise the 
responsibility falling to us with greater rigour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were we to do so, I think that the general effectiveness of this 
parliament would benefit and, ultimately, the esteem in which 
Canadian politicians are held. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many claims from members of opposition parties. 
One of them was that the amendment will actually restrict the 
ability of backbenchers and simple members of parliament to bring 
amendments to the legislation and that it will actually restrict 
the Speaker's authority.  The authority is already there.  What 
has happened is that through the years, from 1968 until quite 
recently, preceding speakers chose not to use that authority.  We 
are talking over 30 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would defy members of the opposition to name one court, 
whether it be judicial or administrative, where frivolous actions 
can be brought in and where the judge, whether a judicial judge 
or an administrative judge, does not have the authority to 
dismiss out of hand on the face of the evidence or the file, a 
frivolous or an abusive action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look at some of our commissions, for instance, 
both at the federal and at the provincial level, whether it be 
governance or civilian oversight of law enforcement agencies, 
where there is that authority.  It is a well established practice 
and concept that frivolous, abusive and repetitive actions have 
no place in proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is already part of your authority, Mr. Speaker.  This 
amendment simply re-establishes that it is within the Speaker's 
authority to deem motions, which been brought before the House 
and which are frivolous, abusive or vexatious, out of order.  In 
many cases, the sole objective of these motions is simply to 
delay the proceedings of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members on the opposite who claimed that this was 
somehow limiting democratic expression of members.  I fail to see 
how being forced to vote for hours on end on frivolous or in some 
cases vexatious motions, or changing a comma from here to there, 
allows me as a member of parliament to express the views of my 
constituents.  It does not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it actually limits the amount of time that I or any 
other member of the House have to actually debate issues.  It 
reduces the amount of time that the House has in order to deal 
with the substantive issues and to deal with them in a 
substantive way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to my point, this amendment does not 
in any way limit, constrain or lessen the powers of the Speaker 
of the House.  On the contrary, it reinforces his powers which, 
while already in existence, have been affected by a practice which 
has set in and prevented him, in a way, from exercising them and 
putting them into application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this amendment would provide not just the 
government but the House as a whole with more facility and more 
means for the democratic expression of the points of view of 
their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would, I believe, also give more time.  We are always 
hearing complaints about insufficient time for private members' 
business.  If we are not tied up, if our time is not taken up, 
with votes about changing a comma we get more time.  The sole 
objective of such motions, which often originate with the 
opposition and let us hide nothing here, is merely to hold up, 
to block, the legitimate work of the House, the legitimate 
work of the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to speak of the government, but there are 
members of parliament here. We too have work we want to get done, 
whether through bills or through motions.  Procedures and 
amendments which are, in my opinion and that of many others, 
frivolous or vexatious ought to be declared inadmissible.  The 
Speaker has the power.  This amendment reinforces that power. It 
hearkens back to the source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, therefore, I call upon all colleagues on both sides 
of the House to support this motion by the government.

<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for the chance to speak on the motion which seeks to reaffirm the 
traditional power of the Speaker to select motions for debate and 
reject those which are repetitive, frivolous and designed solely 
to delay report stage proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a particular honour for me since it touches on issues at 
the very heart of Canadian democracy, namely the dignity of 
parliamentary debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians believe in the country.  They are committed to its 
values of fairness and compassion.  They are dedicated to 
safeguarding those freedoms which are our birthright.  It is 
because of this that they hold institutions such as the debating 
procedures in parliament in great esteem.  They see them as 
living symbols of the values and freedoms we hold so dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing this, members of the House have traditionally sought 
to improve the debating procedure of the parliament in order to 
increase the dignity of the institution in the eyes of Canadians. 
That is, for instance, why we are involved in so many 
parliamentary co-operative institutions around the world to see 
how it is done in other places and how we might improve what we 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we have not always proved equal to the challenge. 
In recent years some believe there have been early and worrying 
signs that some Canadians do not always hold the institution of 
parliament in the high esteem they once did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some of this may be just a result of general suspicion in 
all institutions, some responsibility for this disillusionment 
may lie closer to home with us in the House.  For example— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member.  We have to deal with private members' business. 
Once we are done with this, the hon. member will have 18 minutes 
left for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of private members' business as listed on today's

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP)</B> moved that Bill 
C-213, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to begin 
the debate on my private member's bill to enfranchise 16 and 17 
year old Canadians.  As many members of the House will know, the 
bill was originally introduced in the last parliament by our 
former colleague, Nelson Riis, who represented the people of 
Kamloops, Fraser and Highland Valleys and the surrounding area 
very well for the last 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nelson Riis was an MP who was respected on all sides of the 
House for his insight, his strong grasp of the issues, his 
mastery of parliamentary procedures, his flair for the dramatic 
and, most of all, his unwavering commitment to serving both his 
own constituents and all Canadians.  His legacy of service to the 
country through his work in the House is one that few 
parliamentarians can ever hope to match. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have been able to pick up the bill introduced in 
the last parliament by Mr. Riis and lead off the debate today in 
the House of Commons.  I admit that when Nelson first talked 
about the bill and introduced it I was quite skeptical.  I 
wondered whether 16 year olds were mature enough to vote. 
Therefore I understand if members taking part in the debate today 
are also skeptical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After carefully looking into the matter and speaking with 
literally hundreds of young adults in my riding, I am convinced 
that enfranchising 16 and 17 year old Canadians would 
reinvigorate and strengthen democracy in Canada.  Right now 
Canadian democracy needs a shot in the arm.  Voter turnout in the 
last election was down to 58%.  That is the lowest in the modern 
era.  More than four out of ten Canadians stayed home rather than 
exercise their right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would enfranchising 16 and 17 year olds improve voter 
turnout?  Some people say it would actually lower voter turnout, 
which is already lowest among voters between the ages of 18 and 
25. That argument only scratches the surface of the issue.  If we 
look carefully at voting behaviour we see that exercising 
citizenship through voting, like many life values, is something 
most Canadians learn from their families at a young age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistically speaking, we are more likely to vote if our 
parents vote than if they do not.  People who vote do so because 
they value their rights and responsibilities as citizens in a 
democracy.  Values like this are most often learned in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with setting the voting age at 18 is that by the 
time young Canadians are old enough to vote, which may be 19 or 
20 depending on the electoral cycle, they have already left home. 
By that age most young adults have either gone away to pursue 
post-secondary education or, if they are fortunate, they have 
found a job and moved out.  We do not do this with most other 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most young adults get their first part time job while they still 
live at home.  When young adults get their first job it is 
usually their parents who teach them about important life values 
such as the work ethic.  Even if young adults do not get part 
time jobs, parents often teach them about the work ethic by 
making sure they do their homework or giving them chores to do 
around the house in exchange for an allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that most young adults learn their important life 
values before they leave home and begin living as independent 
adults.  Parents are most often the ones who teach about the work 
ethic, the sense of right and wrong, and even things like how to 
drive or fold clothes.  By the time young adults leave home we 
expect them to have all the tools they need to be able to live 
and function in society, with one exception: voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make sense that we expect young adults to learn 
other life skills and values at home but not voting.  We make 
them wait until an age when most have already left home before 
allowing them to exercise their right to vote.  No wonder there 
is such a drop off in voting among young people.  Even young 
adults whose parents do vote are less likely to vote than their 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest tragedy of all is that if people do not vote when 
they are young they probably never will. 
They do not magically become interested in politics when they 
turn 30.  Most remain non-voters their whole lives.  That is why 
we have had a steady downward trend in voter turnout for decades.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that all of us as parliamentarians should 
seek a way to improve it.  Canadian citizens do not appear to 
have faith in our system.  One of the major factors, quite 
frankly, is that they do not trust politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years back there was a study done.  The most trusted 
professionals were nurses.  The least trusted professionals were 
lawyers.  The second least trusted were politicians.  That should 
tell us there is a problem out there.  We as parliamentarians 
must work very hard to improve that image whether or not it is 
justified.  We must work and do whatever we can to restore 
people's faith in the democratic system.  Otherwise we risk 
losing democracy, something we as Canadians have valued for a 
hundred years plus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enfranchising 16 and 17 year olds would go a long way toward 
stopping the downward trend.  Most young adults would have their 
first opportunity to vote while they were still at home.  It 
would give families a chance to talk about politics.  Young 
adults would have a chance to learn from their parents about the 
values of citizenship and voting, just as they learned other life 
values from their parents.  Instilling such values would make 
young adults voters for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would encourage parents who at present do not vote to have 
an additional interest in it if their young adults are home with 
them and asking what is happening in an election.  It would 
encourage that kind of discussion in the home.  Maybe we could 
get some of those parents and older adults once again to be part 
of the electoral system.  Extending the franchise to 16 and 17 
year olds would also have positive side effects for parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With voter turnout in Canada down to 58%, many parents are 
obviously non-voters and therefore would not be teaching their 
sons and daughters the values of citizenship and voting.  Many 
young adults could still learn about voting by talking to other 
mentors like teachers, or even their friends at school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been increasingly surprised at the well informed 
discussions I hear from young adults in the schools in my riding. 
Seeing their sons and daughters become engaged in politics would, 
I truly believe, influence many parents who would otherwise not 
vote to get involved once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have addressed how enfranchising 16 and 17 year olds would 
help invigorate democracy.  That is the main positive outcome of 
the proposal.  I will now turn my attention to the main criticism 
of the idea, namely the view that 16 and 17 year olds are not 
mature enough to vote.  When I talk to older people about the 
issue that is the main criticism I hear.  In my experience 
nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I make a point of visiting schools 
throughout my riding.  I always make myself available to go in 
and talk to school classes or assemblies about the job of an MP 
and about the Canadian parliamentary system in general.  I work 
extremely hard within the school system to be non-partisan. There 
has been no criticism from teachers, parents, school trustees or 
anyone about it because it is a matter of getting young people 
involved in the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to many classes since I was first elected in 1997. 
Most of those young adults are no less intelligent or mature than 
18 or 19 year olds.  Very often the political discussions I have 
had with high school classes I visit are just as intense as the 
ones on the doorsteps, on the main streets or in the chambers of 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues we discuss may be different but they are no less 
important.  Many young adults are interested in issues with which 
we deal as members of parliament that affect them directly. Young 
adults have a vested interest in the skyrocketing cost of 
post-secondary education or in the economy as they look for their 
first jobs and think about their future careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are interested in what happens when they go into the 
workplace.  It may not be a safe workplace.  We hear year after 
year of the increase in the number of accidents and deaths of 
young people in the workplace.  It is crucial that they be 
allowed the opportunity to be part of the legislative process in 
laws that affect them and in health and safety regulations which 
affect them.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One recent accident in particular still sits in my mind. A 14 
year old construction worker in Alberta was killed on the job and 
charges have been laid against the employer.  I can tell the 
House that the 14 year old did not have an opportunity to be 
involved in the discussion of workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young adults have been affected very negatively by the Liberal 
government's cuts to colleges and universities, by cuts to 
employment insurance and by the overall mismanagement of the 
economy.  Every day the government makes decisions without the 
slightest consideration for young adults, even though many of 
them have jobs and contribute to society both as citizens and as 
taxpayers.  It is as though they do not exist until they turn 18, 
and that is not right.  They deserve to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that affects young adults directly is the Young 
Offenders Act.  Right now the government is talking about 
changing the Young Offenders Act to make it easier to put 16 year 
olds in adult court.  If parliamentarians and the government feel 
that 16 year olds should be treated like adults by the criminal 
justice system, then they should also be treated like adults in 
the electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by noting that I am glad the issue has 
finally made it to the floor of the House of Commons for debate. 
It is unfortunate that the bill was not deemed votable but at 
least we had the opportunity to debate the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changing the electoral system is not an easy thing to do.  A 
hundred years ago women did not have the right to vote in Canada. 
It took many years of persistent effort for women to win that 
right.  It took even longer for aboriginal people to win the 
right to vote.  They were not enfranchised until just 40 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few other democracies around the world have already 
enfranchised 16 and 17 year olds.  Most are newer developing 
democracies like Nicaragua and some of the former Yugoslav 
republics.  The newer democracies started off with a clean slate 
so it was easier for them to set the voting age at whatever 
seemed appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have more historical baggage.  People are used to 
the voting age being 18 and there is an understandable reluctance 
to change it.  I believe in the saying “If it ain't broke, don't 
fix it”, but the fact is that our electoral system is broken. It 
is obvious from the fact that 42% of Canadians do not vote any 
more.  We need to fix it, and enfranchising 16 and 17 year olds is 
one of the ways we can do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to have the opportunity to speak on the private member's 
initiative just described by the hon. member.  The bill would 
lower the federal voting age to 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a special pleasure since all of us in the House share 
the same commitment to making sure all Canadians can participate 
fully in our electoral system and express their views on issues 
of the day.  This is particularly true of our young people who 
are, after all, the very future of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, I want to commend the hon. member for her 
concern for Canadian young people and for her commitment to 
safeguarding their democratic rights, a commitment shared fully 
by the government and, I am sure, by every member in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess that there is something very appealing about the 
idea of expanding the franchise to allow more young people to 
vote.  As we all know, our youth care passionately about Canada 
and are committed to making it even better.  That is demonstrated 
by the number of young people who get involved in the political 
life of the country both during and between elections.  Like 
other members, I have been very impressed by their hard work, 
commitment and dedication to our great country, and I agree that 
we need to look at how we can involve young Canadians more in our 
political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the saying goes, the devil may be in the details. We 
need to take a closer look at this to see what problems there 
might be in lowering the voting age and whether or not it is the 
right time for such a move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the bill, while a leading 
initiative, does not open new ground.  Canadian parliamentarians 
have revisited this issue many times over the last two decades, 
and just recently, as the member mentioned, on a bill brought 
forward by a former parliamentarian, Mr. Riis.  For example, 
parliament lowered the minimum voting age to 18 in 1970. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the Lortie commission on electoral reform and party 
financing investigated at some length whether we should drop the 
minimum voting age to 16 or 17.  While it heard from a number of 
witnesses who presented strong cases for lowering the minimum 
voting age, it was also given equally compelling reasons for 
maintaining the status quo, such as the following: persons under 
the age of 18 were not considered adults for the purpose of 
criminal proceedings but were instead treated procedurally 
separately under the Young Offenders Act; minors required 
parental consent for many important decisions such as applying 
for citizenship, getting married and seeking some medical 
procedures; and all provinces had set the voting age at 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was desirable to look to harmonization of the voting ages in 
all jurisdictions.  Based on these findings, the commission 
decided not to recommend lowering the voting age but rather 
suggested that parliament might wish to revisit this issue from 
time to time.  That is what we are doing now.  If we do not make 
a move now, I am quite sure we will continue to study the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An all party committee studied the issue in June 1998 and 
recommended retaining the current minimum voting age.  There was 
also a re-examination of the issue last year as part of the 
parliamentary review of the Canada Elections Act, however cursory 
that may have been, which kept the voting age at 18.  Finally, 
lowering the voting age has been the subject of a number of 
private members' motions, all of which have up to now been 
rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarkable consistency of members in the House over time on 
this issue is not surprising, subject of course to the various 
initiatives such as the hon. member's bill at this time.  There 
are a number of good reasons for retaining the current minimum 
voting age for the time being.  To begin with, there is the 
experience of the vast majority of democratic societies around 
the world which have in most cases set 18 as their voting age and 
do not feel under pressure to change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian experience suggests that retaining 18 as the voting age 
makes sense as well, given the important role played by the age 
of majority in most areas of law.  For example, most provinces 
tie the voting age to the age of majority, the age of majority 
being a condition for all civil and legal activities and 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code relies under certain circumstances on the age 
of 18 by providing specific rules where persons under that age 
are involved.  Most social legislation takes into account the age 
of majority in terms of the granting of aid or social assistance. 
In most cases family allowances are paid for the support of young 
people up to age 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many economic statutes make reference to the age of majority, as 
well, particularly those relating to business corporations which 
require persons to be 18 before they can be elected to boards of 
directors.  Most legislation dealing with alcohol use is also 
tied in many but not all cases to the age of majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being the case it makes a great deal of sense to maintain 
for consistency 18 years of age as the age when our federal 
electoral law might permit one to vote.  This ensures 
harmonization and consistency across our very diverse country. 
Maintaining just one age of majority in all areas of law helps 
prevent overcategorization and segmentation of our civil rights 
by age and increases the certainty for Canadians on this issue as 
they move from one part of the country to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this is not to suggest that the minimum voting age as it 
is now is set in stone for all time and can never be changed. 
Rather, because Canada is so dynamic, our system of governance of 
electoral laws must also change from time to time to correspond 
to the needs of all its citizens as they may reflect changing 
social, economic and cultural realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should it become clear in the future by way of an emerging 
consensus that we need to reduce the minimum age due to changed 
circumstances, I for one would consider endorsing and supporting 
such an action.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do look for an emerging consensus.  It may be that members are 
on the edge of a wave here.  We do not know, but barring such 
clear evidence we must continue to rely on the recommendations 
and insights of the previous royal and parliamentary commissions 
which have told us that the time for lowering the age has not yet 
arrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I cannot support the bill, I nevertheless commend the hon. 
member for being the flag bearer for potentially a whole 
generation of young people, a rolling over, evolving generation 
of young people, all of whom are old enough to think, to reason, 
and to know right from wrong.  Most people will accept that 16 
year olds are capable of those things.  All members see that our 
education system has helped us greatly in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's commitment and the commitment of other members of 
the House as reflected in this and other debates will show that. 
I urge all hon. members to continue to work together, not only in 
this envelope but in all of the envelopes involving our election 
rights and responsibilities, to ensure that our electoral system 
continues to do the best job we can possibly do of enabling 
representation of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill 
C-213.  I compliment my friend from the NDP for putting it 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She addressed something that is extremely important, not only to 
the youth of the country but to adults:  why we as a nation are 
disengaged from the political process in appalling numbers.  We 
went through a federal election last November where we saw the 
lowest voter turnout in the last 60 years.  Less than 60% of 
Canadians voted in the federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that so?  Canadians are not only apathetic and 
disaffected but are utterly turned off by the political process 
in the House and in the country today for some very good reasons. 
The reason that is so is that we do not live in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a totalitarian regime.  The system is controlled by a 
Prime Minister and a small cabal of individuals who are 
unelected, unaccountable and invisible.  They tell members what 
to do, what to say and when to say it.  Lo and behold the member 
who goes against them.  It is a top down situation.  Members vote 
as they are told to do, not what their conscience or their 
constituents tell them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee structure is under tight government control and 
that is why they start pursuing efforts and initiatives that have 
very little to do with the large pressing problems of the nation 
today.  They deal with irrelevancies because committees and most 
of the House are designed to be a make work project for MPs, not 
to address the big problems that exist in the country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand why members vote this way, it is interesting to 
look at an unwritten code of conduct in the House which explains 
to Canadians why they see members voting clearly against their 
conscience, clearly against what they want to do and in violation 
of what is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes something like this:  do what the leadership tells them 
to do.  It is also known as the principle of blind loyalty.  If 
information comes to them from outside sources that is adverse to 
what the leadership says, they must be ignored at all cost, even 
if it goes against what the leadership says and the external 
information is true.  If their personal ethics and knowledge are 
against what the leadership tells them to do, they must ignore 
that.  It creates an internal schizophrenic environment in the 
brain that prevents them from doing the right thing and is very 
difficult to live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Zealotry is rewarded; objectivity is penalized.  The 
consequences for living up to what their constituents want them 
to do, what they feel is ethically responsible or intellectually 
responsible, where it runs adverse to what the leadership wants 
to do, is to be excommunicated from their party, have their 
democratic rights compromised, have their ability to represent 
their constituents severely restricted and be rendered 
politically impotent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the landscape is littered with the political corpses of 
individuals who have run afoul of their leadership and have done 
the right thing.  The system is weak.  It lends to the political 
disaffection and the disconnectiveness that Canadians have for 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should we do?  Many members of the House have fought for 
constructive democratic solutions to make this place a 
responsible place for Canadians.  We hear about free votes, but 
do we have them?  Absolutely not.  I am talking about true free 
votes for non-money bills.  We need them for members of all 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not have all bills go in draft form to committees?  If bills 
went in draft form to committees then both the MPs and the public 
would have constructive input into forming bills.  Right now 
committees basically rubber stamp the bills that come forward 
which are already constructed by the Prime Minister's Office and 
the department.  They come from the department and go through the 
sham of engaging in an analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It breaks my heart, as I am sure it does of every member of the 
House, to see well meaning, intelligent public individuals come 
before committees with bright and intelligent solutions to deal 
with problems they are studying.  Yet that input is largely 
ignored.  It is certainly ignored by the leaders of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee report is put forward.  It gets a day of press and 
then is tossed on a shelf to collect dust in some unknown 
hideaway.  That is what happens to all the hard work of committee 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees must be independent.  Parliamentary secretaries 
should be removed from committees.  They do not belong there. 
They are acting as mini whips of the government.  They greatly 
impede the ability of committees to do their work.  Committees 
should be independent in order to do effective work that benefits 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business should be expanded by three hours a 
week.  We could have two more hours on Friday and one more hour 
on Monday.  The system upon which private members' business is 
chosen should be changed.  Right now it is a lottery.  Every MP 
must have one votable private member's bill and one private 
member's motion at a minimum every parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for more constructive debates and less 
destructive action on the part of the government.  Presently the 
government rolls itself up in a carapace and the opposition 
parties hammer away at it, often on issues that the public does 
not care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we not seeing any effective debate on how to save our 
health care system?  Why are we not seeing a debate on the 
demographic impact on Canadian society, from pensions to social 
programs?  We have unsustainable pensions, an unsustainable 
health care system and an unsustainable CPP.  Our environment is 
being polluted.  There are solutions out there to address it, yet 
we see no effective action to deal with these and many other 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that so?  The reason is that this place has nothing to do 
with being constructive in addressing the problems of the nation 
but has everything to do with the maintenance and acquisition of 
power.  It is true that one has to get into power to implement 
what one wants to have done, but that does not preclude the 
ability of each and every member of the House to use their 
talents and their skills to represent their constituents for the 
betterment of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to create an environment in the House that will enable 
the big issues of the country to be addressed.  We need to create 
awareness to address the issue the member has raised in her bill. 
When we speak to the public and the young it is sad that they 
know very little about the big issues affecting our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could work with the provinces to introduce a 
civics course starting in grade school.  It is easier to hardwire 
people when they are younger.  They need to be hardwired about 
being involved and connected with their environment.  A civics 
course in school would enable students to be aware of what is 
happening in their environment and to get involved in their 
environment.  Then when they are older they would have a greater 
propensity and a greater desire to get involved in the processes, 
be they political or otherwise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a massive dearth in the interactivity of our processes 
with the Canadian public.  We have to regenerate that.  The only 
way we can do that is to ensure that the House is democratic so 
that what people are saying will be listened to and acted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have to ensure that our youth today are aware of what 
is happening.  One way we can do it, and indeed the government 
should do it, is to work with the provinces to introduce a civics 
course into the schools across this country, starting with 
children at a very early age.  That way we will create 
generations of children who will become the adult leaders who 
will address the problems of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only a minute left, but I again thank the hon. member, 
and I issue a plea to the government.  This is not an issue that 
affects only members in the opposition.  This affects every 
single member in the House of Commons, across all party lines. If 
we fail to democratize the House and if we fail to enable the 
public to have adequate input through their MPs and through the 
systems of the House, we do not deserve to be here and the House 
does not deserve to have a higher reputation than it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to what has been said in this place over the years and 
act on it, and we will be able to do our country proud. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased as well to intervene on this bill as introduced  by 
our colleague from Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to congratulate her.  I think it is 
laudable to put this proposal before the House to enable our 
young people aged 16 and 17 to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader has indicated that this is not the first time this matter 
has been debated here. 
We have to raise this question again periodically and debate it 
from time to time simply because there a number of rather 
conservative forces that are not particularly open to 
considering this reform, the effect of which would be to allow 
our 16 and 17 year olds to take part in the electoral process, 
but are also more or less open, I would say they are in fact 
totally opposed, to the in depth reform of the current electoral 
system, which, it may be said in passing, gives them 
considerable advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not odd when we had to tell our Liberal friends that they 
were being conservative in electoral terms, because the system 
in its current form benefits them?  This is why they do not want 
to change it one iota, since there is no reason for them to 
change it in any way in the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members need only remember the remarks by the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader to the effect that, 
when the House worked on the reform to the Elections Act in the 
last parliament, the committee, the House and the government 
chose to reject the idea of giving the vote to 16 and 17 year 
olds.  He said they had had rejected it. 
He said that, given the wisdom of our predecessors in the 
previous parliament, we should not reopen this issue, since we 
have just discussed it and have made a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I would like to set the record straight and 
explain what truly happened. I was a member of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs when it reviewed Bill 
C-2. The government used its majority in committee to reject the 
motion in amendment that had been proposed by the New Democratic 
Party to introduce an amendment to the Elections Act that would 
have allowed 16 and 17 year olds to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inaccurate and somewhat dishonest to suggest to members of 
the House and to those 16 and 17 year olds who may be listening 
to us that, in the last parliament, this assembly decided, in 
its great wisdom, to close the matter, to not follow up on that 
suggestion. 
The government decided not to go ahead with that proposal. One 
wonders about what motivates this government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all intents and purposes, the government made cosmetic 
changes to the Elections Act. In fact, some changes were useful 
ones, but there was no in depth reform of the electoral system 
that governs democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, given the recommendation of the Lortie commission 
and of the chief electoral officer, the government could have 
changed the appointment process for returning officers. 
The government always wants control over the appointment of 
returning officers.  Why is that?  Why choose them according to 
their political loyalties instead of their real and proven 
abilities?  It seems that the government wants to be the one 
making the appointments in the hopes of gaining some advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also refused to look at the entire issue of 
reviewing political party funding.  We in the Bloc Quebecois—and 
I know that the NDP is also looking at this at the present 
time—have proposed introduction of party funding by the public, 
based on two basic premises, the first one being a set upper 
limit for allowable contributions.  The government said no to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second addressed limiting contributions to only those who 
have a say in the political system, i.e. the voters, those who 
select the people who will represent the population in 
Parliament.  The government also said no to that.  We must 
conclude that the present funding system works in their favour 
and here too they do not want to see one iota of it changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I am getting to the heart of what concerns us at this time. 
I believe that the idea that we should give the right to vote to 
our fellow citizens aged 16 and 17 merits consideration.  More 
than that, it merits adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as fate would have it, according to the decision 
by the subcommittee on private members' business, this bill was 
judged not to be a votable item. 
For now, we can hardly go any further, since the government 
obviously has no intention of introducing such a provision in its 
own legislation, but at least the debate is continuing.  The 
debate is continuing and we think that we will eventually be able 
to get things to evolve to the point where such a measure could 
be contemplated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be only normal, in a society in which a 16 year old can 
hold a driver's licence, work, and therefore pay taxes.  Under 
the principle of no taxation without representation, we should be 
able to let 16 and 17 year olds decide who will spend their tax 
dollars, since they have the right to work and pay taxes at that 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the criminal code as it now stands, 16 and 17 year olds 
are considered adults. What is more, the National Defence Act 
allows the Canadian forces to hire 17 year olds.  A youth of 17, 
who has not reached the age of majority, could be called, if he 
wished, to serve under the flag and even fight to defend Canada, 
putting his life on the line, but we do not want to give this 
17 year old the right to choose who will represent him here in 
the House, who will be called upon to direct the destiny of the 
country for which he is prepared to risk his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the very face of it, this idea of not allowing 16 and 
17 year olds the right to vote is silly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We were concerned here in the House.  The chief electoral 
officer and civil society in general were concerned by the 
declining turnout in federal elections.  Turnout in the last 
election was the lowest in Canada's electoral history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Why is this so?  Perhaps it is simply because we are 
telling these young people in the flower of youth, who are 
interested in the public events, who have become independent 
thinkers and who would like to take part in the electoral 
process, that they must wait longer.  They must wait another two 
years.  They must wait another year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens at the end of this year or two we have made them 
wait?  We make them hang around at the door, telling them they 
still do not have what it takes, that they are not mature enough. 
We tell them that they have not developed sufficiently 
structured thought to enable them to choose judiciously on 
election day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly that makes no sense.  This is the effect of deliberately 
keeping 16 and 17 year olds out of the electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am running out of time, I will conclude very quickly by 
saying that this question deserves further attention and that we 
should not, as the government has done for the past few years, 
silence this reform of the Elections Act, as with all the other 
proposed reforms of the Elections Act. If the government agreed 
to consider reforms, perhaps we could increase people's interest 
in public affairs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, this 
is actually the first opportunity I have to congratulate you on 
your appointment.  I know that it took a number of years before 
the male dominated Parliament of Canada saw fit to put a female 
Speaker in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all my colleagues who were involved in the 
debate today for the varying perspectives they brought to it. 
Just as it took a long time to have a woman in the Speaker's 
chair, it took a long time to give the vote to females and to 
aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the Bloc mentioned, young men and women of 
17 years old, young adults, can go off to war and possibly give 
their lives for our country, but they do not have the opportunity 
to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians do not know that this is exactly what aboriginal 
Canadians did for a number of years and through a number of wars. 
They gave their lives or lost their legs or arms and came back to 
our country disabled.  They could not vote, they could not access 
some of the same establishments and they did not get the same 
rights as other veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not apart from being an unjust society.  We have a 
history there.  I think we need to move beyond that history, open 
up the initiative and once again build a truly democratic, just 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not have faith in this parliamentary system any 
more.  They do not have faith in our electoral process.  We need 
to work very hard as parliamentarians to again build that trust 
in our system.  It cannot be a matter of saying one thing prior 
to an election and then coming to the House of Commons as 
government or opposition members and not being true to what we 
were saying out there during an election.  We have to maintain a 
democratic system and we must build that faith in our system 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally the government should be bringing forth this 
legislation.  Then we would not have to go through the whole 
process of private members' business, hoping for the luck of the 
draw and then hoping beyond hope that our legislation will be 
deemed votable.  We should not have to be in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would be good, progressive legislative and 
electoral change, and it should be coming from the government, 
like so many pieces of legislation that the government should be 
bringing forth to improve our country.  It will not do that, so 
we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As opposition members we will push, and I know there are some 
government members out there who will push.  They will take the 
government kicking and screaming into the next century, and 
hopefully we will see some change and some improvement in 
people's faith in our democratic system.

take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment. 
You have been doing a wonderful job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before private members' business, I was talking about the 
institution of parliament, the respect for the debating procedure 
and how legislation is debated and decisions are reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House have traditionally sought to improve the 
debating procedure of parliament and to increase the dignity of 
the institution in the eyes of Canadians.  Sadly, we have not 
always proved equal to this challenge.  In recent years, some 
believe there have been early and worrying signs that some 
Canadians do not always hold the institution of parliament in the 
same high esteem that they once did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some of that may be a result of general suspicion of all 
institutions, some responsibility for this disillusionment may 
lie closer to home.  For example, from time to time some of the 
debating actions and statements of some members of the House can 
fuel the disillusionment and cynicism felt by Canadians. 
Sometimes this is a result of a misunderstanding by the public of 
how parliament, with its notion of loyal opposition, works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still do not understand all the procedures in that huge 
manual.  I hope I will understand them better and make sense out 
of some of the things that I would see as a member of public 
watching television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At other times some believe it is little more than a matter of 
high spirits and good natured bantering on the part of some 
members and perhaps a reflection of the collegiality which 
permeates the history of this and other similar institutions. 
However, on other occasions there are incidents which are less 
positive and which suggest that some procedures in the House may 
be dysfunctional and no longer work as had been originally 
intended.  I have noted a special sensitivity to these incidents 
by new members such as myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard we need to look further than the use in recent 
years of the report stage to put forward hundreds, and even 
thousands of motions, in the hopes of paralyzing the work of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a brief review of recent history gives a number of glaring 
examples of the misuse of this stage in the legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in December 1999, the House spent more than 42 
consecutive hours voting on 469 report stage motions designed to 
delay to the work of the House on the Nisga'a legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 2000 there was a similar exercise involving 36 
consecutive hours of voting on 411 motions on the clarity bill 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 2000, the House was faced with the prospect of 
having to deal with over 3,000 motions which would have required 
more than two weeks of non-stop sitting on the youth justice 
bill.  Can anyone in opposition explain how this would have been 
useful?  After all the years of study, suggestions, expert 
witnesses and procedures to come up with the best compromise and 
some improvements, how could 3,000 nuisance motions be 
beneficial?  Clearly this would have been an abuse of 
parliamentary procedure that would damage the work of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps worst of all, it damages the dignity of parliamentary 
debate in the eyes of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great pity, for it means we are squandering the respect 
and legitimacy that democracies like ours need in order to

</I></B></P><P align=left>That some Canadians should be turned off by these filibusters is 
hardly surprising.  During the marathon voting sessions, 
Canadians are treated to images of MPs bobbing up and down like 
puppets, sleeping at their desks and reading books or newspapers. 
Reviewing such a spectacle, some Canadians may conclude that 
parliament is not a place that takes the nation's business 
seriously and that MPs are engaged in silly partisan games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this is clearly not the case, we nevertheless must face up 
to the fact that such tactics, while perhaps justified in the 
minds of those employing them, are hurting the dignity of 
parliament and the respect of Canadians for the institution. 
Clearly this can not continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us seeks to address this issue and repair some 
of the damage caused by the amounts of abuse to parliamentary 
procedure in the debating system.  To do this, it proposes to 
restore to the Speaker his or her power to select motions for 
debate and filter out others which are frivolous, repetitious or 
clearly intended to obstruct the business of the House at report 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning the decision to eliminate frivolous motions to the 
honoured institution of the Speaker I do not think could be 
opposed by many.  The Speaker we have in place has the respect of 
all members of the House, as I think we could see by the very 
strong acclamation achieved when he was selected in a vote by all 
members of the House.  Of course the Deputy Speaker and Acting 
Speakers are very well received as well by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the function, many parliamentarians have been 
involved over the years in studies with other parliaments and 
procedures.  We can usually consider the experience of the U.K. 
house of commons.  Therefore, the motion calls upon the Speaker 
to be guided by the practice followed in the parliament of the 
U.K., in effect allowing him to draw on experience of a parliament 
with the longest history in the world in determining whether to 
select motions for debate at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once in place the change would allow members on all sides of the 
House to get on with the work of debating and studying 
legislation, which is after all why Canadians elected us in the 
first place.  It would also restore the traditional functions of 
the House and reinforce the role of House committees in 
considering amendments to legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, many amendments which would normally be 
introduced at the committee stage are now being brought forward 
instead at report stage.  This practice weakens the committee 
system by denying members from all parties the input provided by 
such amendments during their detailed study of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally and perhaps most important, it would remove a misuse of 
House procedures which has damaged the dignity of parliament and 
discredited the institution in the eyes of many Canadians.  As a 
result, the change would facilitate the work of parliament and 
help restore the confidence of Canadians in the debates of the 
House and its ability to address the issues that matter most to 
Canadians.  Clearly this would be good for parliament and good 
for this nation as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues in my riding that I would like deal 
with.  I receive dozens of phone calls and e-mails.  There are 
groups that want to see me.  If that time is taken up by 
frivolous motions to a bill, it would not help me in my work and 
I would be very frustrated by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new parliamentarian, I have been frustrated by the lack of 
time to do all the things we are allowed and expected to do and 
that I want to do in this role. 
I have the great honour to be in this role.  There are a lot of 
things I would like to try to accomplish to help my constituents 
and groups forward their agendas and to look at improving 
legislation.  However, the amount of responsibilities and 
possibilities are just immense.  I am sure all speakers in the 
House find this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike some provincial and territorial legislatures, the House 
sits five days a week, most nights until 6.30 p.m.  Tonight we 
are sitting until maybe 11 p.m.  We have a long sitting until 
June 22.  That is a lot of sitting time and just one function of 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there are committee meetings for detailed discussions 
on bills, research and comments.  If there is a lot of research, 
we have binders full of material.  Input from people giving 
evidence before committees has to be reviewed.  If we are doing a 
good job, we comprehensively study the bill to make sure it is an 
excellent bill.  That takes a lot of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because those two items coincide in time, I find it very 
frustrating.  We have to take time away from one or the other, 
either sitting in the House to try to understand the debate on 
all legislation or narrowing the time down to our committees. 
Already, without adding frivolous motions, we have limited time 
for our functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are various caucus meetings on specific areas which I find 
very productive.  For instance, I have been attending a 
children's caucus, foreign affairs caucuses and regional caucuses 
in different parts of the country.  It is a very productive to 
get into some detail in areas we would not be able to otherwise. 
However, once again it has been very productive for me in moving 
forward things that my constituents are interested in.  On the 
other hand, it is a third time constraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next item is all the e-mails we get, either in our 
constituency offices or in our Ottawa offices.  I am sure all 
members of parliament try to do their best to respond them and be 
sensitive to their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same manner we have written submissions.  Sometimes the 
written submissions, at least the ones I get, have huge 
backgrounds of documentation which I take on the plane with me to 
try to get through them all.  I still have not got through them. 
There is a vast quantity of material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are individual groups that are experts in their 
areas.  We try to respect that.  These groups can bring a 
tremendous amount of research material to us.  In Yukon we 
have the mining association, the Yukon Tourism Association, the 
British Columbia and Yukon Chamber of Mines, the Klondike Placer 
Miners Association, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, 
the Yukon Grants, the Yukon Chamber of Commerce, the Whitehorse 
Chamber of Commerce, the Skookum Jim Friendship Centre and the 
Victoria Faulkner Women's Centre.  There are all sorts of groups 
that have detailed perspective they can bring to us on issues 
that we have to also add to our workload. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe I am the only one who feels that way.  All 
members of the House must be slightly depressed at the amount of 
work they have to do and the time in which they have to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand that being new, I do not always know how 
to prioritize.  Some nights I am in this building until three in 
the morning.  Members can rest assured that I would be very angry 
if I was here because I was voting on 3,000 frivolous amendments 
to something.  Members of all parties have enough other things 
they could do with that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that would be the intent of the motion and would be the 
result of its passing.  I cannot believe that members on the 
other side would not feel the same way too, that they would like 
more time to do the things their constituents and the groups in 
their ridings ask them to do and to review more of the 
legislation. Obviously none of us can review all the legislation 
that comes before us in detail because of all our other duties. 
If we could free up some of the time from sitting here voting on 
frivolous amendments, I think all of us would be happy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not give any more control to the government side, 
whichever it happens to be in a given year.  It does give control 
to the respected institution of the Speaker to eliminate 
frivolous amendments and motions.  I do not think there are many 
who could argue with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions opposition members have talked about 
different suggested improvements, as recently as the speaker 
before me.  I cannot imagine not getting their support because 
the motion is in line with the type of intentions they are trying 
to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous cost to operating parliament.  Of course 
it is not only for the 301 members but for the whole 
parliamentary support that goes with it.  Does anyone really 
think about the cost of that to Canadian taxpayers and the cost 
of taking our time away from serious debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B> Seventeen thousand bucks an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell:</B>  Someone said that it costs $17,000 an 
hour, but I think there is a lot more in personal time as well 
that could be better used than on frivolous amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite, and especially my friend from Elk Island, have 
years of experience and talents to bring to parliament, to their 
constituents, to legislation, to committee meetings, to doing 
research for committees and to Canadians in general.  Do members 
opposite really think it is advantageous to squander those 
talents by sitting here while 3,000 frivolous amendments are 
proposed and voted on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the loyal opposition in their opening addresses to 
the motion used the term parlez-vous.  They did not know any 
French, but they thought it meant something about talking and 
that the House was meant as a place for serious discussion and 
debate.  That would be exactly the result of the motion.  If we 
were to eliminate everyone standing 3,000 times on a frivolous 
amendment, would there not be more time for serious debate? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not talk just about things that are important to us 
members of parliament? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, hopefully a minor change that eliminates 
frivolous amendments will allow us to get on with some of the 
very important things that we do here.  I personally have a great 
respect for this institution and will do my best to do productive 
things with my time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
wonder if we could have unanimous consent for five minutes of 
questions and comments with the member because I have some 
important things I would like to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry, but that 
is not a point of order.  I think the hon. member for Elk Island 
already had his question and comment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, to say that it is a pleasure to take the floor is an 
understatement. It is a pleasure to discuss issues with my 
colleagues, but I am not so sure that it is a real pleasure to 
address a motion like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I was surprised to hear the hon. member for Yukon say 
that voting on 3,000 amendments takes a long time, that it does 
not make sense. I remind the hon. member for Yukon, who was just 
recently elected to the House of Commons, that this is an episode 
of parliamentary history that he has yet to experience. 
Therefore, he may not be in the best position to make a comment 
of that nature on the 3,000 amendments and on the incidents if I 
may use that word surrounding the bills on the Nisga'a and on 
the so-called clarity, bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I want to make some kind of a connection with 
what I just said concerning a possible amendment to the Elections 
Act to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote. 
It is a strange coincidence that I rose to speak just a few 
moments ago on the bill introduced by the member for Churchill, 
and that I must now speak to Motion No. 2.  I see a certain 
relationship between the two and I will explain what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago, I was talking about the low voter turnout in 
the last federal election, and I had occasion to do so a little 
earlier in the session in connection with bills having to do with 
the Canada Elections Act.  I think it is appropriate to repeat 
this, because it is fundamental to my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to make itself feel good by saying that 
it obtained an even greater majority than in the 1997 election, 
and that it therefore has a mandate to govern, I might draw its 
attention to the fact that it received about 40% of 60% of the 
vote.  That is really not much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This points to a fundamental problem in our political system. 
When members of the public lose interest in public affairs, there 
is an urgent need for action.  Democracy must be constantly 
treasured and nurtured like a flower.  Obviously, in the present 
situation, democracy is ailing because, with each successive 
election, the interest of the public in public affairs, 
elections, and the management of the affairs of state, is slowly 
but surely dwindling away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With each successive election, voter turnout drops a little 
lower.  We need to give ourselves a wake-up call and take it in 
that something serious is going on.  There are a number of 
possible explanations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government's lack of ethics, which we have been 
pointing out in recent weeks, is one of the explanations for 
Canadians' continually declining interest in what goes on here in 
Ottawa.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two other factors I can identify, which I would like 
to bring up once again.  First, there is the government's 
systematic refusal to consider any in depth reform of the 
existing electoral system.  I referred to the appointment of 
returning officers a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no hiding one's head in the sand. Each of us in the 
House faced organizational problems during the latest election. 
Perhaps we should ask ourselves a number of questions, about the 
competence or incompetence of certain returning officers in the 
last federal election, among other things. Obviously a number of 
major problems occurred, which should be analyzed.  Perhaps, as I 
was saying, the competence of certain returning officers is at 
issue in some instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is refusing to contemplate any change to the 
system of funding political parties.  The chief electoral officer 
said “In democracy, it is important to know where the money goes 
and where the money comes from”.  It is worrisome for people to 
feel or have the impression that those contributing to party 
coffers, including the major corporations, which contribute huge 
amounts to the coffers of the traditional parties, hold greater 
sway over and have greater access to elected officials than do 
they, the people who chose them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise that the Canadian public shows such cynicism 
and lack of confidence in institutions as it does today with 
respect to what is going on here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other factor that needs considering: parliamentary 
reform.  This government was elected in 1993 on its stated 
desire to change things, to restore public confidence in 
parliamentary institutions.  What has it done since?  Nothing. 
Absolutely nothing, except to reinforce the power that was 
already concentrated in the hands of the Prime Minister and his 
cabinet.  This power that was already too highly concentrated in 
the hands of so few people was concentrated still further.  It is 
nevertheless surprising, as I pointed out to the House 
earlier, that with a scant 40% of the votes close to 100% of 
power could be concentrated in the hands of so few people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the government failed in its duty and commitment 
relating to parliamentary reform, but it has also, and more 
importantly, gone so far as to sneak one reform past us.  The 
government seeks to ensure that the few powers vested in 
parliament, the opposition parties and Liberal backbenchers are 
taken from them and handed over to the all-powerful clique that 
surrounds the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nonetheless surprising that the cornerstones of democracy, 
that is, a country's electoral and parliamentary systems, could be 
modified unilaterally by the government.  This is a source of 
worry.  I believe this can indeed add to the cynicism, the lack 
of confidence Canadians, and Quebecers in particular, have in 
what is going on in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last time, the government took a unilateral approach to 
electoral reform.  It did not have the support of the opposition 
parties.  It even went so far as to ensure that, at third 
reading, the electoral reform bill was debated only between the 
government House leader and the official opposition critic. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was therefore passed or debated at third reading by only two 
of the five political parties present in this parliament. That is 
what is happening now with this attempt at parliamentary 
reform, because that is indeed what this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is attempting to impose on us the defunct Motions 
Nos. 8 and 9, which sought to deprive the opposition of a certain 
number of its powers.  It is coming back to us with a reworded 
motion, Motion No. 2, whose purpose is exactly the same.  But this 
time it does not want to be the bad guy.  It wants to foist this 
role off on the Speaker of the House, which is even more 
unacceptable and shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, it is proceeding unilaterally, without the agreement 
of the opposition parties, and still attempting to concentrate 
all the powers in the hands of a few, making this Parliament even 
more— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Antidemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Antidemocratic is not really the word 
I was looking for, but it is still serious.  Irrelevant is the 
word that comes to mind.  There is an increasing trend to strip 
this democratic institution of its relevance by arranging things 
so that all the powers are concentrated in the hands of the 
government and the powers that used to belong to parliament are 
being progressively taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has invoked monetary reasons to justify moving 
this motion by saying “Listen, when we vote late in the evening, 
it costs taxpayers an awful lot of money”. The government House 
leader indicated that it costs $27,000 an hour in overtime to 
make this institution run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where the government House leader got this figure, 
but just today senior House officials told us that it was very 
difficult to estimate the operating costs of the House outside 
regular hours. Therefore, it is surprising to hear the government 
mention the figure of $27,000 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument the government used is “This is terrible. Our 
members are stuck in the House where they have to vote for hours 
on end. To force parliamentarians to vote for such long periods 
is a real misuse of members' time and taxpayers' money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not our job to vote? Is it not why each and every one 
of us was elected? Were we not elected to pass laws and to pass 
amendments to these laws? Of course that is why we were elected, 
but it seems that this process costs a lot of money an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this government, which always tries to justify its 
premise that it costs a lot of money to have the House sit 
outside regular hours when there a whole slew of 
amendments, asked House officials, through the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and other 
government members of that committee, to tell us how much a 
member of parliament costs an hour. What is the hourly 
remuneration of a member of parliament here in the House of 
Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By crunching the numbers and then using a lot of 
imagination, the government tells us that a member costs about $30 
an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negative effect of this type of figure juggling is that some 
people at home could find it practical to have members sit longer 
because their hourly rate would drop.  They would be paid $25 or 
$26 an hour.  Some would be delighted that their MPs earn less if 
they sit more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the logic, the reasoning, the argument, that the cost of 
a member and of parliament must be calculated when parliament 
sits outside regular hours is Byzantine.  The debate is 
totally as I said irrelevant and serves no purpose because it 
is very harmful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to what I said earlier.  Democracy is a flower to be 
cultivated.  It is distressing to hear the government telling 
Canadians that democracy costs a lot.  Democracy is priceless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, the government is trying to sell the budget to 
our fellow Canadians, by saying “We must pass this motion, 
because at the moment the opposition members are so out of it 
they cost a lot by making the House sit outside regular hours”. 
No logic or reasoning supports such an argument.  I repeat the 
text of the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say two things on this. It is basically 
disgraceful and unacceptable for the government to be claiming 
that what members propose to enrich parliamentary debate may be 
considered repetitive, frivolous or vexatious or of a nature that 
would serve merely to prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has only itself to blame.  It is primarily 
responsible for this practice of the opposition parties, which 
has developed over a number of years, of introducing amendments 
at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it wants to gain public sympathy for the misuse the 
opposition parties are making of the House rules.  Yet it is the 
one responsible.  Why so?  Quite simply, because this government 
governs by gag orders, and as I have said, has gone so far as to 
impose a reform of the House standing orders, a change to the 
standing orders.  It feels it is invested with the power to 
impose this change to the standing orders with a gag. Yesterday, 
the Bogey Man, the Muzzle Man was back, once more imposing a gag 
on us so that he can change the way things are done here in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparing figures on the number of gag orders used by the last 
Conservative government in its nine years in power, and the 
record of the present Liberal government, which has logged seven 
years so far, we see that the present government has considerably 
raised the number of gags imposed on legislation. There has been 
a considerable increase since the Liberals have been in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1984 and 1993, under the Conservative regime, the 
government imposed 49 gags, 9.4% of the total of 519 bills 
introduced in the House.  In its seven years in power, the 
Liberal government has imposed more than 60, with a total of only 
350 bills, almost twice that figure, or 17.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, when it was in opposition, the present government, 
especially the members of the rat pack, one of whom is now the 
Government House Leader, decried the dominating and dictatorial 
attitude of the Conservative government.  Today they are trying 
to preach to us that “The opposition is not responsible”.  That 
argument does not hold water.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition is forced to resort to such practices, it is 
because this is the only way, the only means left to it in this 
parliament to exercise its rights to generate a debate and to 
oppose a bill. It is the only way left for us to express the 
opinions of those whom we represent and who do not necessarily 
share the government's point of view. It is the only way left 
for us under the rules of the House, because after each reading 
this government ends the debate, interrupts the proceedings and 
gags the opposition. And then it is surprised to see us having 
to resort to such practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that, with this motion, the government 
wants to put pressure on the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, <I>Le Devoir</I> wrote this about the government House leader 
“Mr. Boudria clearly indicated that it would not be possible for 
the Speaker to ignore the motion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to force the hand of the Speaker. I want to 
refer to a comment on pages 260 and 261 of Montpetit and Marleau. 
It says that the Chair has an obligation to protect opposition 
members against the tyranny of the majority. Unfortunately, I 
cannot read the quote, but that is the gist of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if that motion were to be passed by the government 
majority, the Chair must remember, because it is the Chair that is 
being pressured, that whatever happens, it must always protect 
the rights of backbenchers and opposition members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to participate in the debate on the government's proposed 
amendments to the standing orders of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That section (5) of Standing Order 76 and section (5) of 
Standing Order 76.1 be amended by adding at the conclusion of the 
notes thereto the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage and, in 
exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be guided 
by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the United 
Kingdom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is proposing that the government's 
motion be amended by adding the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>and for even greater clarity, the Speaker may select for debate 
all motions, regardless of their nature, if in his or her opinion 
the rights of the minority have been infringed upon in any way. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that at a time when members on all sides of 
the House agree that too much power is concentrated in the Prime 
Minister's office and exercised by the Prime Minister, the 
government proposes an amendment to the standing orders that 
strengthens the executive branch and weakens the role of duly 
elected members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is an assault on the rights of Canadians' elected 
representatives in the House.  The government is only interested 
in selectively borrowing those practices from the U.K. that 
increase its power over the House of Commons.  There are other 
practices they could borrow from the U.K. that would strengthen 
our democracy.  I will speak about some of them now and later I 
will speak about committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about what happens in the House of Commons. 
Whenever the government feels a formidable challenge or feels 
that the opposition is embarrassing it, the government cuts off 
debate in the House and passes whatever piece of business it is 
working on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1900"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government entertain changes?  No.  Does it listen to 
what Canadians are saying?  No.  This brings us to the heart of 
some of the procedures in the House that make little or no sense 
at times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not allow scheduled votes to take place 
immediately following question period?  All members of parliament 
are in the House for question period.  Would it not make sense to 
vote when everyone is here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not prepared to entertain good suggestions and 
ideas from members of parliament on all sides of the House, 
including its own backbenchers.  The government is famous for its 
thin soup legislative agenda.  When the opposition parties try to 
thicken the soup, the government refuses to allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country has not had a referendum since the one on the 
Charlottetown accord, except of course the one on tearing the 
country apart.  The Liberals will not allow important questions 
to be decided directly by the people.  The Liberals are control 
freaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is petitions.  The government does not want to 
allow Canadians the freedom to speak out on issues.  Petitions 
are good examples of that.  Canadians spend a great deal of time 
and effort in preparing petitions for submission to the House. 
They spend gas money and go from door to door collecting 
signatures, in the cold of winter and the heat of summer.  The 
MPs proudly present the work of their constituents in the form of 
petitions and the Liberals throw them onto a shelf to gather 
dust.  Sometimes after a few months they issue a small token 
reply using politically correct phrases.  The government takes no 
action on these petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to voting, the Liberal whip tells government MPs how 
to vote or else.  Where is the democracy in that?  Not everything 
has to be a vote of confidence in the House.  There have even 
been assurances from opposition members that a certain vote would 
not be considered a vote of confidence.  An example of this was 
the vote on hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must wake up to the needs of the people in this 
new millennium.  The government is not expected to fall each and 
every time the 301 members of parliament tell the government what 
to do.  If a vote goes against the government, that should start 
a process whereby members of parliament work with the government 
to reach a compromise or to modify the government's position or 
to do a great number of other things that would allow the will of 
the people to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of this issue is how we work in 
committees.  The government could allow opposition members to 
chair more standing committees as they do in other countries, 
including the U.K.  Regarding the election of committee chairs, 
secret ballots are still not allowed even after insistence by the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voting procedure in committees is a completely partisan 
exercise in which government members gang up on opposition MPs. 
Even the future business of the committee is decided in a 
partisan manner, with the government members taking orders from 
the higher-ups.  Even the decisions concerning witnesses who will 
be permitted to appear before the committee are taken in a 
partisan manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government prevents significant issues from being dealt with 
by committees.  Through votes in committees where the Liberal 
members hold the majority of votes, the government can ensure 
that its own agenda is pursued.  Any business that it does not 
want to deal with never gets heard by the committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the government refuses to adopt most of the 
amendments to legislation that are submitted by opposition 
members from all parties.  Often government members will hold 
press conferences without making the reports available to 
opposition members just to pre-empt them by not giving them 
enough time to prepare their responses, or to not give opposition 
members credit where credit is due most of the time.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also fighting to prevent committee hearings 
from being televised.  It knows that the way it runs committees 
is a farce and it does not want Canadians to be able to watch the 
circus that the House committees have unfortunately become under 
the dictatorship of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the various kinds of appointments, the power to 
appoint senators, the auditor general, the ethics counsellor, the 
privacy commissioner, the information commissioner and others 
should not reside exclusively with the Prime Minister's office. 
People in positions such as auditor general, ethics counsellor 
and information commissioner can possibly, after their intensive 
work, make excellent recommendations to government departments 
but they are not allowed to do that.  People in these positions 
only report on their investigations and the government can then 
throw out those reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these reports should be considered binding on the 
government.  They are in fact supposed to give direction to the 
government so they should not be ignored, buried, shelved or 
ridiculed.  The government not only covers up these things but 
also ridicules and tries to tear down the integrity of the person 
doing the criticizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to parliamentary trips, many members of the House, 
from all parties, go on international trips from time to time. 
Whenever delegations from the Parliament of Canada travel abroad, 
they should be team efforts.  Opposition MPs are often denied 
briefings.  They are left out of some of the events and meetings 
held abroad.  Often the government officials will prohibit the 
opposition members from talking to the media about findings or 
other issues relating to the trip.  They restrict the opportunity 
for opposition members to express the opposition's views or 
perspectives.  The procedures used by the government are partisan 
in nature.  The Liberals cling to a mentality of exclusion that 
defeats the full representation of the people of Canada to the 
outside world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to special treatment, decisions on government grants, 
jobs, favours, appointments and a host of others are made by the 
government to benefit the governing party, the Liberals in this 
case.  Sometimes ministerial permits or visitor's visas are 
issued to visitors to Canada upon request by government members, 
even though these same visitors have been refused permits or 
visas when they applied through opposition MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not being treated equally in many respects.  The 
government engages in favouritism based on political support and 
perhaps sometimes on monetary donations.  These are problems of 
procedure.  The process should be fixed so that these kinds of 
things are not permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House, the position of Clerk of the House is a 
responsible and respectable position.  The Clerk of the House is 
appointed by the Prime Minister.  The clerk advises the Speaker. 
With due respect to the Clerk of the House, our Speaker is 
elected by secret ballot and the Prime Minister's office 
continues to try to have a hold on the Speaker through the 
clerk's office.  It defeats the purpose of the election of the 
Speaker of the House.  Canadians do not think it is fair for the 
Prime Minister to give the clerk a job and then expect the clerk 
to be neutral and impartial.  I say this with great respect for 
the Clerk of the House, who is a wonderful person, but I maintain 
that it is not fair.  It is not even fair to the clerk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question period in the House is another area of procedure in 
which changes should be considered.   Most of the time, the 
ministers do not provide real answers to important non-partisan 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That's why it's called question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Then they tell us that is why it is 
called question period.  This is not how it should operate. 
Quite often ministers reject the facts and premises presented by 
opposition MPs.  They often ridicule opposition members when they 
ask sincere questions. 
The media calls question period a farce, a circus, and it is no 
wonder.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to debates in the House, take note debates are another 
farce.  The procedure the government clings to is one whereby the 
cabinet or the Prime Minister's office makes the decision and 
then allows a debate in the House after the decision is made. 
They do not listen to the debate.  Nothing in the contributions 
during the debate changes that already made decision.  The 
ministers adopt none of the recommendations made by the MPs from 
any of the political parties during that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most government MPs read speeches prepared by bureaucrats. 
Often, less than 10% of MPs are even in the House during debates. 
I myself once gave a speech in the House when the only people in 
the House were the Speaker and myself.  Often there are more 
pages in the House than MPs, as we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure prevents anyone on the government side from 
attending the House with an open mind.  Many of the bills we 
debate here are only a couple of pages in length, yet they 
sometimes have hundreds of pages of attached regulations, which 
are never debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedures the government clings to are giving us government 
by regulation, not legislation.  I call it governing through the 
back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the co-chair of the House and Senate Standing Joint 
Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations.  That committee has 
about 800 sets of regulations that are in the process or pipeline 
of being modified or struck down, but the cabinet refuses to take 
action on these 800 files.  It stalls, it denies, it drags its 
feet and it stonewalls the committee.  Some of these 800 files 
are 25 years old.  Imagine that.  Those regulations are not 
supposed to be there.  They have been hanging on in the system 
for 25 years.  It is a disgrace.  It is so undemocratic that it 
is anti-democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government motion we are debating today is an insult and an 
assault on the rights of MPs.  It is an attack on democracy.  It 
is a vindictive exercise in response to the Nisga'a debate in the 
last parliament when the official opposition used a procedural 
tool to cause a voting marathon to alert Canadians to the 
anti-democratic way in which the government was running the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that for the Nisga'a debate the hon. member for Elk 
Island, who is a very dedicated member of the House, more 
dedicated than many other members of the House, and who is always 
in the House listening to the debates and participating actively, 
asked for an incremental cost of the Nisga'a debate, but the 
reply he got was that the incremental cost was not available. 
Perhaps there was no incremental cost because many staff members 
traded off the hours they worked.  Probably the closure motion we 
are debating today will keep us up to eleven o'clock or maybe 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe that the Liberals want to prevent that tool 
from ever being used again, that tool we attempted to use in 
order to exercise our democratic rights.  Why does the government 
not simply behave in a manner that would not require the 
opposition to use the Nisga'a procedural tool ever again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be democratic and the opposition parties will not use that 
procedure any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important issue is private members' business.  Again, it 
is another farce.  Ideally, or in theory at least, private 
members' business should give the elected representatives of 
Canadians an opportunity for an initiative to contribute to the 
formation of legislation in Canada. 
It should be an opportunity to raise the voice of their 
constituents in parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A private member's bill or motion for the production of papers 
does not contribute much to the legislative process unless it is 
votable.  A limited number of private members' bills and motions 
are made votable by the government.  To make private members' 
business votable is a partisan exercise.  It is not supposed to 
be like that, even though there are members from all parties on 
the committee.  I am convinced from my practical experience that 
it is a partisan exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is supposed to be a non-political debate.  Very few members 
come to the House with an open mind.  Private members' business 
is like a pacifier.  A pacifier is put in a baby's mouth but 
there is no milk coming out of it.  It is given to a baby without 
telling the baby to shut up.  It is so like telling someone 
diplomatically to go to hell that the person is looking forward 
to the trip.  It is the same with private members' business.  We 
can write bills and motions, but these things do not cause any 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When was the last time a private member's bill was passed into 
law?  How many have been passed in the last 20 years?  There have 
been only a few, less than a half a dozen perhaps.  Why do we 
even have private members' business?  The government is not 
fooling us and it is not fooling Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the procedures the government clings to prevent 
the House from dealing properly with the expenditures of the 
government.  The supplementary and interim supply budgets are 
hardly dealt with at all.  Is the scrutiny of the money spent by 
the government not the real purpose for us to be here and to 
debate?  Even that is not allowed to be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk a great deal about how there is no procedure in the 
House for bringing together the federal and provincial 
governments.  There is little co-operation between these two 
levels of government and there are no changes being introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government resists change: electoral reform, Senate reform, 
parliamentary reform and democratic reform.  No wonder the 
turnout in federal elections is decreasing and was at an all time 
low in the last federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credibility of politicians is way down among different 
professions in Canada.  It is high time for reform when members 
from all sides of the House are complaining that too much power 
is exercised by the Prime Minister's Office.  The government 
proposes an amendment to the standing orders that strengthens the 
executive branch and weakens the democracy by weakening and 
trivializing the role of elected members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a great honour to speak to the motion tonight.  For 
purposes of public edification I repeat what it is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That section (5) of Standing Order 76 and section (5) of Standing 
Order 76.1 be amended by adding at the conclusion of the notes 
thereto the following: For greater clarity, the Speaker will not 
select for debate a motion or series of motions of a repetitive,

merely to prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage 
and, in exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be 
guided by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the 
United Kingdom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say first and foremost that to listen to the member 
for Surrey Central is really outrageous.  I will tell hon. 
members why.  He raised every grievance, perceived or real, and 
tried to somehow work it into the example of how we will make 
parliament work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This institution, I can tell members from my time in this great 
House, came about as a result of the founding fathers getting 
together in 1867 and providing a framework, a template that works 
well along the lines of the British parliamentary democracy.  It 
is a template that has evolved over the time we have been here. 
It has worked well in a democratic fashion, to the benefit of all 
Canadians as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear members opposite, in particular the one prior to my 
speaking and others too for that matter, talking in terms of how 
this is tearing down the pillars of democracy in Canada and 
denigrating parliament is not only outrageous but pathetic in its 
intent.  I will tell the House why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is something we have honed over time.  We have 
put in place the very pillars of democracy that we now see 
bearing fruit.  I believe it is something to behold and should be 
something of great pride to all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It hurts me to hear members, especially those of the reform 
alliance, tear away at this institution.  That is what they are 
good at. They are good at being negative.  They are good at 
always trying to rip at the very fabric of this great country. It 
is a shameful spectacle.  It is not something we do not expect 
from them because, after all, that is who they are: people who 
would rather tear down than build up and people who would rather 
rip it apart than make sure it works properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion is straightforward.  It is to 
reconfirm the authority of the Speaker.  That is you, Madam 
Speaker and your colleagues.  It is to reassert your ability to 
select motions for debate at report stage in the manner in which 
they are intended when they are presented in a legislative 
process in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can follow the string all the way back to 1867.  More 
important, I believe our parliamentary procedure and what we are 
capable of doing in the House go back 32 years as the direct 
result of a committee that looked at these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the public, fearing that members would take 
advantage of report stage to move similar amendments of little 
importance or which were dilatory in nature, the special 
committee on procedure recommended in its report in 1968 that a 
rule be adopted to permit the Speaker “to select and combine the 
amendments of which notice had been given”.  Such a rule was 
then adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was that done?  It was done to enable the business of the 
House to get done in a democratically elected fashion to the 
benefit of Canadians.  We have committees where we listen to 
witnesses.  We take amendments.  We massage the legislation in 
front of us.  With the benefit of the experience of all the 
members present, at the end of the day we are able then to come 
out with a piece of legislation that is workable and to the 
benefit to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes back at report stage we should not have to be 
hornswoggled, that is a farmer's term I am used to saying from 
time to time, by the reform alliance or the Bloc.  They should 
not be tying our hands and doing all kinds of outrageous things 
when it comes to amendments: frivolous, vexatious and downright 
terrible things to tie the hands of parliamentarians and to tie 
up the workings of this great House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has the power to select or group motions in 
amendment to be proposed at report stage.  That is what we are 
trying to get back to.  That is exactly what was adopted 32 years 
ago, and that is the way it should be.  We would like the 
Speaker's decision on the grouping of these motions in amendment 
at report stage to be in a manner consistent with the values of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing that the Speaker would address two matters. The first 
would be the grouping for debate and the second would be the 
voting arrangement.  These are very important.  The motions are 
grouped according to two factors.  The first is the content and 
the second is the place where they would be inserted in the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions would be grouped according to content if they could form 
the subject of a simple debate.  Once adopted, they would have 
the same effect in different places of the bill or if they relate 
to the same provision or similar provisions in the same bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is straightforward.  That is common sense.  That is simply 
making parliament work effectively in the way it was intended to 
work.  Motions in amendment are continued according to the place 
where they are to be inserted in the bill when they relate to the 
same line or lines.  These motions in amendment would be part of 
a single scheme for voting patterns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to be something Speakers have had over time.  It is 
certainly something that was developed and evolved in the 1970s 
and beyond.  It is important that we reassert the Speaker's 
ability to make those kinds of rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair at this stage to point out that in recent years 
successive Speakers have felt less and less inclined to exercise 
their authority in this matter, with the consequence that report 
stage has been rendered vulnerable to unsatisfactory and 
unintended use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in December 1999 the House was obliged to spend 
more than 42 consecutive hours voting on 469 report stage 
motions, most of which were concocted at the last minute or in 
consultation with the reform alliance people and whatever 
shenanigans they had in mind to hijack the House in a way that 
was not only unprofessional and undemocratic but downright silly. 
At the end of the day we spent enormous amounts of time doing 
things that should not have been done.  The reform alliance 
people proceeded in a very undemocratic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 2000 the Bloc followed a similar exercise. Having 
watched the reform alliance people act out their hijinks and 
their shenanigans, members of the Bloc decided to get in on the 
act.  This was over another bill and it was an exercise that 
simply spun out of control.  There is no other way of putting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were faced in September 2000 with having to deal with 3,000 
frivolous and vexatious motions of little intent, motions that 
were simply silly and downright ridiculous. The Bloc was trying 
to emulate the reform alliance.  I thank the opposition for not 
doing its job.  Its job is to oppose.  It is to be constructive. 
It is to do things in a manner consistent with our great 
democratic principles.  Those shenanigans are not in keeping with 
that.  Rather, they are simply to be silly for the sake of being 
silly.  If that was what they tried to accomplish, they 
succeeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament we had to vote for days on report stage 
motions because of the abuse of the loophole in the standing 
orders at report stage.  That is exactly and precisely the 
loophole we are looking to close tonight.  It is one that should 
not be subject to the kind of abuse we saw in 1999. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

precisely the kind of loophole we want to change to ensure that 
the business of this parliament works in an effective and 
efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of the kind of abuse that we saw in the case of the 
reform alliance people with Nisga'a and the case of the Bloc 
Quebecois with respect to the youth justice initiatives bill is 
totally unacceptable, not only to the House of Commons but to 
Canadians as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who elected us to debate and study legislation resent 
us wasting the kind of time that the reform alliance and the Bloc 
members had us do.  Canadians simply do not want to see the 
people, who should be debating legislation and voting according 
to the will and the needs of their constituents, being hog tied 
by people who would rather abuse the system.  It is an abuse to 
taxpayers who do not like to spend the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars that were spent as a result of precisely what the reform 
alliance people did on the Nisga'a bill and what the Bloc did on 
the youth justice initiative bill.  People do not like to see the 
squandering of those kinds of tax dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We had a ruling by the Speaker that our party is to be called the 
Canadian Alliance in the House of Commons.  In respect to the 
Chair, the member should comply with that previous ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  The taxpayers resent that kind of 
frivolous frittering away of tax dollars.  I suppose it is better 
to give $800,000 to a law firm that would have settled for 
$60,000.

quorum and debate shall continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is not fair to the 
House of Commons staff who do a great deal of work on our behalf 
as parliamentarians.  It is not fair to have the reform alliance 
people and the Bloc for example— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The ruling of the Chair was that the party should be named the 
Canadian Alliance.  The member is showing disrespect to the Chair 
to continue to defy the Chair in this way.  Madam Speaker, you 
should enforce that.

has elapsed.  Will the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington 
please conclude his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is not fair to this 
great institution.  This is an institution that has evolved, as I 
said at the outset, over time based on the great principles of 
the British model.  I believe we have come to grips with a kind 
of democracy that is an example to the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, before beginning my speech, I would like to point out 
that I am going to be splitting my time with the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting position for me to be following the member 
for Waterloo—Wellington who regularly encounters considerable 
reaction from members of the House from all parties. He has been 
known to raise the ire of other members and tonight is no 
exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, I disagree vehemently with the tone, tenor and 
substance of the member's speech.  I do not believe he has 
accurately represented the true nature of the debate and the 
issues at hand.  I hope, in the little time remaining for us to 
debate this very important issue, that we will be able to do just 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the rest of this evening, and I hope the 
member for Winnipeg South will participate in the debate.  He is 
one member who in the past has talked a great deal about 
parliamentary reform and the need to make significant changes in 
this place to ensure greater democracy and greater participation 
by everyone here.  I trust therefore that he, along with many 
other members, is inwardly disappointed and deeply disturbed in 
this initiative of the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but believe that some of the speeches that we have 
heard this evening are a result of members in the Liberal Party 
feeling that they must jump to it, listen to the direction of the 
House leader and, contrary to their best wishes, say “Yes, sir; 
no, sir; three bags full, sir”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing today is nothing more than the typical 
behaviour of what we have all come to know as the model of 
trained seals.  I see the member for Winnipeg South is responding 
appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  He is practising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  He is practising, as my 
colleague from Palliser has just said, his part, which is very 
much at the heart of this debate tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very ironic that we are here today debating a motion, 
which the government has put closure on, that would strip away 
the powers of elected members in this place.  It is ironic 
because today is the day when the auditor general delivered his 
farewell report to this place.  He made a very clear statement at 
the public accounts committee today about the importance of 
preserving the traditions of parliament and ensuring that members 
in this place are able to exercise their rights and 
responsibilities and are able to hold the government to account, 
not only in terms of financial matters but in all questions 
pertaining to legislation, programs and initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be very appropriate to remind members of what 
the auditor general actually said today.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask those who have become cynical about their government 
to reconsider.  Our institutions are the best defence of ordinary 
citizens against adverse trends that require collective 
action....  It is our duty as citizens to strengthen the 
institutions of government.  Those of us who are or who have been 
inside the system have a duty to ensure that we remain 
accountable for our actions and the vast resources and 
aspirations entrusted to us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we aim to do in the debate tonight.  That is why we 
raised such concern about the action of the government today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We began this session with great hope and aspiration that in 
fact the 37th Parliament of Canada would begin with a new 
attitude and a new approach to accountability, democracy and 
transparency.  We held out hope because members from all sides 
and from all parties in this place were talking about the need to 
reform parliament.  We held out great hope because there was a 
reference in the Speech from the Throne about the need to reform 
parliament.  We held out hope because there was a tremendous 
debate going on in the media and with the public about the need 
to ensure that this place, the people's Chamber, was able to 
execute its responsibilities according to the wishes of the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, we are off to a terrible start.  This is a very 
rocky beginning to an agenda that was supposed to be about 
meaningful change here in parliament and in our electoral system. 
It was barely a couple of weeks into this session when the 
government decided to crack the whip and ensure that all members 
voted against the motion to require an independent ethics 
counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A day or two after that the government brought in closure on the 
very first bill it had introduced in this session, the employment 
insurance bill.   We have tabulated it to be the 69th or 70th 
time that this government has brought in closure in the last few 
of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks after that the government brought in this 
motion that would in effect take away the ability of 
parliamentarians and opposition parties in the Chamber to amend 
bills at the report stage.  To top it all off, the government had 
the gall to bring in closure on that motion.  What in effect we 
are dealing with today is closure on closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the government side tonight are trying to defend 
their position by suggesting that what they are doing is in the 
best interests of parliament and of the people of Canada.  They 
say that they want to keep vexatious and frivolous issues away 
from us.  I think the arguments being used tonight by the Liberal 
members in the Chamber are vexatious and frivolous.  They do not 
get at the heart of the matter, which is how to truly reform the 
House in a fair and reasonable way involving all parties and all 
players in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some colleagues have said earlier in the debate, what the 
government chose to do was arbitrarily bring in reform to deal 
with what it considers to be an abuse of the parliamentary 
process without addressing its own abuse of the system, its own 
rampant use of closure, its own political manipulation of the 
committees and without addressing the way this whole place is 
controlled, used and abused by the executive of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we should all be participating together in ways to reform 
this place, and this is not how to do it.  We need to find a way 
to work together and make the necessary changes.  This kind of 
dictatorial, arbitrary and heavy-handed move on the part of the 
government is a setback to that worthy goal, that important 
aspiration of making this place more representative and more 
democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report came out today in which he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For democracy to work and for government to be efficient and 
effective, Parliament must be able to play its part. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that parliament is not able to play its 
part now.  Parliament is not able to play its part because of a 
series of actions taken by the government to strip parliament of 
its powers and to deny members of parliament the opportunity to 
play a meaningful role in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only have to refer to the standing committees as an example of 
the way in which the government has controlled that process by 
prohibiting members from dealing with the serious questions of 
the day, such as the future of health care in the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has denied members the opportunity to participate 
fully, has made decisions outside the Chamber, and has applied 
the heavy hand of closure motions such as the one we are dealing 
with today, to strip us of our powers and ability to represent 
people as we aimed to do at the outset of getting involved in 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members on the Liberal side will reconsider and rethink 
this position, take it off the books, and stop this nonsense so 
we can all get down to the important work of seriously dealing 
with parliamentary reform and ensuring this place preserves its 
proud tradition and example of democracy and citizen 
participation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Madam Speaker, first 
I could say that I am pleased to rise in the House this evening 
to speak to this motion, but, at the same time, it is 
unfortunate that we are once again taking a step backwards with 
respect to democracy here in Canada.  It is truly a step 
backwards; we have a lovely House of Commons here so that we can 
make the laws of the land, introduce bills and motions, and 
govern the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Liberal government across the way, saying “There 
must be respect for the House of Commons, but we are going to 
silence the opposition.  We are going to take the opposition's 
privileges away”. It is sad to see a party which, if I recall 
correctly, around 1988-89, when it was in opposition, was glad to 
be able to rise in the House of Commons and debate bills.  The 
Liberals were glad to be able to make amendments to bills.  Back 
then they did not like it one bit when the Progressive 
Conservatives tried to stop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember the GST bill.  The Liberals turned up with a 
whole string of amendments.  Did the government of the day tell 
them they were abusing the system, abusing parliament, because 
they wanted to do their job?  It is a disgrace that in 2001, 
particularly after the 2000 election, the government says it is 
going to be open to parliamentary reform. 
It says it will sit down in parliament, and we are going to be 
able to discuss and look at parliamentary reform together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening, they turn up here with a motion.  They want to 
shut up the opposition again, but I believe we have a role to 
play in democracy.  We too are capable of shouldering our 
responsibilities.  If the government means to say that the 
opposition is not assuming its responsibilities because there 
supposedly were 100 or 200 amendments to a bill, is the 
government assuming its responsibilities when it closes down 
debate as it has been doing in recent years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Mississauga asks whether we did not want Bill 
C-2 on employment insurance reform, whether we were not anxious 
for it to get passed.  Yes, I am anxious to see a bill on 
employment insurance reform passed. 
I want to see it passed, but as the member representing 
Acadie—Bathurst, I would like to be able to rise in the House of 
Commons and explain the problems and loopholes Bill C-2 
contains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I was elected.  I was elected to do that job and to 
assume those responsibilities.  I was elected to be able to 
attend parliamentary committees, assume my responsibilities, and 
bring up the problems that Bill C-2 brings us.  I was elected to 
be able to introduce motions in the House of Commons, to be able 
to make amendments to Bill C-2, which does not go far enough.  I 
was elected to do all that in the House of Commons.  This seat 
belongs to Acadie—Bathurst.  It does not belong to the member, 
but to the people of Acadie—Bathurst.  Because of that, I ought 
to be able to stand up and be heard in committee.  I ought to be 
able to make amendments to government bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not belong to the Liberals alone.  It belongs to all 
Canadians.  Canadians chose to send members to the House to 
represent them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate.  When the Bill C-2 was introduced into the 
House, there was only one day of debate and that was it.  It is 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have just told us we abuse the system on this side 
of the House.  Yet, in the case of their bill on young offenders, 
the Liberals had over 100 amendments, and they hold the power. 
Shall we call them abusers because they drafted a bad bill and 
realized they had missed the boat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it costs the government any more if I am here 
this evening debating one of its motions. That is why I was 
elected. I was not elected to go home, but to be here to debate 
the problems of concern to Canadians and the people of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government's attitude is unfortunate.  It is an 
insult to watch the member for Waterloo—Wellington rise and try, 
if I can put it this way, to crucify the entire opposition. They 
say “You are wicked, you are not acting properly, you are 
abusers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to call them abusers because we had to call for 
quorum as the government members were not here?  Each time 
opposition members rise and look for what they are entitled to, 
they are called abusers. 
Yet the Liberals did the same thing when they were in opposition; 
they tried to draw the government's attention to the fact that it 
was headed in the wrong direction. That is what the opposition 
wanted to do; it was trying to convince the government that it 
was not going in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, they are not acting properly. The Liberals 
will not wait to undertake parliamentary reform together with us, 
and debate it in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the New Democratic Party whip. The whips and House leaders 
of all the parties thought that parliamentary reform would take 
place. All of sudden, the government House leader comes up with a 
motion that basically says “You are a bunch of abusers, we will 
pass a motion”. Whatever happened to democracy? Were we not 
supposed to work together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you were on this side of the House— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  You are going to have a heart attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  I will say it again.  He said that I am 
going to have a heart attack.  If I have a heart attack because I 
am working for the people of Acadie—Bathurst, I might as well 
drop now and I will be proud of it.  He should not worry about 
me.  I will take care of myself. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the government stop playing these games. It 
must give an opportunity to the other parties to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disgrace. The Liberals' excuse is that the opposition 
did not want to pass Bill C-2 on employment insurance. They came 
up with a measly 5% when people back home are in the gap from 
February to May. Yet they know we need to get rid of the 
intensity rule. As for us, in the opposition, we will act 
responsibly. We will represent our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no business saying we are abusers. I will 
never accept that from members opposite. 
I will never accept this, because I was elected to represent the 
people of Acadie—Bathurst, and I am going to represent them to 
the best of my ability.  I am not going to be swayed and 
intimidated by the people across the way, by the Liberals, I 
guarantee it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a democracy.  This is not the United Kingdom; this is 
Canada.  We do not need to follow the example of the United 
Kingdom.  We can build on our own experience and work together. I 
am sure that if we were to sit down at the same table and try to 
find solutions to certain problems, we would come up with 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe if the opposition turns up with a string of amendments, it 
is because the government's bill does not make any sense.  What 
can the opposition do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall one tactic that was used once:  one opposition party 
refused to enter the House of Commons.  They ignored three or 
four bells. Some will say that this was perhaps not right, but 
others will say that at least they made their point and that 
Canadians had a chance to hear it.

amendments.

the House of Commons, and we do not need the Liberals to shut us 
up.  That is one thing that we will not stand for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am particularly interested in this topic and I wonder if you 
would inquire of the House whether there is unanimous consent to 
give me unlimited time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will try to squeeze my 
remarks into the 20 minutes that are available to me.  Let me see 
if I have it straight.  We are gathered here to debate the right 
of the opposition in this case to force the entire House of 
Commons of Canada to spend hundreds of hours voting on important 
motions like changing a period to a comma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand what I am listening to, that is what we are 
doing right now.  I have some sympathy for that debate.  Some 
members may not know that I was the opposition house leader in 
the legislature of Manitoba.  Certainly the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre knows this.  I have great sympathy for the 
opposition and its need to have tools that allow it to force 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I listen to the debate with some sense of 
concern.  In every place, whether it is the legislature of 
Manitoba or this great chamber, there are two conversations that 
go on.  There is the conversation that goes on here with the TV 
cameras turned on, with the lights on and with <I>Hansard</I> 
turned on to record all of our remarks, and then there is the 
conversation that takes place in the corridors, behind the 
curtains and in the coffee shops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know a member of any party who thinks it is a good idea 
for us to spend hundreds of hours standing and sitting to vote on 
frivolous motions.  When we get away from the hot atmosphere here 
and the attempts to embarrass each other and all that kind of 
silly debate, I have not heard anyone who feels it is a 
productive use of our limited time to spend the time we do on 
issues of this sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put some of this in context.  I too worry about 
excessive use of time allocation.  I too worry about the tools 
the government has available to drive legislation through without 
proper examination or proper debate.  I too worry about a House 
where one side becomes so powerful that it need not take into 
consideration any other opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is legitimate concern that this parliament, like 
legislatures and parliaments around the world, has evolved into a 
tool that permits the government to do exactly that, to impose 
its will on parliament without having to give proper 
consideration of debate on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However to every action there is a reaction.  Oppositions have 
resorted, in part because they have limited tools available, to 
these rather frivolous and extreme kinds of actions to make their 
case, to a point where it makes all of us look silly.

fame was that he actually voted on every amendment because he 
could run in and out to the bathroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into some of the solutions that I think exist to 
this problem, let me try to provide a bit of a context and be 
quite serious about it.  I spend a lot of time thinking about it, 
as I know other members of the House do.  I have had very lengthy 
and, I think, fruitful conversations with the House leader for 
the New Democratic Party, who is one of the more experienced and 
distinguished members of the House.  He has spent a lot of time 
here and is very thoughtful on these issues.  I respect his 
advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is how do we get here?  I would argue that 
there are whole bunch of forces at play.  One of them is that the 
speed of life, the speed of business, the speed of change, the 
need for decision, everything in the external world is moving 
faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Gates, in his most recent book, describes the decade that 
we are now in as the decade of velocity, the decade in which the 
major challenge to everyone will be to manage rapidity, the speed 
at which things have to happen.  This just did not occur at the 
millennium.  This increasing speed has been going on throughout 
our lifetime.  It has been going on throughout history and has 
accelerated to a pace where changes take place within the context 
of one generation.  They are intergenerational.  They are 
multiple changes within a single generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, there has been enormous pressure on the 
institutions of government to respond quickly to changing 
circumstances in the external world and to changing circumstances 
in the communities within which our citizens to whom we are 
accountable live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time, slowly but sequentially and invidiously, the 
governing side of the House has adopted a series of tools that 
allow it to move its agenda forward faster and allow it to clear 
it quickly.  It is worthy of recognition that this has taken away 
some time for thought.  It has taken away some tools that the 
opposition had to force more debate and to slow down the speed 
with which something could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the debate on reform of this chamber is an important 
one.  It is a debate that needs to go on now.  However, I do 
separate it from this motion.  One of the reasons I feel 
comfortable doing this is that we have commitments now.  To talk 
about reform is not idle chatter.  It is not a hopeful thought. 
It is in the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne, the government said it recognized 
there was an issue.  In fact let me read it because I think it is 
important to focus on this part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I admire a great deal about our current Prime 
Minister is this workmanlike, piece by piece, step by step 
approach to solving problems.  There is no fancy banner waving. 
There is the problem and how we are going to find a 
solution.  That is what I see here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutions of Government will continue to be strengthened. 
Since 1993, the Government has taken a range of measures to 
enable members of Parliament to more effectively represent the 
views of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new session of Parliament, the Government will make 
further proposals to improve procedures in the House and Senate. 
Among other measures, voting procedures will be modernized in the 
House of Commons and, to assist parliamentarians in carrying out 
their duties, the Government intends to increase the resources of 
the Library of Parliament to better serve the research needs of 
standing committees of the House and Senate.

the House and in his speech, his personal commitment to the 
House, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like any human institution, the House of Commons is not perfect. 
It can be strengthened.  Over the years many changes have been 
made to improve parliament and more will be made to bring 
parliament into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader is working with his colleagues from all parties 
on reforms that will make the House work even better for the 
benefit of all Canadians— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a commitment.  That is not idle backroom chatter.  I am 
satisfied with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg North Centre mentioned some of my 
feelings about this in her speech.  She wondered how I could be 
defending this motion today.  I am very comfortable defending 
this motion.  I am tired of being part of a process that looks so 
foolish, so stupid and has common Canadians scratching their 
heads saying “What are you guys doing?”  This is a bogus 
procedure.  It is one that destroys good work. It wastes 
important time of which we have too little.  I have no qualms at 
all about getting rid of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the tool we have chosen to moderate it?  We did not say 
it cannot be done because report stage motions are an important 
tool.  What we do in this motion is reaffirm power and authority 
already held by the Speaker.  We do not give it to the government 
or to the government House leader.  We give it to a colleague who 
has been elected by all members of the House and who has a 
majority support in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That colleague is not charged under the motion simply to dismiss 
opposition motions.  The Speaker, as the speaker in Westminster 
has done, is empowered to examine those motions.  If the Speaker 
feels the government is being too harsh and too forceful in 
driving things through, he or she can allow all sorts of motions, 
or if it is felt they are frivolous, he or she may dismiss them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It empowers one of the modern day democratic reforms.  It was 
not that long ago when the House finally got itself together 
enough to take an individual who used to be an appointment of the 
government's side and said “No, we are going to give this person 
power independent of the government”.  That is the position that 
the motion adds to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reflect a little on what may come now because I heard 
a couple of things.  I could close my ears to the silliness which 
I thought was coming.  Actually maybe that is a bad word to use. 
I will apologize for using that word.  I do not mean to demean 
the comments of other members in that sense.  Having been in 
opposition and having been forced to sometimes stand and 
criticize things I felt positively about, it is very hard at 
times to feel comfortable doing that.  I realize members are 
trying to protect a principle of accountability.  However, what 
they are trying to defend is something that is so frivolous. 
They have to be very hard in their hearts to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to pick that apart and hear some of the other things 
that were being said.  There was a comment about the recent vote 
on the ethics counsellor.  There is a saying that a friend of 
mine has on a poster on his office wall.  It reads “For every 
complex problem there is a simple answer and it is wrong”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem which arises when we approach changes in the 
House lightly.  We can all see one little thing that we think is 
important and needs to be changed.  We can all come up with an 
answer on how to change that one little thing that bothers us at 
this moment in time.  That is not how the House got where it is 
today. 
That is not how the rules, the procedures, the precedents and all 
the things that allow us to work in the chamber have evolved.  It 
takes time.  It takes thought.  It takes reflection.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the place in our country that manages power and 
authority in the lives of all of our citizens.  This is the 
Chamber in this country that gives citizens their rights.  This 
is an important debate which should be approached carefully and 
thoughtfully.  It needs to be approached with the full 
involvement of all members of the House.  However it has to work 
both ways.  We all have to recognize the demands being imposed 
upon us externally.  The House needs to modernize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add another dimension to this issue.  I will go 
back to Mr. Gates for a minute.  Mr. Gates talks about the 
tremendous impact that new communication information technologies 
have had on the world.  He calls it the 1980s, the decade of 
quality.  As these new tools became more ubiquitous and more 
people used them and feedback loops were developed, people could 
begin to manage in real time the quality process that affected 
their business, or manufacturing, or service organization or 
whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He calls the nineties the decade of re-engineering.  As these 
tools got more robust and as the accumulation of data got 
stronger and the ability to strike knowledge from that data got 
stronger, suddenly we saw in very large organizations very 
similar changes.  It was like a stepping down into flatter, 
faster organizations moving certain kinds of decisions out to the 
periphery of contact with customers and clients and drawing some 
kind of information into the centre to involve senior management 
more directly in decision making.  These were radical but 
important changes.  These were changes that increased service 
quality, product quality and lowered costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can take members back a step to that little paradigm I would 
ask them what the quality movement meant for government.  It 
happened in the external community.  Where are the quality 
circles, the service feedback and the client operation 
improvement systems in government?  They do not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has re-engineering meant in government?  God knows there 
have been enough consultants running around the country selling 
packages on re-engineering usually trying to bolt crude private 
sector models, which continuously fail, onto public institutions. 
Government is a fundamentally more complex organization than the 
largest business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the restructuring, the re-engineering, the change that 
has taken place in government?  As the world has speeded up and 
as this tremendous change has taken place in the external 
environment that affects the lives of everybody we serve, how has 
this institution changed?  The answer is, it has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Re-engineering in government since the late eighties and up 
until now has meant privatization.  It has meant separating 
those things that government delivers from government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was an advocate of it when I first came here.  I chaired the 
transport committee when the ports were privatized.  I bought all 
the arguments.  I thought we could put them out there so they 
could be fast and responsive.  They could deal with the 
community, respond to local conditions and all those wonderful 
service things.  What were we really saying?  We were saying that 
government was too slow, too stupid, too inept to be useful in 
the lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the challenge to us.  I am talking about every single 
person in the House.  I am talking about this institution.  I am 
talking about every single Canadian because this place affects 
every single Canadian.  The challenge that confronts us is how 
we make the instruments of democracy more useful for everybody. 
That is the debate we are starting.  I suspect it is a debate 
that is going to go on for a long time because it is a huge 
challenge in governments all around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem I have is the attempt here to personalize this. This 
is the Prime Minister's issue.  This is the House leader's issue. 
That is nonsense.  This is an issue that every democratic 
government on this globe is struggling with and failing in right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge challenge, a much bigger challenge than anyone 
really fully comprehends yet.  I am excited about it.  Let us 
debate those changes.

accountability and control over the important instruments that 
affect the lives of Canadians.  We should stop debating the 
importance of this entire House standing and sitting for 400 
hours to change a comma.  That is silly.  We all know it is 
silly, so let us stop it and get on with what I believe will be 
the most important piece of work the House does in this decade. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very happy to speak to the 
motion because it bespeaks a continuation of what we were 
dealing with earlier today, the undemocratization of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from across party lines have for years eloquently 
described the frustration of being an MP.  There is the 
frustration of going home and speaking to the people who sent us 
to the House, listening to their concerns and feeling impotent in 
our ability to represent their concerns in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the basic idea and principle of the motion put 
forth by the government that we do not want to have a situation 
where frivolous amendments are put forth merely to drag the House 
into a prolonged period of irrelevant action.  On the other hand, 
as my colleague for Elk Island has said, we cannot allow the 
rights of the minorities to be compromised.  That is what we are 
talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the rights of the minorities, but the rights of 
the majority.  We have a situation today where the House is ruled 
by a Prime Minister who has an iron hammerlock upon the goings on 
of the House and of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public understands that and we understand that.  That is why 
we saw voter turnout of less than 60% in the last federal 
election.  That is not something to be proud of.  That is 
something that should be a red flag that says we need to do 
something to engage the public.  We need to do something to bring 
back the confidence that people should have in this great 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over decades this institution has whittled away.  The democratic 
powers of elected members have been removed year after year.  The 
late Prime Minister Trudeau said something to the effect that members of 
parliament are nobodies 100 feet off the Hill.  I suggest that 
members of parliament are nobodies on the Hill and that is the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public understands that and we understand that if we are to 
be truthful about it.  The fact of the matter is that there are 
good people across party lines who have great things to 
contribute for the betterment of Canadians from coast to coast, 
but they do not have the power to represent their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we are accountable.  Every four years we are 
accountable.  However during that intervening period of time do 
we really have the power to represent our constituents so that 
people can adequately judge us on the actions that we engage in? 
No, we do not because we do not have the power to represent our 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen over the years the corpses of members of parliament 
lying beside House because they have tried to do the right thing. 
They have tried to represent their constituents and to represent 
their conscience.  When that falls afoul of the leaders of 
parties they are emasculated, rendered impotent, and at the worst 
level they are thrown out of their party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can forget John Nunziata, who on a matter of principle, a 
matter of conscience and indeed the issue of the GST and a 
government promise, said he could not support the government on 
the particular issue?  It violated a promise that he made when he 
was elected.  As a result of doing that he was thrown out of the 
caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the situation faced by every political party today to 
varying degrees.  It is something we have to change.  Members of 
my party have put up ideas such as the ethics counsellor.  We put 
forth a motion to give the government an opportunity to vote for 
the promise that it made to the Canadian people in the first red 
book.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government voted against its own promise of having an 
independent ethics counsellor.   We do not want an ethics 
counsellor who answers to the Prime Minister; neither do the 
members from the other side.  What we should have is an ethics 
counsellor who is independent of the Prime Minister and who 
responds to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that with this motion the Prime Minister will 
exercise more undue and unnecessary control over the House and 
further strengthen his hold so that decisions will further be 
made by the Prime Minister and his office staff, who are a group 
of unelected, unaccountable and invisible individuals who rule 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the public watching today may not know or 
understand that the structure we have created today prevents and 
inhibits their views, wishes and desires from being exercised in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another serious problem is that we do not have any free votes. 
We talk about it but in effect we do not debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees, by and large, are make work projects for members of 
parliament, and the health committee is a case in point.  We have 
a crisis in our health care system today.  Over the years members 
from across party lines have, as has the NDP critic for health, 
stood shoulder to shoulder with us.  We may have a difference of 
opinion on what needs to be done to fix the problem but we 
certainly stand shoulder to shoulder in saying that we need to 
look at it.  We need to examine it and implement effective 
solutions to save our publicly funded health care system. Given 
the fact that this is the biggest problem affecting Canadians, 
not an academic issue but a blood and guts issue where people's 
lives are at stake, we have a government that has directed the 
committee to study plain packaging of cigarettes, aboriginal 
health and other issues that, while important, pale in comparison 
to the overarching issue of how we manage to save our public 
health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government dealing with the issue of our aging 
population?  We have an aging population and a demographic that 
will turn all our social programs on their end, from CPP to 
health care, to other social programs.  It is an impending crisis 
that looms on the horizon.  The failure to deal with our aging 
population and the impact upon our social programs, and indeed on 
our economy, will have such a profound impact on our society that 
we will not be able to deal with it and those people who are the 
poorest in our society, the most vulnerable, from the aged to the 
young, are the ones who will get hurt.  The only way to deal with 
that is to deal with it proactively.  We cannot deal with it in a 
knee-jerk reactive mode.  We have to deal with these problems 
proactively because it takes time to develop the solutions and 
enact them.  If we do not do it now people will be hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the environment, Canada has been repeatedly told 
that we have some serious environmental problems.  We need to 
address them but are we?  No.  We go through this mill that goes 
around and around.  Ideas are tossed around in a big circle and 
they go nowhere quickly.  Our failure to deal with these issues 
causes untold hardship to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in our health care system who are watching their rivers 
being polluted by a minority of the industrialists who dump 
garbage into our rivers and streams want to know why the 
government is not dealing with it.  What do they hear?  They hear 
the sound of silence. They hear nothing.  Does that engender 
respect and a willingness to engage and work with the government? 
Does that engender a desire to get involved in the political 
process?  No, it does not.  In fact, most people want to get 
involved but they recognize that the House does not work and that 
maybe they should find other ways to exercise their democratic 
rights.  Unfortunately, too many people have become so apathetic 
that they are not getting involved at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason that we have this situation is the unwritten 
code of conduct we have in the House, a code that rewards 
zealotry over objectiveness and  a code that says if our ideas, 
our objectivity and our professional training run adverse to the 
leadership, we must be removed or follow blindly what we have 
been told. 
It is a code of conduct that says one must blindly follow the 
leadership of their party.  It is a code that excludes external 
information from other sources when they run adverse to what the 
leadership of the party says.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is disingenuous.  We have a system that naturally rewards 
being able to destroy the other side.  Indeed, the role of the 
opposition is to keep the government on its toes.  It is to be 
the toughest critic of the government that can be found, but it 
should not and must not preclude the ability of members in every 
political party to engage in constructive and positive discourse 
for the betterment of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot use our God given brains, if we cannot engage and 
pull out the best and brightest ideas from the people of our 
country, if we cannot stimulate and inspire the people of our 
nation to bring forth and have acted upon their ideas to make 
Canada the best nation in the world, what are we here for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot do that right now.  We are seeing cracks develop in 
our great nation.  We talk about western alienation.  We talk 
about the well known disaffection of the west, but it is not the 
only alienation.  We have eastern alienation.  We have the 
maritimers saying that what goes on in Ottawa has very little to 
do with them.  They feel left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have rural alienation.  We have a rural-urban split that is 
not well analyzed or spoken about.  The rural alienation is very 
real.  A lot of people who provide the economic backbone of the 
country are forgotten about. Because of a lack of health care, a 
lack of resources and an abysmal or a non-existence 
infrastructure on the part of the government, we have people who 
are turned off, tuned out, and  have a great deal of antipathy 
toward the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have aboriginal alienation, large swaths of aboriginal 
communities who are suffering the worst possible social 
parameters in the country today.  That has been going on for too 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party has been wrongfully accused of being against grassroots 
aboriginal people.  We are the only party which has given 
the grassroots aboriginal people a vector, a voice in the House. 
We are not as interested in advocating for the leadership they 
have as we are in ensuring that the wishes, the hopes and the 
fears of grassroots aboriginal people are brought into the House 
in the most eloquent and forceful terms possible.  We have tried 
to do that time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  We will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  As my colleague says, we will continue 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have francophone alienation.  Part of the reason we have such 
a terrible situation historically in Quebec is a lack of 
communication.  There is justifiable alienation on the part of 
the Quebec people, the francophonie in this entire country, 
because they too have not been listened to.  If we scratch the 
surface of many separatists we find some very real concerns, some 
very real desires to reform the country and to make it a better 
place for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we need to listen to and we need to address.  It is 
not rocket science.  The government needs to listen to what these 
people are saying.  It needs to go to their territory, their 
homes and their communities to ask them what they are saying and 
to listen to what they are saying.  Lo and behold it will find 
that many of the communities across the country are saying the 
same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not subscribe to the notion that we have different types of 
species of Canadians.  We do not have homo sapiens British 
Columbiensis, homo sapiens Maritimiensis or homo sapiens 
Ontarioensis.  We have one Canadian and one Canada.  The hopes, 
the fears and the concerns of people from coast to coast, whether 
they are westerners, Ontarians, people from the prairies, 
maritimers, aboriginals, non-aboriginals, immigrants, 
non-immigrants, rural people or city folk, their hopes, their 
fears and their concerns are the same.

akin to the third world?  Why do we accept three and a half year 
waits to see an orthopedic surgeon?  Why do we accept health care 
that approaches that of a second world nation?  Why do we accept 
our best and brightest leaving the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not and do not accept the level of mediocrity the 
government has been trying to sell to the Canadian people, and 
the people are not buying it.  We can aspire to much more.  It is 
not complex.  Effective constructive solutions exist that must be 
applied in a quick, rapid and effective fashion to address the 
problems.  If we do so, we will be able to aspire to more than we 
have and to build a country that provides a better future for all 
Canadians and especially for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the things we can do?  Many members in my 
caucus have put forth constructive solutions.  Our House leader 
put forth many.  My colleagues from British Columbia and Alberta 
and members from across party lines have put forth constructive 
solutions, and some have done so for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have fought for free votes in the House of Commons, and I 
mean true free votes.  No bill can be made a vote of confidence 
in the government.  If a bill fails because it was not good 
enough, we should send it back to committee and fix the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also reform the committee structure.  Why have a 
committee structure that is a make work project for MPs?  We 
should give the committees a greater say.  We should let them 
have greater flexibility in what they study.  We should let them 
address the big issues.  We should not allow parliamentary 
secretaries to act as mini whips who force government members to 
vote in a certain way.  We should have secret votes for committee 
chairmen so that the best person across party lines has an 
opportunity to chair the committee.  Then we would have the most 
effective committee possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should expand private members' business.  The public might be 
fascinated to know that members of parliament can get private 
members' bills into the House only by lottery.  Names are drawn. 
If members are lucky enough to have their names drawn, their 
bills will go to committee and the committee will decide whether 
the bills are votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other democracy in the entire world allows private members' 
bills to be put forward that are made non-votable. What an 
oxymoron, a non-votable private member's bill.  Why even have a 
private member's bill if it can never become law?  It is a waste 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public may also want to ask why the government gutted the 
legal opportunities and powers we need to put our private 
members' bills together.  They were gutted and removed.  The 
lawyers, the key linchpin in our ability to put private members' 
business forward, were taken away from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time there were only three lawyers for more than 225 
members of parliament, yet the cabinet had more than 70 lawyers 
at its disposal.  That was a sly but effective way of preventing 
private members across party lines from being able to put forth 
bills on behalf of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be given more lawyers to craft our private members' 
bills. We should expand private members' hour by two hours on 
Friday and one hour on Monday.  We should make sure that every 
member of parliament has at least one bill to put forth.

the betterment of everyone here, but more important for the 
benefit of our country, to democratize the House.  If we fail to 
democratize the House we do not deserve the respect of the 
Canadian people.  The House will be nothing but a dictatorship 
that compromises the ability of Canada to be as good as it can 
become.  We need to do this now.  There is cross party support 
for it.  If we do not do it now we do not deserve the respect we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Charleswood St. 
James—Assiniboia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tabled today restates the traditional power of the 
Speaker not to select for report stage debate motions of a 
frivolous, repetitive or vexatious nature.  This is not so 
dramatic or unusual, it seems to me.  Let us consider what the 
motion actually says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage and, in 
exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be guided 
by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the United 
Kingdom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing?  We are moving to the system we used to have. 
We are moving to the system followed by the mother of our 
parliament and of all parliaments, the U.K.  It is not a huge 
change.  We are returning to the original intent of the standing 
orders we now follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that this is the same basic concept and rule 
that is followed by thousands of community organizations across 
the country who use a very well known rule book, <I>Robert's 
Rules of Order</I>.  I will read from <I>Robert's Rules of 
Order</I>, the section dealing with dilatory, absurd or frivolous 
motions.  The intent of the rule, which is used across the 
country by so many organizations, is quite similar to the intent 
of the motion today.  It states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—whenever the chair is satisfied that members are using 
parliamentary forms merely to obstruct business, he should either 
not recognize them, or else rule them out of order.  After the 
chair has been sustained upon an appeal, he should not entertain 
another appeal from the same obstructionists while they are 
engaged evidently in trying by that means to obstruct business. 
While the chair should always be courteous and fair, he should be 
firm in protecting the assembly from imposition, even though it 
be done in strict conformity with all parliamentary rules except 
this one, that no dilatory, absurd, or frivolous motions are 
allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an illustration of a frivolous or absurd motion, suppose Mr. 
A is to be in the city next week and a motion has been made to 
invite him to address the assembly at its next meeting, the 
meetings being weekly.  Now, if a motion is made to refer the 
question to a committee with instructions to report at the next 
regular meeting, the chair should rule it out of order as 
frivolous or absurd. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the rule that is followed all across the country in all 
kinds of democratic organizations.  We are adopting basically the 
same concept with almost the same wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite are up in arms about this, suggesting that it 
will limit important debate.  Is it important that we go on for 
hours voting on questions of whether we should have a comma after 
every word in a bill or whether the bill should be hoisted for 
six months or reconsidered clause by clause?  Such ridiculous 
motions are not intended to change the substance of a bill but 
only to waste the time of the House.  That surely is not why we 
were sent here by our electorates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament members had to vote for days on report 
stage motions because of the abuse of a loophole in the standing 
orders on report stage motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1999 there were over 42 hours of non-stop voting on 
469 report stage motions to amend the Nisga'a bill.  Were they 
really motions to try to improve the or change the bill 
substantively?  No.  The vast majority of them were vexatious, 
repetitive, frivolous motions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 2000 the House spent 36 hours voting on 411 report 
stage motions to amend the clarity bill.  Again they were 
frivolous, vexatious, repetitive motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 2000, just last fall, there were over 3,000 report 
stage amendments to the youth justice bill which would have taken 
two weeks or more to complete in non-stop voting. Let us imagine 
members of parliament spending night and day for two weeks 
standing and sitting in the House to vote on all kinds of 
ridiculous amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public in my riding will not stand for that.  I cannot 
imagine that members opposite can expect their electorate to 
stand for it either.  It is enough that we take the time we do 
standing and sitting in the voting process. It is good that the 
government is looking at the idea of electronic voting to try to 
streamline the voting process. Sometimes it goes on and on and 
on.  It could be done much more efficiently.  Our time could be 
used far better than in this very slow process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the youth justice bill.  I will refer to some of 
those motions.  There were almost 400 motions in Motions Nos. 
2,646 to 3,029 from only 44 members to change the coming into 
force of the provisions of the act.  For example, Motions Nos. 
2,654 and 2,655, one member's motions, had a different coming 
into force proposal for the same section of the act. Another 
member's Motions Nos. 2,657 and 2,658 had a different coming into 
force proposal for the same section of the act.  Motions Nos. 
2,327 to 2,418 included almost 100 motions for the timing of a 
provision, from 691 days to 792 days, increasing one day per 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member who is no longer in the House, Mr. Turp, proposed 
different times for the timing of the same provisions.  Again 
they were silly, frivolous, vexatious and repetitive motions, 
wasting the time of the House and wasting taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 3,030 to 3,133 included over 100 amendments from 
only 44 members requiring a statutory review of various 
provisions of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the point if not to delay things, be obstructionist, 
cause problems, waste taxpayer dollars and waste the time of 
members and the time of the House?  The cost of this abuse is 
completely unacceptable to Canadians who elected us to debate and 
study legislation, not to spend days and days voting on 
frivolous, repetitive and vexatious amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians in my riding and elsewhere across the country are not 
concerned about whether there are 10 commas or 2 commas in a 
sentence. They are concerned about issues like health care, about 
the taxes they pay and about economic growth across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns I heard during the election campaign in Halifax 
West were about the fact that Halifax West was undoubtedly the 
fastest growing area in Atlantic Canada.  We do not have the 
infrastructure to support the growth we have seen over the past 
20 years.  We do not have the new schools that are needed. We 
have children in overcrowded schools and old schools that are 
becoming decrepit.  They need new investment and new schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are concerned about the lack of roads in Halifax West and 
the need for new roads to support this growing area.  They are 
concerned about the need for recreation facilities and the waste 
of their tax dollars.  The last thing they want to see is members 
of parliament wasting $8,000 an hour sitting here overnight 
voting on ridiculous motions.  It is the last thing they want to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want us to be working.  They want us to be looking at how 
departments are spending money and trying to make them work 
better.  They want us to try to make government work better. That 
is the reason we are here.  Let us spend our time focussing on 
what government departments and agencies are doing and trying to 
make them work better.  Goodness knows there is a lot of room for 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of details we must look at in our work as 
watchdogs to get government departments to work better for the 
public.  That surely is our job, not to sit here night after 
night voting all night long on ridiculous motions that wear us 
out and make us unable to do our jobs the next day, or whenever 
it ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cost that is simply unacceptable to taxpayers who have 
to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime costs for the 
House of Commons staff to stay when votes go on through the 
night.

who have to work the extra hours or work overtime.  It may 
endanger their health as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should consider what impact this has on the institutions of 
parliament and how it degrades parliament in the minds of the 
public when it is engaged in silly activities that are clearly 
not constructive or substantive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that members across the way like to find topics to 
raise so they can have time to talk about all kinds of issues 
that are of concern to them.  I appreciate that, but surely to 
waste our time sitting here and voting all night long is not an 
answer to the concerns of their constituents or my constituents. 
Surely we all can see that passing the motion will make our 
parliament more efficient and will help us get to the job at 
hand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, first I want to thank my colleague from 
Halifax West for allowing me to take part in the debate by 
sharing his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I want to say in my remarks, and I want to make 
it very clear, is that I happen to believe very sincerely that 
the opposition parties, not just the official opposition party 
but all parties, play a very important role in the House and in 
parliament.  Their role is just as important as ours, ours being 
the government side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  The Prime Minister runs the show over 
there.  What would be the difference if you weren't here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  What we need is for everyone, wherever 
possible, and if we can change our rules, if we can enhance our 
rules, perhaps we can make— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sure that at 
this hour we all want to hear what the hon. member has to say, so 
I will ask the hon. member to resume debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I hope that 
is not subtracted from my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has just happened in the last few seconds is quite 
instructive.  I started off my remarks by trying to be positive 
and by trying to be complimentary toward the opposition.  The 
opposition does play an important role.  They are just as 
important as those of us on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the member from Alberta immediately brought up the issue 
that the Prime Minister somehow controls every word and 
everything that is said and done in the House, which is totally 
irrelevant, especially in this debate and given the motion that 
is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very intently to the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan 
de Fuca a few minutes ago.  He is one of the more respected 
members of the House.  When he speaks, I like to listen.  I think 
he gave a pretty darn good speech, but almost everything that the 
hon. member said had absolutely nothing to do with the motion 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  I think I can make my case quite clear. 
What are we debating tonight?  We are debating a change in the 
standing orders so that we do not have to deal with these 
frivolous, vexatious motions at report stage, which we have been 
experiencing for the last couple of years.  I think that is a 
very legitimate issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the opposition MPs to address their remarks to the 
motion that is before us.  What did I hear from the hon. member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca?  I wrote it down.  He talked about 
the alleged dictatorship on the part of the Prime Minister.  I do 
not know what that has to do with the motion that is before us. 
He talked about rendering MPs impotent. 
I do not know what that has to do with the motion.  He talked 
about the value of the dollar, the unemployment level, health 
care in Canada and aboriginals in Canada.  He even talked about 
non-votable motions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe in some other debate, maybe in some other context, those 
remarks would be relevant and make a lot of sense, but we are not 
talking about those things.  We are talking about a motion that 
would change the standing orders of the House because we have had 
a problem with these frivolous, nonsensical report stage motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Give us some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Examples?  The best examples are those 
where it is suggested that we change a period to a comma or a 
comma to a period or, as the member for Halifax West mentioned a 
few minutes ago, where one member at one report stage made more 
than 100 motions having to do with the timing of the 
implementation of the bill.  That is frivolous and I do not think 
it should be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the speakers—and I do not know if it was the hon. member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca—said that this particular motion 
before us would somehow aggrandize the power of and add to the 
dictatorship of the Prime Minister.  This has nothing to do with 
the Prime Minister at all.  In fact, if anybody is going to get 
power out of this, it is extra power for the Speaker.  We are 
actually deferring to the elected Speaker of the House to make 
decisions with respect to frivolous, vexatious motions.  It has 
nothing to do with the Prime Minister at all, absolutely zero, 
yet that is the kind of charge we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons that we have this kind of debate is that 
there is a kind of crazy culture in the House.  Everything that 
the government proposes the opposition must criticize.  Somehow 
or other in this culture anything the government does or proposes 
has to be wrong.  In fact if government ever does anything that 
is disagreeable to even one Canadian, the automatic charge that 
comes its way is “You don't listen”.  It is the most familiar 
and common charge one can hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go out and consult 30 million Canadians.  We might even 
find favour with 70% or 80% of them, and guess what?  The 
opposition would say we just were not listening, that we were 
totally irresponsible, and not only that, probably idiotic.  That 
is the kind of culture we have around here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying in one very small way to improve the performance 
of all of us, not just of opposition MPs but of government MPs. 
When we are having debates of this kind, instead of having these 
free-wheeling discussions where any kind of allegation and any 
kind of charge can be brought to the floor, I would suggest that 
we require members, all of us, to talk about the motion before 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember many years ago hearing the story about a debate that 
took place in the House probably 40 to 50 years ago.  It was a 
debate about wheat.  One member stood up.  I know his name but I 
will not mention it.  Apparently in those days members could 
speak for 40 minutes.  The member stood up and talked about wheat 
for 40 minutes and never used the word wheat once, not even once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I mentioned this is that I consider the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca one of the best members in the House, but 
when he can address these frivolous motions we face all the time 
at report stage and talk about the value of the dollar, health 
care, aboriginals and unemployment, what in the name of heaven 
has that got to do with the motion before us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that by tightening up the rules we would all become 
much more responsible.  I think very often that we on the 
government side wander off on crazy tangents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Yes, sometimes.  Yes, we are human and 
we make those mistakes.  Maybe we should have stronger rules, 
forcing us to perform better and to address the issue before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just hope that Canadians who are watching this debate have 
some understanding of what the debate is about.  It is about 
changing the House order to prevent these frivolous, silly 
motions that are brought forward at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine over 400 amendments to the Nisga'a bill in 1999.  We 
spent 42 hours on 469 report stage motions.  A year later in 
2000, we spent 36 hours voting on 411 report stage motions.  It 
makes no sense.  It is silly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are just trying to clean this up, so let us not hear this 
nonsense about dictatorship, about how we are out of control and 
not being responsible.  I think we are being responsible, and I 
think this work we have put forward deserves the support of 
everyone in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege, actually, to be able to 
join in this debate, because I think what we are dealing with 
here is probably one of the most significant elements that has 
hit this House for some time.  That element is parliamentary 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particular issue I will raise is the quotation that I 
believe the member for Winnipeg South used.  I think he took it 
from an office placard that he saw.  I believe it went like this: 
“For every complex problem there is a simple solution”.  It is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that with parliamentary reform we have a very complex 
issue.  It is not something that is going to be resolved simply. 
It will require a major review of a number of things and I 
believe the hon. member for Winnipeg South said as much.  This is 
a complicated issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to ask him a question and unfortunately the rules of 
the House did not allow us to ask questions.  The question I was 
going to ask him was this:  is this not a very simple solution to 
a very complex question?  I think it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good that the Speaker would have the right not to allow 
vexatious and frivolous kinds of amendments.  I have no problem 
with that.  We agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a difficulty, which is why the Canadian 
Alliance put forward an amendment.  Our amendment reads as 
follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>and, for even greater clarity, the Speaker may select for debate 
all motions, regardless of their nature, if in his or her opinion 
the rights of the minority have been infringed upon in any way. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point lies the very heart of the issue.  The essence of 
parliament is to give a voice to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the hon. member for Winnipeg South back in the House and 
it is great to see him nodding his head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our purpose here.  It is to make this place relevant.  A 
number of speakers here this afternoon said that parliament, for 
many people, has become irrelevant.  That is a serious indictment 
on every one of us here.  We should be able to debate in such a 
way that it is relevant to virtually everyone in Canada, whether 
we are on the opposition side of the House or the government side 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address my remarks in that regard.  I will refer to the 
hon. Minister of Finance.  Not too long ago the Minister of 
Finance made a comment in a speech.  I will read the exact 
paragraph that he used.  The Minister of Finance said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been discussing the role of Parliament in enshrining the 
values of the nation and its response to change.  This is an 
empty debate unless it recognizes the role of the 
parliamentarians themselves—in our case the 301 members of the 
current House of Commons...MPs must have the opportunity to truly 
represent both their consciences and constituencies.

responsible position in the government.  I really admire that he 
said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question then is will this kind of a motion bring about a 
stronger and more effective voice for parliamentarians?  It will 
if vexatious motions are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons why there are these, by some definitions 
frivolous or vexatious, motions is because there is frustration 
on the part of parliamentarians.  They cannot express themselves 
the way they want to.  They cannot give voice to the people. 
They cannot vote in the interests of their constituents.  Why is 
this? The hon. members opposite know only too well what I am 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer back to the position of the Prime Minister.  The 
Prime Minister stood in the House and said, “I am only an 
ordinary MP looking after the interests of my constituency”. The 
Prime Minister is not an ordinary MP.  The Prime Minister is a 
very special person with unique powers.  The Prime Minister has 
the power to appoint supreme court judges, senators and all the 
ministers of the crown.  The Prime Minister also has the right to 
take away those appointments.  He can shift around particular 
positions.  He is not an ordinary member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when the Prime Minister exercises certain powers 
over members of parliament that deny them the responsibility and 
the opportunity to exercise their representative power of their 
constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember clearly the vote that took place in the House on the 
remuneration for hepatitis C victims.  I am sure all members of 
the House know that there are people on that side of the House 
who voted against what they had been fighting for and what they 
knew was the right thing to do.  Why did they do this?  They were 
told they must toe the party line.  That is wrong.  That is a 
denial of the democratic principles of the House.  That is what 
we are decrying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was not this kind of frustration, there would be no 
need for all kinds of frivolous and vexatious motions.  These are 
expressions of something else that is wrong.  We cannot fix a 
complex problem by taking one little item and changing it and 
think that all the other things are going to go away.  They will 
not go away.  The problems are inherent in the system.  The 
system has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has to be accountable to parliament.  We had 
a very recent example that happened in this 37th parliament.  A 
red book promise was given to the people of Canada about 
appointing an ethics counsellor by parliament and having that 
ethics counsellor report to parliament.  The Prime Minister said 
that was what they were going to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came to a vote in the House of Commons to give effect to 
and implement that particular promise, what did the Prime 
Minister do?  He said his party would vote against that motion, 
thus denying an opportunity for the ethics counsellor to become 
the truly impartial, objective person who could evaluate what the 
Prime Minister was doing and what other ministers might do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what frustrates us.  That is what makes it impossible 
for parliamentarians to do what they were elected to do.  That is 
serious business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to address one other issue.  This comes out of a study 
that was done by Queen's University.  I am sure there are members 
opposite who know only too well that particular institution, an 
institution of great learning and one I respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  You're too smart for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  I would like to address the hon. 
member for Winnipeg South because he understands this university 
very well.  He probably knows many of the people who teach there. 
I would like to refer to this particular study entitled, 
“Searching for Good Governance”. 
I am going to quote a couple of paragraphs from this particular 
study.  Bill Stanbury in 1994 concluded that the present system 
of cabinet government was seriously flawed with respect to one of 
its most widely cited virtues, accountability. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT127"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT127"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2105
<A HREF="#LINKT128"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT126"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just talked about exactly that.  Accountability is the 
issue.  It is not vexatious or frivolous motions that come to us. 
Those are byproducts of a much bigger problem which is 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Stanbury went on to say “Little useful information is 
disclosed that would permit the voters to properly assess the 
performance of the government.  The ability of parliament and 
voters to hold accountable the cabinet and the rest of the 
executive is highly limited”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about today and it is very 
significant.  The issue is the accountability of parliament and 
the accountability of the Prime Minister and ministers of the 
crown.  He argued that between elections a majority government 
was ultimately constrained only by self-restraint, a form of 
self-regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that self-regulation that is talked about here is 
nothing more and nothing less than the self-regulation of the 
Prime Minister himself.  It is the Prime Minister's office that 
decides what will or will not happen.  Mr. Stanbury went on to 
say “The government often controls the means of monitoring its 
performance.  It controls much of the quantity, quality and type 
of information available.  It is unlikely to admit non-performance 
and will do its best to conceal bad performance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his book <I>Checks Unbalanced: The Quiet Side of Public 
Spending</I>, Herman Leonard wrote: “Civilized people go to great 
lengths to avoid having to confront unpleasant news and 
uncomfortable feeling.  But when we practice avoidance and 
obfuscation in public affairs, the consequences reach us all.  A 
civilized penchant to look away. The willingness of some to hide 
and of others to tolerate the hiding of the public's business is 
on its face antithetical to our society.  Society's fundamental 
governing precept, governing by the informed consent of the 
governed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a major insight but very important for us to realize. 
That is at the heart of what we are debating here today, that we 
make parliament relevant so that every Canadian can say it is a 
place where their representatives can tell the people what it is 
that they want done in a democratic form.  They will take their 
view from the majority position but they want their voice heard 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the point that he is making.  He is saying that if 
information is not given or if it is somehow obfuscated or it is 
adulterated in some way, electors no longer make an informed 
decision about who can represent them.  That is what that is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to the accountability of expenditures.  This is 
probably even more significant than anything else I have said so 
far.  The authors of the study concluded: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the “bottom line” focus of accountability in the media 
is the general budget presentation of the deficit by the Minister 
of Finance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a budget right now but we do have the rest of 
this which does apply.  It is a well established practice that 
the media takes the bottom line from the budget presentation by 
the minister.  It provides an incentive to manipulate the 
presentation of the general accounts to give the impression of 
better performance in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study further stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, spending might be shifted “off-budget” to an 
independent agency such as a Crown corporation, or into a loan 
guarantee as opposed to a direct subsidy, to reduce the 
“deficit” registered in the general accounts.  Alternatively, 
accounts might even be made to look worse in order to make more 
dramatic an expected improvement.  It is well-known that new 
governments tend to attribute as much responsibility for deficits 
as possible to the previous political managers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times have we seen that in the House?   We have seen it 
over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to state that preliminary work done by Postner 
emphasized the need for a consolidated budget, a budget that 
would provide a unified presentation of all government 
activities, including general government activities, trust fund 
activities such as public sector pension plans and enterprise 
type activities such as crown corporations.

<A HREF="#LINKT127"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so it would help to illuminate the complete financial 
picture of the government and diminish the potential to shift 
activities off budget to conceal politically embarrassing 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the heart of the issue.  We are unable to assess 
accurately whether the information we are getting in the 
budget document is an accurate description of where the 
government has spent its money and how much it has spent.  We do 
not know and we cannot know because the accounting system is such 
that it does not accrue the total expenditures.  They are 
expenditures that take place off budget.  They are still a 
liability to the government.  It has spent the money but it does 
not appear in the budget that as presented to the media and the 
public.  It is not an accurate reflection of the real financial 
position of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is at the heart of the frustration which we are 
experiencing.  We can argue about free votes.  We can talk about 
the role of committees and amendments.  If we do not deal with 
the fundamental issue of representation of our constituents, of 
our consciences in this place, we are denying the fundamental 
principle of democracy.  That is what we need to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say one more thing with regard to the whole 
business of reforming parliament.  We must first of all recognize 
that we are Canadians, that we are here as a democracy, a 
democracy that has stood the test of time, a democracy that is in 
a crisis situation right now and a democracy where many people 
are saying it is no longer relevant and they really do not care. 
That is a serious indictment.  We must care because the iron law 
of politics applies to us and to every Canadian.  Those who 
choose not to get involved are bound to be governed by those who 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for each of us to work together and to work 
through the principles of true democracy.  This is where people 
are elected on the merits, platform and philosophies they 
present.  They are elected on the basic principles and policies 
that they stand for, that they will implement when given the 
reins of power and that we can depend on those people to do what 
they said they would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Sounds like a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  The hon. member cries that it is the 
Liberal way.  That is not the Liberal way.  I just gave the House 
an example that said clearly that a promise was given to appoint 
an ethics counsellor.  He would be appointed by parliament and 
report to parliament.  The Liberals denied that.  They voted 
against it.  That is what the Liberals did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor should have been appointed by parliament. 
He should have been given that kind of power.  If they 
did not want to do it then, they should do it now.  It would have 
been far better for the government in power today to have put 
that kind of motion before us.  We could all have supported that 
motion, not this kind of motion which does not get to the heart 
of the issue and which deals with peripheral duties.  The real 
frustration comes from these other issues.  That is what we need 
to keep in place and recognize that it is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point has come for us to realize that many of us in the 
House, and I have spoken to several members on various 
committees, whether it is from this side of the House or from the 
government side are asking what in the world they are here for? 
They feel they are wasting their time.  They say the minister 
tells them the bill they will be voting on or the legislation 
they will be dealing with.  They cannot make any amendments to 
it.  They cannot determine who the witnesses will be.  To some 
degree there is some flexibility but by and large, if the 
minister does not want, or if the Prime Minister does not want, 
certain witnesses to appear, they will not appear, 
notwithstanding the committee has the power under legislation to 
subpoena people.  However, what happens?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the frustration.  We need to come to grips with the 
realities of giving to the parliamentarians meaningful work, 
inside and outside committees.  We need to allow them to vote the 
way they want to vote and allow them to express what needs to be 
done.  That is consistent with what the people want them to do. 
That is at the heart of the issue.  I am pleading for the House 
to reform parliament to make that possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to some of the members opposite and I half expect 
someone in a red or blue cape to come flying through here.  They 
just have all the solutions and all the answers.  Frankly, I find 
it a little bit tiresome and a little bit frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, here are a couple of facts.  We are sitting here and it 
is 9.15 p.m.  On a normal sitting day the House would have been 
recessed by approximately 6.30 p.m.  We will be here until 11.30 
or 12 o'clock tonight at least.  Just so people know, the cost to 
run this place beyond the regular hour is somewhere around 
$25,000 per hour.  The debate this evening will cost the Canadian 
taxpayer, for whom I assume my friend from the Bloc could not 
care less, about $125,000.  I just wanted to make the cost clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have the motion?  Other members have stood up and said 
to speak to the motion.  We have sat in this place through 24 
hours of not debating and not talking but simply voting on 
motions that would make absolutely no difference to the 
legislation or to the quality of the legislation.  They would 
have no impact on the end product. They do nothing more than 
delay.  To sit here doing that is not just a waste of money, it 
is an abuse of the democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite want to talk about ways to reform this 
place, why do we not start with this motion?  The motion is 
indeed parliamentary reform.  The motion says to my hon. friends 
opposite that if they want to filibuster and stand in their place 
and talk with at least a modicum of intelligence about the 
particular issue involved they can do so.  They have that 
opportunity.  In the good old days, filibuster meant talking out 
the issue, debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a member of the Ontario legislature I recall sitting 
through filibusters that would last a day or two.  I may not have 
liked it or agreed with it but I had to respect the ability of 
parliamentarians to stand in their place in opposition to the 
government of the day.  Whether we were members of the opposition 
or members of the government, we had to respect the ability of 
the individual to stay on topic and talk about the issue that was 
of concern to their constituents and, in that example, to the 
people of the entire province, and in this example, all of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we had?  We have had a major debate.  The one that 
comes to mind is the Nisga'a treaty.  The opposition did not 
agree with us.  It did not like the treaty and did not like what 
we were doing.  I did not have a problem with that.  It is 
totally within its rights and its purview to disagree with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the opposition submitted hundreds of amendments that 
were—and I love the word—vexatious, which means annoying.  They 
did not change the treaty one bit and did not change the outcome 
of the government legislation one iota. They simply required the 
government to stay here and vote on periods, commas and 
semicolons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, really, is that what Canadians elected any of us in this 
place to do?  Absolutely not.  Canadians may have some respect 
for a member opposite who could stand up and clause by clause, 
line by line, word by word, go through that particular bill and 
explain to the Canadian public why he or she is against a 
particular bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care what bill it is.  I have served in opposition and 
I have served in government.  I respect the responsibility and 
the important role that opposition must play in this kind of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothers me, though, is that when the opposition today does 
not like what the government is doing it says that it does not 
like the process.  When it says it does not like the process 
means it lost.  Rather than argue the substantive impact of the 
motion, the bill or the document before parliament, members of 
the opposition cry foul that somehow the big, bad Prime Minister 
whipped them.  He has chains and runs racks in the back room 
where they are tortured mercilessly.  Their brains are taken and 
put in jars somewhere when they arrive.  They just denigrate the 
role of MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am here in the nation's capital as a member of 
parliament, like many of my colleagues on all sides of the House 
I work between 12 and 18 hours a  day. Our day starts very early 
with committee meetings, working in caucuses and working with 
opposition members.  We find quite interestingly that in spite of 
the theatre which goes on in here, when we get members of 
parliament from all across Canada sitting in committee talking 
over issues they can actually be reasonable.  I wonder why they 
are not like that in the House of Commons.  Why can we not work 
together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone from the NDP asked when we would start to work together. 
I was at the HRDC committee the other day talking about Bill C-2 
and changes to the employment insurance bill.  At that time I 
questioned the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the construction 
trade unions that were before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the chamber why, when the country is in a recession, 
when the government supports all people who lose their jobs and 
when the EI account is in major deficit, we do not hear from it? 
Why does it not say that it knows the account is in deficit and 
it will pay more?  We do not hear from the chamber in that 
instance, because it is the responsibility of the government to 
be the insurer of last resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that a question that someone might expect from a government 
member?  I think not, because I think some of the more socialist 
minded folks might agree.  Some of the more right wing people 
might not agree.  They might think I was being hard and harsh on 
the poor chamber of commerce.  I see at committee all the time 
where we cross on issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite doing most of the chirping served with me on 
the citizenship and immigration committee for some time.  With 
the odd exception, when that member decided to ignore the rules 
of parliament and released a document to the media before it was 
tabled in the House, for which he was properly chastised by the 
Speaker of the day, I found that he tried to work and to deal 
with issues of concern around the citizenship bill and around 
refugees.  He tried to put forward from time to time some 
thoughtful comments in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that after we have gone through the process of losing 
whatever is the issue of the day— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
am not sure that we on this side should be the only ones required 
to listen to this diatribe.  I would like to see more Liberals in 
the House and I am challenging you on quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We now have a quorum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wanted an audience.  I 
generally perform a little better when I have an audience, so 
here we go.  That is exactly the kind of nonsense that sends this 
place into disarray because that party over there does not have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We can stray a little in debate but I would question the 
relevance of the comments the member is making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  With the greatest respect to my hon. 
colleague, I think that is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, they always interrupt me 
because they have very thin skins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with the issue. The issue is parliamentary reform. 
The issue is whether our Speaker should have the ability to rule 
an amendment out of order that is  put forward by anyone in this 
place.  As a matter of fact I am not even sure we need the 
particular amendment to the standing orders.  Having read them, 
it is my opinion the Speaker already has the ability to throw 
those kinds of things out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he or she considers them vexatious or irrelevant, it is my 
opinion that the Speaker of this place can rule them out of 
order.  However, we want to have a debate about toughening up the 
rules, making it more clear to the boys and girls that we will no 
longer allow periods to be substituted for commas because they 
simply do not change the basis of the bill.  We will no longer 
allow someone to submit 3,000 amendments for the sole purpose of 
stopping a bill that the government, duly elected in a majority 
position, has not only a right but a responsibility to put 
forward.  It is the agenda of the government that needs to be put 
on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If opposition members had any credibility whatsoever they would 
stand and fight.  They would stand and debate.  They would stand 
and disagree, but they do not.  What do they do?  They say that 
this place is dysfunctional and that MPs are irrelevant.  I take 
exception to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that the proudest thing one can do in this great 
country is serve in this place.  It is clearly an honour to have 
people in our communities, our neighbours and our friends, say 
that they trust us to go to Ottawa to represent them, that they 
believe in what we are telling them.  They do not like everything 
we do.  They disagree with us from time to time.  We may have to 
vote a certain way because we do or do not agree on a certain 
bill.  They understand that. That is the process.  That is the 
democratic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will paraphrase Winston Churchill who said that it may not be 
the best system in the world but it is a long way ahead of 
whatever is in second place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand that when they lose and when they cry about 
the system that is one thing.  The next thing they do is 
denigrate their colleagues.  However, when they look in the 
mirror and say as members of this place that MPs are not doing 
their jobs, that they are irrelevant or that they are trained 
seals, they denigrate the face in the mirror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem in this place. If we want to return respect 
of parliament to Canadians, if we want to return respect of 
parliamentarians to Canadians, it is time we respected ourselves. 
That is not to say we should be arrogant.  We have no right to 
do that.  In fact the opposite is true.  We need to work, as my 
colleagues do and even members over there do.  We have round 
tables in our communities.  We have public meetings in our 
communities.  We put out householders.  We all return phone 
calls, I would hope, to our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that constituents will phone my office and 
say that they are calling because they are mad about this or mad 
about that.  They leave their names and phone numbers.  They 
think I will not call them back but I do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My policy is that within 24 hours I return a call personally. 
Guess what they say, Mr. Speaker?  They ask whether that is 
really me.  They are stunned that a member of parliament actually 
called them back.  If they did not want me to call them back, why 
would they call and leave a message? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our job to talk to the people.  That does not mean and 
never will mean that we are puppets.  I love it when the whip of 
the Alliance Party says that members of the Alliance Party will 
vote in favour of the motion unless they are told otherwise by 
their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they have a hot line?  Do they have all their constituents on 
a big speaker phone doing a yea and a nay, doing a referendum of 
some kind?  I guess three per cent of the people told them that 
this was what they wanted them to do.  They are all out there 
saying “Mary, what do you think?  Should I vote in favour of 
this or not?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am being a little facetious but the serious point is that we 
do an injustice to the Canadian people to run down this 
institution.  If members want to know what fuels the so-called 
alienation we hear about in places like Quebec and western 
Canada, it is exactly that kind of behaviour which runs down this 
place.  They throw gasoline on the fire and the people say it is 
awful that those terrible politicians in Ottawa will not listen 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the people of Canada do not buy it at the 
end of the day.  I have talked to people in my community who say 
that they do not like politicians but that they do not mean me. I 
am sure everybody in this place gets that.  I do not want a 
second opinion, either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens because they read it in the newspaper, saw 
it on the news or heard someone in parliament say we are all a 
bunch of bad people who do not care about our communities.  We 
know that is not true.  Putting forward motions to change periods 
and commas and semicolons is not even an intelligent way of using 
the parliamentary democracy that is available in this wonderful 
place, in this incredible establishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says to Canadians that we are here.  I agree with one thing 
the member opposite said in his speech, that we are here to 
provide a voice for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk on the issue of the ethics counsellor that the 
opposition is having a field day with.  Nobody over there 
mentions the fact that in 1999 the ethics counsellor appeared 
before the industry committee and made a report to 
parliamentarians.  I am assuming, a terrible leap in faith maybe, 
that there were members opposite in attendance at that committee 
since it was a standing committee of this House.  They heard Mr. 
Wilson make his report and they had opportunity to question him 
on his findings.  That committee then reported to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the commissioner of the RCMP, which brings up another 
point that the member of the fifth party over there in the corner 
does not want to accept, the absolutely independent investigation 
by the RCMP which found that there was no wrongdoing.  Those 
members say they want it referred to the ethics commissioner and 
then when the ethics commissioner says there was no wrongdoing on 
the part of the Prime Minister, what do they do?  They complain 
about the process.  It is what I said before.  They complain that 
the ethics commissioner, because they did not like the answer, is 
a lapdog.  That too is an insult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as how I voted and my colleagues voted, I am very 
strongly of the opinion that we have already lived up to the 
commitment in the red book by appointing the ethics commissioner. 
He has the responsibility and the opportunity and will be invited 
from time to time to appear before a committee of the House.  All 
we have to do is ask and he will come.  He will answer questions 
and then the committee will report to this place. 
It is absolutely normal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the members opposite credit for one thing.  They 
managed to trick the media a little bit.  They managed to put 
some kind of message or image out there that we were breaking a 
promise when in fact they knew full well we had already kept that 
promise and lived up to that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day that ethics counsellor is there.  If they want to 
apply to have him investigate, they can do so.  If they do not 
like the answer, they had better not come crying to me.  He is 
there to do a job and he has his responsibilities.  He will 
absolutely discharge those responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about someone else.  Someone always throws out 
the name of my former good friend Mr. Nunziata.  Mr. Nunziata 
stood in this place and voted against the government on a 
confidence motion that had to do with the budget.  Everyone said 
how wonderful and great he was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask members a question.  Everybody loves hockey in this 
country.  If I played on a team and I shot the puck on purpose 
into my own net, what would my team members do to me?  They would 
tell me to sit on the bench or they would kick me off the team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Nunziata would have had the courage to step out of caucus 
and vote against the government, I would have nothing but 
admiration for him.  He did not.  He voted against the 
government, against the team, and the end of the day this is a 
team sport, a blood sport and a fabulous place to be.  I could 
not be more proud to represent the constituents of Mississauga 
West and I will continue to do so with vigour in this place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try not to raise the pitch used by the hon. 
member for Mississauga West in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are listening to us and winding down in their living 
rooms now that their children are in bed have heard examples 
taken from hockey by the member for Mississauga West. With all 
due respect for the hon. member, his speech was worthy of a 
chihuahua. Members know that a chihuahua is a small dog that yaps 
a lot but does not bite. So, the member for Mississauga West made 
a speech worthy of a chihuahua. I am only referring to the pitch 
of the speech, not its content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the issue before us, it is unfortunate that we 
must debate until 11 p.m. the government House leader's Motion 
No. 2, because this motion— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> A motion for closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> A motion for closure, I agree with the 
hon. member for Roberval, has very serious implications. It is 
appropriate to read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, let me say from the outset 
that it is not the integrity of the Speaker or of the Chair, as 
it is called, that is being questioned, but the action taken by 
the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That section (5) of the Standing Order 76 and section (5) of the 
Standing Order 76.1 be amended by adding at the conclusion of 
the notes thereto the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage and, in 
exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be guided 
by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the United 
Kingdom.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you are a man of law. I did say a man 
of law not a man of the right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the government has hit one of your tender spots.  I 
do not know you well enough to know all your tender spots, like 
in hockey, when they know a player has bad knees for instance, 
and focus on them, but I do know, with his reference to the 
parliamentary system of the United Kingdom, that the government 
House leader has hit on one of your soft spots, because you are 
greatly fond of the parliamentary system as it prevails in the 
United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion contains elements which give incredible latitude and 
we cannot subscribe to them.  Who, for instance, will be the one 
to determine whether motions are indeed repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, respectfully, that in parliamentary law these are 
totally subjective concepts.  There is nothing objective about 
this.  We are in the realm of subjectivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, then, the government wants to give itself a 
clear conscience  by including an initiative we consider totally 
partisan, something it had been thinking about for a very long 
time, but did not want to take the fall for.  Taking advantage of 
the election last November 27, and the first block of the new 
session, the first five weeks of sittings, the government, and 
the government House leader in particular, said to itself “Now 
is the time to strike”.  I submit that the government is going 
to have to take the fall for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion confers upon the Speaker the right to decide on the 
motives and motivations of the members of the opposition when 
they bring in amendments in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition is denied the right to bring forward 
amendments or if our amendments are subjected to an arbitrary 
decision, what is there left of the opposition?  Is the 
government unhappy with the fact there is an opposition?  Would 
the government like to have had all the 301 seats in this 37th 
parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the members on this side of the House are 
legitimate as well. In other words, they are elected just as 
democratically as the members on the other side.  Does that mean 
that the government is unhappy about having an opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that, when the government House leader 
presented his motion, he certainly did not think his own motions 
in amendment could be frivolous or vexatious.  This is surely not 
the case with the some 200 amendments to Bill C-7 on young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is very insulting to any self-respecting political 
party working sincerely to improve legislation introduced by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, according to the motion the government introduced, the 
Speaker will have the power to judge, to all intents and 
purposes, the relevance of any party's political strategy.  This 
Liberal government wants as little criticism as possible and 
imposes changes to the standing orders in order to manage public 
affairs on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a basic question before us.  Does a 
mathematical majority of members give the government the right to 
do everything?  Can the government usurp this power simply 
because it had a standing of 172 seats at the latest election? 
Does that give it the right, literally, to negate any opposition? 
If this government is democratic and transparent, as it claims, 
what is the point of presenting such a motion as Motion No. 2, 
presented by the government House leader? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a political price to pay for managing public affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government decisions are not popular, they must be debated 
in parliament.  The opposition has a legitimate role in 
parliament of working to amend legislation.  If this right is 
withdrawn, we might as well ask what is the point of committee 
work, and of making speeches in the House, most of the time 
before empty chairs.  What is the purpose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suggestion for the government.  If the government wants 
to move quickly, all it has to do is introduce its bills and say 
“There will be no debate on this bill that we have put together. 
No opposition member will speak.  Only members of the party in 
power will be allowed to speak.  There will be no parliamentary 
committees, and no witnesses will be called to appear before 
them.  I, such and such a minister, rise to introduce a bill, and 
I ask my Liberal colleagues in the government majority if they 
have any speeches to make.  I give them the floor and I order 
that we proceed immediately to pass the bill at first, second and 
third readings”.  Bingo.  We send it to the other chamber and 
that is that, no more discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the kind of democracy that the Liberals want and the 
kind of country in which they want to live?  If so, we need to 
know.  I think they should have been just as plain about it in 
the campaign leading up to the November 27 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process whereby the opposition tries to amend an act is, in 
itself, a sound process in a democracy. It is the expression of 
democracy by a part of the population that does not think like 
the government. I looked at the situation, and we on this side of 
the House should be lobotomized to ensure that nothing the 
members opposite say will be questioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Of course, government members are 
applauding. They would love that, but they really should not 
applaud when I make such comments. This is what they are aiming 
for, but in a somewhat more hypocritical if not subtle way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process whereby the opposition tries to amend an act is 
a sound, democratic process, and the opposition has a duty to 
ensure that the government respects the public in managing the 
affairs of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depriving opposition parties of the tools that they need to do 
their job tends to change the role of our democratic 
institutions. This is a serious matter. It is through debates and 
decisions made democratically in the interest of all that a 
government should manage public affairs, not in the interest of a 
fistful of individuals, and not in the interest of a certain 
group of members who sit in cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of each and everyone of the 301 elected 
parliamentarians, whether they sit in the fifth row on the 
opposition side or on the government side, is to improve the 
legislation, unless the government House leader thinks he has a 
monopoly on truth, in which case I am wasting my time, I should 
sit down immediately and no one else should talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I submit that the government House leader 
does not have a monopoly on truth. 
At any rate, all we on this side have to do is look at the way he 
directs the work of this House to see that he does not have a 
monopoly on the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is calling upon the institution you represent, 
Mr. Speaker, to intervene in order to limit opposition delaying 
tactics.  The government House leader is giving this reason to 
all the media: “I do not want to see MPs turned into voting 
machines”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to inform hon. members that we were elected to listen 
to the debates, to get some idea of what bills are about, and to 
respect the concerns and needs of our fellow citizens.  Then, 
having done all that, our fellow citizens expect us to come here 
precisely for that reason, to vote.  Is that being voting 
machines?  If, within one year, we are able to pass 600 pieces 
of progressive legislation which will help improve society, which 
will add something to democracy, to the relationship between 
citizens and their government—for this is what we often fault 
government for, and I do not necessarily mean this one, or a 
provincial one—we will have done our duty as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the people listening to us run into us at the mall buying 
groceries, what criticism do they often share with us?  They 
fault government for being out of touch with their concerns, with 
not listening to them.  That is why they elect someone and tell 
them “You, sir or madam, are the one we have decided to send to 
Ottawa to represent us in parliament, and we want you to be our 
spokesperson.  We want you to be the one to speak on our 
behalf”.  Is that what being a voting machine means? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons added that 
dilatory motions can lead to hours of unnecessary voting.  This 
is once again a value judgment on the part of the government 
House leader.  That is what he thinks.  He is the one who feels 
the voting is unnecessary, but if the government introduces bills 
that are reasonable, if the government House leader introduces 
bills that are valid, that have the approval of society and all 
the political parties, we are in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have seen that, in such cases, there have been no 
lengthy debates for hours and hours and no amendments.  When 
there is a consensus on the bill, we can pass it quickly.  For 
sure, when the government introduces bills that are meaningless, 
such as the bill on young offenders, such as the clarity bill, 
such as the bill on the Nisga'a treaty, which our Canadian 
Alliance colleagues considered inappropriate for the people they 
represent, naturally amendments are tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the right of parliamentarians.  The best proof that it 
is a right is that we do not use it unreasonably and in a 
repetitive fashion with every bill.  You use a right when you 
want to, when you feel a need to use it.  A right and a privilege 
for an MP, that is what that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that we are voting unnecessarily for hours 
and that it costs some $27,000 for each hour of overtime the 
House sits.  I say to the government House leader that democracy 
has no price.  If we find that $27,000 is too much, and if the 
government House leader wants to make cuts— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Let them abolish parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Let them abolish it.  Let us say that if 
there are savings to be made, we should shut it down.  Shut it 
down for six, eight, nine months a year. 
We should try to compress all of parliament's work into one week. 
If we sit for just one week, we will save $27,000 an hour times 
24 hours for 51 weeks.  That will save a bundle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy does have a price, and I think that passing a 
motion such as Motion No. 2 would be to deny the right of all 
parties, including the opposition parties of course, to introduce 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government is using this faulty argument, while it is 
trying to prevent us from representing our constituents, it has, 
since 1993, pocketed no less than $31 billion of the surplus in 
the EI fund, money that belonged to unemployed workers.  The 
government has many ways of limiting opposition to a bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  We do not need to give the government 
House leader ideas for keeping us down; he has all sorts of his 
own.  One of the tools used by the government House leader is 
closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the main reason for closure?  It is intended to silence 
the opposition members.  The government House leader decrees 
“There will be another two and a half hours of debate on such 
and such a bill.  We feel that you will have said all you had to 
say in those two and a half hours and we are not interested in 
hearing any more. 
It does not matter whether you can provide additional arguments, 
whether research assistants found a study somewhere in the world 
or in Canada to show to the government that it is headed in the 
wrong direction. The government has decided to put an end to the 
debate after two and a half hours with a gag order. You will have 
said all you had to say by then”. I say two and a half hours, 
but it could be one hour, three hours or three days. We cannot 
accept such a measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1984 to 1993, the Conservative government used a gag order 
49 times for 519 bills, or 9.4% of the time. In the seven years 
it has been in office, the Liberal government has resorted to 
closure 60 times for 350 bills— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> It was even more than 60 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> —or 17.4% of the time, which is almost 
double. The hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes tells me 
that it was more than 60 times— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> It was around 70 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> —because it happens regularly, on a 
weekly basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Latin teacher used to say tempus fugit, time flies. Since 
you are signalling that I have only one minute left, I simply 
want to conclude on this: What power will the opposition have if 
it has increasingly less access to the parliamentary tools that 
are necessary to the expression of a true democracy? How will 
opposition members be able to protect the fundamental interests 
of their fellow citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the moment that a government stops listening to the public 
and adopts a piecemeal approach based on a strictly partisan 
agenda that takes into account only the interests of a few, all 
our institutions lose their meaning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member 
for Oxford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to first begin by actually congratulating the 
member opposite for his impassioned remarks, because I think this 
is an important debate and I am very sensitive to the fact that 
opposition members always have reason to fear that their rights 
to a fair hearing in the House of Commons must be protected and 
guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I do not think the amendment that is being 
debated right now actually constructively adds to the original 
motion, because I point out, Mr. Speaker, that the original 
motion gives you, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to interpret what 
the words unnecessarily prolong mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Mr. Speaker, in my view, if you really felt it 
was of interest to protect the opposition or minority rights in 
the House of Commons, you could decide that if the opposition 
felt in order to make a statement they had to move a series of 
amendments for debate, if you felt that was in the interests of 
the Commons at large and the debate at large, you could so rule, 
so I really do not see the amendment as constructively adding to 
the main motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to speak in this debate because I am very, 
very sensitive to the need to preserve the rights of backbench 
MPs on this side and opposition MPs on that side, the rights, Mr. 
Speaker, to move amendments of substance or even, Mr. Speaker, 
substance is of course, shall we say, something that one decides 
subjectively.

<A HREF="#LINKT137"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is very important that MPs retain the right 
to move amendments that they believe in, even if those amendments 
do not succeed, that may make a statement with respect to how 
those members individually or collectively feel about 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I have availed myself of report stage 
amendments on a number of occasions knowing full well that I 
could not proceed with my ideas with respect to the legislation 
at hand through the committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of people who may be watching the debate, they 
should understand that after second reading, legislation goes to 
a committee, that committee hears witnesses, considers the 
testimony of those witnesses and then hears proposals for 
amendments that may come from members of that committee or from 
the government through solicitations to the parliamentary 
secretary.  Those amendments are then voted upon in committee and 
they go forward and the government gets to decide whether or not 
those amendments are actually acted upon at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with that system is that many of our committees are 
dominated by the government.  It is an artifice of the way the 
committee structure is set up.  Whether one is an opposition 
member of parliament or a backbench member of parliament, 
sometimes when we present an amendment through the committee 
process and it is defeated at the committee, it cannot be 
re-submitted at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well the difficulty with that is that if a backbench MP or an 
opposition MP has an amendment, which he or she knows full well 
the government does not support, if he or she introduces it at 
the committee and it is defeated then it disappears forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of the report stage amendment process for a 
backbench MP like myself, or an opposition MP, if we know we 
cannot win at committee, we can submit it at report stage in the 
House of Commons.  We then have an opportunity to rise in this 
place, with the amendment grouped among a number of other 
amendments or other motions, but we have an opportunity to rise 
in this place in front of all of our colleagues on both sides of 
the House and the public at large to speak, I like to think, with 
feeling to the amendment that we know full well will be defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never tire of saying in this House that this House is not just 
about passing legislation, winning or losing, voting or not 
voting.  This House is about debate and about presenting ideas. 
I think the public gets dreadfully discouraged if it does not 
hear valid debate not only from the opposition but from the 
backbench MPs on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to commend the government House leader for the type of 
motion he has put forward now because I believe other speakers 
have alluded to the fact that the House leader did present, about 
a year ago, amendments along this line to report stage 
proceedings pertaining to vexatious or frivolous amendments that 
were of such a nature that many of the members on this side of 
the House could not accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the members opposite should know that when that occurred 
many of us on this side expressed our feelings to the government 
House leader in the strongest possible terms.  In other words, we 
said that we would not support the proposal he had before the 
House.  The government accepted the resistance that came from 
this side and the result is the proposal that the government 
House leader has now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that I ultimately have no problem whatsoever 
with opposition members trying to prolong debate at report stage 
in order to make a point about legislation that they do not agree 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate about the clarity bill, for example, in which 
there were about 100 amendments, if not more, that were presented 
by the opposition, and many of them definitely of a frivolous 
nature, I had no problem with the fact that the House sat late, 
sat into the middle of the night, because if I sat here into the 
middle of the night, the opposition members sat into the middle 
of the night as well.  When it comes down to defending government 
legislation that I believe in, I am willing to sit in my place as 
long as it will take and I am prepared to out sit, if need be, 
any member of the opposition who wants to make a point in this 
particular way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately I did not have a lot of problem with what the 
opposition was doing from time to time by moving multiple 
amendments that were, shall we say, of a frivolous nature.  The 
problem, and I think this is where the government House leader 
has a real point, is the optics to the public out there when they 
see amendments that basically are the moving of a comma, the 
changing of a little bit of grammar.  The optics is such that I 
am afraid that members of the public would lose confidence that 
this House is really undertaking serious business, even though I 
would agree that the opposition ought to have as many 
opportunities as possible to make points even if it is by 
filibuster or by prolonging debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I do feel that what the government House 
leader has done by moving this particular motion, which devolves 
upon you, Mr. Speaker, enormous opportunities, if not power, of 
interpretation and the reason why I was so keen to speak in this 
debate, and, Mr. Speaker, I am speaking directly toward you, and 
I hope you are giving me 100% of your attention, the reason why I 
am speaking directly toward you and seeking your attention, Mr. 
Speaker, is because I am hoping that you will appreciate that 
when you interpret this amendment that is proposed by the 
government House leader you will interpret it only in ways that 
defend the rights of backbench MPs and the rights of opposition 
MPs to move amendments of substance at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a subjective call on your side, Mr. Speaker.  I am glad 
that you are giving me such rapt attention because of course I am 
trying to make a dreadfully important point.  I just wanted to 
make sure you were with us there, Mr. Speaker.  I have full 
confidence that you will interpret this, and I want to stress 
that I only support this motion from the government on condition 
that when you interpret it you interpret it in terms of the 
minority rights, the rights of free expression, the rights of 
state position that has to be a part of being a backbench MP, or 
being an opposition MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I think that the government House leader 
has done something that I know the opposition members would find 
hard to credit, but I can assure them that there was great 
objection to the original proposal on this side.  The government 
did concede that it was going too far.  It has come up, I think, 
with a compromise.  I really do not think it is necessary because 
I do not mind if the opposition wants to use up House time.  I am 
conscious of the fact though that the optics would be improper 
and I will always bow to the government when it has a proposal 
that I think is reasonable and that is ultimately in the interest 
of the House at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I end with one caution because the member for Oxford wants 
to speak very shortly.  I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that whatever 
you do, you must protect the rights of the backbench MPs and the 
opposition MPs to have their say in debate on legislation at 
report stage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion 
deals with empowering you and your assistants to rule on 
repetitious, frivolous and vexatious amendments at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my colleagues this afternoon and evening and found 
myself agreeing with many points made by some of the members 
opposite, particularly the member for Winnipeg—Transcona and the 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a committee to review the democratic purposes and 
actions of the House of Commons.  This could be done, but that is 
not what we are voting on tonight.  We are voting on a way of 
preventing amendment abuse and hence voting abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved with the Nisga'a agreement and the work on the 
bill by the committee on Indian affairs and northern development. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT140"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2210

<A HREF="#LINKT139"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Nisga'a worked on that bill for 500 
years.  Chief Gosnell worked on it for 21 years and Frank Calder 
worked on it for life.  This government and previous governments 
worked on it for some 20 or 30 years.  In the last 11 years we 
finally got an agreement.  To have that agreement held up for 42 
hours while we voted in the House on frivolous, vexatious and 
repetitious amendments was terribly disheartening to me, and I am 
sure to the Nisga'a who watched.  It did nothing for public 
perception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have made much of the fact that the public did not 
understand that waste of time, that waste of talent, that waste 
of effort.  I do not either.  We have a committee system that 
works.  It involves witnesses.  It involves travel if necessary. 
It involves all parties in the committee working toward a common 
end.  It is one of the things I enjoy most about being here and 
working with my colleagues.  Sometimes things go awry between 
committee stage and the House but not always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Report stage allows motions from members who are not on the 
committee and have not had a chance to make an amendment, but it 
is not designed to allow games to be played with the work that 
has been done by serious parliamentarians.  Endless voting on 
frivolous, vexatious and repetitious amendments is not productive 
of anything but cynicism, ennui and disrespect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg North waxed eloquent about closure, 
which is not what we are talking about.  The heart of the matter 
is how we develop good laws for Canadians.  Some members opposite 
talk of overall change, closure, the auditor general's report, et 
cetera.  Somehow they forget that we have just had an election 
based on party platforms, based on the country's choices for the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Waterloo—Wellington talked about the 
development of parliamentary democracy.  He suggested it was a 
slow but steady process.  It is adaptive to new technological 
challenges and social changes.  It did not burst full blown from 
the brow of Zeus or the brow of Simon de Montfort.  It developed 
gradually, haltingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were big steps like the Magna Carta and the Reform Act of 
the 17th century.  There were a lot of little steps day by day. 
We are taking one of those little steps hopefully tonight and 
saying that we went too far in this direction.  We have to 
change. We have to come back to the centre and do the right 
thing. Amendments at report stage were not intended to get us 
into that kind of trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has worked because Canada has just been voted for the eighth 
year as the best country in the world in which to live.  That is 
pretty good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another saying many people use around here and that is 
“if it ain't broke don't fix it”.  The committee system is not 
broken.  Having bills go through at least three stages is good. 
Our voting system is good and our timing for speeches seems to 
work.  The nonsense of wasting time on silly amendments is not 
productive, sensible or defensible by any member who thinks his 
work is useful to his constituents and his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most members have all had experience in many organizations and 
how they run.  We have had experience in motion making, in 
elections and in amendments.  Personally I started at about age 
10 with a neighbourhood stamp club among my boyhood chums.  We 
had elections.  Minutes were kept.  We prepared an agenda.  We 
even had a stamp evaluation committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From there I went to cubs, a scout leader, patrol leader, the 
university student union as a director and a member, staff 
president at the high school, union president, the hospital board 
and a lot of other social organizations, and now here. 
My colleague from Winnipeg South made a great deal of sense.  He 
concentrated on the point of the motion before us:  the 
achievement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that we should focus on the motion and 
pass it.  It is a festering sore which we can eliminate tonight 
and then get on with future improvements to our parliamentary 
system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I start I would like to say that I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague from Fraser Valley.  It is not 
that I really like it but he came up with an excellent proposal 
so I must give him time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member for Mississauga West a little while 
ago.  When I looked at my watch and saw the time I thought it was 
past his bedtime because he was slipping.  He was trying to tell 
Canadians, with his bellowing, booming voice, that this amendment 
was great.  He was saying that the Alliance had taken its supply 
day motion exactly from the red book.  The member was defending 
it and saying that the Liberals had fulfilled their red book 
promise.  Can hon. members believe that?  He said that there was 
an ethics counsellor, forgetting that the ethics counsellor 
reports to the Prime Minister and not to parliament as was 
promised in the red book.  The member had the guts to stand over 
there and say that they have fulfilled the red book promise. That 
is why I thought it was past his bedtime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of the motion is about parliament, the voice of the 
people.  In the House democracy works for the government and for 
the opposition.  People who disagree with the government have a 
voice through the opposition.  From what we have seen over the 
years, our voices have been silenced by procedures, manoeuvres 
and all the power of the majority government.  Opposition parties 
have eventually had to resort to narrower ways and means of 
taking their message to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals stand over there and say that the amendments are 
not changes but they will not say exactly what the opposition, 
the other voice in parliament, is trying to do.  The opposition 
is trying to get the message out to the public about what is 
happening in the House, and its voice is being silenced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance and my colleague from Fraser Valley have 
put forward proposals on the reform of the House. The whole 
purpose of the reform is to have a sound, reasonable debate.  The 
other voice can be heard as well, not only the voice of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues on the other side have said that there are 
committees where the opposition can debate the issues of the day. 
We all know that they were in opposition before 1993.  They 
should know very well that those committees are totally 
ineffective.  We have been there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2220"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my second term.  I have been here for three and a half 
years.  I have never seen the government listen to a committee. 
It does not.  Committees are nice.  Committees are a very nice 
way for the government to deflect criticism of what it wants to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says a matter is going to a committee.  It goes 
to a committee and when it comes back it is up to the minister 
and up to the government whether or not it wants to take a 
committee's recommendation.  We are finding that most of the time 
it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the voice of the opposition, the voice of the other 
side, the voice of the people who elected us to speak in the 
House?  We stand here and debate, but what happens?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion, quite interestingly, says the government wants to be 
guided by the practices followed in the house of commons in the 
United Kingdom.  Of course we all know it is the mother of all 
parliaments and that would be nice.  However other practices are 
followed in that house which give a voice to the other side as 
well.  A balanced voice is heard in that house, but not here. 
Here the government picks only what suits it so that it can ram 
through whatever it wants and forget about what the other voices 
are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the immigration minister said the Alliance Party attracted 
bigots, racists and Holocaust deniers, who was she talking about? 
Millions of people voted for our party.  Was she talking about 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the respect the government has for other Canadians?  Can 
it not respect the views of the opposition and other Canadians? 
It cannot.  This motion is another example of the attitude that 
the government has of ramming things through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that to vote on 3,000 amendments would take a long 
time.  The Speaker will still have some discretion over that. It 
is not the amendments we are worried about.  It is the method of 
getting the message out.  That is what is called democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder Canadians are losing confidence in the House. It 
is interesting that the members on the other side know that and 
allude to it.  The member for Mississauga West referred this 
evening to one of his constituents.  He claims it was a 
constituent but I doubt if it was a constituent; it was probably 
a family member who said “I hate all politicians except you”. 
It was probably a family member who said that, but the point is 
that Canadians are losing confidence in the House because debate 
is curtailed.  They see the power of the government, the 
dictatorial power of the government, and their inability to 
effect any change in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we start seeing little flames of separatism.  We do not 
support them at all but those sentiments start to come out. I 
hope they do not become big sentiments but that is where they 
start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said it was blackmail. 
It is not blackmail.  People are trying to find ways and means of 
saying what they want to say and having someone listen.  If we do 
not listen, people will find other means to make us listen.  That 
is what the amendments are all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the motion although it is 
not a pleasure for any of us to be here late this evening.  Once 
again we are speaking about what the government is about and how 
it has found another way to curtail the legitimate role of 
opposition members within the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is moving again to restrict the ability of opposition members 
to slow down the work of government, a role that both 
Beauchesne's and Marleau and Montpetit have said is a legitimate 
role for opposition parties. Once again it will remove, after 
tonight's vote, our ability to hold up government legislation and 
to make the public aware of opposition points of view on 
contentious legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like you to remember, Mr. Speaker the challenge I gave 
you the first time the government used time allocation or 
restricted debate in this session.  I argued with you at that 
time that somewhere along the line you would have to step in 
between the government and the legitimate role of opposition to 
allow the opposition to do its role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the 70th time that the government has restricted debate 
in the House.  It is always offensive, but to use closure to 
force changes to the standing orders is not just offensive.  It 
is inexcusable.  The present minister of public works said in 
1991: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that the proposed changes to the standing 
orders will make the proceedings more relevant and increase the 
efficiency of the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that sound familiar?  Have we heard that all evening long 
from across the way?  Do they say it will make it more efficient? 
I will go on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we must realize that this is being proposed by the 
very government that applied closure 13 times and time allocation 
8 times.  How can we seriously take a proposal to improve the 
efficiency of the House made by a government which, in the past, 
showed contempt for the Standing Orders of this House? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of public works was complaining about a government 
that had abused time allocation and closure 21 times.  He found 
that offensive in the extreme.  The same member is now part of a 
government that has used time allocation and closure 70 times to 
shut down debate in this place, not 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should be ashamed of his House leader.  He should be ashamed 
of the way the Prime Minister runs this place.  The fact that he 
is not ashamed shows that Lord Acton still lives.  If power 
corrupts, the power concentrated in the Prime Minister's Office 
now is so absolutely corrupt that we cannot tell the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to talk about spurious and vexatious amendments. 
Let us talk about the spurious and vexatious arguments made on 
that side of the House.  I have heard that we cannot make changes 
unless we do it all at once.  First I heard that we had to do it 
piecemeal.  This is just one step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that every time the government makes one step it 
always strengthens the executive's hand?  Why is it that every 
time it shuts down debate it strengthens the government's hand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It restricts the list of witnesses and it strengthens the 
government's hand.  It does not allow a free vote in committee to 
elect a chairman. Why? It is because it strengthens the 
government's hand.  Why is it that the whip will come in at the 
last minute and take members off a committee who have sat on it 
faithfully for months?  When the vote comes, it brings in the 
trained seals and they vote.  Why?  It is because it strengthens 
the government's hand, the executive's hand, time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere, sometime I am convinced that unless you, Mr. Speaker, 
step into the breach and stop this from continuing, the question 
will not be should we sit on Fridays, which some people might 
ask.  The big question will be:  Why sit at all?  I said this in 
an article today which was printed in The <I>National Post</I>. 
Why sit at all if the government treats this place with contempt? 
Every time it gets an opportunity it makes an announcement, not 
here in the House but anywhere other than in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the Speaker in the last parliament time and again how 
the government could make multimillion, sometimes billion dollar 
announcements and treat this place like it did not matter.  The 
then Speaker admonished the government not to do this.  He said 
that it was treating this place with disrespect and should not do 
it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT143"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what happens?  Guess.  The next time an announcement 
comes along the government treats this place like it is 
irrelevant and just goes about its business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You, Mr. Speaker, have to step in and stop it.  Somewhere you 
are going to have to flex some muscles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing to remember is that the government is 
closing off the ability for opposition parties to bring forward 
amendments and the question that has to be asked is this:  why 
have the opposition members felt compelled to bring in so many 
amendments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you why, Mr. Speaker.  Because when we get into 
committee, guess what happens to our witness list.  The witness 
list is tossed aside like trash.  Only government members are 
allowed to come in on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Nisga'a agreement, they went out to British Columbia 
supposedly to talk to the people.  They would not listen to the 
Indian bands that had counterclaims on that same Nisga'a land. 
They would not even listen to them.  They flew in witnesses from 
Vancouver to that committee.  They would not listen to witnesses 
from Prince George, from Prince Rupert and from neighbouring 
Indian bands.  They would not listen to them and they shut down 
the debate in the committee.  They would not allow us to continue 
the debate there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government brought back the bill to the House.  It used 
closure in committee.  It restricted our witnesses.  It 
restricted our ability to bring things to the House.   When push 
came to shove, what happened?  The government used its authority 
to again shut down the debate in this place, which should be a 
debating Chamber.  The government shut it down and that is 
inexcusable.  The government has shut it down 70 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what happens, Mr. Speaker, when the government 
treats this place with contempt— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know all hon. members want 
to hear the hon. member for Fraser Valley.  It is hard to hear 
when everybody is yelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  What happens, Mr. Speaker, when the 
government shuts down debate, which it has now done 70 times? 
Governments have fallen by shutting down debate.  We remember the 
pipeline debate, when it used to be a heinous crime to shut down 
debate in this place, but what happens here now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first bill that came to the House in this session, the 
government shut down the debate.  We hit the second day of debate 
and the government shut it down.  It brought in time allocation. 
It said that we could not speak about it any more.  Why?  It had 
to get the bill into committee.  The only problem was that the 
committees did not exist yet.  The government shut down debate so 
it could do what with it, just hold it in abeyance and wait for 
what, an epiphany?  What was it waiting for?   Was it waiting for 
a road to Damascus experience?  It did nothing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so addicted to shutting down debate.  The 
government is so afraid of other points of view that it shut down 
the debate when there was not even a reason to shut it down. 
There was not even a committee to send it to.  We were on the 
second day of debate and the government shut it all down in this 
place.  The government members said they did not want to listen 
to anybody on the other side of the House.  They said “Anybody 
who disagrees with us is irrelevant.  This House is irrelevant”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens then?  Opposition parties find ways to make 
themselves heard.  They have to.  Our job is to legitimately 
oppose the government.  Rather than let us have a reasonable 
amount of time to debate, rather than let us have a reasonable 
number of witnesses, rather than let us work in committee and 
give and take and make amendments and so on, what happens?  The 
government sends its parliamentary secretaries into committees to 
say, “This is what you shall do in committee.  This is what you 
shall allow for amendments.  This is what you shall permit to go 
through the system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government does instead of give and take, 
instead of debate, instead of amendments, instead of making 
legislation better and listening to a point of view that the 
government maybe has not thought of.  The government never does 
that even when it could and it would not hurt a bit.  It is not 
even part of the government's agenda or even part of the throne 
speech.  The government will not listen to an opposing point of 
view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this idea came forward to give you the power, Mr. Speaker, 
to restrict the number of amendments that could come forward at 
report stage, I spoke to the government House leader.  I said 
that if we were going to do that, then let us go the rest of the 
way, like the United Kingdom has done.  It is even quoted in the 
motion.  Let us talk about some of the other things.  Let us then 
allow the Speaker to intervene when, in the Speaker's opinion, 
the debate has not gone on long enough.  Let us allow the Speaker 
to intervene when he thinks the rights of minorities have been 
unfairly afflicted.  Let the Speaker have some real power to 
intervene, not just against the opposition but on behalf of 
minority parties so minority views come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, none of that happened.  Why, Mr. Speaker?  Because time 
and again, every amendment to the standing orders, to the rules 
of the House and to the way we do business in this place 
strengthens the hand of the executive on that side and every 
single time it weakens both the backbench on that side and 
opposition parties on this side.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is time for you to intervene and to use the 
influence of your office to say that you will have debate in this 
place.  You were elected, Sir, to give us fair debate, a lot of 
debate, and opposing points of view have to be listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you continue to allow the government to go down 
this path of treating this place like a second rate House instead 
of the first rate House of debate it should be, not only will we 
continue to have a Canadian electorate that finds us increasingly 
irrelevant but members of the House will find it so as well. That 
would be the ultimate shame of allowing these kinds of motions to 
continue to pass in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great honour to rise and make my maiden speech 
in this 37th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the gist of what I want to say, I want to 
commend the previous speaker.  I think he articulates a point of 
view very logically and very forcefully.  I agree that the 
opposition certainly should be concerned about the powers of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We work in a system that gives tremendous power to the Prime 
Minister and to the government.  If my colleagues across the way 
had bothered at some point to take a first year political science 
course, they would know that is part of our system.  We should 
have a debate as to whether it is an appropriate system.  It is 
not a function of the Prime Minister's personality.  It is not a 
function of this particular Prime Minister.  It is a function of 
our rules.  There are certain advantages to those rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, my colleague reminds me that I am splitting my time 
with the member for Scarborough—Rouge River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my hon. friends across the way that we should 
have a debate about whether our parliament, our rules and our 
system are serving the needs of the country in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was scheduled today to speak on the endangered species bill. 
That was scheduled to be my maiden speech.  I much would have 
preferred to be talking about a substantive issue like endangered 
species or the environment.  As well, I watched the news tonight 
and we have bad economic news.  I would much rather be debating 
the economy or a variety of other issues that are pressing on 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we are talking about the rights of a Speaker to enforce 
the rules.  We are talking about whether it is appropriate for 
opposition parties to tie up the House of Commons for three, 
four, five or six days by debating whether to move a comma to 
another line or change a period into a semicolon.  We are talking 
about the most trivial, vexatious and frivolous amendments.  This 
is the right that the opposition wants to hold on to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read the motion that is put forth it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the wording of this motion will prevent the 
opposition from putting forward hundreds of substantive 
amendments.  However, they are going to have to be substantive 
amendments, not the silly amendments we had in the last 
parliament.  They will have to be about ideas.  We could have a 
debate about ideas, not about personalities.  We could have a 
serious debate over the coming months about parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us leave the accusations about whether we are puppets or 
they are puppets.  Let us talk about how we make the system work. 
We are in the 21st century.  Let us talk about how we make it 
better for Canadians.  That does not include, I am sorry to say, 
three, four, five or six days or longer of simply debating 
whether a comma should be moved.  I am sorry, but that is not 
what Canadians sent us here to do.  It is not why I was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents want me to concentrate on substantive issues. 
They want me to concentrate on issues that matter to them, such 
as whether the air they breathe is clean or whether their jobs 
will be safe.  They do not want us to concentrate on this 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a perfectly legitimate motion.  All it does is 
tell the Speaker to enforce the rules.  If we want to have a 
debate about changing the rules, then let us do that as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make a few remarks tonight before we reach the end of our 
time.  I thought the quality of the debate tonight was rather 
good and I think most of us have had a chance to share our views 
on the issue in front of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address what I think is a bit of historical 
perspective on this:  how we got here from there and why we are 
dealing with this particular rule change.  I want to suggest that 
it really is not much of a rule change at all.  I am sure all 
members have read the existing rule, which says very clearly that 
the Speaker “shall have the power to select amendments to be 
proposed at report stage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you already have the power to select amendments at 
report stage.  The problem is that the Speaker is not selecting 
amendments at report stage.  The Speaker will group them for a 
vote or group them for debate, but the Speaker is not selecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Speaker not selecting now?  The Speaker is not 
selecting now because 20 or 30 years ago a Speaker decided that 
he or she would not do any selection.  As the practice evolved, 
we ended up with many amendments.  The Speaker still did not 
select proposed amendments, and we ended up in this box at the 
present time where we have 400, 500 or 3,000 amendments, as the 
Speaker was not using the power that he or she had under the 
existing rules.  This could keep us voting for days or even weeks 
solid, 24 hours a day.  The House went through this a year or two 
ago and it was clear to all members that we could not continue 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we may ask ourselves, if the Speaker already has the power to 
select amendments for debate, which means excluding proposed 
amendments, why do we have to move this little change to the 
rules?  The reason, I believe, is that the Speaker felt boxed in 
by the previous evolving practice and did not want to make a move 
to alter what had been an evolution of the practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During one of the marathon voting nights that occurred in the 
House, during the clarity bill, I believe, a year or two ago, I 
happened to be in Westminster.  I felt perhaps fortunate not to 
be here at that time.  I was in the U.K. parliament.  When word 
of this marathon voting procedure came up over there, MPs and 
clerks there asked me what was happening.  They did not 
understand.  Even I could not understand.  I could not explain to 
them how our House had allowed this procedure to evolve to the 
point where we could have 10,000 report stage amendments.  There 
was no restriction in our rules.  Over time, Speakers simply 
appear to have accepted that it did not matter whether there was 
1 amendment or 100 or 1,000 or perhaps even 10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point I inquired into the U.K. situation.  Normally 
under rules similar to our own and a practice similar to ours, 
which says that the Speaker shall select for debate, the Speaker 
purges all amendments that may be described as frivolous, 
vexatious, repetitive or unnecessarily prolonging the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have done here is propose for greater clarity for the 
Speaker a rule of thumb that will allow him or her finally to 
select on a basis that will exclude the frivolous, the vexatious 
or the unduly prolonging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition thinks it is being prevented from doing that. I— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Given that the hon. member opposite, the parliamentary 
secretary, has in essence outlined how the Speaker feels and how 
the Speaker has pronounced on this issue already, and knowing 
that this certainly is not common, I would suggest that this is 
highly inappropriate.  The Speaker is certainly in a position to 
speak for himself.  Although that is not common practice, perhaps 
the Speaker would like to speak to this issue himself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I appreciate the very kind thoughts of the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I think he 
knows that the hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge River really 
meant the speakership because certainly this Speaker would not 
have any opinion whatever on a subject like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, opposition members say that 
they have been restricted in some way, precluded from doing 
things that they feel they should be able to do in their role in 
opposition.  There is a role for opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just say tonight that all the opposition parties are 
doing a good job being the opposition.  However what they are 
being prevented from doing under the rule is being repetitive, 
frivolous and vexatious in unnecessarily prolonging debate.  I do 
not think the rule change is particularly momentous or onerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  The party at the end of the House is now 
interested in the debate.  It is nice to see them participating 
at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that the rule change is not much of a 
rule change at all.  It does not give the Speaker any more power 
than the Speaker already has.  It is simply gives direction to 
the Speaker to do what the Speaker perhaps should have been doing 
all along but has not been for reasons of evolving practice in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only think that a Speaker would be glad, fortunate and 
pleased to have this kind of direction from all members of the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before coming here, I was wondering what the government was 
trying to do exactly with this motion and why it has come to the 
point where it wants to impose this kind of motion upon the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the House of Commons is about to vote on a very serious 
issue tonight. The members opposite seem to change their tune 
depending on which side of the House they are sitting. I remember 
clearly that, when they were on this side of the House, they used 
to cry bloody murder every time the Conservative government 
invoked closure or used its majority to impose its will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before voting on this motion, members must ask themselves the 
following question: did the opposition go too far? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> The government House leader is 
applauding like a five year old. He may very well do that 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the opposition bring parliament to a halt? Did it go too 
far in the use of the legislative and procedural tools? That is 
the question we must ask ourselves before voting tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a group of persons who went too far in the use of 
the legislative tools at their disposal, it is the government 
members. They went too far in the use of closure or time 
allocation, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members will remember the rat pack, when the Liberals 
were in opposition, how they criticized the government. Today, 
one of these individuals is the government House leader, and he 
is proud of what he is doing. It is undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the statistics, we see that the Conservative 
government limited debate 49 times on a total of 519 bills. Over 
a shorter period, the Liberal government opposite did that 17.9% 
of the time on a total of 350 bills. Is this what we can expect 
from a responsible government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> We are a responsible government, unlike 
you.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur: </B>I hear the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs say the government is responsible 
because it is gagging the opposition. In gagging the opposition, 
it is also gagging democracy. Does the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs think this is a responsible government? 
I understand he is the best liked minister in Quebec as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the motion today, and I think it must be read, borrowing 
from the United Kingdom's house of commons? Even though we have a 
British history, the United Kingdom's house of commons does not 
have the same legislation as we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before speaking, I was wondering. The government wants to gag 
the opposition, because we are doing our job. Yes, I plead guilty 
to bringing forward 3,000 amendments on a bill. Once again, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is applauding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I brought forward 3,000 amendments on the young offenders 
bill, it is because, in Quebec, no one wants the minister's bill. 
Thanks to my 3,000 amendments, the government did its homework 
even further, because it moved 170 to 200 amendments on the same 
bill. In some of these amendments, and I invite members to read 
them, it changed some commas. Are these frivolous amendments, as 
the motion implies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, when you will rule on this issue, will you reject 
one of the government's amendments? No. 
The government House leader is staring at his papers, and so he 
should, because if I were in his shoes, I would be ashamed of 
doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a strange country indeed, where the opposition can be 
gagged. I can be denied my constitutional rights, my freedom of 
speech in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the Hell's Angels, the government does not dare 
to do anything. They have constitutional rights. The mafia and 
organized crime have constitutional rights too. But members who 
have been democratically elected are denied these rights. It is 
ironic. I cannot understand how Quebec members can vote for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, under the charter of rights, just about everything can 
be done. You can even have a website with slanderous comments. 
The supreme court even ruled that one can draw pornographic 
pictures at home if it were for personal use. That is what is 
called freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House have been given a legitimate mandate in an 
election. We are here to stand for our constituents. That is what 
I did with my 3,000 amendments to the young offenders bill. It 
was not a kind of power trip. I wanted to represent adequately 
the people of Quebec, something the ministers from Quebec are not 
doing at this time. They just sit on their behinds and keep an 
eye on their limo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should be supporting the Bloc Quebecois on this kind of 
bill, but they are not. Where are the members from Quebec in the 
government caucus? Where are they, when they should be standing 
for Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even worse than that. The issue today is above 
partisanship. It is a matter of democracy. Some day, you will be 
back on the opposition benches.

is he? Today, he will hide behind a motion in which the Liberals 
refer to the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom does not 
have the Canadian constitution, the magnificent constitution of 
the best country in the world, as the Prime Minister says, with 
the mounted police and whatnot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincerely, and I will repeat what my leader said, I do not envy 
your situation, Mr. Speaker, once the motion is carried. 
I am anxious to see what the words repetitive, frivolous and 
vexatious mean for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the amendment moved by the Minister of Justice to move a 
coma in Bill C-3 frivolous? Was that vexatious? We know that the 
legislator does not speak for nothing, a small comma can make a 
big difference in the interpretation. I do not say that the 
minister should not have made that change or changed words as 
she did. What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, is that you will be in a 
very uncomfortable position when time comes to decide what is to 
be considered frivolous and what is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honestly, you are going to have a very hard time ruling on that.

answer: we just have to change the Speaker. I have more respect 
for you, Mr. Speaker, than the members opposite. At the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> We just have to change the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> I would invite the members opposite who 
are making comments among themselves to look at their own 
record, especially the member for Abitibi who brings in motions 
without even being able to find a seconder in his own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member did not tell the whole truth. He could have mentioned the 
full name of my riding, Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. Moreover, I was 
able to make my speech anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I believe this is a point of debate, not a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was in the House and I 
can say that the member had a hard time finding a seconder for 
his motion and finishing his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I will close with a quote from 
Marleau and Montpetit. The government wants to give lessons in 
democracy, but if we knew all that is being said on the 
government benches while we are making our speeches— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> It is outrageous for Canadian democracy. 
I will try to rise above the level of debate set by the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> It will not be difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Here is what it says on page 260 of the
