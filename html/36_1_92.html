</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on March 12, 1998, 
the Minister of the Environment introduced Bill C-32, an act 
respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the 
environment and human health in order to contribute to 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the minister is in Toronto for the first joint meeting of 
energy and environment ministers since Kyoto.  The minister will 
be taking part in a CEPA debate on Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to begin the second reading of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, only 10 years ago, the Canadian Environment Protection 
Act, or CEPA, became law.  When first introduced CEPA was a 
significant shift in environmental law and in the way the federal 
government protected Canada's environment and human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original CEPA contained several important measures including 
various approaches to the management of toxic substances, 
provisions for citizens to request an investigation and 
parliamentary scrutiny and review of the act after five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar provisions are internationally and domestically becoming 
more common in environmental legislation.  In fact over the past 
10 years environmental science and law have evolved considerably. 
We have much greater insight into the stresses that humans place 
on the environment.  We know more about what must be done to 
reduce and remedy these stresses.  We also have a strong and 
growing public concern for the environment and related impacts on 
human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental protection is a core value for Canadians.  More 
than 90% of surveyed Canadians are concerned about toxic 
chemicals, air pollution and water quality.  Legislation must 
reflect the growth and change of society.  CEPA must reflect the 
awareness and concern of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development when it undertook the year-long review of 
CEPA in 1994.  Our review, the government response to it and 
further talks with stakeholders including provinces, territories, 
aboriginal people, industry, environmental and other groups were 
included in the development of the bill.  The new Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act must serve as a tool to help 
Canadians as we move into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act covers 
pollution prevention, managing toxic substances, clean air and 
water, controlling pollution and waste.  The act is further 
comprised of parts including public participation, environmental 
matters related to emergencies, biotechnology, federal government 
operations and federal aboriginal lands, enforcement and 
information gathering, objectives, guidelines and codes of 
practice.  More important, Bill C-32 incorporates a number of 
policy directions or objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some important goals of environmental management are noted in 
the preamble and these include an ecosystem approach, the 
precautionary principle and the principle of pollution 
prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the following goals of environmental 
management:  the ecosystem approach, the precautionary principle, 
user/producer responsibility, pollution prevention, the 
management of toxic substances, enforcement, and public 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our environment is dependent on countless complex interactions 
among air, land, water and all living creatures.  Ecosystem is 
defined under the act as a dynamic complex of plant, animal and 
micro-organism communities and their non-living environment 
interacting as a functional unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ecosystem approach to environmental management recognizes the 
fact that all of these components are interdependent.  These 
interactions are key to our continued health and existence.  We 
cannot, for example, protect our air by removing contaminants 
from smoke stacks only to dump them into our waterways.  We 
cannot protect our waterways by removing pollutants from 
discharge pipes and sending them to landfills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ecosystem approach to managing our environment requires the 
consideration of the complete picture and all its 
interdependencies, not just specific pieces of it.  The concept 
of the comprehensive, integrated whole must underpin all our 
research activities and the way we make decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The earth is an existing single reality and it can survive—we 
can survive—only in its integral functioning. 
An ecosystem approach is an integrative, transdisciplinary 
approach.  It recognizes the interplay and interdependence of 
various domains such as biophysical, socioeconomic, human health, 
political and ethical domains that make life possible on our 
planet.  Protection and amelioration of the environment demands 
this integrative and transdisciplinary approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An essential component of the current CEPA is the minister's 
authority to carry out monitoring and research on environmental 
quality.  Monitoring and research allows us to understand and 
respond to environmental challenges.  Knowledge is a critical 
precursor to informed decision making.  The new CEPA specifies 
that ecosystem health is included in the concept of environmental 
quality and provides authority to conduct studies to detect the 
state of and damage to ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 also allows for the publication of a state of the 
environment report for Canada and the development of ecosystem 
objectives, guidelines, codes of practice and inventories. 
Efforts will be focused on maintaining the integrity of 
ecosystems and not just individual components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the preamble of the new Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
the government is committed to the implementation of the 
precautionary principle which is now clearly recognized as a 
fundamental tenet of international environmental law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Precautionary principle means that we act to prevent 
environmental damage rather than react after the damage has 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the precautionary principle science is an essential 
component of what is done under CEPA.  We must act when the 
weight of evidence suggests that a potential threat to the 
environment and human health exists.  The costs of inaction are 
simply too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly talk about the concept of user/producer 
responsibility which has also been included in the preamble to 
Bill C-32.  User/producer responsibility means placing a greater 
onus on the producer, user or importer of a substance to ensure 
that it is safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is consistent with current regulations under CEPA that 
require information and data to allow for an assessment of these 
products before they are introduced into the marketplace.  The 
bottom line is that individuals who profit from a substance 
should ensure that it does not pose a risk to the environment or 
to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pollution prevention approach demonstrates that government 
must identify toxic substances, work with others who are in 
positions to devise effective solutions to change specific 
processes and reduce or eliminate pollutants and waste and, where 
necessary, aggressively control these substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution prevention is a much better approach than trying to 
control or clean pollution up after it has been created.  The 
pollution prevention approach benefits the environment, improves 
the health of Canadians and saves money.  Good environmental 
practices make good business sense.  They lower operating costs, 
increase value for customers and build loyalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are particularly concerned about the risks that toxic 
substances pose to their health, their children's health, as well 
as the long term sustainability of their environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been recognized that stricter management action is 
required for toxics if they result primarily from human activity, 
if they persist in the environment for long periods of time and 
if they bioaccumulate, that is, the toxins are stored in the 
tissues of living creatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minute quantities of these substances can build up over time. 
When they do, they can reach levels that cause serious, long term 
adverse effects to the environment or to human health.  Once in 
the environment, these substances will damage our health and our 
ecosystem over many generations through subtle effects to the 
endocrine, immune, reproductive and other sensitive biological 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A virtual elimination approach for these substances is required 
to protect our health and that of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 allows the government to completely prohibit the 
importation and manufacture of these substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental protection compliance orders are a powerful new 
tool that work like injunctions.  Our inspectors will be able to 
issue orders on the spot to stop illegal activity and, if 
necessary, require an action to correct a violation so that the 
environment and public safety are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 also creates a new category of enforcement officer 
called CEPA investigators.  These officers will be investigation 
specialists with expertise in the gathering of evidence and court 
procedures.  They will have all the powers of inspectors as well 
as certain peace officer powers such as the authority to serve 
court documents. 
Environmental protection alternative measures, EPAMs, are another 
enforcement tool.  These alternative measures are essentially 
negotiated settlements to criminal charges.  They allow the 
government to get companies back into compliance and make them 
pay fines or restore the environment without proceeding into 
costly and lengthy court cases.  Charges are withdrawn only once 
the conditions of the environmental protection alternative 
measures are met.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a role to play in maintaining a healthy and 
viable environment.  Canadians want a healthy environment and 
they want to be involved in the solutions.  Government alone 
cannot be expected to protect the environment.  Canadians have 
throughout the years expressed their desire to be active 
participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While provisions for public participation were included by 
parliament in the original CEPA they were limited.  The new CEPA 
seeks to improve opportunities for public participation. First, 
Bill C-32 requires the establishment of a registry of 
environmental information.  It is currently proposed to make the 
registry accessible through the Internet.  This will increase 
information available to Canadians.  Use of the registry should 
increase public participation, how Canadians make more informed 
decisions and make it easier to hold the government accountable 
for its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-32 sets out an explicit requirement to establish 
and publish the national pollutants release inventory so that 
Canadians have access to information about pollutants being 
released in their communities.  This inventory exists now on the 
basis of a policy decision.  With Bill C-32 the government is 
going further by making it a legal commitment to provide the 
public with information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, under the existing CEPA whistleblower protection applies 
only to individuals who report illegal releases of toxic 
substances.  Bill C-32 also broadens this to include all 
violations such as improper storage of PCB contaminated material. 
Individuals who report infractions can have their confidentiality 
protected and all federally regulated employees can report 
violations without fear of dismissal, harassment or disciplinary 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the current CEPA allows citizens to sue only if 
they can demonstrate that they have suffered loss or damage 
because of a violation of the act.  In the original red book we 
stated our intention to use the review of CEPA to examine giving 
members of the public access to the courts as a last recourse if 
the federal government fails to enforce an environmental law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 allows citizens to sue when there has been a violation 
of CEPA and the government fails to enforce the act resulting in 
significant harm to the environment.  In other words, a person 
can sue for damage to the environment without the need to prove 
they suffered personal harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes will foster greater public participation which 
will help ensure the protection of Canada's environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to enter into the debate on 
this very important piece of environmental legislation.  The 
legacy we as members of the House leave our children and 
generations to follow is reflected in how we regard the natural 
environment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure.  I would like to address the 
bill before the House on behalf of the member for 
Nanaimo—Alberni, the Reform environment critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's position on the environment is very clear. The Reform 
Party supports ensuring that all Canadians dwell in a clean and 
healthy environment.  Reform believes that environmental 
considerations must carry equal weight with economic, social and 
technical considerations in the development of a project.  This 
is the key to protecting our environment. We believe in public 
consultation, public participation and public commitment. 
Governments must work together to ensure our environment is a 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Environmental Protection Act came into force 
in 1988 the primary objective of the act was to protect the 
environment and protect human health.  The act was intended to 
fill regulatory gaps in certain environmental matters, 
particularly with regard to toxic substances.  It was also aimed 
at enabling Canada to fulfil international obligations.  The 
Environmental Protection Act replaced and incorporated several 
previously existing acts such as the environmental contaminants 
act, the ocean dumping control act and the clean air act. 
Section 139 of the act requires a five year mandatory review of 
the administration of the act, and review began in the last 
parliament.  The Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development held hearings which resulted in a report 
full of recommendations so that the then minister of the 
environment drafted Bill C-74 in the last parliament. But for 
many reasons, largely a result of its inadequacies, which I will 
get into briefly a little later, it died on the order paper and 
never made it through the House in the last parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are talking about today is Bill C-32 which is a 
revamped version of Bill C-74 tabled in the last parliament. This 
new legislation provides measures for protection of the 
environment and human health, pollution prevention, management of 
toxic substances, virtual elimination of releases of substances 
determined to be most dangerous, and partnerships to achieve 
highest levels of environmental quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to CEPA contained in Bill C-32 include provisions to 
implement pollution prevention, new procedures for the 
investigation and assessment of substances and new requirements 
for toxic assessments, new provisions respecting fuels, 
international air and water pollution, motor emissions, federal 
and aboriginal land protection, disposal of wastes and other 
matter at sea and the export and import of wastes.  That is quite 
an expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provides for the gathering of information for 
research and the creation of inventories of data, publishing of 
objectives, guidelines and codes of practice, new powers for 
inspectors, investigators and laboratory analysts, environmental 
protection alternative measures and civil suit action guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we are still considering the merits of this bill it 
appears the legislation has resurfaced with amendments that work 
in favour of the bill.  There are many areas in this bill that 
Reform supports.  However, there is also concerns which must be 
addressed both in committee and in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking today there are four major areas that I want to 
discuss. Those four areas contained in the legislation are the 
main areas of jurisdictional issues, public consultation, science 
and enforcement.  I will start off with the jurisdictional 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, environmental jurisdiction is not clearly defined 
and separated in our Constitution. Since the 1980s expanded 
environmental protection at the federal and provincial levels of 
government has caused considerable tension.  Although the supreme 
court decision ruled last September that Ottawa has the right to 
enact legislation to protect the environment the federal 
government should not take this as a carte blanche to run 
roughshod over the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although environmental issues transcend boundaries there is no 
reason for the federal government to interfere in provincial 
affairs.  Federal-provincial co-operation is essential to ensure 
environmental policies are carried through.  Clearly provinces 
must be involved in this process as Environment Canada simply 
does not have sufficient resources to take full responsibility 
for the implementation of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform blue book policy clearly supports the establishment of 
clear federal-provincial jurisdiction over environmental matters. 
There have been some amendments to the bill introduced since the 
last parliament to require co-operation between levels of 
government and to better recognize the harmonization accord.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble sets out a shared responsibility for the 
environment.  This is a start.  However, this can be improved as 
the bill does not spell out that the government will discharge 
its responsibilities by working co-operatively under the 
federal-provincial-territorial Canada-wide accord on 
environmental harmonization agreed to in principle by the 
Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment and the 
subagreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 does not and should ensure that the provinces are able 
to advise the federal government on an international treaty 
requiring provincial implementation and that they take part in 
the treaty's implementation strategy.  The bill also empowers the 
minister to control the movement of non-hazardous solid waste to 
or from the United States.  As waste management is primarily 
provincial jurisdiction, this probably represents an intrusion on 
provincial powers that must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Bill C-32 creates a national advisory committee. 
The concept of a national advisory committee appears quite 
meaningful at first observation, yet on examination of this 
section of the bill it is clear that the committee may be 
compromised by its very structure.  The committee, surprise, is 
appointed by the minister and not by the provinces.  Therefore it 
is very likely that this committee may function as little more 
than a political vehicle to promote the minister's agenda rather 
than a national vehicle to ensure that the provinces and 
territories are properly represented in the decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to talk about four issues, jurisdictional issues, 
public consultation, science and enforcement.  I have talked 
about the jurisdictional issues.  I am now going to talk about 
public consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical that the process for public consultation in the 
development of regulations and additions of new substances to 
this act be as fair and open as possible.  The Reform Party is 
founded on the principle of grassroots participation and public 
consultation in policy development.  This is particularly 
important when we deal with issues such as the environment that 
affect all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament one of the strong complaints voiced by 
many against the bill was that it lacked proper consultation. 
There were over 100 concerns regarding the bill when it was 
introduced in the last Parliament.  Some areas of concern have 
been addressed in the new legislation, though there are still 
areas that need attention.  Some of the issues concern the public 
consultation process.  For example, the bill needs to ensure that 
all draft regulations and guidelines are released for public 
comment 60 days before the minister formally releases the 
assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates and environmental registry.  However, the form 
and access of the registry is at the minister's discretion. 
Access to this registry should be open and the form clearly 
announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act allows for notice of final agreements to go into the 
<I>Canada Gazette</I> but it does not require that the final text 
of all agreements be published in full in the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I> or as an alternative that access be provided through 
the Internet.  These are very common sense things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act does not allow the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development adequate time to review proposed 
administrative and equivalency agreements.  Clearly it is 
important that we move away from the old way of doing business 
behind closed doors and into a more transparent manner of 
conducting business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area I want to talk about is science. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with the environment, sound science is essential to 
good policy discussions and decisions.  This is not always the 
case with the present government.  Our legislation must ensure 
that political decisions do not overshadow making the right 
choices to protect our environment.  Decisions made under the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act must be substantiated by 
scientific study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last bill had serious problems regarding the minister's 
power to bypass section 65 and its risk assessment approach for 
determination of toxic substances.  This section gave the 
minister unlimited powers to bypass science in her decision 
making.  This was one of the critical reasons Reform, industry 
and many Canadians could not support the bill.  It is likely one 
of the reasons for its demise in the last parliament.  This 
section has now been amended.  I look forward to receiving 
comments from witnesses as to whether this has been properly 
addressed in the new bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some areas of concern regarding the science of the bill includes 
the fact that toxic is not defined in the preamble.  Yet it is 
defined in the section on controlling toxic substances. This is 
clearly problematic because it may allow substances to be defined 
toxic without scientific evidence which proves that they are in 
fact toxic.  This section may give the minister of the department 
authority to arbitrarily ban substances which, if true, is 
frightening to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a major concern in the last parliament.  A separate 
piece of legislation went through parliament banning MMT without 
a scientific basis. We now have an ongoing legal suit from Ethyl 
Corporation that is held up by many as a fallout from things like 
negotiating the MAI as a complexity that can be made much worse 
through something like the MAI.  If the decision on MMT had been 
done not on ramming legislation through the House without 
scientific basis but had been done on a scientific rationale the 
whole argument would be moot.  We must ensure that the 
legislation does not allow that kind of back door thing to occur 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is the fact that provisions to provide for toxic 
assessment consultation failed to require that qualified experts 
from government, academia and industry be full partners in the 
assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another controversial section of the bill is where it provides 
for a national ban on substances banned in other provinces or 
industrialized countries.  Such a policy could negate the need 
for Canada to carry out a risk assessment as a basis for chemical 
control, which is the standard accepted internationally and by 
the science community.  This policy could also undermine the 
necessity of requiring a scientific basis for decisions.  It is 
critical that the role of science be clarified so that science 
forms the basis of decisions made under the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act.  This needs to be spelled out 
clearly and precisely.  Without that all else fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth subject area I want to discuss is the whole area of 
enforcement, which is also critical to environmental policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has many clear positions on enforcement. 
Reform bluebook policy clearly supports the principle that the 
polluter shall pay for its pollution controls, that this be 
stringently enforced in an unbiased manner and that penalties be 
severe enough that polluters will not consider them a licence fee 
to pollute. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform also supports fines and jail sentences for officers and 
executives of companies violating environmental laws.  The 
biggest problem with the Canadian Environmental Protection Act in 
this regard is its lack of enforcement.  When CEPA was proclaimed 
10 years ago the Conservative government bragged that it had 
introduced the toughest environmental law in the western 
hemisphere.  Yet this has proven to be quite the exaggeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the principal concerns regarding this act is inadequate 
funding for enforcement.  The Department of the Environment 
simply does not have the resources to ensure that the 
requirements of the act are fulfilled.  The clearest way to state 
that is that the environment department has had almost two-thirds 
of its budget slashed since the Liberals came to power.  That is 
quite a commitment to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how tough the minister makes this act it will make no 
difference unless the department has the resources to enforce the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be emphasized, however, is more than enforcement. The 
operative word is compliance, not enforcement.  Compliance is 
number one.  It is always better to follow the carrot on the 
stick approach.  A law must have the capacity to enforce its 
regulations.  Yet it will be a more effective law if it can deter 
individuals from breaking the law or, better yet, if it can 
encourage individuals to follow the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That applies to all legislation in the House.  If we could 
follow the basic principle that incentives, all things being 
equal, work better than sticks, I think we would all be much 
further ahead.  The business community certainly knows about 
natural incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other areas of enforcement contained in Bill C-32 also need to 
be examined and possibly amended for improvement.  For example, 
the right to supervision contained within the bill may be 
improved if amended so that the government is made a mandatory 
party to any suit.  Whistleblower protection contained in the 
legislation may also require expansion to include whistleblower 
protection for workers who report breaches of the law and bad 
environmental practices, not just to inspectors but to the public 
and through the media.  Pollution is a public issue and workers 
should have the right to publicize it without fear of sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the many needed areas of improvement, some of the other 
improvements to the bill include improved time lines for adding 
new substances that have been assessed to the domestic substances 
list.  Pollution prevention planning guidelines have been further 
developed in the new bill.  Recognition of voluntary instruments 
has also been added.  Section 51 has been amended to ensure that 
pollution prevention, virtual elimination and environmental 
emergency plans can only be required by the minister for 
substances on the list of toxic substances.  Greater flexibility 
has been provided in the preparation of pollution prevention 
plans to keep with the policy objective that these plans do not 
become akin to excessive regulatory burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does a bureaucrat cut red tape?  The answer is lengthways. 
As we can see many changes have been made to Bill C-32 to make 
the bill more acceptable to the public than Bill C-74 which died 
in the last parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still areas of concern that need to be worked out. 
Canadians have waited a long time for the government to pass 
meaningful and realistic environmental legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the recent example of the fiasco over Kyoto.  We do not 
need another one of those.  Canada went with no plan, no 
preannounced target.  We abandoned our own negotiators for 
political reasons.  We had no cost benefit analysis, no idea of 
how to get to our commitment.  It was an international 
embarrassment due to a Liberal search for political correctness, 
without caring about the downstream consequences.  It was almost 
as if we would not bother to measure them so that we could not be 
held accountable later.  It is sort of like make it up as we go 
along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping to see our government get away from its empty 
rhetoric and destructive political agenda and move toward 
something more realistic and acceptable to Canadians that will 
truly benefit our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears there has been progress in amendments to the 
legislation since the last parliament.  The bill has shortcomings 
and some revisions are certainly required, as I have pointed out. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today on a subject of the utmost importance. We in the 
Bloc Quebecois consider that the relationship between developing 
our economy and protecting the environment is one of the major 
challenges facing our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past few generations, the capacity of the human race to 
modify the world ecosystem has undergone a spectacular increase, 
as the result of the population explosion and our dizzying rate 
of technological progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World economic activity, for example, is more than 20 times what 
it was in 1900. 
Consequently, many human activities are on the verge of 
surpassing our planet's potential to replenish its resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, the energy we consume is responsible for releasing 
billions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere and for using up 
more than 40% of the planet's organic material. Every year, we 
burn almost as much fossil fuel as the earth was able to produce 
in a million years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we are forced to acknowledge that poverty and hardship 
exist throughout the world, and will continue to exist, we do 
not throw up our hands in despair at its scope.  Similarly, we 
are capable of seeking solutions together to many of the 
challenges posed by our deteriorating environment, and the 
multiplication of substances that are a threat to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short-sighted view will not enable us to solve these problems. 
What we need is a fundamental change to our way of making 
decisions at all levels of society. We need to start 
incorporating environmental considerations in our day to day 
decisions as individuals, managers and legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must treat the environment as the limited and unique resource 
that it is.  We must treat human life like the fragile thing 
that it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no illusions about this.  The precarious state of 
our environment is the result of what will soon be two centuries 
of neglect.  There can be no quick fix.  There will be more 
crises, more ecological accidents.  What is needed essentially 
is to restore the ecological balance that has been upset 
gradually over the centuries, and particularly over the past 100 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a long term undertaking, and one which will require the 
commitment of each and every one of us, from the various 
governments down to the last individual. Any serious response to 
the environmental challenge will lay our present lifestyle open 
to question, because the environmental issue is more than just 
pollution, domestic and chemical waste, or land use management. 
These are just symptoms of a larger problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thing is the way we approach our relationships, define 
our prosperity and select a lifestyle. In this respect, we are 
witnessing a real revolution in attitudes. Recent polls, 
newspaper forums and radio hot-lines all agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public, and young people in particular, consider quality of 
life more important than the mere accumulation of consumer 
goods. They choose health over the pursuit of economic expansion 
at all cost. These new values are priorities. 
They should be used as the basis for the political will to 
allocate sufficient resources to the preservation of the 
environment we all care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical that this government repeatedly drew upon this 
widely held public opinion to finally come up short in terms of 
a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases and protect the 
collective scientific tools used to assess our environmental 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government cannot be satisfied with reacting to 
environmental crises. Never has the government developed a long 
term action plan which takes into account the collective 
diversity of the territory for which it is responsible under the 
Constitution. Never has the government given any serious thought 
to where it wanted to be five or ten years down the road and 
even after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have a political will, governments must be able to 
set out the goals they wish to achieve through specific actions. 
For the time being, we must unfortunately express concern about 
this government's lack of vision on environmental issues in the 
current constitutional context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, since I have been sitting in this House as the member 
for Rosemont, not one federalist party has been able to come up 
with a vision of the future that reconciles two fundamental 
values in my view: respect for societies, including Quebec 
society, and implementation of sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 as it stands symbolizes the failure of a unilateral 
federal approach, which denies the right of the Quebec people to 
decide their own future. This is my view of Bill C-32. Because 
of what I believe in, I cannot consider this bill simply from a 
sovereignist or environmentalist point of view. 
I am opposed to Bill C-32, because this Liberal bill fails to 
reconcile two fundamental values for Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, my vision of sustainable development is based on the 
conclusions of the United Nations commission on the environment 
and development, chaired by the then Prime Minister of Norway, 
Gro Brundtland. The commission defined this new concept that it 
was proposing to the world, namely that economic development must 
now be subject to environmental considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear: it is wrong to claim that the environment must 
now be at odds with economic development. These two basic 
realities are not at odds: they are essential elements of a type 
of progress that is now sustainable in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of sustainable development simply means that we must 
no longer endanger the resources of our planet and that we must 
make sure our natural resources will still be there for future 
generations. In other words, economic development must be 
achieved by preserving our planet's resources, rather than by 
using them up, or, to use a financial image, by using the 
interest and not the capital, in terms of our resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic development must not jeopardize the planet's natural 
balance. Since I first came to Ottawa, all too often I have seen 
people try to change the meaning of sustainable development. They 
closely link that concept to economic growth and then use it to 
oppose environmental concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are not helping anyone's cause. If anything, they 
take us back 10 years, before the Liberals and before the work of 
the United Nations on development and the environment. 
We now have to recognize that the respect for individuals must be 
extended to their surroundings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it is not a question of choosing between 
economic growth and environmental protection.  Since both of 
these concerns are essential to global survival, what matters is 
finding an approach that takes both into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This environmental challenge still requires changes in attitude 
that force us to reconcile what might initially look like 
contradictory goals.  I am convinced that we can forge a 
consensus in Quebec around these environmental and economic 
convictions.  I am sure that a great many Canadians and 
Quebeckers also share my vision of sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The misunderstanding does not lie at this level.  The difference 
resides in our identifying with distinct peoples. 
We want to acquire as many tools as possible for orienting our 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our wishes are the opposite of those of the majority of 
Canadians, who basically want to see Ottawa play an increased 
role in numerous areas, including that of the environment. 
Elected representatives from Quebec, whatever their political 
stripe, have always fought to be able to retain the prerogatives 
that allow us to shape our future as we see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were any sign of this feeling of belonging and this 
desire for freedom in the other provinces, Bloc Quebecois 
members would not be the only ones rejecting the federal 
government's attempts to keep on grabbing a little more power. 
We can only conclude that this wish for autonomy is confined to 
Quebec. 
The fact of the matter is that, every time this country wanted 
or had to make weighty decisions of the sort that reveal basic 
natures, it went into crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of finding comfort in the face of adversity, instead of 
being galvanized by a challenge, and united in trust and hope, 
like a normal country, it instead fell into painful division. 
From the Riel affair to the schools in Manitoba, from 
conscription in World War I to conscription in World War II, 
from the 1982 patriation to the passage of the free trade 
agreement, from the Meech Lake accord to the Charlottetown 
accord, each time the same wounds were opened anew, the same 
tenuous solidarity was torn apart along the same stress lines by 
the same tensions. Paralysis and uncertainty were the poisoned 
fruits of this inability to live together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two recent environmental initiatives provide another 
illustration of the forces blocking the legitimate aspirations 
of two peoples still bound together by one federal government. 
The first issue is of the highest importance for our future, 
since it involves climactic changes affecting the nature of life 
on earth as we know it today.  As I speak, millions of tonnes of 
carbon dioxide are being released into the atmosphere.  In North 
America alone, we are responsible for more than a quarter of 
these emissions, which are having an unprecedented effect on our 
atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time already, scientists from the four corners of the 
globe have noted that the planet has been warming up at a rate 
unprecedented in the past hundred years or so.  Naturally, many 
research teams have looked at this phenomenon to understand its 
origins.  One after another, the teams have published their 
disturbing results, which have begun to reveal that human 
activity is responsible for global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their conclusions were immediately contested by many scientists, 
who were astonished to learn that humans could have such an 
impact on the atmosphere protecting us.  For a long time these 
scientists and ecologists were reduced to preaching in the 
wilderness.  However, by the mid-1980s, we were becoming 
increasing aware of the seriousness of the environmental problem 
we now face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the main concerns relating to the 1982 economic crisis were 
resolved, our societies began to realize the scope and the 
amplitude of our environmental problems.  We all benefited from 
the expanded debate that ensued.  It did not take long for the 
environment to become a concern to society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public awareness supported both specialists and political 
leaders in their efforts to further protect the environment. 
After facing the many challenges necessitated by greater levels 
of protection of waters, air, forests and the earth, we looked 
to problems at the global level, such as those concerning our 
atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international scale of these problems necessarily involves 
global and co-operative action by nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to the signature in Helsinki, in 1984, of the first 
international protocol to reduce transborder emissions 
responsible for acid rain.  Three years later, in 1987, Montreal 
hosted an international meeting that resulted in the signing of 
the Montreal protocol, the purpose of which is to reduce the 
production of gases harmful to the ozone layer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years later, over 150 nations got together in Rio for the 
earth summit. This meeting led to the signing of a UN framework 
agreement to limit concentrations of greenhouse gases. 
At this unprecedented summit, developed countries adopted the 
common goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at the 1990 
level by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, five years after the Berlin conference, Canada as a whole 
has achieved nothing but a resounding absence of concrete 
measures for meeting this challenge. Why?  Because the Liberal 
government, which has been in office since 1993, seems to have 
devoted more effort to developing an environmental doublespeak 
than to implementing concrete measures for reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no lack of examples. In a self-congratulatory 
advertisement that appeared on April 24, the Liberals claimed to 
have demonstrated international leadership by helping reduce the 
causes of climate change in the world. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 
Unless, in Liberal speak, leadership means one of the worst 
performances in the world when it comes to reducing greenhouse 
gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, compared to other OECD members, Canada has done poorly 
in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, in spite of the good 
results achieved by Quebec, which is still in a position to meet 
the objectives set in Rio. For Canada as a whole, however, 
observers expect that there will be an increase of 13% in 
emissions by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, by international leadership the Liberals are not referring 
to this country's notorious failure to reduce greenhouse gases, 
perhaps they are referring to its apparent wish to be the last 
to present a reduction goal for the period up to 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, thanks to the Liberal government, Canada was the last 
G-7 country to present its negotiating position for the Kyoto 
summit. For a long time, the only public position that was 
endorsed by the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of

September 1993 during a UN peacekeeping operation in the former

conflict between Croat and Serbian forces.  A UN sponsored 
ceasefire agreement called on the Croats to withdraw their forces

establish a buffer zone.

came under repeated attacks but held its ground.  Eventually the 
Canadians forced compliance with the ceasefire agreement and 
ended an ethnic cleansing operation in the area.  The Canadians 
were given a rare unit citation by the French UN commander for 
their collective bravery and devotion to duty.  Unfortunately,

minister, say “this has never been a political issue.  We should 
not be making it a political issue?”  Mr. Serby went on to say 
“Now you have political parties today who want to try to make 
hay politically on this irrespective of who they are.  I worry 
about that”.

of the provincial counterparts who are part of the arrangement, 
reject that and think it is wrong.  The hon. member did not deal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
year's budget announced an increase in the emergency services 
volunteer tax free allowance.  The difficulty is that unless they 
receive remuneration for their services, volunteers cannot claim 
any tax deduction.  Typically urban volunteer firefighters 
receive some form of remuneration while rural firefighters do 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government treating rural volunteer firefighters as 
second class cousins compared to urban firefighters?  Will the

<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this tax deduction has been offered in the case of essential 
services for small municipalities that may have trouble paying 
their emergency volunteers more than they usually give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case it would be extremely costly to extend it more than 
has been done in the budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
need to address this problem.  Almost every member of the House 
has rural communities that are dealing with this issue.  It is a 
problem that crosses party lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government chose to extend benefits to urban 
firefighters without considering the deduction for their rural 
cousins.  Rural firefighters across Canada deserve the same 
benefits as urban firefighters. 
They risk their lives in the same manner and deserve the same 
type of benefit and treatment as their rural counterparts.

general criteria for determining compensation should be under a

be whether with the benefit of hindsight the injury could have 
been avoided by an alternative diagnostic or therapeutic

exempt Canadians from the U.S. border controls, the draconian

the floor of the senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the minister is relying so heavily on his feelings that

Continued dependence on this product could be hazardous to your

we now have to look at that particular agreement to see that it

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK175">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resume consideration of the motion that Bill C-32, an 
act respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the 
environment and human health in order to contribute to 
sustainable development, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this second 
part of my speech, I would like to draw members' attention to 
the fact that Bill C-32 is not part of a decentralizing approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It renews the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which has 
been so vigorously opposed by the various governments of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, the Liberal government attempted to get 
the previous version of this bill passed, but gave up the 
attempt in light of the huge outcry, which could have 
jeopardized the upcoming elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-74 therefore died on 
the Order Paper last session, but CEPA calls for a five-year 
review and that deadline is already past, so the government is 
at it again, introducing a bill that maintains the national 
vision, which still does not sit well with the members of the 
National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the purpose of this bill?  With it, the prevention of 
pollution becomes a national objective. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to amend Canada's legislation on the 
environment by changing certain technicalities while maintaining 
the essence of a centralizing vision of environmental 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation introduces provisions to implement 
pollution prevention, new procedures for the investigation and 
assessment of substances and new requirements with respect to 
substances that the Minister of the Environment and the Minister 
of Health have determined to be toxic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a broad range of such substances.  Investigators will 
be given new powers, for example, and there will be new 
regulatory measures to deal with offences.  Barely a few weeks 
after the sensational statement by senior officials of the 
Department of the Environment, who wondered openly whether their 
department could still monitor offending businesses as cuts had 
been so draconian, we may well ask ourselves what purpose is 
served exactly by tightening offence regulations if they cannot 
be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of including the Native peoples in the 
environmental assessment process.  We wonder, however, about the 
double standard in the degree of openness toward the Native 
peoples and Quebec. 
Native representation on a national advisory committee, as with 
the provinces and the territories, in fact diminishes the power 
of Quebec, which like the Native peoples wants to deal with the 
rest of Canada nation to nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What powers will the renewed CEPA delegate to Quebec and the 
other provinces in Canada?  Although in theory Bill C-32 
recognizes that responsibility for the environment is shared 
between the federal government and the provinces, in practice it 
delegates no powers to them, and this runs counter to real 
environmental harmonization between the various levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 unfortunately aims at strengthening the federal 
government's preponderance in the field of environmental 
protection. 
This centralization runs counter to the clearly expressed wish 
of the National Assembly to participate fully in the 
environmental assessment of any project on its territory. The 
bill is also in flagrant contradiction with the spirit of the 
harmonization process launched between the federal government 
and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Government of Quebec has pulled out of 
negotiations, and is looking further into this promising 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill thus opens the door to duplication of federal and 
provincial powers.  The federal government is justifying its 
interference in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction by invoking the 
recent supreme court decision with respect to Hydro-Québec.  This 
case has always been contested by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the courts that ruled on it, including Quebec's highest 
court, the Court of Appeal, declared the federal government's 
order invalid. 
Only the supreme court, with its unitary vision of Canada, 
overturned the Quebec court rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 also contains a number of new features.  For instance, 
the government wants to replace the existing federal-provincial 
CEPA committee with a new national advisory committee.  This 
committee would consist of one representative each from 
Environment Canada and Health Canada, one representative from 
each province and territory, and up to six aboriginal 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee will advise the two federal ministers on the 
drafting of regulations, the management of toxic substances, and 
other matters of mutual interest.  The provinces will advise the 
federal minister through a national advisory committee. 
The bill contains provisions for the signing of co-operation 
agreements covering activities such as inspections, 
investigations and the collection of monitoring data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes provisions relating specifically to 
aboriginal governments.  They will have the same rights and 
responsibilities as provincial and territorial governments, 
including the right to conclude administrative and work-sharing 
agreements and equivalent provision agreements with the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, they must be consulted with respect to all 
environmental matters affecting their territories.  Up to six 
representatives will sit on the national advisory committee. 
Again, it is surprising to see that Quebec does not get such 
recognition of its specificity and its culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act also provides for increased public participation and 
for better protection for those who report CEPA violations. 
Individuals will be allowed to play a role in the decision 
making process, by submitting to the Minister of the Environment 
comments or notices of opposition following certain decisions, 
and by asking the minister to investigate alleged violations of 
the act.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides that individuals' identity may not be 
disclosed, and it protects employees who report violations under 
the federal legislation. It will also allow individuals to bring 
civil action to protect the environment when the government is 
not enforcing the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for public information, such information will no longer be 
limited to the data found in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. The act will 
create a new public registry that will include all environmental 
information published under the CEPA, including decisions and 
regulations. This registry will complete the 1993 National 
Pollutant Release Inventory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards pollution prevention, this issue will become a 
national objective. 
The minister will have the authority to require a pollution 
prevention plan in respect of substances deemed toxic under the 
CEPA. A tribunal will also be authorized to demand a pollution 
prevention plan, an environmental emergency plan, or to rule 
that research must be done on the use and the elimination of the 
substances involved in the violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act creates a national information centre on pollution 
prevention to help the industry share the knowledge and 
technologies that relate to pollution prevention activities. The 
new CEPA also provides for the establishment of a reward program 
to recognize the voluntary efforts made by the industry to 
prevent pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the protection of water, the bill seeks to protect marine 
environment against land and atmospheric pollution sources. 
It also limits what can be disposed of in the sea to a list of 
non-hazardous materials, and will require those desiring to carry 
out such a disposal to prove that this is the best solution and 
that reuse or recycling is not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government feels that this bill will enable it to 
work, with the United States in particular, to prevent or 
restrict cross-border marine pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 will enhance the EPA's authority as far as fuel and 
fuel additives are concerned.  Imported fuels, as well as those 
crossing Canada's provincial and territorial boundaries, must 
meet certain requirements.  The bill will confer the ability to 
establish a national fuel mark to indicate compliance with 
environmental standards for fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where international atmospheric pollution is concerned, the 
government wants to do onto others as they do onto it.  When a 
state has not allowed Canada rights similar to those Canada has 
allowed, the federal minister's will have the option to take 
action in cases of international atmospheric pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for protection of the air, Bill C-32 calls for a national 
emissions mark for equipment meeting its standards. It 
incorporates the power to limit engine emissions.  These 
provisions apply to motor vehicles in general, which include 
pleasure craft, construction equipment, farm machinery, 
snowblowers and lawn mowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes enhanced federal power over cross-border 
traffic involving hazardous and non-hazardous waste, domestic 
garbage in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have touched on some of the aspects of this bill. 
We cannot explain why the bill clashes with the harmonization 
the government claims to have as a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we recall, Quebec refused to sign the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment agreement this past January 29. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment met at 
that time, Quebec Environment Minister Paul Bégin refused to 
subscribe to that agreement, as long as the conditions called 
for by Quebec are not met by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditions include recognizing that Quebec has primary 
jurisdiction in certain areas, under the constitution, a firm 
commitment on the part of the federal government to amend 
federal legislation accordingly, and finally, the signature by 
Quebec and the federal government of a bilateral agreement on 
environmental assessment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Minister Bégin stressed that the federal government's 
plans to revise the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
giving the federal government increased powers, contravened the 
spirit and goals of the environmental harmonization accord 
negotiations, especially with regard to preventing overlap and 
intergovernmental conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Bégin's position underscored our own, as expressed in 
the Bloc Quebecois' dissenting opinion made public in December 
1997. This step followed the one taken on November 20, 1996. 
The Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment had then 
tentatively agreed to the Canada-wide environmental harmonization 
accord as well as two subagreements on inspections and 
standards. The subagreement on environmental assessment was 
negotiated during the winter of 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was aimed at improving the protection of the environment in 
order to contribute to sustainable development, while respecting 
each government's fields of jurisdiction in a more efficient 
manner. It contained general principles to be implemented 
through subagreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always supported harmonization between 
the federal government and the provinces if it eliminates 
overlap and administrative and legislative duplication between 
both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we are in favour of environmental harmonization as long as 
it is not used by the federal government to hide its 
interference in provincial areas of jurisdiction or, conversely, 
to dump programs on the provinces without the appropriate 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that harmonization recognize the exclusive or 
primary jurisdiction of the provinces in the areas entrusted to 
them by the Constitution. The spirit of harmonization must be 
reflected in the changes the federal government is making to 
existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, the Bloc Quebecois thinks that only the Quebec 
environmental assessment process must prevail in the province of 
Quebec. 
The harmonization sought by the federal government must be 
reflected in its legislative agenda. However, we think that Bill 
C-32 does not take into consideration the legislative 
harmonization process envisioned by the federal government and 
the provinces and is simply another example of federal 
interference in a provincial area of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that this new piece of legislation 
goes against the past positions taken by Quebec and against the 
spirit of the federal-provincial harmonization initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois thinks it is unfortunate that the federal 
government refuses to put into law its good intentions in terms 
of environmental harmonization and prefers to hide behind a 
Supreme Court ruling that it can use as an argument for 
centralization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill confirms that, with the latest Supreme 
Court ruling on environmental matters, the federal government is 
trying to broaden its powers in this area. Although the federal 
and provincial governments share responsibility for the 
environment under the Constitution, the Liberal government 
clearly wants to subordinate the role of the provinces to that 
of the central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emphasis on pollution prevention as a method of priority 
intervention with the power to require pollution prevention 
plans, which are mandatory for substances included in the list 
of priority toxic substances, involves the development of a 
direct partnership between the federal government and industrial 
sectors that are already partly covered under Quebec programs, 
such as the industrial waste reduction program that has been 
implemented in the pulp and paper industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures contained in Bill C-32 will allow the federal 
government to establish national priorities for intervention. 
Therefore, the provinces will have no choice but to adopt 
federal regulations, otherwise they will be forced to see the 
federal government serve the same clientele.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative and regulatory powers that the federal 
government is giving itself are very important, and while the 
Liberal government is constantly talking about its willingness 
to work in partnership with the provinces, it nevertheless 
institutionalizes its powers in order to play a paternalistic 
role towards the provinces. That is what the Bloc Quebecois 
deplores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, in light of what I just said, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois are against the principle of this bill at the second 
reading stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-32, an act respecting 
pollution and the protection of the environment and human health 
in order to contribute to sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleague, the member for Churchill River, my 
constituents of Sackville—Eastern Shore and the New Democratic 
Party, we are opposed to Bill C-32.  The New Democratic Party is 
not opposed to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  We are 
opposed to Bill C-32 which continues the Liberal policy of 
devolution and the removal of federal responsibilities for 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is a reintroduction of Bill C-74 which died with the 
election call last year.  I will not speak today on it section by 
section, clause by clause, point by point.  The legislation spans 
200 plus pages and contains 356 clauses.  I wish to address the 
reasons for and the basic principles behind the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, also known as CEPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CEPA was developed in the mid-1980s when there was growing 
concern about the presence of toxic substances in the environment 
and the adverse impacts on the environment from a variety of 
pollution sources and industries contributing thereto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consciousness was not an oversight revelation that 
something was suddenly wrong with the environment.  The move 
toward and calls for improved environmental protection came from 
a heightened awareness that man can damage the environment, that 
man can poison the air we breathe, that man can contaminate the 
waters we drink and that man can destroy the soil we walk upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key turning point was the publication of a book written by a 
very brave woman ahead of the times, a book of revelations and 
thoughts so contrary to the industrial complex and the misguided 
beliefs that the earth is an endless supply house for our 
personal use and pillage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The book provoked controversy.  The very idea that someone could 
espouse such views was considered an outlandish travesty.  The 
book was <I>Silent Spring</I> by Rachel Carson.  I urge my 
colleagues to read it as we embark upon the review and 
restructuring of CEPA.  It paints the picture I believe we are 
revisiting in the current Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental protection is a requirement.  Environmental 
protection is not an option.  The Brundtland statement on 
sustainable development is not words.  It is a practice few 
countries embrace by deed or implement by actions.  It is 
development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The founding principles for sustainable development can include 
some compromise adaptation for different regions or socioeconomic 
concerns.  However there are lines we cannot cross if we are to 
avoid the mistakes of the past, the environmental degradation we 
must acknowledge if we are to move forward as a society and 
protect the environment for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 states “the protection of the environment and human 
health in order to contribute to sustainable development”. The 
environment and human health cannot be considered as separate 
entities.  They are tied together as one.  A healthy environment 
provides healthy living.  Rachel Carson identified the link in 
the basic process through language easily understood by 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several events contributed to the original CEPA: beyond 
<I>Silent Spring</I>, the travesty at Love Canal, the accident at 
Bhopal, the poisoned Beluga whales washing ashore along the St. 
Lawrence, the acid rain carried between countries and the near 
loss of North America's Great Lakes ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original CEPA provided the first steps toward recovery, a 
check and balance between dangerous environmental practices and 
sustainable policies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need the legislation?  We were being poisoned.  Our 
children's future was being compromised.  Legislation to ensure 
the protection of the environment which supports us as a species 
was required.  The polluters polluted; the victims suffered and 
died.  By victims we cannot consider man as the sole reason for 
action.  All species suffered:  the wildlife, the flora and the 
fauna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original CEPA provided an ability to act to protect the 
environment, to levy fines, to expose polluters and to support 
sustainable development beyond the generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 has strayed from the original principles to protect 
and to provide recourse.  As science and technology evolved in 
the past decade, the ability and capacity for corporations and 
people to act responsibly toward the environment and to 
demonstrate environmental stewardship also evolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industrial complex has discovered that clean operations 
equal efficiency and increased profits.  The majority of former 
polluters practise environmental stewardship.  This is a fact. It 
is recognized internationally that environmental protection and 
sustainable development can flourish together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going green does not cost jobs or decrease productivity, a 
principle the New Democratic Party has stated time and again in 
the House and across the country.  The original CEPA followed a 
command and control regulatory framework to be reviewed for its 
adequacy every five years.  A decade has passed and we are 
revisiting our responsibility as a federal government and as 
members representing Canadians from all regions and provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is straying from that original regulatory structure 
and visiting the very policy that required CEPA in the 1980s: 
voluntary measures and limited federal intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has demonstrated a consistent approach to 
environmental policy:  ignore until an issue climate change and 
global warming; finances first before the environment or, as my 
colleagues have described, Environment Canada decimated by 
resource and staff cuts; economic concerns first and 
environmental consideration second, an example is Cheviot mine in 
Alberta; unit politicking and devolution to the provinces, the 
harmonization accord; international embarrassment for failed 
targets, Rio and in a few years Kyoto; and global competitiveness 
as a moral marker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has demonstrated time and time again that 
the environment is not important.  “Let the provinces handle the 
problem, similar to what they are doing with hepatitis C.  We can 
wash our hands clean of the responsibility.  The next Plastimet 
will be someone else's travesty.  The Swan Hills plant will 
continue to spew poisons.  The Sydney tar ponds, the United 
States abandoned military sites, the Lachine canal, northern 
contamination through the Arctic and poisons in mothers' milk, 
not our problems”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with this Liberal picture?  It is not protection 
by design and legislation:  sign an accord, cry co-operation and 
put the Canadian public at the mercy of economics and global 
competitive policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a year for the House Standing Committee on Environment 
and Sustainable Development to complete the last review of CEPA. 
Its report entitled “It's About our Health:  Pollution 
Prevention” echoes Ms. Carson's <I>Silent Spring</I>.  This 
massive report contained 141 recommendations to improve Bill 
C-32's predecessor, Bill C-74. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals refused the majority of the recommendations and the 
majority of the 400 responses received by the government during 
the public review.  They ignored the consensus and followed a 
detrimental path:  devolution, voluntary programs and voluntary 
participation.  In most cases this practice works and the New 
Democratic Party recognizes this fact.  There are however bad 
apples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules and regulations are necessary to ensure that when 
damage occurs, when environmental degradation occurs, when 
protection is required, there is a mechanism for redress, a legal 
course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe that Canada's environment requires a command 
and control regulatory framework as the sole parameter or measure 
of environmental protection.  There should be co-operative 
measures including sharing of responsibilities between provinces 
and territorial governments, indeed at all government levels, to 
ensure environmental protection of the highest possible standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more personal note, my family and I firmly believe that the 
bill does nothing to protect my children's future or my 
children's children's future.  I encourage the government to 
revisit Bill C-32 and to listen to the voices out there to 
improve these regulations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-32, the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, a most comprehensive piece of 
legislation with respect to environmental management and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an extremely complex piece of legislation.  It is long. It 
is over 200 pages and covers a wide variety of subjects from 
toxic substance and waste management to vehicle emissions and air 
and water pollution.  It has been called everything from an 
environmental war measures act to a piece of legislation so vast 
and sweeping that it defies categorization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish at this point to go into any great detail on any 
specific clause.  That will be our role in committee.  There are 
a couple of areas of concern to me.  First is the issue of 
pollution prevention.  The government has stated that pollution 
prevention is the cornerstone of the bill.  It calls it a 
national goal, which is fine for me because I believe it is a 
very laudable intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am concerned about the consequences of this 
commitment.  Has the government thought it out?  The bill gives 
the minister the authority to require any person or business to 
develop and submit a pollution prevention plan.  How much will it 
cost?  How detailed will it have to be? Will it be the same for 
small business as for big industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about time?  The bill states that the government can tell a 
business how much time it has to draw up and implement a plan. 
Will there be any guarantee that business will be given enough 
time to study the problem and consult the people who will help 
draw up the plan, or will everything be left merely to the 
discretion of the minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make reference to a clause found in paragraph 6.  It states 
essentially that lack of full scientific certainty shall not be 
used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental 
damage.  Any kind of environmental legislation must be based upon 
science.  At the end of the day it is imperative that we take a 
very prudent approach to our sustainable management if there is 
any thought that any kind of environmental initiative or toxin 
could potentially harm any citizen's health or the environment of 
the country.  The government should be applauded for this very 
prudent initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a different era in terms of political parties in Canada. 
We can look at the number of parties we have on this side of the 
House.  We talk about the Progressive Conservative Party.  We 
talk about the Reform Party.  I make clear that I respect 
individuals who chose to vote Reform in past years for different 
reasons.  In some situations it was a way to express a desire for 
better representation for the western provinces.  We applaud 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More often than not, the media and the electorate are looking at 
areas that actually distinguish political parties.  One such area 
is a prudent approach to science.  We believe categorically in 
the science of climate change.  The Reform Party has chosen to 
ignore the science of climate change because it believes there is 
some doubt.  The primary scientific body on climate change set up 
by the United Nations said there was a discernible human 
influence on climate change.  This is a case in point for people 
looking for areas to distinguish the two parties.  Ours is a 
prudent approach to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second area of concern is about the enforcement clauses 
contained in the bill.  These are found in part 10 which contains 
almost 100 clauses of the 356 clauses in the legislation.  They 
cover areas like inspection, search, detention, forfeiture, 
offences and punishment.  In light of the preponderance of 
enforcement clauses in the bill, almost one in three, I am 
surprised no mention is made in the preamble of the government's 
position on the matter of enforcement.  To me 100 clauses says 
that we are determined to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes the bill is 
important.  The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada 
introduced the Environmental Protection Act in 1988.  It was 
brought forward by the Hon. Jean J. Charest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that protection of the environment is important, but 
recent reports of the auditor general and the environment 
commissioner have raised doubts about this.  Not only do they 
take issue with this government's ability to manage the 
environment properly but, more fundamentally, they seriously 
question its very commitment to protect Canada's environment and 
its ability to enforce environmental legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January of this year the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments, with the exception of Quebec, signed an 
environmental harmonization accord.  This accord, like much of 
what this government attempts to do in the environment field, has 
been the target of much criticism.  People are asking why it 
contains no provision guaranteeing environmental enforcement. 
They are upset that the federal government is offloading its 
responsibilities to the provinces, particularly in the areas of 
environmental inspection, assessment and standard setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other criticisms they have on the harmonization 
accord is the fact that the government actually chose to do 
inspections of environmental regulations during the first 
subagreements with the provinces, but not enforcement.  So 
inspections can be done, but violations cannot be enforced. 
Perhaps the government understands this.  However, the 
environmental community and common sense Canadians understand 
that enforcement and inspection should have been part of the 
first set of subagreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that it is not downloading its 
responsibilities to the provinces.  It is simply harmonizing 
environmental programs and policies.  It is making sure if one 
level of government is fulfilling a task competently that another 
level will not come in and begin doing the same job.  That is the 
intention of harmonization and that would be a good thing. 
However, according to the information on the accord I obtained 
from the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment's 
website, it is clear the government is devolving power to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the objectives of the accord, they include using what 
the government calls a co-operative approach.  Under the 
principles of the accord we see that decisions pursuant to the 
accord will be consensus based.  In the part entitled 
“Subagreements”, No. 8 states specifically that in areas where 
governments have been unable to reach a consensus on a 
Canada-wide approach, each government is free to act within its 
existing authority and will advise the other governments 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operative approach and consensus approach are words that mean 
only one thing.  The federal government is getting out of the 
environment business.  It is abandoning its role as a setter and 
a guarantor of national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's haste to relinquish power and responsibility to 
the provinces over environmental matters is going to have a 
direct consequence on environmental enforcement.  This much is 
certain.  Regional disparities or the so-called patchwork effect 
are going to become the rule rather than the exception.  The 
environment is a shared jurisdiction and we know that shared 
jurisdictions lead to unequal application of laws and 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would refer to a question that I asked on March 19 in the 
House during question period with respect to this very issue.  I 
believe it would be very important for us to revisit the question 
at this time.  Essentially, I pointed out to the minister that 
when it comes to enforcement in the province of New Brunswick 
there is only one enforcement officer for a province of 750,000 
persons.  There is only one enforcement officer for an economy 
that is resource based, with industries such as pulp and paper 
and other heavy industry.  I believe it would be more prudent to 
have better investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just New Brunswick.  In the province of Ontario one of 
the minister's officials stated in committee on February 26 that 
if there are not the resources for a CEPA regulation that needs 
to be investigated, then it basically sits in a file until an 
investigator is freed up.  If an investigator is not freed up 
over a period of a year or two years, then a file is simply 
closed.  That is shameful.  Canadians want to know how many 
environmental regulations which are violated end up in a file 
that simply gets closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is a shared jurisdiction.  It is known that 
shared jurisdictions lead to the unequal application of laws or 
regulations.  This is especially true when there are no national 
benchmarks and no single points of authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country each province and territory has its own 
political culture, its own employment needs and its own set of 
relationships with business and industry. 
Each applies and enforces laws and regulations according to their 
needs.  Lacking in overall authority, namely the federal 
government, it is clear that the chances of CEPA being enforced 
with any rigour or consistency are remote.  They get even more 
remote when we consider how little money and resources are being 
allotted to enforcement.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 100 clauses the government is making a major commitment to 
enforcing CEPA.  Yet as the draft report of the environment 
committee points out, at the same time the government is failing 
to provide the department most responsible for enforcement the 
necessary wherewithal to accomplish its task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government came to office, Environment Canada's budget 
was approximately $750 million and it employed nearly 6,000 
persons.  Today the department's budget has been reduced to a 
touch over $500 million and the number of employees has shrunk to 
a little more than 4,000; a 33% cut on environmental management. 
That is the record of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously these reductions have not been without consequences on 
the department's ability to enforce CEPA properly.  Last summer, 
in fact, things got so bad that the director of the department's 
enforcement branch admitted publicly that it was considering 
asking the RCMP to help track polluters.  The Mounties would 
be going after polluters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week we learned that this same branch plans to cut 
more staff, meaning that Environment Canada will be dedicating 
the grand total of approximately 1% of its staff to enforcement. 
This is a bizarre situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really think of it, one in three or 33% of this bill's 
clauses deals with enforcement.  Yet out of a total budget of 
$500 million, a mere $16 million is allocated to enforcement. 
These are hardly the types of figures a government claiming to be 
committed to protecting the environment and enforcing CEPA's 
rules can accept.  If it can, Environment Canada cannot 
realistically be expected to play anything but a minor role in 
the enforcement of environmental regulations in this country from 
now on.  This means that by default the task in enforcing CEPA 
will fall to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics are very sobering; indeed, alarming.  We are 
going to ask the provinces to actually carry the enforcement ball 
even more so.  Let us look at what the provinces are doing these 
days with respect to environmental management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick annual spending on enforcement, planning and so 
forth has dropped from $17 million in 1991-92 to a mere $12 
million today.  In Newfoundland the environmental department has 
had to absorb a 60% cut in its budget since 1994-95. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics are indeed sobering.  They also point out that 
the environment is not a priority of this government any more. It 
does not take a nuclear physicist to judge the impact that these 
continued and sustained cuts to environmental budgets are having 
on the ability and the will of different environmental 
departments to enforce regulations.  Governments simply cannot 
continue cutting budgets and staff while maintaining, in some 
cases increasing, the mandate of their environment departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point one thing out.  I am what I consider to be 
a devout fiscal conservative.  I think it is very important for 
governments to live within their means.  We need to ensure that 
we have very strong debt reduction targets so that there is an 
actual investment in our future and we do not continue to 
mortgage the future of younger generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High debt levels actually affect our country's competitiveness 
to be able to compete.  Why?  It is because taxes actually impede 
our ability to compete, but we can never lower taxes unless we 
eliminate the pressures that cause high taxes and those pressures 
are spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is pay down our debt so we actually pay less 
money in interest charges on a year to year basis.  Then it comes 
to establishing our priorities.  A government that has too many 
priorities, by definition, does not have any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am pointing out is that the government should be 
investing in its people and its future.  We should allocate our 
moneys where the citizens of this country want them, in the 
health care system and in the education system.  As well, 
Canadians want to be assured of a healthy, sound environment in 
which to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My last concern about this bill relates to the proposal to allow 
anyone over 18 to provoke an investigation of any person or 
business felt to be contravening the act.  This particular clause 
makes me very uneasy.  I am in favour of measures to increase 
public participation in the environmental process, but we are 
opening the door to malicious and vexatious investigations by 
individuals and groups with personal grudges or corporate 
agendas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, I am somewhat disappointed with the scope of this bill. 
This is particularly so in light of the great expectations 
engendered by the Liberals over the environment issue.  In fact, 
<I>Great Expectations</I> could well be the title of the Liberal 
environmental policy since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that one-eighth of the first red book was 
devoted to the environment, thanks to the efforts of one of its 
authors, the present finance minister, who was then the 
opposition environment critic.  The red book was not the only 
promise.  Since coming to government one environment minister 
after another has made promise upon promise to do great things 
for the environment.  That is why this bill is so disappointing. 
It simply does not live up to its billing.  It fails to meet the 
hopes raised through years of unbridled rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that inevitably comes to mind is:  Why, after so 
much debate and so many promises, has this bill fallen so short 
of the mark?  The first and most obvious reason is that the 
Liberal Party has lost interest in managing the environment.  In 
its rush to adopt as many of the previous government's policies 
and positions as it could, there is no longer any room on the 
policy plate for the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is that the former environment critic, the 
current finance minister, has other things on his mind these days 
than the protection of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this government was hit hard by its pre-Kyoto “make it up 
as we go strategy”, we would have thought that one of the 
principal actions of the government in the new year, given the 
minister's comments in January that the cornerstone of its 
post-Kyoto strategy was rewarding industry for early action on 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, would have been to put an 
initiative in the budget for tax incentives for research and 
development on energy efficiency, for the use of renewable energy 
sources and for the development of renewable energy sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude my remarks by saying that the 
Progressive Conservative Party will support Bill C-32 in its 
current form.  We will have to look at in terms of what comes out 
of committee.  It is a more workable bill than Bill C-74 was.  It 
is an extension of what the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
was initially set out to be.  It is our cornerstone bill of 
legislation with respect to the environment.  It is a bill that 
the current member for Sherbrooke brought in when he was 
environment minister between 1990 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gentleman had a very successful record in managing the 
environment.  This House will actually miss his leadership and 
his commitment to the environment, as well as his commitment to 
Canadians as he takes on other challenges for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time remaining I would like to point out that this 
government must be challenged over the coming days and weeks to 
ensure that the environment becomes a priority again.

my Conservative colleague's presentation. I know from often

conferences, including the one in Kyoto, to reduce greenhouse 
gases.

which level of government should be responsible for

Is it the responsibility of the federal government or the 
provinces? Does the Government of Quebec have jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harmonization process and the agreement were quite clear. 
There was a principle which stated that every effort would be 
made to eliminate duplication and overlap. Today, the government 
brings in Bill C-32. Every aspect of this bill is set in a 
national context or spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a simple question for my colleague from the Conservative 
Party. 
Does he agree that the national principle underlying Bill C-32 
is contrary to the stated principles of harmonization? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, everyone knows there will 
be a long answer, but my short answer to the question generally 
is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians believe that the management of the environment is a 
shared jurisdiction.  All levels of government, provincial, 
federal and I may also add municipal, have a role to play with 
respect to environmental management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, it is imperative that our federal and provincial 
governments work in a more co-operative manner so we can manage 
and utilize our resources to ensure that whichever level of 
government is best served to deliver a certain function with 
respect to environmental management, that level of government 
should do it.   At the end of the day, I believe the provinces 
should deliver a number of services which the federal government 
does today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The population of Canada wants to know that the federal 
government is the principal governmental body that provides 
leadership for this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I was 
the official opposition environment critic in the last 
parliament, I will make a few comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, we studied Bill C-74 for almost a year 
and a half. The Bloc Quebecois had tabled a minority report 
during that study and our concerns remain the same. They are 
still related to the fact that, in the bill, the federal 
government is again interfering in provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are my concerns: are there not some risks, in this bill, of 
never ending legal challenges between the federal and provincial 
governments, once again? 
If we look at the CEAA, the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act, that was passed during the last parliament, and if we look 
at what is happening at this time, we realize that legal 
challenges have already been launched, involving Quebec and the 
federal government, again because the federal government is 
interfering in provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have the BAPE, which does some extraordinary work 
with environmental assessments. If the federal government comes 
and interferes in assessments that have already been done, and 
says it is not satisfied with our assessments, this will delay 
some projects, business projects, big projects, major projects 
that will not be undertaken because for five, six or seven 
years, money will be spent going around in circles because of 
dry legal challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my concern. Is the federal government not again 
interfering in a provincial jurisdiction? 
Having been involved for more than three years, I think the 
environment is better managed close to the people than at a 
higher level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the cuts in the federal environment 
department, how are they going to properly enforce an act when, 
because of the huge cuts, they do not know who will enforce it? 
How will they succeed in doing this? Will there be an 
environmental police on the highways? That is impossible, 
because they do not have the means to do it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the revision of the CEPA and the meddling in provincial 
jurisdiction and causing endless legal wrangling nothing more 
than window dressing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether my colleague has any comments in this 
regard.  Clearly the environment is a priority because it 
involves our future.  On the other hand, we must ensure, if 
legislation is to be properly applied, that we do not 
systematically block what is already happening provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the broader picture and cut in financial terms as 
well.  If we try to come up with situations that are intolerable 
and unliveable we will be doing the environment no favours, in 
fact, quite the opposite, we will harm it. 
I would like to hear what my colleague in the Conservative Party 
has to say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for the question.  She raises a number of very relevant points 
some of which I would like to touch on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that where my colleague is coming from is that the 
government has shown a tendency to interfere in a number of 
provincial jurisdictions where it is just not welcome.  At the 
end of the day it does not make sense for the federal government 
to interfere in areas which are clearly within provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is that of education.  Education is something 
that belongs in the provincial realm.  Except for maybe 
post-secondary education, the federal government really has no 
direct role in interfering with the provinces unless the 
provinces want to participate in a particular program. For 
instance if the province of Quebec wanted to do something about 
post-secondary education with the federal government and it was 
more Quebec's idea than that of the federal government, then 
maybe they might go ahead and do that, but education is something 
that belongs to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another case in point is Quebec's right to self-determination. 
Clearly Quebec's right to self-determination and the unity issue 
of this country is a political decision.  It is not a legal 
decision. There is no reason for the government to privatize the 
political process and send this issue to the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member has concerns about federal interference in 
provincial areas, I understand where she is coming from because 
there are times when the federal government interferes in areas 
where it does not belong.  That said, I fundamentally believe the 
environment is an area of shared jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member touched on a couple of points. One of the things 
I would like to comment on is that this is the first piece of 
environmental legislation of any note that the government has 
brought forth since being elected on October 25, 1993.  Bravo. It 
is a good piece of legislation because we first brought it in 
back in 1988. The only piece of legislation the government has 
actually brought forth was to update a solid piece of legislation 
which our party first introduced in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised some questions and concerns with respect 
to enforcement of environmental regulations.  There are 100 
clauses in the legislation which refer to enforcement but the 
federal government does not allocate the resources to have 
enforcements in the first place. If the hon. member is concerned 
that it is really nice that we have this legislation but we are 
not going to enforce it, I think at the end of the day the 
federal government is required to send the resources to the 
provinces to ensure that the environmental regulations are 
actually carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the other points the hon. member brought forth, perhaps I 
could catch up with her at a later time to finish this 
conversation to permit other questions in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member is spinning so hard he is driving himself 
into the ground in terms of this and other legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question relates to the member's comment.  He is justifying 
the legislation on the basis that because it was introduced 
during the time of the Tory administration in 1988 it has to be 
good.  Does the member feel the same way about all legislation 
introduced by the previous government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer to that 
question is absolutely no.  The fact is that the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, known as CEPA 88, was a solid piece 
of legislation, something that should continue on a regular 
basis.

of the Minister of Health to support the opening remarks made by 
my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment on Bill C-32 and to bring to this debate the 
perspective of the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's mission is to help the people of Canada maintain 
and improve their health as a colleague opposite indicated during 
question period.  To protect and promote the health of Canadians 
is a federal responsibility embedded in the constitution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Health plays an important role in the 
application of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and 
will continue to do so under the new legislation, which bears 
the appropriate title of an act respecting pollution prevention 
and the protection of the environment and human health in order 
to contribute to sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take this opportunity to remind members of our 
responsibilities under the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conjunction with Environment Canada, the Department of Health 
conducts investigations to identify substances requiring 
immediate attention, it evaluates the risks presented by such 
contaminants, drafts regulations under the act, such as 
regulations on the provision of notices and the evaluation of 
new substances and, finally, develops national strategies to 
control toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Protection Act was and will remain a 
significant legislative measure for protecting public health. 
Other legislation generally focuses on controlling substances in 
products, whereas this act controls the dumping of contaminants 
into the environment at source throughout their production and 
use. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's action on lead is a good example of the significant and 
measurable benefits to human health that environmental 
legislation can and does make.  We have a variety of legislative 
means of controlling exposure to lead in Health Canada through 
for example the Food and Drugs Act and regulations, the Hazardous 
Products Act and the Pest Control Products Act.  These have all 
played their part in reducing risks to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only through the use of CEPA that we could control a 
major environmental source of exposure for the general 
population, lead in gasoline.  Similarly, regulatory controls 
have been put in place under CEPA for PCBs, polychlorinated 
biphenyls, used in the past as insulation fluid for transformers; 
and dioxins and furans, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and 
furans, which are toxic byproducts from the incomplete combustion 
of chlorinated material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Protection Act is an important 
mechanism for addressing the issue of toxic substances because of 
its framework for identifying, assessing and managing toxic 
substances.  This is what Canadians want, a comprehensive 
approach for managing toxic substances throughout their life 
cycle, that is, from production, through use, to disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basis for economic progress is wealth creation.  At the core 
of wealth creation is the contribution of knowledge, knowledge of 
how to transform the gifts of nature into wealth.  It is 
essential to remember first that nature's gifts and how 
abundantly we have them here in Canada are not infinite.  This is 
not a bottomless treasure trove. 
Second, it is salutary to remember that human development is at 
the core of sustainable development.  One cannot have sustainable 
development without healthy people, a fact that we have 
underlined in our department's sustainable development strategy 
entitled “Sustaining Our Health”, tabled in parliament in 
December 1997.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my colleague who spoke a moment ago would want to take 
note of that as being a little different from his recollection of 
history and parliament at least as it relates to innovative 
legislation from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity, though, to remind hon. 
members that the preamble to the declaration on sustainable 
development to which Canada committed by signing agenda 21 of the 
Rio declaration states: “Human beings are at the centre of 
concern for sustainable development. They are entitled to a 
healthy and productive life in harmony with nature”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is these twin targets that the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act has in its sights.  It is an act respecting the 
protection of the environment and of human life and health.  This 
legislation then is is intended not only to protect our 
environment for its own sake but it aims also to protect the 
environment because of its direct links with human health.  These 
are not disparate targets but vitally linked, linked for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is reminded of the saying that our fate is connected with 
the animals, from Rachel Carson's book <I>Silent Spring</I> 
published in the early 1960s, a book which did so much to promote 
the awareness of the need for environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Mr. Speaker remembers the environmental movement of the 
1960s. You lived through it as a young person in university.  I 
recall your activist days at Queen's University and then later on 
in Toronto.  You earned quite a name for yourself in this regard. 
I know you did not want me to draw attention to that.  But in 
view of the fact that members opposite are interested in the 
activities of all members of this House prior to their presence 
here in this institution, I thought it would be appropriate to 
draw attention to the fact that you were not always a Speaker nor 
a member of parliament but quite an active and interested citizen 
of this great land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are happy that movement generated your presence in this 
House, it is also worthy of note that the environmental movement 
of the 1960s culminated in the establishment in Canada of a 
strong federal presence on the issue with the formation of the 
Department of the Environment in 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way since then when a series of high profile 
ecological disasters worldwide spurred on the environmental 
movement. Our view of the issues has changed as has our means of 
protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada this federal involvement began with the environmental 
contaminants act in the mid-1970s, legislation which seemed fine 
at the time. By the mid-1980s it was clear the act needed 
expanding and strengthening.  In 1988 the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act was launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the cornerstone for federal environmental protection with the 
arrival of the 1990s it was time for the review once again of the 
administration of our environmental protection legislation by a 
parliamentary committee.  I might take a moment to compliment the 
committee on its whole and on its individual representation for 
the fine work it has done over the course of this last parliament 
and in this current parliament in coming forward with suggestions 
that have been incorporated in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to express on behalf of the Minister of Health my 
appreciation and admiration for the work of the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development in 
laying the groundwork for the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It became clear from the committee's review of the present act 
that it could be and should be enhanced in several ways to focus 
more on pollution prevention and so contribute in a more 
significant way to sustainable development and the health of 
future generations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this very concern about the future there is the need for 
all of us not think in terms of business as usual or development 
without regard costs but about what we should do now to build a 
sustainable future for generations to come.  That makes this bill 
to renew and revitalize the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
of critical importance as we prepare to enter the new millennium. 
We believe the new Canadian Environmental Protection Act is an 
essential tool in helping to shape the future of sustainable 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewal of this act will satisfy at least two federal 
priorities by increasing the effectiveness of the environmental 
protection in Canada and by meeting the objectives of the Liberal 
government such as making pollution prevention a national goal 
and enhancing the role of the public and setting timetables for 
phasing out releases of those toxic substances which are of most 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know that chemicals in one way or another are an 
essential part of technological development.  Because of our 
dependence on the environment for our well-being both now and in 
the future, those chemicals that are assessed as toxic persisting 
in the environment and tending to build up in animal and human 
tissues must be prevented from gaining entry into the 
environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore support Bill C-32 for the following reasons:  its 
prudent approach, which consists in taking steps to avoid 
possible damage; its adherence to the principle of pollution 
prevention, which consists in taking steps to prevent 
contamination; its concern with reducing the overall costs 
associated with environmental pollution, that is to say, not 
just repercussions on the public's health and well-being, or its 
costs in financial terms, but also its impact on the cost of 
health care in Canada; and its science-based decision-making 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the provisions of Bill C-32, the Department of Health, in 
conjunction with Environment Canada, will continue to assume 
responsibility for setting objectives and drqfting guidelines 
and codes of practice for the protection of human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, and in order to respond to public concerns about 
the effects of pollution and toxic substances on health, the 
department will step up its efforts to assess and manage risks 
associated with new and existing chemical substances and with 
biotechnology products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is increasingly aware that international 
action is required to address pollution from outside the 
country. 
In response to this new priority, the Department of Health will 
take the opportunity offered by the new bill to broaden its 
sphere of activity and move from a mere assessment of 
international atmospheric pollution to a more global assessment 
of international air and water pollution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide comprehensive protection for Canadians in the most 
effective of manners, Bill C-32 complements but does not 
duplicate other legislation.  As an illustration of this effort 
the federal government has included a consequential amendment to 
the Food and Drugs Act and regulations as part of Bill C-32. This 
amendment allows the Minister of Health clear authority for the 
first time to collect and assess information on the environmental 
impact of foods, drugs and medical devices under the Food and 
Drugs Act. 
To provide comprehensive protection for Canadians in the most 
effective manner, Bill C-32 complements but does not duplicate 
other legislation.

national desire to provide a co-ordinated response to 
environmental protection.  In this context I mention the recent 
endorsement of the principles of co-operation on health and the

are responsible for ensuring their decisions to protect the 
health of people and the environment for creating conditions that 
encourage individuals and communities to adopt sustainable 
practices.  But we recognize that governments alone cannot solve 
the problems.  I am encouraged by the efforts of the chemical 
industry which has been on the forefront of engaging in the 
challenge of sustainable development with its reasonable care 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental protection is an important matter for all 
Canadians.  As we have seen in the results of recent public 
opinion polls, most people see issues of environmental quality 
largely in terms of health, their own and that of their children. 
They are willing to take part in protecting the environment to 
accomplish those goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the recommendations of the standing committee, 
Bill C-32 explicitly recognizes that protecting the environment 
and human health is a responsibility that must be shared by all 
sectors of society.  The present Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act includes participation rights.  The renewed act 
will give the Canadian public the right to examine all phases of 
risk assessment and management and to provide recourse if it has 
reason to believe the government has failed to live up to its 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people with their unique history and knowledge of 
environmental management have an important role to play.  For the 
first time the Canadian Environmental Protection Act will include 
aboriginal peoples as partners in environmental protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Concepts such as pollution prevention and sustainable 
development had just emerged when the first Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act was drafted. It was also the case 
for concepts such as globalization. Today, the world is smaller. 
No country can live in isolation, particularly when it comes to 
toxic pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must be ready to face the challenge of globalization. 
The new Canadian Environmental Protection Act will be an 
essential element of the federal government's strategy to take a 
proactive approach with environmental issues, in a global 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act provides a whole range of options beyond direct 
regulation to monitor toxic substances, and this should help us 
move toward an approach that better reflects the principles of 
sustainable development. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I provide a quote from a previous minister of health, Mr. Marc 
Lalonde, who did so much to promote the emphasis on preventive 
care in public health with his report “A New Perspective on the 
Health of Canadians”.  He closed this report with a quotation 
from the Bible: “Who shall prepare for battle if the trumpet 
gives an uncertain sound?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed new CEPA gives a very clear and certain sound.  It 
signals to all Canadians this government is serious and is truly 
committed to pollution prevention and sustainable development. 
Canada needs this legislation for the 21st century and beyond.  I 
strongly urge all members to support it and I thank them for 
their attention.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POLICE AND PEACE OFFICER NATIONAL MEMORIAL DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the last Sunday of September 
should be formally recognized from this year forth as “The 
Police and Peace Officer National Memorial Day” to honour the 
memory of those officers killed in the line of duty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am honoured and pleased to rise in the 
House today in support of Motion No. 342, a motion I introduced 
some two months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a quick recap for members present, Motion No. 342 states that 
in the opinion of this House, the last Sunday of September should 
be formally recognized from this year forth as the police and 
peace officer national memorial day to honour the memory of those 
officers killed in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the Canadian Police Association for 
bringing the lack of formal recognition for the memorial to my 
attention.  As always the CPA has been a strong voice on behalf 
of the police officers in the street. In particular Scott Newark 
has assisted me in my efforts in bringing this motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September of last year one of my first public engagements as 
the Progressive Conservative justice and solicitor general critic 
was to attend the 20th annual memorial service for police and 
peace officers on Parliament Hill.  It was a very moving event in 
which thousands of people, law enforcement officers from all 
parts of Canada, the United States, their families and friends, 
participated. They gathered not only to honour the memory of 
their comrades or loved ones, but also to remind all Canadians of 
the law enforcement community's dedication to public safety, a 
dedication for which men and women have been willing time and 
time again to pay the ultimate sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my own perspective, it allowed me to pay personal tribute 
to the many police officers I had worked with during my time as a 
crown attorney. Their commitment and contribution to public 
safety and community on the front lines helped me to do my job in 
a more satisfactory and professional way in the courtroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national memorial service for police and peace officers is a 
story of how a single incident can provoke something of a much 
grander scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this day 21 years ago there was not any memorial service for 
law enforcement officers in Canada who had lost their lives in 
the line of duty.  That situation changed one tragic summer night 
in 1977.  A 21-year old rookie officer with the Ottawa-Carleton 
police by the name of David Kirkwood paid a professional visit to 
710 Gladstone Avenue, about a 20-minute walk from Parliament 
Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young constable with only four months service on the force 
went with two other officers to serve Frederick Koepke, himself 
only 22 years old but with severe emotional and psychiatric 
problems, with two warrants for assault causing bodily harm.  The 
three officers were met at the door with gunfire and a stand-off 
ensued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While awaiting reinforcements, David Kirkwood was assigned to 
cover the rear of the residence where, upon attending that 
position, he was shot at point blank range.  He died instantly on 
July 11, 1977 leaving behind a pregnant widow and a police force 
fraught with grief and sorrow. A veteran constable who served 
with David Kirkwood described the loss of the young officer as a 
death in the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Ottawa Police Association wanted to do more 
than grieve, they wanted to send a clear message to the entire 
country.  On September 24, 1978 David Kirkwood's comrades held a 
service on Parliament Hill to honour his memory and remind 
elected officials that peace officers continue to be killed in 
the streets daily in the name of public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1978 ceremony began with a two-gun salute fired by members 
of the 30th Field Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery. After 
the salute, one brass shell case was saved and mounted on a 
commemorative plaque.  This plaque contained a simple yet 
powerful inscription:  To fallen comrades, Parliament Hill, 
September 24, 1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Ottawa police officers continued to hold the ceremony 
subsequent to that year, the number of participants increased in 
size and scope.  This memorial began to take on a more national 
focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceremony's evolution through the past two decades was 
incremental. 
At the 1984 service a memorial book of remembrance for police 
officers and correctional officers killed while on duty was 
unveiled by the Office of the Solicitor General and the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police. In 1994 the Prime Minister 
joined with more than 700 police officers and relatives of slain 
officers at the site just behind these parliament buildings as 
the Canadian Police Association and the CACP dedicated the new 
Canadian police memorial pavilion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That granite stone at the base of the pavilion contains the 
names of more than 200 officers killed in the line of duty since 
1879.  Two other stones were also erected, one for peace officers 
who died in the line of duty and the other explaining the 
pavilion's history. In 1995 the memorial honour roll was expanded 
to include the names of slain officers from other Canadian law 
enforcement agencies such as customs and excise, natural 
resources and fisheries and oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that my father in his last ministerial 
portfolio of public works played a key role in realizing the site 
in the early 1990s.  In fact there is a photo in my office 
showing my father speaking at the ground breaking ceremony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I have been advised that construction near the site has 
jeopardized the integrity of this pavilion.  It is certainly 
hoped that great care will be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In expanding the memorial to include peace officers the event's 
organizers cited the basic principle behind the annual ceremony: 
to pay tribute to those who have sworn an oath to protect the 
lives of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association and the Canadian Association of 
Chiefs of Police established three criteria to establish the 
names of those who should be listed in the memorial book and on 
the stone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deceased must have been a sworn police or peace officer and 
death must have occurred as a result of a traumatic event 
influenced by an external agent. The deceased must have been on 
duty at the time of death, or if off duty, acting in their 
capacity as a police or peace officer, or the death must have 
been brought about because of the victim's official status. 
Lastly, the deceased must have acted in good faith in doing all 
that was expected, while bearing in mind the incident, the rights 
of those involved and the safety of all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The names of the more than 200 Canadians displayed on this 
memorial, all of whom have met these extraordinary benchmarks, 
distinguishes the highest act of sacrifice and selflessness.  So 
long as we add more names each year to this memorial, Canadians 
and their elected representatives will be challenged to do more, 
to strive to bring about better policy and legislation in the 
hope of ensuring that fewer names will be added to this gallant 
but tragic list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most certainly time for parliamentarians to take the next 
step in the evolution of this memorial and to grant formal 
recognition to this very special occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing Motion No. 342 parliament can send a strong message 
of respect and gratitude to our law enforcement officials who 
have made the alternate sacrifice for public safety.  It would 
also express our collective solidarity with the families and 
friends who have lost loved ones, along with those men and women 
in the law enforcement profession who put their lives at risk 
each and every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us rise above the usual political fray that exists in this 
place and pay tribute to one of society's most demanding and 
important vocations.  Let us accord the respect that many law 
enforcement officials presently feel that perhaps they do not 
receive from their elected officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the procedure and House affairs committee opted not to 
classify Motion No. 342 as votable, I would ask that all hon. 
members give unanimous consent to allow the motion to be voted 
upon in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a passage of the Bible which was read 
at last September's memorial service.  It is taken from chapter 
3, verses 1 to 6 of the Book of Wisdom: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the soles of the righteous are in the hands of God,<BR> 
and no torment will even touch them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died and their 
departure was thought to be an affliction and their going from us 
to be their destruction but they are at peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For though in the sight of men they were punished,<BR> 
their hope is full of immortality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been disciplined a little,<BR> 
they will receive great good 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because God tested them and found them worthy of himself;<BR> 
like gold in the furnace he tried them, and like a sacrificial 
burnt offering he accepted them. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sombre but telling words.  I hope all members of the House will 
support this motion and as requested, make this motion a votable 
item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is their unanimous consent that the 
motion be a votable item? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no consent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on 
the motion to designate the last Sunday in September as a 
national police and peace officer memorial day.  I do so on my 
own behalf and especially on behalf of my colleague the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General and I hope on 
behalf of all other members on this side as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 20 years Canadians have honoured police and peace 
officers in a memorial ceremony and reception for the families 
and colleagues of officers killed in the line of duty.  That 
memorial takes place on the last Sunday of every September.  Each 
year this memorial service has been conducted on Parliament Hill. 
It is always a well attended event.  In fact it is a day when all 
of us set aside our differences and pay our respects to those who 
sacrificed their lives so that we can live safely in our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Thomas Welsh first introduced the service in 1978 in 
response to the shooting death of Ottawa Police Constable David 
Kirkwood in 1977.  Since then Constable Kirkwood's memory is 
honoured each year along with others who lost their lives so 
suddenly and tragically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now in its 21st year the memorial service has had in attendance 
special guests such as the Governor General of Canada, numerous 
solicitors general, members of the fallen officers' families and 
police officers from around the world.  It is a solemn occasion 
to pay tribute to the men and women who have given their lives 
over the years to protect all Canadians.  It is an occasion for 
families and friends to remember their loved ones.  More 
important it is an occasion for all of us to remember that part 
of the reason we live in a safe and just society is because of 
the dedication of police and peace officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year we hope that new names will not be added to the list 
of the memorial. Sadly this has not been the case. While 
Canadians live in one of the safest countries in the world there 
have been times when danger could not be avoided and when those 
on the front lines have lost their lives while protecting the 
safety of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although those in law enforcement garner a great deal of respect 
from Canadians they are also facing unprecedented challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our current social environment there is a public perception 
that crime is much more prevalent than it actually is.  Even 
though crime rates have been steadily decreasing in recent years, 
the perception is that crime is on the rise.  Police race 
relations, youth gangs, violent crime, organized crime, drug 
trafficking, smuggling, hate crime and even fear of crime are at 
the forefront of the daily challenges police face across this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These competing demands make it even more necessary for police, 
our communities and government to continually look at how we can 
do things better and to find new ways to meet these problems 
directly.  Responding to crime and criminal behaviour is no easy 
task.  The very nature of police work involves some intrusive and 
at times aggressive interventions in order to control situations 
and to solve crimes.  It is important to provide a fair and 
equitable framework for police work in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this government's safe homes and safe streets agenda, 
we have done much in the way of improving the tools with which 
police are able to carry out their duties.  We have worked very 
hard to introduce legislative reforms that strike the right 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the memorial tribute each year, this government 
continues to honour the work of peace officers across Canada by 
doing what we can in our capacity to provide the tools that those 
in law enforcement need to do their jobs as safely as possible. 
That means providing legislation that tackles crime head on such 
as the anti-gang legislation which was passed last year.  It 
means focusing correctional resources on those who need it most. 
It means ensuring that we continue to live in safe homes and safe 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion speaks to the need to officially recognize a service 
that has taken place for over two decades.  It has become a 
tradition we observe each year and it is clear that the families 
and colleagues of fallen officers count on all of us to pay 
tribute to the memories of those who are no longer with us.  It 
is a time when we all pause to reflect on the contribution our 
police and peace officers make to our society and to honour the 
fallen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A formal national memorial day such as the one proposed in this 
motion will serve Canadians well.  Quite often it takes a 
ceremony of this magnitude for us to realize that our safety 
sometimes comes at the cost of our best and brightest peace 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of us take public safety for granted, Canada is one 
of the few countries in the world where we can walk in our 
streets and feel relatively safe. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public safety is a priority of law enforcement for this 
government.  This is demonstrated on a number of fronts.  It 
means providing legislation to tackle crime head on such as the 
anti-gang legislation which was passed last year.  It means 
focusing correctional resources where they will be most 
effective.  It means taking crime prevention seriously to ensure 
that we will continue to live in safe homes and safe streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An official recognized national police and peace officers 
memorial day would provide Canada with a specific occasion to 
express our appreciation for what we have.  This government is 
committed to taking a balanced approach to reducing crime in 
Canada which includes the underlying factors that lead to 
criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hallmark of our efforts includes close co-operation with 
federal, provincial and territorial governments.  It is essential 
in order to build an effective and efficient criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record on public safety speaks for itself.  Since the last 
peace officers memorial, this government has taken steps toward 
making Canada a much safer place to live.  First, we have 
introduced legislation to create Canada's first national DNA data 
bank so that repeat offenders can be apprehended more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have supported studies that tell us more about the 
nature of crime and what we can do to change the behaviour of 
those who commit criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we continue to work with our partners across Canada and 
beyond our borders to stop crime in its tracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we will continue to take tough measures against violent 
and dangerous offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we remain committed to making improvements to the 
legislative foundation of Canada's correctional system, the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, where the need for 
change is demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more to be done and this government is prepared to take 
on the task.  In the name of public safety and for the safety of 
those who work each day to enforce our laws on the front lines, 
we will continue to build on our successes and to learn from our 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government supports Motion No. 342 and I am sure all 
members will do the same. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I believe the last member speaking from the government 
side was from the Eglinton—Lawrence riding.  I also believe that 
is a member who called out no when there was a request for a 
votable motion here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to his comments and remarks with regard to this 
motion, it borders absolutely on being anti-police.  It was 
nothing more than a self-serving discussion, a brag of what is 
perceived to be great accomplishments in the area of crime 
fighting and support for our police forces and peace officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important motion and I do not intend to dwell on 
the kind of speech I heard. The mover of this motion has devised 
an important motion for all of us in Canada because there is no 
one in this country who is not either related to a police 
officer, has been served by a police officer or has supported 
police officers as they go about trying to do their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, I can assure the member that the Reform Party totally 
supports his motion and that it should have been allowed to be a 
votable motion.  A special day should be set aside for these 
people who serve our communities so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my comments today I will not go over the slightly more 
technical, historical, chronological events that have occurred to 
bring this about.  I would like to expand a bit on the human face 
that was put on this motion by the presenter and just expand a 
bit on his comments in support of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, I am a former police officer in the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police. 
I have attended these memorial functions, not in Ottawa here on 
the Hill but in other divisions, and attended the funerals of 
members slain on the duty days when they went to work not 
expecting anything unusual.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are these police officers who serve in front of us every day 
in uniform and in plain clothes?  They started out as boys and 
girls in our high schools thinking about the occupation they 
would like to take up.  The ones who lean toward public service, 
toward helping their fellow man, recognize right from wrong, 
these are the people who have traditionally joined police forces 
across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of all police officers and peace officers designated by 
the various provincial and federal statutes and who serve with 
every municipality, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the 
Surete, the Ontario Provincial Police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we should not forget either those members of 
yesteryear police forces that are no longer in existence.  Those 
members also gave up their lives on occasion for the Canadian 
public and the Canadian good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young boys and girls graduated from high school in days 
past and currently graduate from university and then continue on 
to police work.  They do not realize at the time they go into 
police work the full extent to which they are dealing with the 
most unpredictable animal on the face of the earth.  That happens 
to be a human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people go into cadet training and training at the RCMP 
academy full of idealism, hope and a sense of service, little 
expecting and little knowing what lies ahead.  While they are in 
training they begin, through the studying of the Criminal Code 
and the training programs they go through where instructors start 
to speak of the reasons why they are hammering home self-defence 
and the law, to fully understand their rights and authorities in 
carrying out their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is done for two reasons.  One is obviously so that the 
maximum quality of service can be given to Canadians, and the 
second is for the protection of those peace officers as they go 
about their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly a concern of mine that these future members of 
our police forces not be lulled into a false sense of security 
through government propaganda about all the protection they are 
going to get out of Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, that they will 
somehow know before going into a dangerous situation, a family 
dispute or whatever, that so and so is not the owner of any guns 
or in possession of any firearms.  That is not true and I 
sincerely hope that the trainers of these young police officers 
do not put forward the government's propaganda with regard to 
Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was putting a human face on these young police officers, that 
first patrol when they are first assigned to their duties, 
whether it is walking in the tough end of a city or driving their 
first patrol car at night. 
As they pull over that first car for a spot check or attend that 
first alarm indicating the possibility of criminals in a 
building, their hands start to sweat a bit and there is a knot in 
their stomach.  They know at that point that their safety is not 
guaranteed and cannot be guaranteed.  Relying on their training 
and knowing they have in essence volunteered to put themselves on 
the line on behalf of the rest of us so we can sleep safely at 
night, they proceed along with their duties taking the best 
precautions possible but knowing they cannot protect against 
everything.

doing specialized duties such as highway patrol duty, traffic 
duty.  They are exposed to more dangers than just firearms, 
knives and being assaulted. They are subject to contamination

arises for the family, and there is always family.  These people 
need a place to go from year to year for the rest of their lives

home provinces and towns.  It would be really nice if there were 
one day that everyone could point to as being the day that 
recognizes their sons' and daughters' contribution to Canada.

pleasure to rise in this House today to speak on the motion put 
forward by my colleague, the parliamentary leader of the 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say, however, that I am terribly disappointed that my 
colleague opposite, the hon. member for Eglinton«Lawrence, would 
refuse to make this motion votable and turn this into a 
political, partisan issue, when in fact every member of this 
House should support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the last Sunday of September 
should be formally recognized from this year forth as “The 
Police and Peace Officer National Memorial Day” to honour the 
memory of those officers killed in the line of duty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois enthusiastically endorses this motion and 
will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Society as a whole is indebted to police and peace officers for 
the work they do so we can live in peace and security within our 
families, in our homes, at work and everywhere else. Men and 
women have paid with their lives for this dedication to their 
communities, and their families too deserve our gratitude in 
recognition of the great sacrifice resulting from the choice 
made by their spouse, father, mother or child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere in Quebec and in Canada, police and other law 
enforcement officers perform their duties under difficult 
circumstances, and we become aware of the importance of what 
they do only when some tragic incident wakes us up to the harsh 
reality of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues in this House and the general public, 
I wish to thank all those who work tirelessly to make our 
society a fairer and a safer place to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media report only the most spectacular tragedies, so we tend 
to be collectively unaware of what these law enforcement 
officers go through every day, as they live with the possibility 
that their future may be jeopardized if a seemingly routine 
incident turns sour on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to support the motion of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the last Sunday of September 
should be formally recognized from this year forth as “The 
Police and Peace Officer National Memorial Day” to honour the 
memory of those officers killed in the line of duty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for bringing this matter forward.  As 
we heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, 
this matter is supported by members from the other side although 
they oppose making it votable.  The parliamentary secretary says 
that the government supports the motion.  He also says that there 
is more to be done and that the government is prepared to take on 
this task.  Obviously the government is not prepared to take on 
the very modest task of voting in support of this most worthwhile 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time police officers, firefighters and others with 
the job of protecting and assisting many in difficult situations, 
at risk or in danger, are prepared to risk their lives in doing 
so. They have asked not only for recognition of this sort but 
also for a public pension to be available to their families if 
they are killed in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a financial question that most members of the House 
would support.  However it is not what is being asked today.  The 
motion does not ask the government to provide funds.  It merely 
asks all members of the House to have a day to recognize the most 
supreme sacrifice made by Canadian police and peace officers in 
the continuance of their duties to ensure we live in a secure and 
safe community.  Most Canadians would find it odd to think that 
the government was not prepared to support what is a modest yet 
important provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was involved in the 1994 ceremony in which 
over 700 police officers and relatives of slain officers gathered 
at the site behind the Parliament Buildings to dedicate the new 
Canadian Police Memorial Pavilion.  The Prime Minister and his 
government were supported then in their initiative to recognize 
and respect those police and peace officers who had lost their 
lives in the line of duty.  The year 1994 is not very far in the 
past, yet here we are five years later with the same Prime 
Minister and the same government not being prepared to recognize 
a day to honour officers who died in the line of duty.  Canadians 
would wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sacrifices and the risks taken by police officers in the 
line of duty may not be better described than by the words of 
dignitaries at a memorial ceremony that was held just behind the 
House in 1997.  I will quote a couple of those dignitaries. Neal 
Jessop, president of the Canadian Police Association, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we gather to honour our fallen comrades and keep faith 
with them and their families left behind.  It is a duty most 
sacred of all of us within the law enforcement family and a 
commitment that exemplifies the bonds in our larger family.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a duty and commitment of all of us.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This service honours those who gave their lives in service of us 
all. It is also our way of ensuring that the family members of 
those we remember today know that they are forever in our 
thoughts and prayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year's service stands as a stark reminder that the duties, 
responsibilities and risks of law enforcement are a 24 a day 
reality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vincent Murray, president of the Canadian Peace Officers' 
Memorial Association, said the following important words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the twentieth anniversary of the Memorial Service, a 
service which commemorates the great sacrifice our officers have 
made.  They have lost their lives protecting society from the 
evils of violence and crime.  These officers served their country 
with integrity, honesty and courage, well known values of the law 
enforcement family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now remember and honour those brave officers who gave 
their lives in service to their country.  Let us remember them as 
they were, for time does not age them as it does us.  They will 
stay forever young in memories, but we will not forget them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely all of us in the House share those words and sentiments. 
It would not be asking very much to have the motion votable and 
to have this day set aside to remember peace officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few words to say about the police service in my 
community of Saskatoon.  I have spent time, as I am sure have 
many members of the House, with them in the line of duty.  I have 
watched the tasks they have to perform and the risks they have to 
endure.  Nobody could but be impressed by their commitment to all 
of us and their preparedness to take on risks in the line of 
duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent on all of us to recognize that and to do what 
little part we can to make sure that they know and that the 
families of those who have died in the line of duty know how 
important Canadians regard their work, understand it, and 
consider with compassion the circumstance in which they find 
themselves having lost a loved one.  It is incumbent upon us to 
ensure that our thanks is provided in any way we possibly can do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One police officer who died in the line of duty comes from 
outside my community of Saskatoon.  His name was Brian King.  He 
was hijacked, taken hostage and killed in the most outrageous 
circumstances.  All in Saskatoon and indeed all in Saskatchewan 
remember this police officer and his family.  There is a centre 
named after him in the town of Warman where he served with the 
RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to say thanks to those police officers who have 
provided services to date.  It is not enough to say to the 
families of those police officers who died that we are sorry, 
concerned about them, appreciate the service that was provided 
and understand the circumstances in which they live.  It is not 
enough to say that and go no further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members opposite would reconsider their opposition to 
voting on the motion and would support it.  I cannot imagine any 
Canadian would be opposed to this important motion except maybe a 
few on the Liberal benches.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary 
for the Minister of Health is not opposed to setting aside this 
day.  Surely the member from Prince Island is not opposed to 
setting aside this day to respect and honour police officers who 
lost their lives in the line of duty.  Surely the member for 
Nunavut is not opposed.  Surely, if they are opposed, they would 
be one of four or five people in the whole country who are not 
prepared to come forward and support the motion.

reconsider and by asking for unanimous consent to make the motion 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My hon. colleague opposite has been in this place for 
such a long time that he should know his party and the parties on 
both sides have members on the House procedures and affairs 
committee that make decisions about how to deal with the motion.

also respects the decisions made by the all party committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a point of 
order.  It sounds like a point of debate to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accordance with the request for unanimous consent by the hon.

consent of the House to make the motion votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak today in support of the motion to 
designate the last Sunday in September as the police and peace 
officer national memorial day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1978 Canadians have been afforded the opportunity to 
officially commemorate the memory of police and peace officers 
killed in the line of duty.  The annual Canadian police and peace 
officers memorial weekend service is a solemn occasion for family 
colleagues and all Canadians to honour and pay tribute to the men 
and women whose job it is to enforce the law and to protect 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attended these services and they are an occasion to 
honour the memory of those who did so at the price of their own 
lives.  The participation at last year's service is testimony to 
the increasing respect and esteem we all have for our peace 
officers whether they be police, correctional people or others in 
law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of the work of these officers that we as Canadians 
live in a safe society.  However we sometimes take for granted 
the security we enjoy and it is commemoration ceremonies such as 
a memorial that remind us of the courage and dedication police 
and peace officers display day after day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, it brings us all together to thank them for a 
job well done.  Each year we hope that new names will not be 
added to the list of those to remember.  Unfortunately this has 
not yet been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that Canadians are fortunate to live in one of 
the safest countries in the world, adversity is a real risk and a 
real danger.  Peace officers are vigilant about the safety of the 
entire community but the safety of their own lives may be 
compromised as they carry out their duty.  In this regard I am 
especially grateful for the services provided by Canadian police 
and peace officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have firsthand knowledge about police service in Canada. I sat 
as a member of the Waterloo Regional Police Services for 10 
years.  As chairman I was intimately involved with the work of 
police and the police service.  I certainly applaud the loyalty, 
the commitment, the dedication and the outstanding 
professionalism of not only Waterloo Regional Police but of 
police and peace officers across Canada wherever they may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks to the need to officially endorse a national 
police and peace officer memorial day on the same day as what has 
become an unofficial tradition for the past 20 years.  It is a 
time when we all pause to reflect on the contribution our police 
and peace officers make to society and to honour the fallen.  In 
addition, it is a time when we can pay our respects to the 
families who have also lived with the risk that each day brings 
and who have been called upon in their own way to make great 
sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the memorial tribute each year, the government 
continues to recognize the work of police and peace officers 
across Canada during National Police Week.  Again I have been 
intimately involved with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also provides practical support through the 
provision of new and innovative tools required by law enforcement 
officers to carry out their duties as safely as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means passing legislation that will prevent crime as well 
as legislation that will tackle crime in many ways simultaneously 
whether it be targeting high risk offenders or putting in place 
special measures to deal with criminal gangs.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will continue to make public safety its 
priority.  This is demonstrated on a number of fronts.  For 
example, through our efforts to combat organized crime, to 
develop crime prevention initiatives, to fight drug abuse and to 
redefine correctional strategies.  The record on public safety 
speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the last police and peace officers memorial this 
government has taken steps toward making Canada a much safer 
place to live.  The last Sunday of every September gives us all 
an opportunity to appreciate the difficulties and the importance 
of the work of police and peace officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is my belief that to designate the last Sunday of 
September as the date of the memorial service for the police and 
peace officer national memorial would entrench our respect as 
Canadians for police and peace officers who protect us, sometimes 
at the price of their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A formal national memorial day, such as the one proposed in this 
motion, would serve Canadian police and peace officers.  It would 
serve their families, their colleagues and indeed all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government supports Motion No. 342.  I am honoured to do 
likewise and I urge all members to do the same. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would just like to make a couple of brief comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to support Motion No. 342 brought forward by the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  As he stated in his 
comments, I too attended the memorial last September on the Hill. 
I attended with the widow and the son of a member of the old B.C. 
highway patrol who was killed in the line of duty on his way to 
responding to a traffic incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember some two decades ago, just after I moved into 
the area of Surrey, how a young RCMP constable was purposely 
drawn out of the police station by two people driving a car 
wildly.  He was purposely drawn to them and was shot at point 
blank range as he walked up to the window of the car.  These two 
people were convicted of first degree murder at that time and 
sentenced to death.  The death penalty was withdrawn and, to the 
best of my knowledge, at least one of those persons was 
successful on a 745 application.  However, this is not the time 
nor the place to debate that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think for most people in this country the most common contact 
with police officers is through speeding tickets and roadside 
breathalyzer tests.  Fortunately, for most people, that is their 
only contact.  However, I have a personal connection.  Five and a 
half years ago there was an incident within my family and I was 
forced to deal with the police for about two years, on a very 
personal level.  I saw their dedication and the honour these 
people work with and how diligent they are at their jobs, 
especially in the investigative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time I have had many opportunities to ride along with 
the constables on the streets of my city, to see them work and to 
see what they are exposed to.  I advise all members of this House 
and any member of the public who has a problem with the police to 
go out and spend a Friday or Saturday night on the streets of 
their community to see what policing is really all about.  It is 
a lot more than just speeding tickets and roadside breathalyzers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, in most cases, police officers are not forced to 
put their lives on the line.  They realize when they leave the 
house every morning to go to work that it is a possibility, but 
very fortunately for us and for them they do not have to always 
deal with it.  However, occasionally they do and far too often, 
in my estimation, these people lose their lives and widows and 
families are left behind to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak in support of this motion because I think it is long 
overdue.  There should be full public recognition and a 
recognition by this place and a day should be set aside to 
remember these people and what they have given for their country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very encouraged by the remarks and words of 
support that have come from all present here today.  I know as 
well, Mr. Speaker, that you have been very supportive of the 
police in your community.  Again, I think this is a time and a 
place for us, as a House, to express our support for those in the 
law enforcement community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite, the Liberal secretary for the Minister 
of Health, spoke of crime and crime prevention as being a major 
priority for his government.  I can certainly advise that it is a 
priority for all here in Parliament and in fact all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member did take the opportunity today to talk about the 
government's moves toward combating this most serious problem of 
crime in Canada, the DNA data bank legislation still before the 
House which we are hopeful will include the ability of the police 
to taking samplings at the time of charge to ensure they have the 
opportunity to use this important technology in crime prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also spoke of the anti-gang legislation and changes 
to the Young Offenders Act.  Quite frankly, those are certainly 
legislative moves we support but we are yet to see and yet to 
have the opportunity to vote on the floor of the House to bring 
about the necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard mention of ill conceived gun registry. 
Unfortunately I can state uncategorically we do not believe this 
is going to help the legal community or Canadians, nor is the 
continuation of section 745, as alluded to by the hon. member for 
Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate the importance of an opportunity for us to rise 
above the fray and be unified in our support of day that would 
recognize those in the law enforcement community, the men and 
women who are daily out there on the streets willing to put their 
actions forward for the protection of all; not to talk about it 
in the way the government talks about what it will do, but these 
men and women are out there daily putting forward their actions, 
not their words, toward this cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed and saddened by the position taken by the 
Liberal members opposite.  Many of these individuals should go 
home to their communities and consult with police officers, look 
them in the eye and tell them why they were not prepared to do 
more than just talk about it in the House but allow this motion 
to be votable which would then bind them to make this happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a vote of confidence.  This is not something like 
they are going to face on Tuesday where the Prime Minister has 
decided to make this a vote of confidence.  This is an 
opportunity for a non-partisan commitment, a commitment that 
everybody in the House should be quick to embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of conscience, good will and patience I ask members 
present to give unanimous consent for this motion to be made 
votable. I ask members to check their conscience and if they are 
not willing to do so they should go home to their constituents 
and to the police community and hang their heads in shame.  This 
is an opportunity for us to do something right for all Canadians.
