	<B>Mr. Janko Peri</B>G<B> (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this summer 
Constable Philip Francis, a member of the Peel Regional Police 
who lives in my riding of Cambridge, was awarded the Medal of 
Bravery.
<P>
	On September 21, 1994, Constable Francis, with the help of Mr. 
Robert Fitzgerald, pulled two people from a burning tractor trailer 
whose fuel tank had ruptured following a collision with a vehicle 
on Highway 401 near Milton, Ontario.
<P>
	As the tires of the rig exploded, Mr. Fitzgerald hoisted Constable 
Francis on to the cab of the truck. The constable smashed the 
window and pulled two passengers to safety just moments before 
the rig was completely in flames.
<P>
	Through his example, Constable Francis has shown that bravery 
and concern for others are not outmoded virtues.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of Cambridge, I congratulate Constable 
Francis on being awarded the Medal of Bravery.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
Saturne Solutions, Quintiles and Ericsson recently announced 
major investments in Quebec. Highly sought  by other provinces, 
not to mention other countries, these companies chose to invest in 
Quebec. This testifies to Quebec's ability to compete at the 
international level.
<P>
	But how to explain that, every time a business decides to 
rationalize its Canadian operations, as CIBA did, Quebec gets the 
short end of the stick. It is not because Quebec is not competitive, 
as everyone recognizes its expertise in the pharmaceutical area. 
There must be other reasons.
<P>
	We, for our part, feel that federal comments maintain an 
unhealthy climate for the Quebec economy. These comments, 
which were probably inspired by the famous plan B, hinder the 
Quebec government's efforts. Clearly, renewed federalism is not a 
panacea for Quebec. The time has come to move on to sovereignty.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two years ago I 
brought forward a votable motion to extend the Access to 
Information Act. Although many Liberal members supported it, 
they voted against it because they were assured by their party brass 
that improving access to information was high on the government's 
agenda and that legislation was just weeks away.
<P>
	Today, we all know that was not true, so I hope they have learned 
their lesson: Do not trust the party brass to do in the future what we 
can do for ourselves today.
<P>
	Later today we will begin the first hour of debate on a new 
votable motion on Canadian peacekeeping. Many Liberal members 
will also want to support this motion because if it is passed, it will 
give the members the right to speak out and represent our troops 
when we send a large contingent abroad. Motion No. 31 also gives 
final approval for large peacekeeping missions to members of 
Parliament through a free vote.
<P>
	When the time comes, members should use their votes to make a 
difference. Help support our troops and empower members of 
Parliament by supporting Motion No. 31.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-32, an

private radio broadcasting industry if the neighbouring rights

<P>
provisions are permitted to proceed. Many people from the radio 
industry in my riding have told me they are very very worried.
<P>
	Dr. Arthur Donner conducted an economic impact analysis for 
the Department of Canadian Heritage. This study clearly showed 
that higher copyright payments would seriously hurt most and put 
some radio stations out of business. It also showed that only 2 per 
cent of neighbouring rights fees would go to new Canadian talent, 
so why are we doing it?
<P>
	The U.S. just passed a similar law, however it exempted the 
radio industry from the neighbouring rights fees. They felt that the 
value of air play was considered payment in full.
<P>
	This government continues to renege on its election promise of 
creating jobs. It continues to eliminate this country's infrastructure 
of long term jobs. I urge the minister to amend Bill C-32 to exempt 
all radio from neighbouring rights.

recognize Small Business Week.
<P>
	Today in Canada all but approximately 2,000 of the more than 
two million businesses fall within the self-employed or small and 
medium size business categories. Ninety-nine per cent of the new 
businesses started up in the last decade have been SMEs.
<P>
	Today in my riding the CFDC, in partnership with the BDC, 
local chambers and others, is conducting a conference for existing 
and new entrepreneurs. I applaud this community initiative to help 
the small business community adapt and take advantage of market 
opportunities.
<P>
	On a national level, our federal government is working to help 
small businesses compete by streamlining regulations, improving 
access to capital and enhancing export opportunities. Canada is a 
great place to do business. Today I salute the small business men 
and women across this country for their entrepreneurial spirit.

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, October is Women's History Month. What better time to 
recall the historic Persons case of October 18, 1929. On that date 
the British Privy Council overturned the decision of the Canadian 
Supreme Court which excluded women from public office, 
pursuant to its interpretation of the British North America Act.
<P>
	Having decided women were not persons, the court said that 
women could not be appointed to the Canadian Senate. Dismissing 
this interpretation as ``a relic of days more barbarous than ours'' 
the privy council opted for a more modern view that women were 
``people too''.
<P>
	If we do not remember our history, we shall be condemned to 
repeat it. In the telling of this tale we can be encouraged by the 
increased numbers of female parliamentarians, over 50 MPs and 
more than 20 senators. While it is an improvement over 1929, the 
lesson of the Persons case is that we can do better.
<P>
	I look forward to a time when the proportion of female 
representation in government is a true reflection of the general 
population and like the privy council, we can look back on today's 
modest numbers as a relic of days gone by.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to inform the members of this House of an 
excellent initiative taken by our government in the Montreal area.
<P>
	On October 11, the Secretary of State responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development-Quebec announced a $500,000 
federal subsidy to the Centre d'entreprise et d'innovation de 
Montréal or CEIM, to set up a new program aimed at helping small 
businesses at the start-up or expansion stage carve out a solid 
position for themselves in the year 2000 economy.
<P>
	The CEIM will provide training services to 15 new businesses in 
the high-tech health care industries, thus helping to create over 200 
jobs in areas that are vital to our prosperity.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	This support for the CEIM shows that our government is still a 
partner of Quebec's small business sector. It also demonstrates the 
major role we intend to play in the development of the greater 
Montreal area so it may remain an economic, technological and 
cultural powerhouse essential to the future of both Quebec and the 
rest of Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a study

poverty line after the United States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5595"> 5595 </A></B>
<P>
	According to this study, 14 per cent of children in Canada live 
in poverty, compared to only 3 per cent in Finland, Norway, 
Denmark and Switzerland, and 7 per cent in Germany and France.
<P>
	In spite of these disturbing statistics, the Canada Information 
Office continues to distribute fact sheets stating that Canada is the 
best country in the world. This is chloroform for steadfast 
Canadian nationalists.
<P>
	Canada is a country where the gap between the rich and the poor 
is widening and child poverty is growing. There is no valid reason 
for the child poverty rate to be higher in Canada than in European 
countries.
<P>
	The government must act on its 1989 commitment and eliminate 
child poverty by the year 2000, otherwise too high a price will have 
to be paid and the human deficit will be out of control.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance often talks nonsense about the 
Reform budget platform. For him and the media, here are the facts 
made simple.
<P>
	Spending cuts of $15 billion plus $24 billion in revenue 
increases in four years will produce a surplus of $39 billion. This 
money will be used to eliminate the deficit of $14 billion, provide 
tax relief of $15 billion, raise spending on medicare and education 
by $4 billion and pay down the debt by $9 billion.
<P>
	This spending program uses exactly $39 billion in the revenue 
surplus. Our fiscal program does not produce deficits. We first 
balance the budget and then use only money in the bank to finance 
tax cuts and spending increases. The debt reduction money is our 
contingency reserve. Simple, eh?

medium size business is the driving force behind the Canadian 
economy. It is also the driving force behind job creation. That is 
why our government is committed to supporting the small business 
sector to ensure its growth.
<P>
	In Quebec, the Federal Office of Regional Development speaks 
for the federal government to small business. Through a network of 
13 regional offices across Quebec, it works in partnership with 
Quebec entrepreneurs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Small and medium size businesses, often run by families or 
young entrepreneurs, are the key job creators in Canada, 
particularly in my riding of Saint-Denis. There are also those who 
seek markets outside this country and the federal development 
office of Quebec provides them with the expertise to help enter 
those markets.

Saint-Denis and throughout Canada for their contributions to 
Canada's economic development in this week dedicated to them.

<P>
	The main services already in place include the electronic filing 
system, the payment of the GST and the transfer of funds.
<P>
	Eventually, customs processing will be made possible through 
the use of Internet and the implementation of an electronic system 
as simple as the sending of a fax, as well as the release and 
reporting of goods, and the payment of duties and taxes, without 
having to go to the customs office.

<P>
	The article, which appeared in the arts and theatre section, dealt 
with a film about the referendum and noted that, in it, the federalist

<P>
	I feel it is most fitting for me to encourage women of today to

special status. Special status is divisive. It is the very issue that 
Nellie McClung fought against.

<P>
	Transportation, including the automobile, is the single leading 
source of air pollution in Canada and it is the automobile industry 
itself that has told us that the fuel additive MMT compromises the

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Prime Minister went to Montreal to tell business people that he 
wanted to work together with the Quebec government and local 
stakeholders to deal with the real problems of real people, as he put 
it.
<P>
	For many years, federal initiatives have had a crushing impact 
on Montreal's economy. To mention a few: the Borden line, which 
killed the petrochemical industry in Montreal; decisions in the air 
transportation sector, which, following the opening of Mirabel, 
compromised the viability of this airport; federal procurement 
policies, which penalized Quebec and Montreal; the way federal 
spending on research and development is directed, which penalizes 
Montreal's economy. These are all decisions that over the years 
have undermined Montreal's economy.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister means what he says about wanting to help 
Montreal's economy, why does he not review his government's 
decision to put a stop to federal participation in the Tokamak 
project in Varennes, which provides the greater Montreal area with 
quality jobs in the high tech sector? That is a big help to the 
economy.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government was forced to make cutbacks in this area, 
and we had to-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien:</B> Yes, cutbacks were made in Quebec, in Ontario 
and all Canadian provinces. It was felt this particular program was 
not a priority at this time. Other cuts in the same sector have 
affected similar scientific projects elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	We would probably have preferred to keep it, but the Minister of 
Natural Resources indicated many times here in the House that she 
could no longer keep this program because there were other 
priorities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
Prime Minister goes to Montreal, speaking to all Quebecers, says 
he is willing to give Montreal's economy a boost. People suggest 
certain projects that will help Montreal's economy, improve the job 
situation and provide for a better future, but he says no. He refuses 
to invest $7.5 million in these projects.
<P>
	I will give him a second chance to show his good faith regarding 
Montreal. We know that Atomic Energy of Canada is a Crown 
corporation that refers its important decisions to the minister 
responsible.
<P>
	Why did the government approve the transfer of the office of 
AECL to Toronto, which may eventually deprive Montreal of high 
tech companies in this sector, another area where the Prime 
Minister could help Montreal if he were so disposed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me point out to the hon. Leader of the Opposition 
that in fact the crown corporation AECL has not closed its office in 
the city of Montreal. In fact, it retains an office in that city. I 
remind the hon. Leader of the Opposition that it is because of 
AECL and the sale of Candu reactors that there is a nuclear 
industry, a private sector industry, that employs thousands of 
people in the Montreal area.

the Prime Minister had nothing to tell the people of Montreal. 
Today, he has nothing to say to the official opposition. I will give 
him a third chance.
<P>
	In recent years, the Liberal Party of Canada was fiercely opposed 
to Bills C-22 and Bill C-91, which encouraged the development of 
pharmaceutical industries in Montreal, a sector that is in good 
shape. I may recall that the entire Liberal Party voted against Bill 
C-91, except perhaps for the Minister of Finance, who was absent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5598"> 5598 </A></B>
<P>
at the time. Under constant pressure from the  Ontario caucus, the 
government recently wanted to review the regulations of Bill C-91.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister really wants to help Montreal develop its 
economy, will he promise today that he will not in any way change 
Bill C-91, which his party voted against but which is a godsend to 
the pharmaceutical industry in Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a few seconds the Leader of the Reform Party will rise 
to accuse me of investing too much in Montreal on Monday, by 
helping Bombardier develop a new 70 seat aircraft to take 
advantage of an increasingly accessible market. We have been 
helping this company for a very long time. It is now the sixth 
largest aircraft manufacturer in the world and very soon will rank 
fourth. The company received $85 million on Monday. We have to 
choose our priorities, and that is the one we chose.
<P>
	As for the pharmaceutical industry, the legislation is in effect. 
There will be a review at some time, as required by law. We will 
have to see whether the pharmaceutical industry is fulfilling its 
obligations to engage in research and development and to locate 
facilities in Canada, and if it is, the legislation will be maintained. 
The industry has made certain commitments which I hope it has 
met. When the House of Commons reviews this question, a 
decision can be made. It is true that in the past three years there has 
been pressure to amend the legislation, but we have not done so. 
The leader of the opposition does not seem to be aware of that fact.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while he cries over Montreal's fate, what the Prime 
Minister wants in fact is to deprive Montreal of a financial and 
economic decision making centre. There was the S-31 attempt to 
rein in the Caisse de dépôt et de placement du Québec. The Prime 
Minister must remember, as he was a minister at the time and took 
part in the decision to crush the Caisse de dépôt et de placement. 
More recently, there was Montreal's proposed international 
banking centre, which was also torpedoed by the federal 
government. The government now wants to create a Canada-wide 
securities commission in Toronto rather than Montreal.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile yesterday's fine promises 
to help Montreal with his plan to create a securities commission in 
Toronto, when we know full well that this would further weaken 
Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, the decision to designate Montreal and Vancouver as 
international banking centres has yet to be made. Second, in his 
speech yesterday, the Prime Minister listed a whole series of 
measures the federal government has adopted to help Montreal and 
Quebec,  of which the announcement about Bombardier is but one 
example. In the private sector, the pharmaceutical and aeronautical 
industries do more research and development in Quebec than 
elsewhere because of the federal government's support for R and 
D.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	As far as the securities commission is concerned, the federal 
government's position is very clear: if the other provinces want to, 
we are ready to co-operate with them. It is up to them. In fact, all 
those who favour this option do so because they want to protect 
Quebec's financial industry, because they are very much aware that 
Montreal is not in competition with Toronto, but with New York, 
London and Frankfurt. That is what we will protect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is arguments like those raised by the minister, which 
border on recklessness, that have crippled Montreal's economy and 
continue to do so.
<P>
	We have no answer regarding the pharmaceutical projects, as the 
Minister of Finance was hiding behind the curtains when this 
matter was raised. Again today when we asked about the securities 
commission, we received no answer from the Prime Minister or 
even the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I put the question again to the Prime Minister. Will he promise in 
this House to mind his own business and not put in place a 
Canada-wide securities commission that will further weaken 
Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is asking us to oppose the will of other provinces 
that want to protect Canada's financial industry. They are telling all 
the industries in Quebec that want to issue shares in Canada they 
will not be able to do so in the future because everything will be 
moved to New York.
<P>
	They are saying that the people of Montreal and Quebec cannot 
compete with other countries, and I say to you that I am a proud 
Montrealer, that I am not afraid of anyone, that it is the hon. 
member who is afraid and he should admit it.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government claims to be interested in helping the 1.4 
million jobless Canadians yet it refuses to set targets for reducing 
that number.
<P>
	The government professes to be concerned about the 
overburdened Canadian taxpayer and yet it refuses to set targets for 
tax relief. The best way to create jobs in this country is to balance 
the budget and to lower taxes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The finance minister says he is interested in setting measurable 
targets. What are the minister's targets for providing tax relief to 
overtaxed Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
far as we are concerned, our record can speak for itself. In not one 
instance have we increased personal income taxes, having 
succeeded a government that had increased them 39 times.
<P>
	In each of our budgets we have brought in selective tax cuts 
designed to help the poor, to help the disadvantaged, to help 
research and development and to help in the creation of jobs. If 
what the hon. member is saying is will we accept his thesis, his 
philosophy, that the kind of tax cuts that ought to be brought in are 
those tax cuts that will help the rich while gutting the programs and 
the poor, then we say no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister says that he opposes Reform's tax 
relief proposals. In other words, therefore, the minister is against 
giving single mothers earning $20,000 a year a 95 per cent tax cut 
as we propose.
<P>
	The minister has just said he is against giving tax credits to stay 
at home parents. The minister says he rejects the changes in 
personal and spousal exemptions that Reform proposes, proposals 
that will directly benefit over 13 million Canadians and two million 
taxpayers respectively.
<P>
	Why is the Liberal government so opposed to giving single 
mothers, families and over 13 million Canadians tax relief as 
Reform proposes?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are not against providing single mothers with help. If the 
Reform Party will look at the last budget it will see that we 
increased substantially the working income supplement for 
families with four children.
<P>
	If it will take a look at what we have done in the case of 
education credits, if it will take a look at a whole series of measures 
which we have brought in, every single one is designed to help the 
poor, to help single mothers. The Reform Party voted against every 
single one of these.
<P>
	I will tell the House what we are against. The hon. member talks 
about helping single mothers. We are against gutting welfare 
programs because that is what single mothers depend on and that is 
what Reform has used to pay for its tax cuts for the rich.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the finance minister is against cutting welfare budgets, 
why has he cut $7 billion out of federal transfers to the provinces?
<P>
	Reform's tax relief proposal will help all taxpayers but it will 
help low income Canadians and Canadian families the most. 
Thirteen and a half million Canadians will benefit from Reform's 
plan. Over one million middle to  low income Canadians will pay 
no tax under Reform's plan. That is $2,000 in tax relief per family 
by the year 2000 under Reform's plan compared to the $3,000 
income deduction that families experience under the Liberals.
<P>
	Will the government set some firm targets for tax relief or are the 
Liberals satisfied with the crippling tax burden facing Canadian 
workers, families and employers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
our first budget we provided tax relief for Canadians. In our second 
budget we provided tax relief for Canadians and we will continue 
to do so.
<P>
	The reductions in transfers to the provinces were less than 3 per 
cent of their revenues and they were substantially less than the 
reductions in transfers that were recommended by the Reform 
Party. The Reform Party essentially said it would gut those 
transfers. What we have done is a lot less.
<P>
	Let us deal for a minute with this question of families. The 
Reform Party stands up and says it wants to protect the Canadian 
family. In those provinces where the Reform Party will gut 
equalization are there not Canadian families who depend on the 
public services that would be provided? Do Canadian families not 
depend on maternity, sickness benefits and unemployment 
insurance?
<P>
	The Reform Party would eviscerate welfare payments. In the 
weird, narrow definition of the Reform Party, are there not 
Canadian families on welfare who require help? Is its vision of this 
country so narrow that it cannot understand the needs of ordinary 
Canadians?

will answer himself.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was in Montreal yesterday, where he shed 
crocodile tears over the sad state of the Montreal economy. Yet, the 
federal government's procurement policy clearly puts Quebec at a 
disadvantage. The value of federal goods and services not 
purchased in Quebec amounts to amounts to $1.2 billion, which 
represents a loss of $600 million to $700 million for the Montreal 
area, I repeat a loss of $600 million to $700 million.
<P>
	Instead of crying over Montreal's economy, will the Prime 
Minister act positively and constructively, and restore fairness in 
federal procurement, which would create thousands of jobs in the 
greater Montreal area? Will the Prime Minister take action?
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in our system, government procurement is through public 
tenders. Each province, in fact, each citizen may submit a bid.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Some things are bought in one part of Canada and others in other 
parts, and all the provinces are treated equitably. If the hon. 
members are suggesting that we should stop using this system and 
award contracts only to those we like, that would not be honest 
government. It would amount to systematic favouritism.
<P>
	One of the actions we have taken was to set specific rules 
providing a level playing field for everyone. If they really did 
respect the wishes of Quebecers, who, twice already, have said they 
want to remain in Canada, they would stop talking about 
referendums. Businesses would then not be leaving but moving to 
Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the referendum is an issue they raise when they have 
nothing else to talk about. I have a specific proposal for the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not agree to making federal 
procurement in Quebec proportionate to the size of its population? 
For Montreal alone, this would represent a $500 million increase, 
which, in turn, would create 10,000 new jobs in the greater 
Montreal area. Why did the Prime Minister not make this 
commitment yesterday? Is the Prime Minister serious about 
Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the hon. member rise in this House and tell the public 
that, under the equalization payment system through which the 
Canadian government provides assistance to any region of Canada 
experiencing financial difficulties-and they say they appreciate 
it-last year, because its revenue was below a certain level, Quebec 
actually received an extra $500 million from the federal 
government?
<P>
	Will the hon. member rise in this House and admit that our good 
policies have resulted in lower interests rates over the past 18 
months and that the Quebec government actually saved $625 
million because there is a good, responsible government in

they really want.
<P>
	The GST saga continues. The Liberals promised taxpayers they 
would axe, scrap and abolish it-the Liberal equivalent of ``I'll 
respect you in the morning''-then they covered that whopper up 
with a  billion dollar pay-off that doubled the tax in Atlantic 
Canada, followed by the Deputy Prime Minister's resignation. 
Then they broke their promise to end the GST on reading and now, 
just like the Tories used to do, they have cooked the books to bury 
the billion dollar pay-off and fudged their deficit figures.

credibility of the country in order to pull another fast one on the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us be very clear. Despite the obvious problems of the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat, the auditor general has expressed a clear, 
unambiguous approval of the government's books. There are no 
reservations. He has given us a clean opinion.
<P>
	As a matter of fact we have never had a reservation on the books 
since we have taken office. The auditor general said that the 
government had acted in a way that was even more prudent than he 
would-I was about to use the word conservative, but I caught 
myself.
<P>
	When we took office we found that the previous government had 
made a series of commitments that were not consolidated in the 
books. As a result the books did not provide a proper statement of 
the government's financial condition. We have made sure that any 
liability is recognized at the time it is incurred. That is proper 
accounting. That is what we have done.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
the finance minister's chin is growing.
<P>
	The government just put hundreds of new tax auditors on the 
payroll to ferret out these same types of scams in the small business 
sector. If the finance minister did these things in a private sector 
company he would be in jail.
<P>
	Will the finance minister commit today to stop the creative 
bookkeeping and meet the same standard that he expects small 
business people to meet when his auditors come knocking on their 
doors?

we had done in the private sector-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Exactly. Accounting 101.

use.

<P>
	What we have done is recognize the liability at the time it was 
incurred. If what the hon. member wants to do is accuse the 
government of in fact having done better on the deficit this year 
than we announced, that is a lot better than what the previous 
government was accused of, which was to always understate the 
deficit.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was a lot of wishful thinking on the Prime Minister's 
part yesterday, in Montreal. The Prime Minister also shed tears 
over the plight of the city.
<P>
	However, we looked at the Liberal agenda, which will be-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask you to not use props.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> You are right Mr. Speaker, I should not have 
shown this, it is awful.
<P>
	I looked at the list of resolutions for the Liberal Party congress, 
which will form the basis of their platform. I found 20 priority 
resolutions relating to the economy, however, not one of them had 
to do with Montreal. The only thing about Montreal was a very 
short reference in the eighth paragraph of one of these 20 
resolutions, a ``whereas'' clause. There will not be much room for 
Montreal on the Liberal agenda.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Prime Minister: how can he tell Quebecers 
that he is prepared to take the first steps, that he is shedding tears 
over the plight of Montreal, that he wants to do something for 
Montreal, when nothing will be said about Montreal during the 
Liberal congress?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I guess my visit to Montreal did not go unnoticed. I guess 
the announcements we made regarding Canadair did not go 
unnoticed in Montreal. The other initiatives we are taking in the 
Montreal region must be effective, given that the Bloc Quebecois is 
so upset today.
<P>
	Let me say one thing: we implement programs in every region of 
the country. We know, and I acknowledged it before, that, because 
of the current problems in Quebec, where everyday the provincial 
government says it will soon hold a referendum, businesses are 
leaving the province because these irresponsible people will not 
recognize that, twice, Quebecers have opted to remain in Canada, 
since it is in their best interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for once the Prime Minister used the right word, which is 
a rare occurrence. He said his visit did not  go unnoticed. He is 
right. His visit was not remarkable, it merely did not go unnoticed.
<P>
	The Prime Minister talks about uncertainty. But who is 
generating uncertainty in Quebec when the Prime Minister of 
Canada challenges democratic rules when he threatens to partition 
Quebec, when he goes so far as to have his picture with Howard 
Galganov in one of his members' pamphlets? Who is generating 
uncertainty? Who has an interest in generating uncertainty, if not 
the person who has made a career of denigrating Quebec?
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister: How can he reconcile the speech he 
delivered yesterday in Montreal with the fact that all his actions 
relate to plan B, a plan which even Daniel Johnson repudiates?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

who have no arguments.
<P>
	I have been in this House for over 30 years and I was elected for 
28 years in a riding that is 98 per cent francophone. I have always 
protected the interests of my constituents based on my conscience, 
and they have always renewed my term of office.
<P>
	I have also always respected democracy, but I know these people 
do not want to respect democracy. They do not want to accept 
defeat. They do not want to admit that Quebecers want to remain 
Canadians, and this is why Montreal is currently in trouble. People 
are leaving Montreal because of the political uncertainty. But we 
say it is possible to be proud Quebecers and to be proud Canadians 
at the same time.

because of his high tax, high  unemployment, interest free loans to

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are implications coming from members of the Reform Party 
that the auditor general did not express a completely clean opinion 
as to the books of the government. I repeat that the auditor general 
did. And the hon. member ought to have at least the decency to 
recognize this.
<P>
	In terms of when a liability should be recognized, it is a 
generally accepted accounting principle, generally accepted in 
international commerce as well as domestic commerce, that a 
liability should be recognized when it is incurred. The liability was 
incurred in the year in which it was booked.
<P>
	What the auditor general has said was that all the details of the 
agreement had not been fully worked out. If the hon. member 
would like to hang round the House for about 15 minutes at the end 
of question period, that particular question will be answered for 
him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that 
was a pretty long and technical answer. It added up to 
fuddle-duddle. The point is the auditor general pointed out that he 
is breaking his own rules and accounting rules and everybody else's 
rules to accomplish what he has set out to.
<P>
	Why does politics become more important that truth in 
accounting, honesty in reporting and responsible management of 
Canadian finances?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sorry if my answer was a little too technical. Perhaps one of his 
colleagues might explain it to him.
<P>
	Let it be very clear that at the time we took office there were a lot 
of doubts expressed as to the credibility of the government's 
financial projections.
<P>

<P>
	It was very clear to us that if we were going to re-establish 
confidence in the management of the economy by the new

they occurred, that we be as prudent as possible and that we go the 
extra mile to do so.

	The reality is that we have a law in Canada on electoral expenses 
and contribution and it is all public. I have a list of corporations 
that have given to the Reform Party, and I do not call those 
kickbacks. They are people who are contributing.
<P>
	What we did yesterday or the day before with Canadair was to 
help a company that is becoming extremely competitive in the 
world today. It is sixth in the world as a builder of planes and it will 
be fourth soon.
<P>
	I want to tell people that the company is very successful. It 
contributes to my party. It may contribute to other parties. It is all 
public. All contributions are public.
<P>
	It is completely unacceptable to accuse us of providing a loan, 
which is to be repaid, to a successful Canadian company because it 
has given a contribution to the Liberal Party. But we know the level 
at which this member of Parliament loves to operate.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister asked about our policy on disclosing 
severance settlements. I remind you that our policy is the same as 
the Quebec government's, which is based on Quebec jurisprudence 
and puts severance pay in the same category as regular 
compensation, which is in the public domain.
<P>
	If the minister is willing to be open, I am giving him another 
chance and asking him again to confirm that General Boyle 
received over half a million dollars in severance pay, and whether 
or not he intends to make this agreement public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I told him 
yesterday, I hope my hon. colleague understands that the rules are 
the same for everyone. Not only for General Boyle, but for every 
public servant, every member of the military, or anyone else 
working for the Government of Canada.
<P>
	The settlements reached with General Boyle are within the rules 
established by Treasury Board. If the hon. member wants to find 
out more, he knows what he must do, because we in Canada have 
laws on the protection of personal information, which, I hope, will 
be respected in both Canada and Quebec.

those factors in mind.
<P>
	By raising this issue in this way, this hon. member has 
demonstrated more than anything else his own lack of judgment

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to announce that the Government of Canada has 
reached detailed agreements with the Governments of Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador to implement a new 
harmonized sales tax system as of April 1, 1997. The detailed 
agreements are based on the principles outlined in the 
memorandum of understanding that was signed earlier this year.
<P>
	Any successful negotiation requires goodwill and good faith by 
the parties involved. I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the governments of the three provinces concerned and especially 
my counterparts in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland 
and Labrador for the manner in which they and their officials 
handled the issues involved in these negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What helped all of us to conclude these negotiations successfully 
was that we shared a common objective: to give consumers and 
businesses a sales tax system that is simpler, more efficient and 
more equitable. It is a practical example of how the federal and 
provincial governments can collaborate to make our federal system 
work better.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For consumers, the new harmonized system will offer several 
important benefits. First, thanks to tax inclusive pricing, 
consumers will know the full price of their purchases before they 
get to the cash register. This is something Canadians have 
consistently insisted on in consultations about GST reform. At the 
same time, consumers will continue to know how much tax they 
are paying because receipts and invoices will show either the 
amount of tax paid or the rate at which tax has been charged.
<P>
	Consumers will also benefit because sales tax rates will be 
substantially lower than at present in each of the participating 
provinces. In Newfoundland, sales tax rates will be almost five 
percentage points lower. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick they 
will be almost four percentage points lower.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The harmonized sales tax will be good for businesses as well. 
They will have to deal with only one tax, not two. They will have to 
complete only one set of forms, not two. And, they will have to 
deal with only one tax administration, not two. The new system 
will be straightforward and simple. For example, there will be no 
separate requirement for businesses to register for the harmonized 
sales tax. Businesses that are registered for the GST will 
automatically be registered for the HST. Furthermore, registered 
businesses will continue to use the current GST return to calculate 
net tax remittances. When reporting tax collected and remitted, as 
well as claiming input tax credits, there will be no need for 
registered businesses to identify separately the federal and 
provincial components of the HST.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During our negotiations with the three Atlantic provinces, 
concerns were expressed about the taxation of books and its impact 
on literacy. We took those concerns seriously. They came from the 
Atlantic ministers themselves, but they were also expressed most 
articulately and most forcefully by a number of members of the 
federal Liberal caucus.
<P>
	Members may recall that in our economic and fiscal update of 
October 9 we said that one of the key roles of government was to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5606"> 5606 </A></B>
<P>
help give Canadians the tools they need to take advantage of the 
new economy. In that  context the question that we have to answer 
today is at a time of limited resources how can we best support 
efforts to promote literacy.
<P>
	Our answer is to target assistance to educational institutions and 
organizations which play a direct role in the area of such concern to 
us. That is why I am tabling today a notice of ways and means 
motion that provides a 100 per cent rebate on all books purchased 
by public libraries, schools, universities, colleges, municipalities, 
certain charities and non-profit organizations and other frontline 
literacy groups.
<P>
	This rebate is not an isolated gesture. We introduced several 
measures designed to support learning and education in our 1996 
budget, an increase in the education tax credit and increases to the 
limits on the transfer of tuition and education credits and 
contributions to registered education savings plans.
<P>
	The 100 per cent rebate that I am announcing today means that 
there will be no GST on all books purchased by educational 
institutions and learning organizations across Canada. It means no 
GST on all books distributed freely in primary schools, in 
secondary schools and other educational settings. It means tax 
relief on books not only for structured learning in our schools and 
colleges but for lifelong learning through public libraries and front 
line literacy groups. These measures are effective immediately and 
on a national basis.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	We have also agreed to administer a point of sale rebate in the 
three harmonizing provinces which will eliminate the provincial 
component of the tax on books. In short, there will be absolutely no 
increase in the taxation of books as a result of harmonization. 
Indeed in many cases there will be a decrease.
<P>
	In closing, we do not claim that today's measure answers all the 
challenges we face with respect to literacy in this country. 
However, by targeting assistance in this way we can get greater 
impact for every dollar we spend at a time of limited resources.
<P>
	Obviously more needs to be done. My colleague, the minister 
responsible for literacy, is working hard to get groups right across 
the country to identify and to develop the best means for working 
on this problem. We will continue to work closely with her to 
ensure that progress is made.
<P>
	More often than not, real and lasting progress in government 
occurs in measured steps. Today's announcement on a harmonized 
sales tax and the rebate on books is a real, constructive and a 
concrete step forward in the administration of sales taxes in the 
promotion of literacy in our country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as strange as it may seem, I would like to offer the 
Minister of Finance my congratulations, but I will then move right 
on to three complaints.
<P>
	I congratulate the minister on taking a step in the right direction 
by abolishing the GST on books purchased by educational 
institutions, non-profit organizations and other organizations 
working in the field of literacy.
<P>
	This is also a victory for the Bloc Quebecois, for I would remind 
the finance minister that, since 1992, when there were seven 
members of the Bloc Quebecois in this House, we have been 
calling for the complete removal of the GST on all books sold, not 
only in the case of educational institutions and non-profit 
organizations, but everywhere, in all provinces, in whatever 
manner, for the purpose of eliminating illiteracy in Canada.
<P>
	We are claiming a victory, because of the initial hard work done 
by our seven colleagues, and because the Bloc Quebecois, as the 
official opposition, carried on this fight for the complete removal 
of the GST on books.
<P>
	Just as the Minister of Finance often slips bad news in with the 
good, the bad news is that this agreement with the Maritimes is 
going to cost Canadians almost one billion dollars. This is one 
billion dollars that Canadians outside the maritimes, as well as 
Quebecers, will have to pay for a political agreement with the 
Maritimes to fool the public into thinking that the government is 
doing something about the GST. If it had had to do anything, if it 
had had to keep its red book promise, it should have abolished the 
GST.
<P>
	Now it is buying off the maritimes, and pretending to the 
Canadian people that it has taken action and sorted out part of the 
problem, when in fact nothing has been sorted out, and this 
political agreement has cost one billion dollars, 250 million of 
which will come from Quebecers, to make the Minister of Finance 
look good.
<P>
	Second, I must protest the minister's lack of transparency, 
because nowhere in his statement does he mention this one billion 
in compensation that we will have to pay.
<P>
	A second instance of lack of transparency pointed out by the 
auditor general: the minister doctored his figures in the last budget 
to include in the financial year ending on March 31 the $961 
million, nearly one billion, he will pay to the maritimes. Why did 
the minister do that? He did it so that next year, he would have even 
better news for us about reducing his deficit. That is doctoring 
figures. That is cooking the books.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The auditor general said it as follows: ``Ottawa violates its own 
accounting rules''. To make himself look good, the Minister of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5607"> 5607 </A></B>
<P>
Finance included an amount in the previous financial year, before 
the agreement was even signed with the maritimes. Now that is 
carrying transparency a bit too far.
<P>
	Another case of lack of transparency is the minister's refusal to 
release the formula and the parameters for establishing this one 
billion dollar compensation for the maritimes, despite the fact that 
the Quebec government and other provincial governments, at the 
last meeting of Finance ministers, asked the federal government to 
come clean, for once, and release the formula for establishing this 
billion dollar compensation.
<P>
	For instance, why should Quebec not be entitled to this kind of 
compensation, since it harmonized the QST with the GST back in 
1991 and 1992? The government says Quebec is not entitled to 
compensation, but it never released the formula for calculating this 
compensation. That is a lack of transparency.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the minister on partially abolishing the 
GST on books, but at the same time I have serious reservations 
about the transparency of the process. As far as the Minister of 
Finance is concerned, transparency does not exist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance at this week's Liberal Party 
convention will claim that he has delivered on his red book promise 
and got rid of the GST. This is a false claim. Rolling the GST and 
PST into one in a small part of Canada does not meet the 
expectations raised by Liberals during the last election.
<P>
	Of course, we have heard the Liberals reply to this criticism: 
``Read the fine print. We never promised to eliminate''. In my 
experience neither voters nor candidates read the fine print in red 
books. Not even an experienced politician with a name that 
reminds us of the police did so. No more proof is needed.
<P>
	I could raise many shortcomings of the new blended GST-PST. 
Let me mention just a few.
<P>
	First there is the added cost for national retailers who have to 
print a different set of flyers, catalogues and price tags on 
merchandise for distribution in the Atlantic provinces and who 
have to change computer programs and cash registers. The Retail 
Council of Canada estimates this cost for all retailers to be $100 
million.
<P>
	The second criticism of the agreement for the new blended retail 
tax is that it costs the rest of Canada $1 billion. This payment is 
basically a bribe which the government was forced to pay because 
of the embarrassment caused by the red book. The Liberals 
obviously decided that the political cost of this payment was 
smaller than that of the broken red book promise, especially after 
their spin doctors told them to emphasize the fairness of the 
payment in light of adjustment costs incurred. We will see whether 
such payments will be made to other provinces in the future. 
Quebec tried to get equal treatment and failed.
<P>
	We will also have to see what such equal treatment will do to the 
deficit. I also worry about the distribution of this adjustment 
assistance. Will it reach the small retailer who has to adjust his cash 
register and buy new computer software? How much will it cost to 
distribute this money to such users?
<P>
	The third criticism of the deal is that it increases incentives for 
the underground economy. In the finance committee we heard how 
evasion of the GST is rampant in a number of industries; in 
construction, automobile repairs and many other services.
<P>
	Such tax evasion is more rewarding; the larger is the gain. Since 
the blended tax is higher than the GST alone there will be more 
underground activity in untaxed income.
<P>
	Fourth, the PST was a retail sales tax. In order to prevent the 
cascading of taxes business buyers did not have to pay the tax. As it 
turned out, for reasons I do not understand, many firms did pay it 
anyway to the tune of many millions of dollars. The blended tax 
falling on consumers only has to be higher in order to make up the 
money paid by business under the old system.
<P>
	Fifth, the blended tax will not get rid of the complexity of the 
basic GST system. As the minister well knows, it is a nightmare. 
Municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals get special 
deals. Doctors and other professions enjoy yet another treatment. 
But most annoying is the special treatment given to food. ``No GST 
on food''. What a slogan. What a nightmare in practice.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Five doughnuts are not food; six are. Frozen pizza is a food. 
Pizza in a restaurant is not. I will not go on with the many examples 
of costly deviations from a value added tax on all transactions, as 
recommended by most economists and serving extremely well the 
people of New Zealand.
<P>
	The trouble with today's announcement is that this complexity is 
now even higher. Books are no longer books free of tax. There are 
good books like the ones bought by libraries and universities and 
not so good books bought by everyone else. What a sham. What an 
administrative nightmare, a typical political compromise that 
serves no one.
<P>
	Finally, I cannot help note that the minister in his statement 
claims that the tax will benefit consumers. I have trouble 
understanding this. I thought that the blended tax was revenue 
neutral. Are we now to understand that it lowers taxes?
<P>
	If it does, what will be the effect on the provincial and federal 
deficits? If it is revenue neutral, how then can it benefit consumers?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5608"> 5608 </A></B>
<P>
	In sum, the entire scheme of the blended GST-PST tax in the 
Atlantic provinces is one gigantic failure. It cannot be justified 
economically and socially. It can be justified only by someone 
whose judgment is clouded by the desire to extricate the Liberal 
Party from the serious political hole of their own making.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With all 
due respect, I would like to have unanimous consent to say a few 
words in response to the minister's statement.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity. I thank my colleagues for allowing me 
to respond on behalf of the New Democratic Party.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and many members of this House know 
that Canadians want a society in which the costs of maintaining a 
stronger community are distributed fairly with those who have 
gained the most from the community paying their fair share of 
taxes.
<P>
	Instead, Canadians are getting a society in which rich and 
powerful individuals and corporations get away with paying less 
than their fair share, leaving the rest of us to pay the freight on 
reduced public services.
<P>
	With respect to harmonization, it is the New Democratic Party's 
position that harmonization is not a fair way to deal with some of 
the tax situations in this country.
<P>
	Members will recall that in the 1950s federal government 
revenues were shared 50 per cent by individuals and 50 per cent by 
corporations.
<P>
	By 1996 those shares have changed from 50 per cent by 
corporations down to 6 per cent by corporations, with individuals 
paying about 94 per cent of the tax revenues in this country.
<P>
	Corporate tax revenues in Canada, combined federal and 
provincial, right now are the lowest of all the G-7 nations. In fact, 
corporate taxes amount to 6 per cent of the gross domestic product 
in Canada, with the G-7 average being around 10 per cent.
<P>
	The Liberals in opposition promised to abolish the GST. In fact, 
the GST is not only remaining, but they have expanded it to include 
harmonization.
<P>
	Members will recall that when the federal sales tax was in place, 
corporations paid about half the federal sales tax and individuals 
paid for about half the federal sales tax. When the GST was 
incorporated, we saw with respect to the harmonization of the GST 
corporations paying zero GST and individuals paying 100 per cent 
of the federal sales tax, which is now the GST.
<P>
	It amounted in very simple terms to about a $7 billion or $8 
billion tax increase under the former Conservative government, 
which is now not only embraced by the Minister of Finance and by 
the Liberal government but supported and expanded to include 
harmonization of this tax.
<P>
	We are very concerned about this effort because the 
harmonization, if taken across this country, would be yet a further 
tax increase. This is not a very fair way to deal with Canadians who 
are in many ways either underemployed, unemployed or facing 
significant personal challenges when it comes to personal financial 
conditions.
<P>
	To expand the GST and the PST into a harmonized program 
really is a shortsighted effort by the government to give 
corporations a very significant tax cut.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	In summary, I just want to say that New Democrats and many 
Canadians whom we have talked to across the country believe in 
fair tax reforms based on the two fundamental principles of 
fairness: fairness to those who are participating in our economy, 
and also on the ability to pay.
<P>
	Those who can pay their fair share should be paying their fair 
share. We have seen 35 tax increases under the Minister of Finance. 
We have also seen Bill S-9 being passed which contained 
significant tax cuts for corporations and significant tax breaks for 
very wealthy Canadians which the Minister of Finance agrees is 
really an unfair tax but he embraces it and supports it.
<P>
	What the minister is doing here is really unfair to Canadians. It is 
something I think his party and his government will have to 
account for once an election is called.

	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-340, an act to amend the Marriage (Prohibited 
Degrees) Act and the Interpretation Act.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the purpose of my bill can be 
succinctly stated. It is to ensure that the only valid marriage in 
Canada is one between one man and one woman. There are a few 
cultures and religions in the world which allow multiple wives or 
husbands but that is not part of Canada's history, tradition or 
values. There are one or two countries or states which either permit 
or are thinking of permitting persons of the same sex to marry but 
that is not part of Canada's history, tradition or values.
<P>
	Canada's history, tradition and values are being challenged right 
now in our courts. The United States has already passed similar 
legislation to defend the institution of marriage. It is time for 
Canada to do the same. This bill will ensure that marriage remains 
what Canadians have always known it to be: a legal union between 
a single female and a single male.

Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present to 
this House two petitions signed by the residents of York North. The 
subject matter of these petitions is closely related as they deal with 
deficit reduction and job creation, two priorities for this 
government.
<P>
	The first petition draws to the attention of the House the 
government's red book commitment to reduce the deficit to 3 per 
cent of the GDP and the fact that we have surpassed that goal.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to continue to keep its 
commitment to Canadians and pursue its actions on the deficit so 
that the government will reach its deficit target of 2 per cent of the 
GDP by 1997-98.
<P>
	The second petition draws to the attention of the House that in 
the past year alone short term interest rates have declined three 
percentage points, that for the last two and a half years inflation has 
averaged less than 2 per cent and by 1997-98 the federal deficit will 
have been reduced by $25 billion.
<P>
	The petitioners further draw to the attention of the House that 
since this Liberal government took office, over 600,000 jobs have 
been created.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament to continue to 
work diligently to create a healthy environment for jobs and 
economic growth.

reasonable force for the correction of pupils or children under their 
care; whereas such reasonable force has been interpreted by the 
courts to include spanking, slapping, strapping, kicking, hitting 
with belts, sticks, extension cords and causing bruises, welts and 
abrasions; and, whereas such legal approval of violence against 
children is contrary to their fundamental right to security of the 
person and to equal persecution and benefit of the law without 
discrimination as guaranteed by our charter of rights and freedoms,

approval of this harmful and discriminatory practice by repealing

	These petitioners ask that Canada must embrace a philosophy of 
zero tolerance, that victims of crime must be given the highest 
priority and that in cases of impaired driving causing death or 
injury sentencing must reflect the seriousness of the crime.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code that will 
ensure that the sentencing given to anyone convicted of driving 
while impaired or causing injury or death while impaired does 
reflect both the seriousness of the crime and zero tolerance by 
Canada toward this crime.

<BLOCKQUOTE>With regard to ground fish on the west coast, (<I>a</I>) what species are ``below average 
in abundance'', (<I>b</I>) what species are ``very low in abundance'' and (<I>c</I>) what is the 
scientific data to support the above?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> (a) The following species are 
considered generally ``low to average in abundance'', slope 
rockfish (Pacific ocean perch, redstripe rockfish, yellowmouth 
rockfish, rougheye rockfish, shortraker rockfish), inshore rockfish 
(red snapper and other inshore species).
<P>
	A number of stocks of slope and shelf rockfish are fished, which 
individually may be from below average to average in abundance. 
More detail can be obtained in the annual report of the Pacific 
Stock Assessment Review Committee Groundfish Subcommittee.
<P>
	Although slope rockfish have generally been considered ``below 
average'' for some time, there are indications (at least in areas 
north of Vancouver Island where the major fisheries occur) that 
abundance of these species could be ``average'' rather than ``below 
average''. Additional data and analysis will be required to define 
stock status more precisely.
<P>
	There are indications that some flatfish stocks (English sole, 
rock sole, Dover sole) are declining in abundance due to poor stock 
replenishment during the past decade, particularly in areas to the 
north of Vancouver Island. Additional data and analysis will be 
required to more clearly define whether these are ``below 
average''.
<P>
	(b) The following species/stocks are considered ``very low in 
abundance'': Pacific cod (all stocks), lingcod in the Strait of 
Georgia (offshore lingcod are considered at ``average'' abundance), 
Petrale sole.
<P>
	(c) The information above comes from the latest assessment of 
Pacific groundfish stock status, conducted under the auspices of 
PSARC in July 1996.
<P>
	Many kinds of scientific data are used in assessing the status of 
Pacific groundfish stocks: catch and fishing effort data (from sales 
slips, fishing logs, dockside monitoring, observer programs), data 
from surveys conducted on Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
vessels or in co-operation with industry (using trawls, traps, and 
acoustic methods), biological sampling data (length, weight, age, 
maturity), and data on ocean conditions (temperature, salinity, 
ocean climate trends, currents). The particular mix of data used 
depends on the specific species and stock. Details on the data and 
analyses used in assessing stock status are included in the annual 
reports of the PSARC groundfish subcommittee and in working 
papers on specific stocks.

TECHNOLOGIES ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (for the Minister of Health)</B> moved that 
Bill C-47, an act respecting human reproductive technologies and 
commercial transactions relating to human reproduction, be now 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-47-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-an act respecting human reproductive and genetic technologies.
<P>
	This government is committed to a regime that protects the 
health of Canadian women and children, reflects Canadian social 
values and ethical standards and recognizes the needs of infertile 
Canadians.
<P>
	It is our view that a caring society demonstrates its concern by 
using science and technology to aid those who would otherwise be 
denied the joy of parenthood, while protecting those who risk being 
harmed both now and in the future.
<P>
	Probably the most difficult question most of our parents and 
indeed some of us in this Chamber faced was how to name their 
new baby. The choices confronting those who want to become 
parents today are often much more vast, more technologically 
complex and have greater repercussions for generations to come 
than we have ever as individuals and as a society had to deal with.
<P>
	Couples having difficulty conceiving a child have to decide to 
seek outside intervention, or not to seek it, as the case may be. They 
have to make decisions about drugs and treatment regimes. They 
have to balance their desire to have a child against the potential 
risks involved. Sometimes these would be parents have to decide 
whether to involve a third individual, an anonymous donor, in their 
search for parenthood, whether they are willing to undergo invasive 
and difficult procedures such as in vitro fertilization and what to do 
with the embryos that may be created as a result of this procedure.
<P>
	Women who are already pregnant, whether through natural or 
assisted means, have to decide together with their partners whether 
to undergo prenatal diagnosis and what to do with the information 
once they have it. It is our opinion that we have to develop a two 
pronged approach to deal with many of these issues.
<P>
	First, through the legislation before us today, we are proposing to 
prohibit certain unacceptable technologies. Second, we are 
developing a regulatory regime to manage safe and effective 
technologies that are permissible.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The technologies and practices that would be prohibited under 
today's legislation are ethically and socially questionable. They 
pose significant threats to the health of those who use them and to 
the children who are born as a result of their implementation. They 
have significant adverse effects on the physical and emotional 
well-being of children and they pose significant threats to the 
health of the population.
<P>
	This legislation I believe is valuable in its own right, an 
important first step in addressing public concerns. But this is yet 
not enough. That is why the government has also released a 
position paper outlining a proposed regulatory framework for those 
technologies that, while acceptable, still require regulation to 
ensure the safety and well-being of women who depend on them, 
the children who emanate from their use and families that are 
created from them in Canada.
<P>
	What we are proposing is not, as one can imagine, an easy task. 
Its complexity has required us to consult the status of women, 
heritage, finance, treasury board, industry, human resources devel-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5614"> 5614 </A></B>
<P>
opment, citizenship and immigration, the solicitor general, 
agriculture and of course the justice department. All of these 
ministries have been brought into the consultation process for  
developing this legislation because they all have interests in the 
legislation and in the regulatory regime that we are planning.
<P>
	This government's willingness to tackle an issue of this 
complexity is in accord with the pledge made in the red book to 
make the health of women and the well-being of children a priority. 
It is concrete evidence of our commitment to the health, safety and 
ethics in the field of new reproductive and genetic technology.
<P>
	New reproductive and genetic technologies have the potential to 
enhance the health and well-being of women, children and 
families. Technologies such as artificial insemination and in vitro 
fertilization, the process of retrieving eggs from a woman's body, 
fertilizing them either with her partner's sperm or with that of a 
donor and implanting the resulting embryo back into the woman's 
body, have enabled children to be born to those who otherwise 
might never become parents.
<P>
	Prenatal diagnosis has been used not only to identify birth 
disorders, for example, but to identify anomalies that can be 
corrected at birth thanks to the knowledge gained through 
diagnostic procedures. These technologies can confer significant 
benefits on those who use them. They also, unfortunately however, 
hold within them the potential to threaten human dignity and to 
treat women and their children as well as the whole reproductive 
process as mere commodities.
<P>
	To give one example, to date at least seven advertisements have 
appeared in student newspapers seeking women willing to sell their 
ova. In return for cash, they ask otherwise completely healthy 
women to take powerful drugs with unknown long term effects to 
stimulate multiple egg production and to undergo invasive and 
often painful medical procedures to retrieve those eggs. This is an 
inappropriate use of medical treatment. Even worse, it reduces 
women and the eggs they carry inside them to sheer commodities.
<P>
	It is understandable, I think members will agree, when we 
consider the applications of technology like this one why new ways 
of intervening in the reproductive process have created hope for 
many Canadians but have also become a source of unease. The 
profound social, ethical, legal and health questions they raise 
challenge our most fundamental values.
<P>
	Canadians have asked the federal government to exercise 
national leadership to manage these technologies in a way that 
protects those most affected and reflects our collective values.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	The Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies was 
created in recognition of the important role of the federal 
government in the area of new reproductive and genetic 
technologies.
<P>
	Members in the House will recall the report entitled ``Proceed 
with Care'' as an impressive document, not only for the 
comprehensiveness of its 293 recommendations but for the means 
by which the commissioners arrived at those recommendations. 
Each of those recommendations was based on an ethical framework 
encompassing the principle of an ethic of care and eight guiding 
principles and on a thorough understanding of Canadian social 
values and attitudes.
<P>
	This comprehensive and solid basis makes it difficult to disagree 
with the commission's conclusions that it is necessary to establish 
boundaries around the uses of new reproductive and genetic 
technologies prohibiting the most egregious and regulating those 
that are safe and ethical.
<P>
	Since the release of the commission's report, the federal 
government has been working on the type of public policy called 
for by the commission. Because the responsibility for health is 
shared among the federal, provincial and territorial governments, 
discussions have been held between the two levels of government 
to identify possible areas of collaboration.
<P>
	At the same time, Health Canada held bilateral consultations 
with some 50 key stakeholders on their reactions to the 
commission's recommendations. Those consultations expanded on 
the work of the royal commission. They confirmed that Canada 
needs a legislative and regulatory infrastructure to deal with the 
new reproductive and genetic technologies. Further, they 
demonstrated the necessity for the federal government to exercise 
national leadership in this area.
<P>
	In exercising this leadership, we have been guided by a policy 
framework that includes a set of ethical guiding principles and a 
focus on the implications of the technologies for children. We have 
also focused on the prevention of infertility. It is sometimes 
identified as a priority both by the commission and by our own 
extensive consultations.
<P>
	We feel that we must be guided by these basic principles. I will 
enumerate them for members. First, we must balance individual 
and collective interest in recognition both of the importance of 
reproductive autonomy and of the reality of the individual 
decisions in the area of reproduction that may affect the larger 
society.
<P>
	Second, we must strive for equality between men and women. 
That does not mean that this issue affects men and women in the 
same way. The physical and social burdens and risks of 
reproduction are borne primarily by women and this reality should 
be acknowledged and be reflected as well in this reproductive 
policy.
<P>
	Third, we must protect the welfare and dignity of vulnerable 
persons and groups and particularly the children who may be born 
through the new uses of these  technologies, but also individuals or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5615"> 5615 </A></B>
<P>
couples seeking to use the technologies, as well as persons with 
disabilities.
<P>
	Fourth, prevention must be a first priority to lessen the need for 
medical treatment of infertility. In cases where treatment is 
necessary there should be a progression from the simplest and least 
invasive treatment to the more complex. The principles of evidence 
based medicine must be applied to reproductive health care.
<P>
	Fifth, non-commercialization of reproduction and of 
reproductive materials is essential. Commercialization modifies 
reproduction, offends human dignity and may lead to the 
exploitation of vulnerable persons or groups.
<P>
	Sixth, accountability is paramount. Individuals have the 
responsibility to safeguard their reproductive and sexual health. 
Governments and medical practitioners have a responsibility to 
protect the reproductive and sexual health of their communities and 
of the individuals they serve.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I have given these ethical guidelines certain actions where 
clearly indicated for the government. It has begun to address the 
safety issues identified by the royal commission, among them the 
reported use of fresh semen for donor insemination with its 
attendant risk of HIV transmission and the potential risks 
associated with the use of fertility drugs.
<P>
	Regulations concerning the process of testing and distribution of 
semen for donor insemination became legally enforceable on June 
1 of this year and a surveillance program for drugs used to treat 
infertility is also being developed.
<P>
	The voluntary moratorium on some new reproductive and 
genetic technologies was introduced one year ago. We recognized 
then that legislation in the area of new reproductive and genetic 
technologies would require a lengthy development process, 
therefore the moratorium was announced to cover nine problematic 
uses of reproductive and genetic technologies, together with the 
creation of an advisory committee on the moratorium.
<P>
	This was a positive first step. It has helped the key medical 
specialties at work in this area in their process of policy formation. 
However, some unethical practices continue to be offered in 
Canada.
<P>
	Many Canadians continue to feel that these issues are too serious 
for voluntary compliance. Government is responding to these 
concerns through this legislative action in order to transform the 
voluntary moratorium into one that is mandatory.
<P>
	The Human Reproductive and Genetic Technologies Act is based 
on the common policy and ethical ground identified in extensive 
consultations with more than 50 stakeholder groups, and with the 
provinces and the territories. This legislation gives voice to the 
widespread  agreement that some activities conflict so sharply with 
Canadian values and are so potentially harmful to the interests of 
the individual and of society that they must be prohibited.
<P>
	The government has met three goals in this legislation: 
protecting the health and safety of Canadians; ensuring the 
appropriate treatment of human reproductive materials; and 
protecting the dignity and security of all persons, especially women 
and children.
<P>
	The prohibitions listed in the legislation include the nine original 
prohibitions in the voluntary moratorium, together with five 
additional prohibitions not originally contained in the moratorium. 
In each case, the risks they pose to vulnerable Canadians and the 
offence they give to such basic values as equality between men and 
women and the non-commodification of reproduction justify a 
strong legislative response.
<P>
	Let me outline them and explain in the process the ethical 
underpinnings for each prohibition. The first of these prohibitions 
is on sex selection. Attempting to select the sex of a child for 
non-medical purposes is abhorrent to most Canadians. I think most 
members here will agree. In fact, all of them agree. Despite the 
inclusion of sex selection in the interim moratorium, there are still 
at least two clinics in Canada offering this service.
<P>
	Sex selection can take a number of different forms. It is 
prohibited under this legislation with only one exception. Sex 
selection is simply the most basic form of sex discrimination. To 
value a child primarily on the basis of his or sex is demeaning to 
the child and contrary to any principle of respect for human life and 
dignity. It also poses significant threats to the well-being of 
children.
<P>
	The knowledge that a child was born primarily because he or she 
was the ``right'' sex can cause significant harm to a child's sense of 
self-worth, to say nothing of his or her siblings who must suffer 
with the knowledge that they are not the right sex.
<P>
	If sex selection were widely used, it could cause the male-female 
birth ratio to become skewed with unknown consequences for our 
nation.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	However, the government recognizes that some very serious 
genetic disorders are sex related and that parents facing this 
situation will want to know the sex of the fetus. The legislation 
allows for this possibility. All other the uses of sex selection 
techniques are explicitly and firmly prohibited.
<P>
	The second prohibition is on the manipulation of reproductive 
materials. A number of prohibitions contained in the act fall into 
the category of manipulating eggs, sperm, zygotes or embryos for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5616"> 5616 </A></B>
<P>
various purposes. Many of the practices included in this category 
are somewhat familiar to us, usually from the late, late show on 
television for those who are insomniacs. Without making light of 
the issue, that is where they should stay.
<P>
	Members would be horrified to see what some of those 
prohibitions include. It suggests practices that are beginning to 
develop that must be nipped in the bud. One of those is cloning the 
genetic materials of living or dead human beings or of zygotes, 
embryos or fetuses. This could produce identical copies of single 
persons which would diminish the value of human individuality.
<P>
	We do not know yet what the health implications of being a clone 
might be. We know even less about whether there are any long term 
implications for population health by having large numbers of 
people who are genetically identical.
<P>
	Another example is that of creating animal-human hybrids 
whether by using animal gametes together with human gametes or 
by implanting a human embryo in an animal or an animal embryo 
in a human. These procedures could potentially produce creatures 
that would be half human, half animal. The presence of these 
hybrids is not unusual in folklore but it is eminently undesirable in 
real life. The formation of such hybrids violates the most basic 
norms of respect for human life and dignity and denies the 
embryo's connection with the human community.
<P>
	A third example is that which involves the altering of the genetic 
structure of reproductive material so that the alteration can be 
passed to subsequent generations or to germ-line genetic alteration. 
This has the potential to permanently alter the human genetic 
heritage at unknown risk to future generations.
<P>
	We lack even a preliminary understanding of how genes interact 
and of how altering one gene would affect others. We do not know 
how altered genes would act in subsequent generations. It would be 
inconceivable hubris on the part of any society to risk the health of 
future generations in this way and completely contrary to any 
concern for the vulnerability of the children of the future.
<P>
	A further example is the potential to manipulate the materials of 
reproduction that coexist with the speculation about the possibility 
of ectogenesis, that is, maintaining an embryo in an artificial womb 
until it is born. Its pursuit dehumanizes motherhood and 
marginalizes women from their previously central role in 
reproduction.
<P>
	We have no idea what the health effects for children born in this 
manner would be. The interactions between a woman and the fetus 
she is carrying are essentially still a mystery to us. One thing is 
clear, however, as we learn more about them. These interactions are 
of far greater significance for the health and well-being of the child 
than we might suspect. The royal commission describes 
ectogenesis as ``morally reprehensible''. We would all  be 
challenged to find anyone who would disagree with that finding.
<P>
	The third prohibition under this legislation affects reproductive 
material from fetuses or cadavers. It is an indication of the speed 
with which developments have been made in this field that when 
the royal commission released its report, the issue of retrieving 
sperm or eggs from dead persons had not yet emerged. As members 
of the House are aware, it has since become a very real possibility.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Thus it is no longer sufficient to prohibit the use of fetal eggs as 
was the case in the interim moratorium. Bill C-47 must also and 
does prohibit the use of eggs or sperm from cadavers. To create a 
child from the reproductive material of a dead person or from eggs 
retrieved from a fetus is a frightening proposition and could create 
unknown psychological harm to children born in this manner.
<P>
	We know that miscarriages are often the source of fetal eggs and 
we know that fetuses often miscarry because they carry disorders. 
Without knowing more about what that disorder is and whether it is 
genetically based, it would be taken unjustified and unjustifiable 
risks with a child's health to permit the use of the fetus' eggs.
<P>
	The use of gametes from the deceased in order to create a child is 
a violation of reproductive autonomy. Even if a person gives 
permission for his or her gametes to be collected for fertilization 
after death, the potential for psychological harm to a child born in 
this way is too great to ignore. This prohibition is not intended to 
apply to the use of eggs from the fetuses or sperm or eggs from 
cadavers in research. Rather it is designed to prevent research 
aimed at producing embryos from this process.
<P>
	The fourth prohibition is with regard to surrogacy. The effects of 
the prohibitions I have discussed so far relate primarily to what 
happens in laboratories. Surrogacy occurs much closer to home. 
Agreeing to carry and give birth to a child and then surrendering 
that child to another person or couple in return for monetary gain 
poses tremendous ethical and health related difficulties.
<P>
	Surrogacy commercializes reproduction and women's 
reproductive capacity and it commodifies children. It forces 
women to undergo the risks and burdens of assisted conception and 
then of pregnancy and birth. It poses risks to the emotional 
well-being of children. When the child becomes the subject of a 
custody dispute or when the child is not wanted by either the birth 
parents or the commissioning couple, these harms are magnified.
<P>
	Criminalizing such arrangements carries with it potentially 
serious penalties for those convicted. For that reason the targets of 
criminal prohibition have been carefully chosen. Anyone paying or 
offering to pay a woman to carry a child only to surrender it at birth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5617"> 5617 </A></B>
<P>
will  be subject to a criminal penalty, as will any third party acting 
or offering to act as an intermediary in the surrogacy arrangement 
for profit.
<P>
	Women who agree to bear children for others are often 
vulnerable because of the disparities in power and resources 
between themselves and those paying for their services. Rather 
than further burden such women with the risk of prosecution, the 
new prohibition targets the persons paying for such services. The 
behaviour of the so-called surrogate is not and will not be 
criminalized. As well, the legislation permits volunteer surrogacy 
arrangements so long as no payment is involved.
<P>
	The fifth prohibition is on the buying and selling of reproductive 
materials. The prohibition against buying or selling eggs, sperm 
and embryos is consonant with that against commercial surrogacy 
arrangements.
<P>
	Eggs and sperm are the basic building blocks of life. They 
contain the unique genetic heritage of the human being who 
produces them. When combined, they form embryos that have the 
potential to become human beings. To reduce these materials to 
commodities that can be bought, sold or exchanged for other goods 
or services is a grave offence to the principle of respect for human 
life and human dignity.
<P>
	The practice of permitting payment for sperm and eggs also 
carries significant health risks. Short term financial need can 
induce a donor to be less honest about his or her own health and his 
or her own genetic family history. Unfortunately donor screening is 
only effective when the potential donor is forthcoming with 
information regarding his or her health.
<P>
	Paying sperm donors thus increases the risk to the women who 
will receive the sperm and the children who may be born as a 
result. The risks inherent in paying for donated sperm accrue 
primarily to the recipients and to the children born as a result. 
There are relatively very few risks to the donor. Selling eggs on the 
other hand holds the potential for significant physical and medical 
harm to the donor as well.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	A woman who agrees to sell her eggs is generally perfectly 
healthy. She would have to be in order to pass the same types of 
screening procedures that are used for sperm donors. She is quite 
probably not infertile. Yet this perfectly healthy woman will be 
prescribed fertility drugs with their unknown long term health 
effects to stimulate multiple egg production. She will also undergo 
invasive and painful medical interventions to retrieve these eggs. 
In exchange for the risk and burdens she will bear, she will go home 
probably about $2,000 richer but she will have taken unknown risks 
with her own health and her own future fertility.
<P>
	This government cannot permit the health of vulnerable women 
and children to be put at risk by allowing a payment based system 
of sperm and egg donation to continue.
<P>
	The legislation does allow doctors, clinics and sperm banks to 
recover expenses involved in the collection, storage and 
distribution of sperm, eggs and embryos. In addition, because the 
current practice of paying sperm donors is a significant incentive in 
donation, there will be a phase-in period for this aspect of the 
regulation to ease the transition from a commercial to a non-profit 
and volunteer based system.
<P>
	The legislation is an advance on the interim moratorium because 
it prohibits payment for the donation of the human reproductive 
material for research purposes. This decision was made on the 
grounds that there is no compelling argument to be made for 
treating donations for research purposes any differently from 
donations for other purposes.
<P>
	The sixth prohibition relates to embryo research. A further set of 
prohibitions not included in the interim moratorium have been 
added as a result of our extensive consultations. They have to do 
with embryo research.
<P>
	Under the terms of Bill C-47 it will be illegal to use any human 
sperm, ova or embryos for research purposes without the explicit 
permission of the donors. Every person has the right to control the 
use of the products of his or her own body. Failure to obtain consent 
violates the principles of individual autonomy and respect for the 
vulnerable.
<P>
	It will also be illegal to fertilize eggs or to create embryos 
outside the human body solely for the purposes of research. Some 
couples choose to donate surplus embryos from in vitro 
fertilization for research purposes. We acknowledge their 
generosity in facilitating research that could help other infertile 
couples. But the field of embryo research is growing and some 
scientists have argued for a more abundant supply of research 
embryos than can be achieved through donation. This government 
does not accept this argument.
<P>
	Regardless of the potential for embryo research to give us much 
more information about the human condition, the need for embryos 
for research is not compelling enough to justify their creation and 
use solely for this purpose. All human embryos have the potential 
to become human beings. To create them without this end in mind 
commodifies them and undermines human dignity.
<P>
	Finally, it will be illegal to conduct research on human embryos 
any later than 14 days after conception. Since human embryos may 
eventually become fetuses which will become human beings, the 
question of how far into their development research should be 
permitted is far from merely academic. The issue has been widely 
debated and there is an international consensus that 14 days is an  
appropriate end point. Bill C-47 signals agreement with the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5618"> 5618 </A></B>
<P>
discussion group on embryo research which accepted this 
international standard.
<P>
	In addition to the specific prohibitions that I have outlined here, 
the legislation makes it an offence to offer to provide or to offer to 
pay for any of the services prohibited in the act. This will also help 
to prevent the creation of a supply and a market for these services.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The legislation sets significant penalties for those who are found 
to be in violation of any of the provisions of the act. There is a 
maximum penalty of $500,000 or 10 years in prison. As a 
government we are committed to the principles of 
non-commercialization of reproduction and the protection of 
vulnerable women and children. This legislation and the penalties 
for disobeying it demonstrate that commitment.
<P>
	Critics of this legislation will argue that prohibiting reproductive 
practices violates Canadians' rights to reproductive autonomy. I 
think they forget that no right is absolute when it causes harm to 
society as a whole or to other individuals. We are mindful of the 
need to respect reproductive autonomy, but we are also mindful 
that the practices and uses of technology prohibited in this 
legislation have the potential for tremendous harm to children, to 
women and to the value of human life in our society.
<P>
	Indeed many of the practices that are being prohibited in this 
legislation themselves have significant implication for women's 
reproductive autonomy. Factors that affect women's relative social 
and economic status can render the whole concept of reproductive 
autonomy meaningless. Some women may be tempted for instance 
to sell their eggs or to enter into commercial preconception 
arrangements to support themselves. Without adequate protection 
such as those found in this act, women can be particularly 
susceptible to the adverse consequences of these technologies.
<P>
	Unlike most medical treatments in which the individual alone 
bears the burden or benefit of the intervention chosen, those using 
new reproductive technologies pass on those benefits and those 
burdens to their children. New reproductive technologies have 
implications for children's health, including the unknown risks 
arising out of the use of fertility drugs.
<P>
	Children born through the use of donor gametes face legal 
uncertainty concerning their familial relationships, and they face 
uncertain impacts on their emotional well-being. Families of 
children born through donated sperm or eggs told the commission 
of the great strain caused by trying to keep the child's origin secret 
and by the lack of information available to them when and if their 
child asks about his or her genetic parents.
<P>
	This legislation does not offend reproductive autonomy. It 
balances the need to protect the interests of vulnerable women and 
children with the right of individuals to become parents and the 
needs of research that will help them attain that goal.
<P>
	Some may claim that prohibition against buying or selling 
sperm, eggs and embryos may result in a shortage of sperm for 
donor insemination. As I said earlier, the prohibition on buying and 
selling sperm will be phased in over time. This will allow sperm 
banks and medical professionals to adjust their recruiting practices 
and will also allow for education and promotion to encourage 
voluntary donation.
<P>
	Human reproduction is far too precious to make the use of 
donated gametes a matter for the marketplace. Our commitment is 
to the realization of an open gamete donation model with no 
commercialization and no anonymous donation. This is in line with 
the international trend away from commercialization and toward 
more open systems. We are not alone in addressing this issue in this 
fashion. There are strong international precedents for all aspects of 
this legislation.
<P>
	For instance, since 1990 the United Kingdom has prohibited the 
creation, storage or the usage of an embryo unless subject to a 
licence. The conditions of the licence include prohibitions against 
retaining or using an embryo later than 14 days, placing an embryo 
in an animal, cloning, or mixing human and animal gametes. 
Separate legislation prohibits commercial surrogacy arrangements.
<P>
	Germany too has had a wide range of prohibitions in place since 
1990, including fertilizing ova for any reason except pregnancy, 
using technology for sex selection, artificial fertilization after the 
death of a gamete donor, artificial alteration of human germline 
cells, cloning, and the creation of animal-human hybrids.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Recently France has created a series of new offences, including 
the creation or use of human embryos for commercial purposes and 
the creation of embryos for research or experimental purposes.
<P>
	Most Australian states prohibit a variety of new reproductive 
technologies including cloning, the production of animal-human 
hybrids, altering the genetic structure of an egg or embryo and the 
sale of gametes or embryos.
<P>
	This legislation puts Canada squarely in the position of 
supporting an international trend to limit the uses of science and 
technology when they contravene deeply held societal values.
<P>
	This legislation is also squarely within the Canadian tradition of 
using the criminal law to protect Canadians' health, safety and 
common values. Most health law is based on misuse of the criminal 
law and the courts have traditionally recognized these as valid 
exercises of Parliament's authority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5619"> 5619 </A></B>
<P>
	The decision to prohibit certain technologies and practices was 
made in light of a commitment to the health and well-being of 
women, children and families in Canada. It is based upon a strong 
ethical framework that incorporates the fundamental principles of 
the non-commercialization of reproduction and the protection of 
those at risk, particularly the women who use them and the 
children who are born as a result.
<P>
	The timely passage of this legislation will provide the needed 
protection not only to women and children but to a society that has 
shown it is apprehensive about its impacts.
<P>
	Its passage, however, still leaves an estimated 500,000 
Canadians affected by infertility. The inability to have one's own 
biological child is a source of grave distress to many people. We 
take this issue seriously. We believe there is a need for national 
leadership in responding to the needs of the infertile. That is why 
the legislation before the House today is but one part of the 
government's approach to a comprehensive management regime 
for new reproductive and genetic technologies.
<P>
	The royal commission recommended, which in this regard has 
been confirmed by the government's own consultations, that 
technologies that are ethically and socially acceptable to Canadians 
and that have been shown to be both safe and effective should be 
available to Canadians within a regulated framework.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I realize you are signalling that I am at the end 
of my time, but I feel that the seriousness of the topic would 
warrant a few more moments of reflection. I ask if the House will 
give its unanimous consent to extend my time another few minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank you and my colleagues on 
both sides of the House for your graciousness.
<P>
	We cannot ignore the reality that these technologies are already 
in use in Canada. In 1994 an estimated 8,500 donor insemination 
cycles were performed in hospitals and clinics across Canada. This 
is in addition to an unknown number of cycles conducted in the 
offices of private practitioners. Currently about 5,000 cycles of in 
vitro fertilization are performed each year in Canada. These 
procedures result in the birth of as many as 2,000 children each 
year. So far, however, the regulation of these infertility treatments 
has fallen almost exclusively to the medical professionals 
involved. It is clear from both the royal commission's work and 
from the government's consultation that self-regulation is not 
sufficient given the wide ranging implications for women and 
children.
<P>
	In the late spring of this year we released a position paper 
outlining the proposed regulatory regime when Bill C-47 was 
introduced. We have been discussing the proposals in this paper 
with the provinces and territories and with all the stakeholder 
groups. We are working to develop a consensus on the most 
effective regulatory framework for managing new reproductive and 
genetic technologies. This component of the management regime 
will be introduced in a second bill which will amend the bill before 
the House today. The result will be a single piece of legislation 
containing both prohibitions and regulatory controls that will 
provide a comprehensive management system.
<P>
	The government is proposing a system which would regulate the 
collection, processing, distribution and use of reproductive 
material to provide infertility treatments such as in vitro 
fertilization and donor insemination and in the conducting of 
medical research. The same system would also deal with the 
collection, processing, distribution and use of human fetal tissue 
for medical procedures and medical research.
<P>
	Three principles will guide us in our regulatory proposals. First, 
the protection of the health and safety of Canadians in the provision 
of medical procedures and in the conduct of medical research. 
Second, the assurance of appropriate treatment of human 
reproductive materials and the fetal issue and the recognition of the 
potential to form life. Third, the protection of the dignity of all 
people, especially women and children, in relation to the use of 
human reproductive materials in fetal tissue.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Another function of the regulatory regime would be to establish 
registries of information regarding the use and long term effects of 
new reproductive and genetic technologies. These registries would 
include a donor offspring registry to collect data on the identity of 
all sperm, egg and embryo donors and any resulting children that 
might be born from their use; a fertility treatments registry to 
gather information about the provision outcome of infertility 
treatments; a drug surveillance program for fertility drugs to track 
any adverse effects of the drugs on the women and men who take 
them and any children born as a result of their use; and a health 
surveillance system to track any short or long term health effects 
for children born from assisted reproduction.
<P>
	I have outlined how we will proceed with our legislative 
program for a comprehensive management regime for new 
reproduction and genetic technologies. It is a management regime 
that will protect the interests of vulnerable Canadians, particularly 
women and children, while addressing the needs of infertile 
individuals. However, the new reproductive technologies cannot be 
seen in isolation from concerns about overall reproductive and 
sexual health.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5620"> 5620 </A></B>
<P>
	This government made a red book commitment to a 
multidisciplinary approach to women's health and one  that 
recognizes the important role of social and economic factors. In 
this spirit we are developing a framework for sexual reproductive 
health to co-ordinate national efforts and to facilitate a coherent 
and integrated response to issues related to sexual and reproductive 
health.
<P>
	This framework will provide the basis for a comprehensive 
strategy for the prevention of infertility with an emphasis on 
educating Canadians about healthy sexual practices.
<P>
	The federal government has recently completed the first phase in 
the provincial-territorial consultations on the framework. Health 
Canada is also examining the implications of a more open system 
of information sharing in gamete and embryo donation.
<P>
	There is a growing recognition that, like adopted children, 
children born through donated gametes or embryos may wish to 
know about their genetic parents and even their identities and that 
the inability to get such information may have negative 
consequences for them.
<P>
	Moving toward a more open system with more readily available 
non-identifying information would be consistent with the goal of 
the protection of the vulnerable and consistent with the need to 
recognize the well-being of children as a priority.
<P>
	Finally, this government is committed to working with the 
provinces, the territories, non-governmental organizations and the 
public to examine the place and future direction of prenatal 
diagnosis and genetics in society.
<P>
	Even though I am not finished, I realize that I am wearing 
everyone's patience a little, but I think members can appreciate the 
seriousness of the content of this bill. I hope that all members will 
look at it with the same sort of grave approach with which we all 
have addressed the issue to date and give it not only their thorough 
and diligent consideration but their support as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-47, which is now at 
second reading. Bill C-47 is a bill respecting human reproductive 
technologies and commercial transactions relating to human 
reproduction.
<P>
	New human reproductive technologies raise many concerns and 
questions, primarily with respect to the technologies per se. Their 
development, use and commercialization is growing at a rate that 
even the main players involved can hardly sustain.
<P>
	But these concerns are even more troubling, from a social and 
ethic point of view, when we try to determine what the balance 
should be between the use of these reproductive technologies and 
human beings' control over their bodies, which technologies are 
morally acceptable and which are not, and to what extent they may 
be used by researchers and infertile couples.
<P>
	Also, as this exponential growth in genetic medicine and new 
reproductive technologies, or NRTs, is taking place, a dwindling 
birth rate is causing some concern and prompting more and more 
people to turn to these technologies, which emphasizes the urgent 
need for a framework governing this developing sector.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	What kind of framework is required? That is the question we 
must ask ourselves as we consider this bill.
<P>
	Many organizations dealing with NRTs and the official 
opposition as well have pressed the federal government to do the 
responsible thing and table amendments to the Criminal Code. In 
response to these various questions, on June 6, the Minister of 
Health introduced Bill C-47 and a regulatory scheme dealing with 
NRTs.
<P>
	Again, this government is proving unable to stick to what was 
recommended in terms of criminalizing certain procedures. True to 
itself, it is trying once again, with its proposed regulations, to 
encroach on exclusive provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	Bill C-47 answers but a fraction of the numerous questions 
raised by this growth sector. It prohibits a number of human 
reproductive technologies and genetic manipulations as well as 
commercial transactions relating to human reproduction.
<P>
	Under these provisions, 13 human reproduction and genetic 
engineering techniques are now prohibited. Of these, eight were 
already subject to so-called voluntary moratorium, where those 
who keep pushing the limits of these technologies further and 
further were in charge of ensuring that such procedures no longer 
be used. Needless to say that this voluntary moratorium was a total 
failure.
<P>
	The government has always been lax on the issue of new 
technologies; that is nothing new. As early as 1977, a Canadian 
coalition of feminist groups asked that a royal inquiry commission 
be set up immediately to study the impact and the regulations of 
new reproductive technologies. According to the coalition, it was 
essential and urgent to hold a debate on the progress made in the 
use of these technologies and to regulate them. This was in 1977, 
almost 20 years ago.
<P>
	The inability of the federal system to adapt and to improve 
things was once again demonstrated, since we had to wait 12 years 
before the federal government would listen and finally pretend to 
act. Twelve years passed. Finally, on April 3, 1989, the government 
announced, in a speech from the Throne, that a commission of 
inquiry would review new reproductive technologies and their 
impact. Twelve years during which there was neither act nor 
guidelines to regulate a scientific sector that was evolving by leaps 
and bounds. Twelve years during which everything was allowed in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5621"> 5621 </A></B>
<P>
the name of humanity and science. This is scary, considering that 
the world's worst  atrocities were often committed in the name of 
humanity and science.
<P>
	The Baird commission, named after its chairperson, was 
supposed to complete its work in two years, but finally tabled its 
final report in November 1993. During these years, the commission 
heard over 40,000 witnesses and reviewed the works of more than 
300 researchers from all over the world. This exercise ended up 
costing close to $30 million. Incidentally, not one province was 
consulted at the time of the Baird commission.
<P>
	In its final report, which required incredible dedication, the 
commission made 293 recommendations to the federal 
government. These range from restricting certain practices to 
completely prohibiting others, such as paying surrogate mothers 
and selling ova and sperm.
<P>
	The conclusions and the main recommendations are somewhat 
similar to those of similar studies conducted abroad, including the 
Warlock report, released in Great Britain, in 1980. However, the 
Baird commission also made recommendations beyond the scope 
of its initial mandate, going as far as dealing with issues as varied 
as the effect of tobacco and drug use, health and safety in the 
workplace, family law and civil responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	But regardless how good a report is, nothing will change if there 
is no political will on the federal government's part to take the 
necessary action to correct a situation. This is precisely what is 
happening with the new reproductive technologies.
<P>
	After ten years of public debate, after a royal inquiry 
commission spent four years, at a cost of close to $30 million, to 
produce a huge report of over 1275 pages and to make 293 
recommendations to the federal government, and after experts 
from Health Canada and the Department of Justice spent over two 
years reviewing the report, the government was still not prepared to 
make a move in 1993.
<P>
	However, in May of 1994, the Minister of Justice said a bill 
would be introduced in the fall of that year. The answer came over a 
year after the minister's statement and, far from being the promised 
bill, it was in the shape of a so-called voluntary moratorium 
imposed by the former health minister, in July 1995.
<P>
	This moratorium, with its contradictory tag of ``voluntary'', 
asked the principal players in the field of new reproductive 
technologies to refrain from certain practices, which I will 
enumerate for you: preconception contracts, in which a woman is 
paid to be a surrogate mother; the sale or purchase of human ova, 
sperm or embryos; the selection of a child's sex without a medical 
reason; free <I>in vitro</I> fertilization for women unable to afford this 
service in exchange for ova; the alteration of human genetic 
material present in ova, sperm or embryos and its transmission to a 
subsequent generation; experimentation to maintain an embryo to 
term in an  artificial uterus; the cloning of human embryos; the 
creation of hybrids of humans and animals; the use of ova from 
foetuses or cadavers to produce babies or for research purposes.
<P>
	A voluntary moratorium on these practices was outrageous. 
Greeted with absolute indifference, this moratorium was a bald 
admission of the Liberal government's complete lack of vision in 
this area.
<P>
	The former minister herself said that these new technologies 
were unacceptable, that they threatened human dignity and raised 
serious social, ethical and health questions, in addition to 
relegating procreation, women and children to the status of mere 
commodities. And the response was a voluntary moratorium.
<P>
	It would allow the main stakeholders in the field of new 
reproductive technologies the freedom, however, to decide whether 
or not to continue with what they were doing. In this field, where 
science is evolving so quickly that even specialists are having 
trouble keeping up, the main stakeholders were going to be both 
judge and judged. And during all this time, when the sheep were 
being guarded by the wolves, the wolves were looking out for 
themselves and expanding their activities, without a worry in the 
world.
<P>
	It is hard to believe, when we look at the pathetically 
insignificant action taken, that this voluntary moratorium was 
designed to do anything more than mislead the public into thinking 
that something was being done.
<P>
	Less than six months after the moratorium was imposed, and 
faced with criticism and warnings about the predictable 
ineffectiveness of these measures, the government had a brilliant 
idea: create an advisory committee-another one; when they no 
longer know what to do, they create advisory committees, they 
create agencies charged with overseeing the advent of new 
reproductive and genetic technologies and advising the deputy 
minister of health on the extension of the moratorium to practices 
other than those initially targeted.
<P>
	In other words, this committee had no authority to enforce the 
moratorium because the moratorium was voluntary, and reported 
infractions observed not to the government but to the deputy 
minister of health. As though anyone at the health department 
needed a committee to tell it what everyone knew already, which 
was that the voluntary moratorium was not putting a stop to 
anything, and that the situation, far from improving, was taking a 
turn for the worse.
<P>
	A striking example of just how bad the situation was becoming 
was an advertisement placed in a University of Toronto student 
newspaper last January. This classified ad was for a white woman 
between the ages of 23 and 32 who would be willing to sell her ova. 
Although no specific amount was mentioned, we know that such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5622"> 5622 </A></B>
<P>
transactions can turn to about $2,000 or more. This ad  caused a 
general uproar among the public, both in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The uproar was not about to die down, because a similar ad 
published at Wilfrid Laurier University promised financial 
compensation, not for the sperm collected, since there is a 
moratorium on this, but to pay for the time and travel expenses of 
the generous donor. Needless to say, this ad was intended as a direct 
attack on the voluntary moratorium requested by the Minister of 
Health at the time.
<P>
	Following these disturbing ads in student newspapers at 
universities, the former Minister of Health said she was upset and 
very concerned about the fact this was being done commercially 
and that women and children were more or less being treated as 
merchandise. She announced a bill that would contain vigourous 
measures-she said in a matter of weeks-to prevent trafficking in 
sperm and human ova. This was on January 16, 1996.
<P>
	In any case, the government managed to table a bill on new 
reproductive technologies. There will be two stages. Bill C-47, 
which defines prohibited procedures, and later, regulations that will 
be added to the bill. Here, we say to improve Bill C-47.
<P>
	After many years of waiting and statements by the federal 
government that it would do its duty with respect to NRT, we 
expected the bill to be far more thorough and comprehensive than 
is the case with Bill C-47, introduced by the Minister of Health.
<P>
	This bill is an admission by the government that the voluntary 
moratorium requested in July 1995 was a failure. Bill C-47, in that 
it recycles provisions that were already part of the moratorium and 
adds a few new provisions, may be seen as a more forceful version 
of the existing moratorium.
<P>
	We will take a closer look. In section 1-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Honourable 
members, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform 
the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Rosedale-Bosnian Elections; the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway-Canada Pension Plan; the hon. member for 
Lévis-the Joffre Shop.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> In clause 1, the French text lacks the precision of 
the English text. In fact, the term «manipulation génétique» used in 
the French version is more restrictive than the English term 
``genetic technologies''. Furthermore, the difference between the 
short title and the long title is astonishing. The long title is about 
reproductive technologies and related commercial operations, 
while the short title adds the term ``genetic technologies''.
<P>
	Furthermore, a distinction should have been made between 
assisted procreation and basic research. In the former, care and 
treatment are involved, while the latter is about genetic research. 
These are two specific areas that should be kept strictly separate.
<P>
	In clause 2, which concerns definitions, we see that the 
definition of certain terms does not correspond to the medical 
definition and that a number of technical terms were left out. This 
will be fertile ground for legal debate when the first violations are 
dealt with.
<P>
	In clauses 4(1)(<I>a</I>) and (<I>b</I>), the cloning of human embryos and 
making animal-human hybrids were already covered by the 
moratorium. The same applies to the altering of genetic material in 
clause 4.1(<I>e</I>), and the use of reproductive material from cadavers or 
foetuses in clauses 4.1(<I>f</I>) and (<I>g</I>).
<P>
	In clauses 4.1(<I>h</I>) and (<I>i</I>) we see other controversial measures that 
were also part of the notorious moratorium, such as choosing the 
sex of a child on the basis of non-medical criteria.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The same goes for clauses 4(1)(<I>j</I>) and (<I>k</I>) regarding ectogenesis, 
that is to say, maintaining an embryo in an artificial uterus.
<P>
	As provided for in clauses 4(1)(<I>c</I>) and (<I>d</I>), Bill C-47 also applies 
to the fusion of human and animal zygotes and the implantation of 
a human embryo in an animal.
<P>
	Clause 5 formally prohibits paying a surrogate mother or using 
intermediaries for that purpose.
<P>
	Clause 6, which prohibits the sale or purchase of ova, sperm or 
embryos, including their barter or exchange for goods, services or 
other considerations, was already in the moratorium.
<P>
	Clause 7 bans the use of any sperm, ova or embryo without the 
informed consent of the donor.
<P>
	Clause 8 makes Bill C-47 coercive by providing for fines of up 
to $500,000 and prison terms of up to 10 years. The government 
wants to send a clear message.
<P>
	In this respect, if we take the analysis a little further, we can 
predict that any such fines would be appealed to the Supreme 
Court. In fact, under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of 
the person.
<P>
	The 1988 Morgentaler ruling and the 1989 Légère decision 
established that section 7 of the charter may include certain choices 
made about one's own body. This section is tied to the notion of 
human dignity, which includes the right to make certain 
fundamental decisions free of any government intervention.
<P>
	Clause 12 gives the minister the right to designate inspectors and 
analysts. The door is open to giving the minister the power to 
designate the staff of the agency he would create in phase 2 of the 
government policy. This clause is typical of the Liberal govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5623"> 5623 </A></B>
<P>
ment, which could not care less about the openness this kind of 
appointment requires.
<P>
	Bill C-47 is an incomplete measure that is far from meeting the 
expectations raised by this government. He admits it himself on 
page 48 of the information paper on setting limits for health 
protection purposes, which states that the government is now set to 
start the third and most complex phase of its NRT management 
information scheme, which consists in developing regulations. The 
admission could not be clearer and goes to show that most of work 
lies ahead.
<P>
	This second phase the federal government is hoping to complete 
consists in regulating new reproductive technologies by 
introducing another bill, which will amend Bill C-47. As I said 
earlier, we have been waiting for comprehensive and responsible 
legislation since 1977. When all is say and done, there should be a 
single piece of legislation covering both prohibited procedures and 
regulations respecting authorized procedures. These procedures 
would include: in-vitro fertilization; insemination by a donor; the 
use of foetal tissue; the preservation, manipulation and donation of 
ova, sperm and human embryos; research on embryos; 
pre-implantation diagnostic, and postmenopausal pregnancy.
<P>
	But the proposed regulations contain an element that has become 
a trademark of the federal government, and this one in particular, 
namely a national agency to control and monitor new reproductive 
technologies.
<P>
	This agency would be responsible for issuing licenses, 
inspecting clinics and enforcing regulations. It seems it would also 
be in charge of monitoring the development of NRTs and advising 
the federal health minister in this respect.
<P>
	While officially operating at arm's length from Health Canada, 
this agency would be required to submit to the will of the minister. 
Page 35 of the aforementioned document states that, by law, the 
minister could establish general guidelines for the regulatory body. 
So much for independence.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	It goes without saying that setting up a national agency will 
inevitably result in the establishment of national standards over 
which the provinces will, of course, have no authority at all.
<P>
	Even more disturbing is the fact that, in addition to the measures 
to prohibit or regulate NRTs, this body could be given the 
responsibility of developing and implementing measures affecting 
areas other than NRTs.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois repeatedly asked the federal government to 
criminalize certain practices relating to NRTs. While the provinces 
have jurisdiction over health, it is incumbent upon the federal 
government to make  changes to the Criminal Code. While this bill 
appears to meet our wish that certain practices be criminalized, it is 
not at all an amendment to the Criminal Code which comes under 
the responsibility of the provincial governments, including 
Quebec. Rather, this is a parallel act unrelated to the Criminal Code 
and whose implementation will come under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Indeed, the consent of the Attorney General of Canada is 
required to initiate proceedings. This implies that the compliance 
and enforcement activities relating to this act will not come under 
the responsibility of provincial authorities. This opens the door to 
the establishment, as already announced, of a national agency to 
control NRTs. It is this body which, given the federal government's 
will, would be responsible for managing and implementing 
applicable rules and, more importantly, which would deal with 
eventual proceedings under the future act. Such is the real purpose 
of the bill before us. It is a far cry from what the official opposition 
asked.
<P>
	Federal involvement in the health sector, with all the duplication 
and the unilateral and successive cuts to the funds for the 
provinces, is a good example of the inconsistency and 
ineffectiveness of federal interference in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I do not know how many times I have read the Constitution Act. 
According to sections 92(7) and (8) of the act of 1867, and based on 
the interpretation made by the courts, health and social services 
should come under the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec. But this 
did not prevent the federal government from getting constantly 
involved, since as early as 1919, and even forcing Quebec to 
comply with so-called national standards and objectives.
<P>
	This intrusion, made possible thanks to the federal government's 
spending authority, allows this government to get involved in areas 
that come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	The federal government is thus able to redistribute monies in the 
form of subsidies, tied to conditions that the provinces must meet 
unless they want to be cut off altogether.
<P>
	However, these transfers have been reduced in any case, whether 
Quebec and the provinces met the standards or not. For the past 
fifteen years, successive cuts have created a shortfall of $12.3 
billion in the case of Quebec alone, including $7.9 billion for health 
care.
<P>
	These repeated cuts in funding for health care do not show a 
government that is terribly concerned about the health care system. 
Of course, these successive reductions in funding were never 
accompanied by an increase in flexibility with respect to meeting 
national standards.
<P>
	This kind of blackmail of using our own tax money, threatens the 
very future of the health care system as we know it today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5624"> 5624 </A></B>
<P>
	Although the Bloc Quebecois and the Quebec government have 
pleaded with the federal government to withdraw from health care, 
the latter has always turned a deaf ear. We see a good example 
today in Bill C-47 and, especially, the draft regulations which have 
been announced. However, the government can no longer afford 
its ambitious policies. We urge the government to give back these 
financial resources and withdraw altogether from an area that is 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	By the way, there has been a first step in Bill C-47, which 
provides that a province may withdraw from enforcing this 
regulatory component. However, once again, the first step will be 
the last.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	First of all, it will be up to the federal government to decide 
whether an equivalent system exists or not. Quebec and the 
provinces would have no say in this decision. Similarly, should the 
federal government decide whether an equivalent system exists, it 
could withdraw from this provincial jurisdiction and then reverse 
its decision at any time, on the grounds that the province no longer 
meets the requirements, and it could do so unilaterally, without 
consulting the province.
<P>
	Second, it would be not be possible for a province, even if there 
were an equivalent system, to escape the prohibitions described in 
Bill C-47, much less receive adequate financial compensation.
<P>
	In concluding, it is clear that with Bill C-47, this government is 
looking at far more than criminalization. It is trying to interfere 
with health care and with the treatment of certain products 
connected with NRT, activities that clearly come under the 
jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces.
<P>
	This is a contradiction of what was requested by the official 
opposition and the Government of Quebec. It is a contradiction of 
the division of powers, and finally, because of increasing federal 
intrusion in health care, it goes against the principles of efficiency 
and common sense.
<P>
	I will tell you why the Bloc Quebecois will not vote for Bill 
C-47. We are against the bill for the following reasons: there is no 
amendment to the Criminal Code; several clauses, definitions and 
terms are vague, which could lead to interpretation problems; the 
bill is incomplete; it announces the creation of a national agency 
which is unacceptable; and Bill C-47 perpetuates federal intrusion 
in an area over which Quebec and the provinces have jurisdiction.
<P>
	We want to ask the Minister of Health and his officials to go back 
and do their homework.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to the subject of human  reproduction and the 
genetic technologies act. This bill is very timely. Research is 
advancing at an unprecedented rate. We do not yet know the limits 
of our own research and perhaps we do not know even if there are 
any limits at all.
<P>
	The ethical questions raised by our accelerating knowledge are 
enormous. Just because we are now able to do something, does that 
mean we should do it? Clearly there are ethical limits to our 
activities and our answers to these ethical questions will define our 
society since they deal with the very definition and determination 
of life.
<P>
	The commission itself has noted that this issue has moral 
implications for Canadian society. It is important therefore that all 
of us put aside our partisanship, study these issues with the 
sincerity that is deserved and bring our most deeply held beliefs 
and those of our constituents to bear.
<P>
	In my own case, as a Christian, I believe that life is a gift of God. 
While animal and vegetable life are wonderful, beautiful, valuable 
and necessary life forms, human life is something more. It is 
distinct, it is different. That is why all people are special and human 
life must be treated with special dignity. To be human is to be 
noble. It is a thing of high honour. We are not worthy of that dignity 
because of utility, because of what we can do or how well we can 
communicate, or how strong, or how smart or how useful to society 
we are; humanity is in and of itself a priceless identity.
<P>
	It is no wonder that the commission wrestled so strenuously with 
these reproductive issues, since the technology and practices 
covered in this bill, for example, have spiritual, moral, as well as 
economic, scientific and social consequences. Perhaps that is why 
it entitled its report ``Proceed with Care''.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Since this is the second reading debate I would like to identify 
the principle of the bill and take a position on it. I would also like to 
identify two major objections to the bill in its present form in the 
hope that these will be remedied in committee or by subsequent 
legislation.
<P>
	On the content of the bill, clause 4 expressly prohibits 11 listed 
procedures referred to by some authorities as NRGTs or new 
reproductive and genetic technologies. These include the cloning 
of human embryos, the transfer of embryos between humans and 
other species, the creation of animal-human hybrids, genetic 
manipulation and the taking and either implanting or fertilizing 
sperm or eggs from cadavers or fetuses. Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the 
bill expressly prohibit two other activities impacting on human 
reproduction, namely the commercialization of surrogacy 
arrangements and the buying and selling of eggs, sperm, zygotes, 
embryos or fetuses.

	My first objection is that not all 13 activities proscribed by the 
bill are of the same order or deserve to be subject to the same 
prohibitions. For example, there will be legitimate debate in 
scientific quarters as to whether all of the 11 procedures listed in 
clause 4 should be subject to a blanket prohibition or whether 
some of the proscribed activities should be allowed to proceed 
under strict scientific controls for the sake of increasing our 
understanding of human life and enhancing its proper 
development.
<P>
	It is also apparent that those activities listed in clauses 5 and 6 
relating to surrogate mothers and providing the prerequisites for in 
vitro fertilization are qualitatively different from the activities 
covered by clause 4. They should, therefore, be subject to a 
different form of regulation so as not to put unnecessary obstacles 
in the way of childless couples and their doctors seeking to 
improve the couples' chances of having children. In other words, I 
am saying that the bill should be split, that the subject matters of 
clauses 5, 6 and 7 should be dealt with in a different manner from 
the activities proscribed in clause 4.
<P>
	The broad principle of the bill before us is to bring all the 
described activities under regulation by law. This principle of 
regulation by law is one which I support and I would urge my 
colleagues to support it as well.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we are dealing here with the very building 
blocks of human life. We are not dealing with property. We are not 
dealing with inanimate matter. We are dealing with human life.
<P>
	While I and my party are great believers in the marketplace, I do 
not believe that marketplace mechanisms are appropriate 
mechanisms for governing technologies and procedures for the 
reproduction of human life. None of us believes that human beings 
should be bought and sold, although there was a time when 
European and American law tolerated such practices and such 
transactions were governed by market mechanisms.
<P>
	The most basic principles of Canadian law and Canadian society 
condemn and prohibit any trafficking in human life. I would not 
like to see those principles violated by now permitting unregulated 
market forces, the impersonal play of supply and demand, to 
regulate reproductive or genetic altering practices.
<P>
	At the same time, most of us in the House have great respect for 
science and the managerial and peer group assessment processes 
which govern scientific activity. We are also well aware that 
self-regulation of the development and application of new 
technologies by science is not without danger and in the past has 
been insufficient to prevent gross misuse of technologies such as 
nuclear and germ warfare technologies, destructive to human life.
<P>
	As history has shown, science can be counted on to ask of 
technology can we. It cannot always be counted on to ask should 
we. If the scientist out of moral conviction does answer the 
question should we, and the answer is no, science does not have the 
capacity to ensure that no means no.
<P>
	For these reasons science itself cannot stand as the sole 
regulatory gatekeeper of new reproductive and genetic 
technologies. I therefore suggest that regulation of the reproductive 
technologies and genetic altering practices identified in the bill 
cannot be left to unregulated market forces or to the good 
intentions of the science community but must be made subject to 
regulation by law. This is the basic principle of the bill for which I 
would urge qualified support.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The second objection to this bill is more substantive. While 
agreeing with the principle that the reproductive technologies and 
genetic altering practices referred to in this bill should be subject to 
regulation by law, I do not believe that this should be regarded as 
synonymous with direct regulation by the government.
<P>
	The preamble of the bill states that the Parliament of Canada 
acknowledges the health and ethical dangers inherent in the 
commercialization of human reproduction. The Parliament of 
Canada should also acknowledge that there are health and ethical 
dangers in direct state regulation of reproductive and genetic 
technologies. Historically, the greatest abuses of reproductive 
technologies and genetic research have not been perpetrated by 
private enterprise for commercial reasons; they have been 
perpetrated by governments for ideological and political purposes.
<P>
	The most frightening example of such atrocities is of course the 
Nazi regime which conducted genetic experiments in the name of 
racial purity, in the hope of creating a super race. Experiments in 
the former Communist bloc and even by well-intentioned 
governments throughout the western world testify to the dangers 
when the state is allowed to play the role of God.
<P>
	Unfortunately the enforcement and regulatory section of this bill 
is very rudimentary and incomplete. It is the weakest part of the 
entire bill. It calls for offences under the act to be determined by 
inspectors designated by the minister and calls upon the courts to 
impose fines or terms of imprisonment in respect to offences under 
the act. The governor in council is empowered to make regulations 
for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this act.
<P>
	We have no confidence that this rudimentary regulatory regime 
is adequate for the purposes of the act and are convinced that it is 
not adequate to prevent abuses of reproductive technologies and 
genetic altering practices by the state itself. It is our understanding 
that this bill is to be followed soon by another statute  specifically 
outlining a better form of regulation. Our recommendation would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5626"> 5626 </A></B>
<P>
be that regulation of these technologies by law be assigned to a 
quasi-judicial regulatory tribunal acting at arm's length from the 
government itself.
<P>
	In summary, I would therefore urge hon. members to support the 
bill in principle, the principle being that the practices described in 
this bill should be subject to regulation by law.
<P>
	Second, I urge members to support the splitting of the bill so that 
technologies and practices immediately applicable to assisting 
childless couples to have children are dealt with separately from 
the other practices prohibited by this bill.
<P>
	Third, I urge members to recognize that total state control over 
the technologies described in this bill could be as dangerous to 
Canadians as unfettered commercialization and that regulation of 
such activities should be entrusted to a quasi-judicial regulatory 
body at arm's length from the government.
<P>
	I must add that my support in principle does not imply support 
for any subsequent bill setting out this regulatory framework. 
Unless such a bill spells out adequate safeguards against abuse of 
power by the state as well as by the marketplace or by scientific 
researchers, we will be obliged to oppose it at that time.
<P>
	I trust that these observations will be helpful to other hon. 
members. I look forward to their contributions in the debate, as the 
secretary of state mentioned earlier, on this very grave and serious 
matter.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Annapolis Valley-Hants 
on debate. Colleague, before you begin, unless there is direction 
otherwise, we will be ringing the bells at 5.30 p.m. I just say that so 
you will know how much time you have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of those who cannot speak 
for themselves: the children who were born and who will be born 
from the use of new reproductive and genetic technologies.
<P>
	Most medical treatments involve only individuals who consent 
to bear the benefits and burdens of the treatment. Assisted 
reproduction techniques such as donor insemination and in vitro 
fertilization are different. There are the interests of another party to 
consider, those of the children who will be born through their use.
<P>
	As a society we sympathize with those who are infertile and wish 
to help them reach their goals at having a child. But we must not 
forget that we have to consider more people than just those 
suffering from infertility.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The health and well-being of children must be of paramount 
importance in the decisions we make about  new reproductive and 
genetic technologies. The value of children in our society is 
self-evident but it is important to state firmly and unequivocally 
that children are not a means to an end. They are of value not 
because of the great gifts they possess, not because of the way in 
which they fulfil their parents' dreams and not even because of the 
joy they bring to their parents. Children are of value merely 
because they exist, because they are.
<P>
	This government does value children. It believes that the 
hallmark by which our society can be judged is the priority that is 
placed on the interests and well-being of children. The government 
has established a transparent and explicit framework for its policy 
on new reproductive and genetic technologies.
<P>
	Concern for children's interests is the vital aspect of that 
framework. The government also approaches the issue of children 
and new reproductive technologies from the perspective of a need 
to protect those who are vulnerable to adverse consequences of 
these technologies. And who indeed is more vulnerable in our 
society than a child?
<P>
	New reproductive and genetic technologies affect children in 
different ways. Some practices and procedures have consequences 
so adverse and so easily apparent that prohibition is the only 
possible response. The consequences of other uses of technology, 
adverse or otherwise, are less obvious, or they are controllable 
through policy regulation. These include implications of the 
technologies for children's physical health, both immediately and 
in the long term, and the implications for children's emotional 
well-being. In cases where donated sperm or eggs are involved, 
new reproductive and genetic technologies also raise serious issues 
about the legal status of children.
<P>
	The government by putting forward this legislation is proposing 
that some practices and procedures are so important for various 
reasons that there is no alternative than to prohibit them and to set 
criminal penalties for their use. Practices that turn children into 
commodities to be bought and sold are among them.
<P>
	That is why for instance this legislation makes it a criminal 
offence to buy or to sell human sperm or eggs. Sperm and eggs are 
the building blocks of human life. To make them into commodities 
subject to the conditions of the market is to commodify children 
and to turn them into products. This is ultimately dehumanizing. It 
will affect in the long term the way we as a society value children 
and how we value human life.
<P>
	Permitting payment for sperm and eggs also increases the 
possibility of health problems for the children who might be born 
as a result of these donations. Studies have shown that when a 
donation is made for payment, donors have less reason to be honest 
about the state of their health and about their genetic family 
history.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5627"> 5627 </A></B>
<P>
	One study found much higher instances of HIV-positive donors 
among those who were paid than among those who donated on 
a purely voluntary basis. Men or women in financial need may 
be less likely to consider the welfare of others in responding to 
this financial incentive.
<P>
	Commercial surrogacy arrangements go even further along this 
road to the commodification of children. Instead of sperm or eggs 
changing hands for money, it is a live baby. Those involved in the 
practice will assert that it is not the baby that is being sold but 
rather the reproductive services of a woman. Commercial 
surrogacy is simply the practice of paying a woman to give up her 
baby. We do not permit human beings to be bought and sold in any 
other context and it is an insult to children to allow this to continue.
<P>
	I have heard from a significant number of constituents in my 
riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants regarding the issue of 
reproductive technology. Many constituents have written to my 
office or spoken with me personally on this matter. They have 
consistently expressed opposition to the commercial use of 
reproductive technologies. Our government has listened to these 
concerns and through this legislation it is responding.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This government is determined to remove the profit motive from 
pregnancy and birth. It has accordingly prohibited anyone from 
paying or offering to pay anyone to surrender a child or from acting 
as an intermediary in such an arrangement.
<P>
	The prohibition on cloning is also justifiable in terms of its 
impact on the health of children. We simply do not know the health 
implications of creating large numbers of genetically identical 
people, either for individual children or for the population as a 
whole. The use of fetal eggs to create a human embryo could be 
harmful if they are from a miscarried fetus, since genetic disorders 
are one of the most frequent reasons for early miscarriage.
<P>
	Practices such as commercial surrogacy arrangements, buying 
and selling of sperm or eggs, cloning, or using reproductive 
material from fetuses or dead people have no place in a society that 
claims to value children. The physical health of children can be 
severely affected in the short term by the use of new reproductive 
and genetic technologies for the simple reason that their use 
increases the likelihood of multiple births.
<P>
	For example, 30 per cent of deliveries from in vitro fertilization 
are multiple: twins, triplets or even quadruplets. These babies are at 
a high risk of being born prematurely and of having a low birth 
weight. This can mean problems ranging from cerebral palsy and 
poor eyesight to short attention span and poor learning skills as 
these children grow up. In fact, Canadian and American studies 
have found that 20 to 25 per cent of  low birth weight babies suffer 
from a form of serious disability and will continue to need attention 
and care in varying degrees for much of their lives.
<P>
	Other health effects of new reproductive technologies just 
simply are not known right now. They will not become apparent 
until enough children are tracked through the various 
developmental stages until they reach adulthood. This is why the 
advent of new technologies has to be treated with such caution.
<P>
	Children are our country's most valuable asset. Our recognition 
of their value is found in Canada's signature on the United Nations 
declaration on the rights of children. They are so vulnerable to the 
decisions made by adults. Concern for children's health and 
well-being requires that their interests be a priority in making 
decisions about new reproductive and genetic technologies. The 
legislation before the House today has taken that perspective.
<P>
	The government has prohibited activities that, by 
commercializing reproduction and reproductive materials, make 
children into commodities, products for sale on the market. It has 
prohibited activities whose impact on the future health of children 
is harmful. It has in other measures proposed to set in place 
mechanisms to ensure that all new reproductive and genetic 
technologies that are offered in Canada are provided with the 
interests and needs of children paramount so that children are 
treated with the care and respect that they deserve.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, we only have one minute left in

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on Motion M-1, standing 
in the name of the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has 
informed the Chair in writing that owing to his recent appointment 
to the ministry as Minister for International Cooperation and 
Minister responsible for the Francophonie, he is precluded from 
moving Private Member's Motion M-1 standing in his name in the 
order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Consequently, in accordance with the Speaker's duty under 
Standing Order 94(1)(a) to ``make all arrangements necessary to 
ensure the orderly conduct of Private Members' Business'' I am 
directing the Clerk to remove Motion M-1 from the Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, all proposed peacekeeping or peace 
enforcement commitments involving more than 100 Canadian personnel should be 
put to a free vote in the House for approval or rejection.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise on votable motion 
M-31 which provides Parliament the opportunity to address the 
important issue of peacekeeping. If passed, M-31 will ensure that 
members of the House are properly consulted whenever we send a 
large contingent of our men and women in uniform on dangerous 
missions abroad.
<P>
	It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, all proposed peacekeeping or peace 
enforcement commitments involving more than 100 Canadian personnel should be 
put to a free vote in the House for approval or rejection.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The reason my motion would only deal with missions involving 
100 or more personnel is to allow the government sufficient 
flexibility to deal with the kinds of small missions that come up 
from time to time such as observer missions, de-mining operations, 
election  supervision, without requiring full parliamentary 
approval.
<P>
	Motion M-31 is very simple and straightforward. There are no 
tricks here and what it all boils down to is this. As members of 
Parliament we have a responsibility to our country and to our 
troops. When soldiers from my riding or any member's riding are 
ordered to put their lives on the line, I want to know that all 
members of Parliament looked at all the facts and made the best 
decision regarding the mission and any questions arising from the 
mission.
<P>
	It is not good enough that decisions are made by a few people 
behind closed doors. The Canadian people expect all of Parliament 
to face up to the responsibilities of sending our troops on these 
missions. When our soldiers go it must be a Canadian decision 
endorsed by the entire House of Commons. Before the decision to 
go or not to go is made, members of the House owe it to our 
soldiers to speak for them in a full debate and to cast their votes 
only after careful reflection.
<P>
	I point back to the times over the past 10 years when Liberal 
members stood up to say much the same thing, that it was a total 
disregard of this House when soldiers were sent off on serious 
missions without first consulting them. The people in all of our 
ridings expect us to have been consulted and expect us to have an 
answer to the reasons why Canadian soldiers have gone on a 
peacekeeping mission.
<P>
	Not only are modern peacekeeping missions more risky than 
they used to be but they are also much more expensive. The tab for 
our various missions runs into the billions of dollars. That is money 
coming straight out of the pockets of Canadians. We owe it to all 
citizens who are funding these missions to evaluate the facts and 
have a free vote before jumping in head first.
<P>
	How many of us, in our ridings, have been asked why we are 
spending whatever the figure is on a particular mission? Our troops 
have done a great job but our voters deserve an answer from us.
<P>
	The old way of simply handing over blank cheques to the UN is 
no longer acceptable. Canadians want accountability. Canadians 
want to know the risk and cost are worthwhile before the decision 
is made, and the only way to get all of the facts on the table is by a 
full parliamentary debate with a free vote at the end of it.
<P>
	After that debate, the only way we possibly can show our 
accountability is through that vote. Then members can put their 
money where their mouths are and go on public record as 
supporting or not supporting a particular mission.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Since we are not only talking about a huge amount of money but 
the lives of our troops when we make this decision, it is vitally 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5631"> 5631 </A></B>
<P>
important that members be able to  vote their conscience or vote the 
wishes of their constituents. If ever there is a free vote on anything 
in the House it should be for peacekeeping. It should not be 
political. It should not in any way be partisan. It is an obvious item 
for a free vote. The lives and welfare of our soldiers cannot be a 
partisan matter. Similarly, it cannot be a situation where a whip 
instructs members how to vote. This is a life and death decision 
that must be left up to the elected members of the House to decide.
<P>
	I realize that this is private member's hour so there is not a huge 
number of people here, but there are more people here now than 
when we have had some of our rather sham debates on 
peacekeeping missions that have occurred after hours.
<P>
	Not all the facts were known at that time. The decisions in many 
cases had already been made and reported in the press. There was 
no opportunity for input of members to be incorporated into the 
government plans. There was no free vote. In fact there was no vote 
at all on any of these debates. No wonder there was so little interest 
by members. No wonder there was so little media attention. No 
wonder Canadians were not informed as they should have been. No 
wonder that when Canadians would ask members about the validity 
of the missions, those members were not able to give an answer.
<P>
	Over the next few months two major peacekeeping missions are 
supposed to expire. All current indications show that these 
missions will be renewed. The blank cheques are already in the 
minister's hand. While I have no doubt that some mockery of 
consultation will occur, it will be what it has always been, a mirage, 
an image and a fraud on the Canadian public.
<P>
	It does not have to be that way. I know there are members on all 
sides of the House who would dearly love to have some real input. 
They would love to discuss all of the facts in a full debate and then 
make a decision that is best for the country by means of a free vote.
<P>
	In particular, I am thinking of the members of the foreign affairs 
and defence committees. I am thinking of members whose sons or 
daughters are in the military. I am thinking of members who have 
military bases in their ridings or members who are veterans. All of 
these members have something to contribute and it does not matter 
if they are Liberals, Bloc Quebecois, Reformers or New 
Democrats.
<P>
	This debate is about the lives of our young people and the place 
our country has in the world. For many years peacekeeping has 
been a major factor of Canadian foreign policy. It is up to all of us 
as members of Parliament to take the responsibility seriously and 
speak to these motions.
<P>
	I am pretty sure that the Liberal whip has already instructed 
some member opposite to give a speech saying something like this: 
``We appreciate the idea of the member for Red Deer and the 
Liberal Party is always  concerned about peacekeeping and 
consulting with the public, but we do not support this motion''. 
Then we will probably hear some convoluted explanation of why 
my motion is impractical or improper or unparliamentary, but it 
will be one of those things.
<P>
	I think back to a motion a couple of years ago on access to 
information. Member after member got up and said that it was a 
great motion and it was just what the House needed for 
accountability but they were going to vote against it because the 
government was going to act on it and they would have action 
within the year. That was two years ago and there is still no action.
<P>
	I urge whichever member has been chosen to give this speech to 
think twice before that member gives it. The member should think 
about his or her responsibility as a member of Parliament to 
represent his or her people back home, to promote the interests of 
the country and to support our troops. All of these things have to be 
more important than blindly serving the all knowing party brass.
<P>
	I urge other Liberal members who have not had instructions from 
their whip to speak their minds freely. While they are doing this 
they should take inspiration from what has been said in the past by 
certain Liberal cabinet ministers. I am going to read a few quotes 
and I want the Liberal members here to hold their ministers to their 
words because their words support the principles behind M-31.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	I will begin with the words of the Minister of Foreign Affairs: ``I 
appreciate the co-operation of all parties in this new Parliament. 
This way, the people of Canada will be able to express their views 
to their elected representatives on an important foreign affairs 
issue. I also want to point out that today's consultation will not be 
the last on Canada's foreign policy''. In this case he was talking 
about Haiti: ``I promise that as far as possible, future debates will 
be held under better circumstances''.
<P>
	Since a fuller, more complete debate will be of benefit to 
Canadians, I can only assume that he would support M-31.
<P>
	A second quote from the minister: ``We have learned our 
lessons. We realize that when the United Nations takes on a role 
there must be proper and effective resources to meet the needs''. 
Parliament should know if these resources are in place. If they are, 
then all the facts are laid on the table. And if they are not but the 
government is going ahead with the mission anyway, clearly the 
minister's words about having learned a lesson ring rather hollow.
<P>
	A third quote: ``I also brought the views of Canadians to bear by 
opening up this question on the Internet so we were able to ensure 
that Canadians from a wide variety of perspectives would let us 
know what their thoughts were''. Obviously the minister is 
concerned about listening to people and obviously believing in 
representative democracy as other parties in the House do. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5632"> 5632 </A></B>
<P>
obviously believe that members of Parliament then should have 
their voice heard.
<P>
	Another quote: ``We still need and want the expressions of 
opinions of members of Parliament on what they think''. Obviously 
the clearest way to get that is by a free vote in the House.
<P>
	Finally, from the Minister of Foreign Affairs: ``We are finding 
the solutions but we need to have the views of members of 
Parliament''. From all these quotes one can see that the minister is 
saying we should have fuller debate with the facts available to all 
members so that they can make an educated decision on matters. 
This is exactly what Motion No. 31 states.
<P>
	The foreign affairs minister is not the only cabinet minister who 
seemingly supports the principles of M-31. Let me turn now to 
some quotes from the former minister of national defence: ``I think 
the hon. members from Red Deer and Charlevoix have raised very 
good points about getting a better handle on the cost before we go 
into these missions''. Again, clearly the minister was stating he 
believes more parliamentary debate would be the way to get that 
information.
<P>
	He goes on: ``With respect to the rules of engagement, we have 
to be very sure that we know under what auspices we are operating 
there. We have had some unpleasant experiences before, one in 
Somalia, and we have learned a lot of lessons''. Again I point out 
that he is strongly promoting the concept of M-31.
<P>
	I think we will find as well that we have tried various 
experiments in our committees to make this work. In fact, we have 
moved a long way in looking at what we might do here.
<P>
	A final quote from that minister: ``The mandate has to be 
appropriate and achievable under the circumstances. We have to 
know the rules of engagement. We have to know what the ultimate 
force size and composition are''. This is exactly the point. We have 
to know the facts, we have to have the briefing and we as members 
of Parliament have to feel good about what we do when we spend 
that money and risk those lives.
<P>
	My conclusion from all of these statements is that it appears 
there would be strong cabinet support for M-31 based on what I 
have read and what I have heard in the House.
<P>
	Time will tell whether those were hollow words or whether the 
ministers really meant those words about consultation on an issue 
as strongly felt by Canadians as peacekeeping.
<P>
	Let me now turn to a discussion on one of those missions which 
will expire in a month, the Haiti mission. This is a perfect example 
of an ad hoc mission that is  lurching from one crisis to the next. 
The mission is due to expire yet we have heard nothing about the 
continued Canadian role in Parliament. Members are being kept in 
the dark. I expect a day or two before the debate we are going to 
have a rush debate in order to extend the mission for another six 
months.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Members of this House who are on the foreign affairs committee 
know that we were told this was just a six month extension, that 
most things should be under control by then and that we would in 
fact not be carrying on with the mission in likelihood come 
December of this year. Putting a band-aid on a bleeding artery is 
not going to solve anything.
<P>
	The former minister of international co-operation in Haiti said 
Canada will prove its friendship and solidarity. It is very nice for 
the minister to say that and I am glad that he enjoys cutting 
backroom deals with foreign leaders while keeping the Canadian 
Parliament in suspense. I would like to remind this House that the 
Liberals used to cry bloody murder when the Mulroney Tories did 
the same thing. Although certain members of this cabinet have the 
Tory act fine tuned, it appears, I know that most members would 
agree that this should be openly discussed, openly debated and then 
let all members consult with their constituents and make that 
decision. M-31 would allow that to happen.
<P>
	As far as Reform is concerned, we have to look at the Haiti 
mission and the facts again, much as we did before. We know the 
situations, we read the reports about what is happening there. We 
know that illiteracy is still at 85 per cent and unemployment at 80 
per cent plus. We know that Mr. Aristide is waiting in the wings. 
We know there has been no great progress in democratization. We 
know that there are under 100 rich families adding nothing back to 
that country. We know that expatriates are not encouraged to invest 
in the country.
<P>
	Canadians need to know more. What are the benefits, the long 
term solutions and is there a long term plan? We in the House of 
Commons can put forward such a plan to look at a country like 
Haiti. It is in our hemisphere. We can come up with a solution, 
maybe it will take 20 or 30 years, but we have to at least give a 
chance.
<P>
	This is the kind of thing that this House can do. This House can 
put forward a long term solution, one that Canadians will 
understand, one that all of us will understand and together we will 
agree on it. This last minute two hour debate rushed through the 
day before is not a solution to solving these sorts of peacekeeping 
problems.
<P>
	Maybe the solution is to go to the OAS to begin the democracy, 
to say to the 31 other countries it is time that we took the 
responsibility. It is in our hemisphere, it is causing us problems, let 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5633"> 5633 </A></B>
<P>
us take it. Let us at least come up with another solution, not just a 
band-aid that probably will not work.
<P>
	Within this House we have the capability, the brain power, the 
thoughtfulness, the intelligence, all these adjectives, where we 
could actually create something better for ourselves. If there is any 
area, foreign affairs has to be that area where we can be 
non-partisan, where we can look at a solution with long term 
benefits for all of us.
<P>
	We should get unanimous consent for this bill. We should all be 
able to agree to it. My constituents will be happy if I am working 
for the good of the country, not for the good of my party, not for the 
good of partisan positions but one showing co-operation, 
leadership and using members of Parliament to the best advantage 
of this House.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in this debate as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs but also as a member of foreign affairs and 
international trade committee who has participated with the hon. 
member for Red Deer and others in debate on the question of 
Canada's peacekeeping missions, notably the most recent one in 
Haiti.
<P>
	I want to begin by challenging the premise of the motion which 
is that unless there is a free vote in this House as is specified by the 
motion, Canada's role in peacekeeping missions is not debated by 
parliamentarians, that no debate has taken place.
<P>
	That is manifestly not the case. With the committee of which the 
member is a part, we have been in the process of attempting to find 
a realistic way of obtaining the views of parliamentarians who are 
interested in the question of peacekeeping to provide good, timely 
and sound advice to the government on the question of renewal of 
peacekeeping missions and on the question of new peacekeeping 
missions.
<P>
	In addition to that, we have been attempting to say that somehow 
because the debate occurs near the end of a given mission on the 
question of renewing that mission there has been no work done to 
bring the issue to the stage at which it is brought for debate is again 
a false presumption.
<P>
	As the member knows, in dealing with issues that give rise to 
peacekeeping missions the international environment is changing 
all the time. At some point, with the facts at our disposal it is 
appropriate to have a discussion to get reasonable advice from 
members of Parliament on all sides of the House. That is what this 
government has been attempting to do, particularly the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, using the resources of Parliament.
<P>
	This continues to be the policy of this government and it will 
continue to be the policy of this government. Whenever possible 
and necessary, the House's opinion will be sought prior to 
Canadian troops being sent overseas.
<P>
	In the international context, however, the Government of Canada 
must be able to act. More important, the government must be able 
to act quickly. This requires flexibility. Canada has been at the 
forefront of international peacekeeping policy for the past 40 years.
<P>
	At the 50th United Nations general assembly in 1995, the 
previous minister of foreign affairs, the hon. Andre Ouellet, 
presented the Canadian study toward a rapid reaction capability for 
the United Nations.
<P>
	It recognized that a faster response by the United Nations in 
times of crisis was required in today's world. The UN cannot act 
without the support of leading peacekeeping nations such as 
Canada.
<P>
	This motion establishes a rigid process and risks tying the hands 
of the Government of Canada when the international community 
seeks our assistance. It does not recognize that each peacekeeping 
mission is distinct and must be treated as such.
<P>
	It does not recognize the importance that Canadians and the 
international community place in our peacekeepers. Because of 
that, the motion does not receive the support of this government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In normal circumstances, when a peacekeeping mission is being 
launched, reviewed or renewed, debate is encouraged, and the 
House is asked to support the initiative. However, there may be 
exceptional cases in the future in which time is of the essence. It 
may be necessary to react quickly in order to avert a disaster.
<P>
	In these conditions, the government cannot be slowed down by a 
bill requiring a vote in the House before Canadian troops can be 
deployed. The government must be able to quickly send Canadian 
troops where they are needed. A requirement to hold a vote in the 
House would prevent the government from doing its duty. This 
could take time we do not have in these situations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The face of peacekeeping and peace operations in general is 
changing. The world community does not always wait for a stable 
environment before intervening.
<P>
	The United Nations and other international bodies now act to 
prevent conflicts from starting and to keep them from spreading. 
They deploy troops while fighting continues when there is no peace 
to keep. The focus is now on action rather than reaction. In order to 
fulfil its role as a pre-eminent peacekeeper, Canada must be able to 
act quickly and decisively when asked to do so. A conflict can 
escalate in a matter of weeks if not days. A ceasefire can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5634"> 5634 </A></B>
<P>
deteriorate or a town can be destroyed. The intervention of 
peacekeeping troops can help to prevent a situation from 
disintegrating into a tragedy.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We hope the world learned valuable lessons from peacekeeping 
operations like the one in Rwanda. It is no longer possible to stand 
back and do nothing. We must step in to avert a tragedy before the 
situation gets out of hand. Waiting for order to be restored in an 
area is no longer a viable solution.
<P>
	Peacekeepers must sometimes be deployed somewhere on very 
short notice. If the situation is dangerous, they are asked to stop 
violence while it is occurring or before it starts and not after the 
harm has been done. We must respond to the horror of ethnic 
massacres with vigorous measures. Canada must play its part in 
helping to maintain the safety and security we as a people value so 
much.
<P>
	This motion would prevent Canada from taking action. Our 
peacekeepers are considered to be among the best in the world. 
That is why the international community relies on Canada to 
participate in almost every UN mission. The word ``Canadian'' has 
become synonymous with peacekeeper. One of our Prime 
Ministers, the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson, was awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize for coming up with the concept of peacekeeping. 
In 1988, the peacekeepers themselves received a medal in 
recognition of their services.
<P>
	If we cannot respond to UN calls for help, other countries will 
start questioning Canada's commitment to this organization, and 
therefore its relevance as a peacekeeping tool.
<P>
	If we chose to ignore the United Nations' demands, then many 
other countries will question the confidence they have put in this 
organization. We must not let this happen. When the UN and the 
international community call, we must answer. We must be able to 
react on very short notice, if required.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Peacekeepers have taken on more aggressive roles in peace 
enforcement but they have also accepted the hat of humanitarian 
relief workers. Not only do United Nations soldiers separate 
warring parties, now they must also feed, shelter and protect the 
civilian populations.
<P>
	A prime example of this is the new Disaster Assistance Response 
Team, DART. It is designed to begin the deployment of its 180 
members to a humanitarian disaster within 48 hours. The team will 
provide the infrastructure necessary for UN organizations or 
non-governmental organizations to follow in the coming weeks. In 
the interim, DART will provide medical and structural support for 
the surrounding community.
<P>
	This could not happen if there was a postponement due to a 
required debate within the House. A situation  could decay just as 
rapidly in a humanitarian emergency as it can in times of armed 
conflict. The delay could cost the lives of hundreds of innocent 
people. It could even make deploying the force impossible.
<P>
	If they had arrived according to schedule, then the force may 
avert further disaster. Canada must be in a position to stop a 
tragedy from developing. If we are capable of doing this let us not 
be entangled by unnecessary legislative requirements when people 
are dying. Let us not create reasons why we cannot help those who 
need our assistance in order to survive. Let us not antagonize and 
shame the Canadian people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada would lose its status as a leader among countries 
providing peacekeeping troops if it could not react when the help of 
Canadian men and women is requested. Last year, Canada released 
a study entitled ``Towards a Rapid Reaction Capability for the 
United Nations''.
<P>
	We have seen in the past that reacting quickly is a must in a crisis 
situation. With this report, Canada is now providing a model for the 
future.
<P>
	I realize that my speaking time is up. I will therefore wrap up 
quickly. The government agrees that a debate on our commitments 
should be held either in this House or before the Parliament of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	It is quite another story to ask that there be a vote before Canada 
can make any commitment, every time Canada makes a 
commitment, for the reasons I stated in my remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
going to speak to Motion M-31 introduced by the Reform Party 
member, the purpose of which is to give Parliamentarians a greater 
voice when Canada sends soldiers to take part in United Nations 
peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	It is very laudable to give Parliament a greater say in these 
decisions. Nonetheless, there are some changes we would like to 
see made to the proposal. As for the substance of this proposal, I 
think it is desirable to involve parliamentarians in debates of this 
importance.
<P>
	We know that, on a number of occasions, this has already 
happened. Emergency debates have been held to back decisions 
which, in some cases, had been taken, or were to be taken, to send 
Canadian soldiers to take part in peacekeeping operations. At the 
conclusion of my speech, I will propose an amendment to this 
proposal.
<P>
	Many people in our ridings and in our families have a connection 
with the armed forces; we all have such people in our ridings. Some 
members have military bases or other military installations in their 
ridings. The number of people involved in the military across the 
country is large. In debates such as these, therefore, we can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5635"> 5635 </A></B>
<P>
represent our constituents, who share with us their views and 
opinions when we see them at various events and meetings.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has already made its views on this subject 
known in its dissenting report on Canada's foreign policy, tabled in 
November 1994 after the election. I am going to read you parts of 
this report. The last paragraph deals specifically with the subject of 
the motion put by the member of the Reform Party.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois said that ``it considers that one of the 
primary roles of the Canadian Forces on the international scene 
must be to support peacekeeping operations by taking an active 
part in them. Canada's willingness to help keep the peace is one of 
its most important attributes and a major international 
achievement. However, in the future Canada will have to define 
more precise criteria for its interventions.
<P>
	The costs and complexity of intervention will require a new 
attitude on the part of the international community: the events in 
Rwanda and Bosnia are eloquent evidence of this. Canada must 
learn from the experience of all these peacekeeping missions. The 
recent case of Haiti is a reminder of the need to base our 
intervention on democratic legitimacy and rigorous planning. In 
the future, mission objectives and orders will have to be carefully 
established, under the aegis of the United Nations''. I continue: 
``Although in agreement with the majority report's 
recommendation on the necessity of giving the Canadian Forces a 
special configuration, since the credibility of our intervention 
depends on this, the Bloc Quebecois wishes to spell out the 
direction that Canada should take in this area. First, we think that 
Canada should rethink its current military alliances-NATO and 
NORAD-so that their strategic missions reflect the UN's needs''.
<P>
	``This approach would bring new vitality to these organizations 
and update their usefulness in security maintenance and conflict 
resolution, while enabling Canada to achieve the collective security 
goals that are crucial for its own territorial security. In addition, we 
consider that Canada should encourage the setting- up of a 
permanent contingent available to the UN for its peacekeeping 
missions abroad. We further think that Canada should set a ceiling 
on the human resources it is prepared to devote to peacekeeping. 
For example, it could limit the number of military personnel 
committed to peacekeeping missions at any one time to a 
maximum of 2,000 to 2,500''.
<P>
	This is what we said earlier. There are now close to 2,000 
Canadian peacekeepers abroad. These soldiers are generally sent 
on a mission for a six-month mandate, so there is a rotation.
<P>
	We concluded as follows: ``And lastly, Canada should submit 
any decision to participate in peacekeeping missions to a vote in 
the House of Commons, as rapidly as possible, where time 
allows''.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	That is the context in which we want to propose an amendment. I 
want to say here that peacekeeping is currently one of the main 
areas of activity of our armed forces. I do not think that anyone is 
under the impression that, overnight, Canada will be facing any 
threat of invasion. Our role, as a country, is therefore much more to 
provide personnel to contribute to the peacekeeping and 
peacemaking effort around the world.
<P>
	In fact, any review of DND activities should always be carried 
out in a similar frame of mind, looking to allocate a larger portion 
of the budget to peacekeeping missions, which are important 
missions, while at the same time assuming a role that may be very 
useful at home and in terms of operations of a more civilian nature. 
That being said, savings could certainly be made by managing 
along these lines.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois policy, as set out in this report, has not 
changed. A number of options are discussed as far as possible 
positions regarding UN missions.
<P>
	As for the amendment, I would like to point out that, in its 
present form, it refers to a number of peacekeepers. A figure like 
100 is rather restrictive. The opportunity of this figure could be 
questioned. It is always difficult to set an arbitrary number. The 
other question is: what would we do in the event of a major crisis, a 
crisis erupting somewhere on the international scene, in any given 
country, on July 31, August 2 or December 27? According to the 
wording of the other motion, we would have to call an emergency 
session of Parliament, with the delays that would entail.
<P>
	To ensure that a decision may be made in any event, and later 
approved by Parliament, we will submit in a moment an 
amendment introducing a degree of flexibility in the process, while 
ensuring however that, should this occur, if the government 
decided to send troops and contribute to a peacekeeping force over 
the summer or any other time when the House is in recess, 
immediately upon its return, the decision would be put to a vote in 
Parliament.
<P>
	You will tell me: ``Yes, but the personnel have already been 
sent''. Even so, if Parliament decided that it was not necessary, we 
could go back on the decision and not renew the mandate at the end 
of the six month term, or withdraw the peacekeepers, not 
immediately of course, because replacements would have to be 
found, and we do have commitments to honour within the United 
Nations.
<P>
	So that would influence matters somewhat. It would mean a 
public debate could be held on the subject, people from various 
sectors could express their points of view, and if the government, in 
the view of the opposition parties, had not made the right decision, 
this would be the time to say so. But it would allow more 
flexibility, it would not have the disadvantage of having to
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5636"> 5636 </A></B>
<P>
convene an emergency session of Parliament. That is why our 
amendment will introduce a little more flexibility in this regard.
<P>
	I would like to say, while I am on the topic, however, that I 
would like to see our troops receive more training before being sent 
outside the country, so that they will have a better understanding of 
the stakes involved, which are often political, economic or social, 
in order to be able to represent us with dignity.
<P>
	Many people have done extraordinary things during their 
posting. It only takes a few unfortunate incidents like those in 
Somalia, for example, or elsewhere to ruin the reputation it has 
taken years to build. We must therefore step up our efforts to train 
these people before they set out, to ensure that they have a clear 
understanding of the work they will be doing, and that they 
represent us well. I think we have some way to go, and we must 
avoid any more events like those that took place in Somalia.
<P>
	In conclusion, I propose as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``all'' and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``projects of military commitments abroad involving Canadian troops must, as soon 
as possible, be the subject of a vote in the House in order to recommend their 
approval or rejection to the government''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This would satisfy the objectives I have just mentioned. I would 
like to table this amendment.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This amendment is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I see we have about 18 minutes left. It is my intention to 
recognize the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands and the hon. 
member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak to Motion No. M-31 which would give 
members of Parliament the opportunity to register their 
constituents' approval or disapproval of Canadian involvement in 
major peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	I am astounded and I wonder which planet the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs has been living on 
when he makes remarks about how this motion would preclude 
Canada from acting rapidly in response to a situation. When pray 
tell has he ever seen the UN operate with such speed?
<P>
	Furthermore, I was astounded to hear the member from the Bloc 
asking what if it is on Boxing Day or what if it is on New Year's 
Day? When we are sending real live red-blooded Canadians into a 
harmful situation, putting them in danger, surely it is the 
responsibility of the people in this House to be able to respond and 
come  back no matter when it is, in the middle of summer or 
whenever. It is our responsibility to come back here and debate 
whether or not it is appropriate to send our people to that 
deployment. Surely holidays should not enter into it. Input from 
parliamentarians is required if they are to fulfil their obligations to 
Canada, to the Canadian forces and to their constituents.
<P>
	The people in the Canadian forces are the only ones in our 
society who are committed to laying down their lives on order 
when they are in a combat situation. No one else is required to do 
that. We are obligated to take account of that and ensure that when 
we send them somewhere, it is appropriate that they go there, that 
they are properly equipped and so on.
<P>
	I will provide examples of mistakes. Look at when we sent our 
forces to UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslavia. What was the 
mandate? Nobody knew. How were they equipped? Inadequately. 
We know that. How did they exist there? Very very poorly. They 
were stranded. They were held hostage. Everything was wrong with 
that mission, yet there is no question they did magnificently under 
the situation, under the conditions that were imposed. But we did 
not do our homework when we sent them there.
<P>
	How many Canadians are aware that when we sent our troops to 
Somalia they did not go as peacekeepers, they went as 
peacemakers? They were to restore order there. At the time that 
land was inhabited by warlords who drove around in jeeps and 
other vehicles equipped with big machine guns. They attacked 
anybody they could to take away their supplies and goods. Our 
people went there to restore order and they did a good job of it.
<P>
	When we deploy our troops overseas, what items do we need to 
discuss, to approve and disapprove? First we need to find out what 
the problem is. What has caused the situation to arise? What is 
needed to resolve it? What sort of force is required to take action on 
it? What action has already been taken? What have they tried? Has 
it worked or not? Has it partially worked?
<P>
	Is there a willingness on the part of the people who are in the 
situation to resolve the situation? Do they want to achieve a 
peaceful solution? Are peacekeepers in general welcome? Do they 
want somebody to intrude into their affairs to try to rectify the 
problem or cool it down? More important for Canadians, are 
Canadian peacekeepers welcome? Would they be the ones who 
would be welcomed in to try to resolve the situation?
<P>
	Next we would want to know the composition of the force. How 
big is it? How is it to be equipped? What skills should that force 
have to accomplish the mission? Are the Canadian forces able to 
accept this commitment within their present restrictions and 
resources? Do they have the right personnel? Do they have enough 
personnel? Do they have the proper equipment? If they do not, we 
have no business sending them into that area.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5637"> 5637 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	We should also know how many and what other nations are 
involved. What sort of involvement do they have? How may troops 
are they sending?
<P>
	What is the command and control? This is one of the most vitally 
important things we have to resolve before we commit Canadian 
troops to an action. How are they going to be commanded? Who is 
in charge? And what recourse do we have to that command and 
control centre? What are the logistics? Who is looking after 
providing the requirements to keep our troops active and mobile in 
the field?
<P>
	When is the force to be there? How soon does it have to arrive 
and once it is there, how long is it to be committed? Do we know 
exactly what it is our troops are being asked to do? Do we have a 
very clear idea of what it is they must do to resolve the situation? 
Because if they do not, then we should not be sending them there. It 
is something we should be deciding in the House.
<P>
	If they are deployed under UN auspices, what access does 
Canada have to influence the decisions that are made with regard to 
things involving our troops? Does Canada have the right to 
approach the security council or whoever is in charge to ensure that 
Canadian interests are addressed? If they do not, I do not think we 
should approve it. We should say: ``No way''. If we are sending our 
troops down there, we should have a right to involve ourselves in 
what is being decided for them.
<P>
	One of the most important things is the rules of engagement. 
What amount of force are our people allowed to use? Under what 
circumstances can they use it? What are the rules governing the 
whole deployment? Are they adequate? If they are not, again we 
have to say that is not good enough, that we need better for our 
troops.
<P>
	Because of our debt situation obviously we have to be conscious 
of the cost. We have to know how much it is going to cost. It is also 
important that we find out who is going to bear the cost. If it is to be 
paid for by Canada, which ministry is going to pay for it? Would it 
be defence? Defence gets hit pretty often. Should it be foreign 
affairs? Is there another agency that should be contributing to this?
<P>
	What about the other people who are involved? What are they 
contributing, not only by way of forces but in support, in money? 
Are they assisting Canada? Are they supporting Canada, or is 
Canada paying for a disproportionate amount of the involvement in 
the deployment?
<P>
	MPs are obligated to know the facts. We should discuss them and 
we should be willing to come to this place at short notice any time 
that we are contemplating deploying Canadians into a dangerous 
situation. I believe that in such a situation it should be a 
non-partisan decision. The parties should not be involved in it. 
Obviously, the government has to take the final decision, but the 
government should listen to what is going on.
<P>
	The debates we have had until now have been meaningless with 
no votes. They have been very, very close. In one case, two days 
before the mission was to be renewed, we were debating it here in 
the House and there was no vote at the end of it. Obviously, the 
decision had been taken before that debate took place. This is not 
appropriate nor adequate.
<P>
	I believe, if my memory serves me correctly, the IFOR mission 
in Yugoslavia is up for renewal on December 20 this year. So far we 
have had no sign that there will be any sort of a meaningful 
parliamentary debate on whether to renew that commitment or not. 
It seems that since we are approaching the end of October we 
should be debating that. It is not fair to the people who are 
committed there for us to say at the last minute that we are not 
going to play. Surely to gosh we should give them a couple of 
weeks' or at least one month's notice that Canada unfortunately 
will not be able to continue with it.
<P>
	In this aspect perhaps at the moment our army troops have been 
over committed to a number of things. Serious consideration 
should be given to making the Canadian support to IFOR an air 
support, a fighter squadron. This would be meaningful and would 
have a lot of punch. It would give the army time to regroup, to 
recover, to get back into training and to establish relations again 
with their families.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	If this Parliament does not have the intelligence, the capability 
and the moral courage to address this situation, then it is a lot less 
of an establishment than I believe it to be. This motion should pass.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking to this motion today, I begin by 
pointing out that what this motion offers is in absolute keeping with 
the Canadian peacekeeping policy process. In fact it supports the 
philosophy which guides our present policy.
<P>
	It has been and will continue to be the policy of this government 
to bring before this House all issues relating to peacekeeping. 
When it has been possible and necessary, that is exactly what this 
government has done. We recognize the importance of full and free 
discussion of any proposed deployment of Canadian forces 
personnel and we attach great value to the opinion which this 
House has to offer.
<P>
	It is for these reasons this government has endeavoured to allow 
for the debate of Canada's peacekeeping commitments at every 
opportunity. Therefore the apparent objective of this motion to 
generate discussion and debate of Canada's peacekeeping 
commitments has already been accomplished by this government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5638"> 5638 </A></B>
<P>
	I note here that we have heard a lot about non-partisan debate 
from the Reform Party spokespeople tonight. In this House, 
foreign affairs used to be quite non-debatable and people came 
to a consensus. It is rather ironic that the spokespersons for the 
Reform Party were on their feet asking for non-partisanship and 
at the same time were castigating Liberals in past debates in this 
House.
<P>
	Motion No. M-31 calls for a free vote in the House. Our 
government is derived from the system in Great Britain, the mother 
of Parliaments. It is called responsible government. Under our 
parliamentary system responsible government means that the 
government of the day must make the decisions. Decisions have to 
be made and sometimes as has been stated they have to be made 
quickly.
<P>
	We cannot compare this with the way the United Nations makes 
decisions because we are in the throes of trying to upgrade and 
modernize the United Nations and streamline its procedures and 
that is the right way to go. The way debates are handled in this 
House, decisions on foreign affairs or any other major events have 
to be made by a responsible government in the long run. That 
government is the one that has to live with the decisions.
<P>
	While we are talking about peacekeeping, peacemaking and 
what should be done in Parliament prior to a force going wherever 
to smooth things out, let me emphasize to the greatest degree the 
appreciation we should have as Canadians for the members of the 
Canadian forces who go out and do Canada proud around the 
world. Canadians respond responsibly. Yes there have been a few 
hiccups along the way, but the hiccups totally disappear when we 
consider the positive contribution our Canadian forces have made 
to world affairs and indeed right here at home when disasters occur.
<P>
	Think back to World War I and World War II and how Canada 
acted. Why did Canada act? Because there was no United Nations 
to bring countries together to make decisions. Everybody was 
drifting off in their own direction and we drifted into World War I 
and we drifted into World War II. That is why at the end of World 
War II the UN was founded. Then when the communists started 
becoming more and more aggressive during the cold war period of 
the late 1940s, NATO was established, another group of nations 
coming together for help. That did not exist in the earlier days.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Korea, the first test of the United Nations peacekeeping, was a 
very successful test in that the United Nations forced the North 
Koreans back to the 38th parallel.
<P>
	Canada took part in the Persian Gulf war. It has been into 
peacekeeping and peacemaking of all kinds over the years. Then 
there is aid to the civilian power by our Canadian forces.
<P>
	I want to say here what a debt we owe to those Canadian forces 
who participated in aid to the civilian power during the Saguenay 
River disaster. The words of a person who lost their home, lost 
everything, when he came up to the Prime Minister in the Saguenay 
area when he visited there were: ``Mr. Prime Minister, the 
Canadian forces have been with us since day one. We don't know 
what we would have done without them. They have been 
marvellous''.
<P>
	When we see all this hype about Canadian forces today and all 
the negative things occurring, let us give those men and women out 
there a pat on the back. Let us tell them that Canadians should be 
giving them the credit they deserve for the wonderful work they are 
doing. The other problems go into insignificance.
<P>
	Those young families sitting out there tonight may be watching 
this debate. They have to be thanked, the rank and file of the 
Canadian Armed Forces who are the very basis of what we are 
talking about today.
<P>
	Just to back up what I have been saying, the recent event that 
supposedly occurred in Hungary with four Canadian soldiers, 
remember the headlines the first day: ``Canadian soldiers assaulted 
couple, Hungary police say'', headlines in a Hungarian newspaper.
<P>
	After the investigation was made, they found that reports of 
Canadian soldiers attacking a Hungarian civilian and his girl friend 
were exaggerated, as Hungarian journalists in the Canadian 
military now say.
<P>
	In fact, information indicates that one of the Canadians was 
himself beaten up in a street fight. Then the editor of the largest 
Budapest daily newspaper said Monday that the story his paper 
published on the weekend was not entirely accurate.
<P>
	I want to thank the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> for correcting that story. 
While we castigate the media, when it does admit a mistake and 
comes forward and corrects a story, it deserves our thanks as well.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that while we are sending our Canadian 
troops into all areas of the world, into all kinds of different 
cultures, different languages, different geographical conditions, 
different transportation conditions to do a job, for heaven's sake, 
let the rest of us here at home get behind the spirit of the Canadian 
forces and give them the boost they deserve.
<P>
	They are an institution of this country, and a proud one. I want to 
underscore that tonight while I am on my feet. This country since 
the very conception of peacekeeping has been an international 
leader in the field.
<P>
	Canada's pre-eminence in peacekeeping has resulted from a 
willingness to act in times of crisis. Indeed it has been our 
willingness to become involved and our ability to do so quickly 
that has won us the acclaim and admiration of the entire 
international community.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5639"> 5639 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not to say that this government opposes debate. On the 
contrary, we recognize that debate is essential, especially when 
the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces may be put 
in harm's way.
<P>
	Debate on important peacekeeping issues is crucial and the 
opinion of this House is valued.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	That is where this government stands. We have had debates on 
these issues in the past. There will continue to be debates in the 
House, but I want to underscore that it is the government of the day 
that must make the final decision. It is the one which is going to be 
held accountable, so it will make the decision. If we are going to 
have responsible democracy in Canada we have to have a 
responsible government. That means that members of the 
government respect the government which they support.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BOSNIANELECTIONS">BOSNIAN ELECTIONS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to rise this evening to raise again a question which I originally 
raised with the Minister of Foreign Affairs respecting the role of 
our election supervisors or election observers in Bosnia.
<P>
	At that time I asked the minister if he would be good enough to 
respond to the concerns which Canadians had as to what the role of 
our observers actually was in an election of that nature and the 
response was given by the Secretary of State for Latin America and 
Africa. She pointed out the important role that our observers have 
played in that particular community.
<P>
	In following this up tonight I think it is worth reminding 
members of the House and members of the public of the very 
important role that our observers play in local elections. I have not 
had an opportunity to do this, but as chairman of the foreign affairs 
committee I get regular reports on this form of activity and have 
often had the opportunity to observe the role that Canadian 
parliamentarians and others have played not only in Bosnia but in 
Nicaragua, in Palestine and in many other countries where there are 
really serious concerns about the credibility of the election process.
<P>
	It is appropriate that my opportunity to follow up on this issue 
comes this evening on the heels of the debate which has taken place 
on peacekeeping. In many ways the role that our observers play in 
this type of activity is very similar to the role that our troops play in 
peacekeeping. They are there to ensure the credibility of the 
democratic process. They are there to ensure that peace will be 
maintained in the region because there will be elections which will 
replace the need for violence.
<P>
	This is an extraordinarily important process and it is important 
for us to be assured by the ministry that our observers are actually 
performing the role which they are called upon to do and are able to 
do it.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary for the minister if he would be 
good enough to elaborate on the role that our observers play. I 
would like him to tell us what the prospects are for peace, 
particularly in Bosnia, in the former Yugoslavia, now that these 
elections have been held. What can we see from the fruits of all the 
labours of our observers and peacekeepers? What can the 
parliamentary secretary tell us about the present prospects?
<P>
	In particular, I would ask him if he is able to comment on a 
recent suggestion by the president of the war crimes tribunal, 
which is seeking to bring to justice potential war criminals in the 
former Yugoslavia. The president of that tribunal has actually gone 
so far as to say that he is considering resigning from his post. He is 
concerned about the integrity of the process of that tribunal because 
of its failure to actually bring before the tribunal many of the 
accused. Some 74 persons have been accused and only seven 
people have been arraigned before the tribunal because many of the 
accused are still in the former Yugoslavia, still unassailable, still 
inaccessible and cannot be brought to justice.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to invite the parliamentary 
secretary to elaborate some more on the answer which was given 
before and assure the House that the role of our observers is an 
important one, that they have achieved success in the former 
Yugoslavia and that there is now ongoing opportunity for peace in 
that region, including justice to be served by the international 
tribunal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Rosedale for his interest in this issue.
<P>
	Indeed Canada can be proud of its key contribution to the 
technical organization to the elections that were held in Bosnia on 
September 14. Voting took place in a positive, non-violent fashion, 
free of systematic obstruction. The elections constituted an 
essential and reasonably democratic first step toward institution 
building and democratization in Bosnia.
<P>
	Twenty-two Canadian electoral experts were seconded to the 
OSCE mission in Bosnia, many in senior positions.  Canada also 
contributed to the larger international effort to supervise and 
observe the elections in Bosnia. We provided to the OSCE 15 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5640"> 5640 </A></B>
<P>
election supervisors and 30 election observers. Another 32 
Canadians engaged with the UN also helped supervise the 
elections.
<P>
	Mr. Izatbegovic has been confirmed as the chair of the new 
three-person presidency of Bosnia. We congratulate all three 
members of the new presidency and encourage them to move 
quickly once the other election results are confirmed to put in place 
the common institutions established by the Dayton peace 
agreement and to implement all aspects of the agreement.
<P>
	Canada is committed to helping the parties face the enormous 
challenge of this post-election consolidation period. We will do so 
through our engagement in the peace implementation process, our 
IFOR contribution and through our reconstruction program in the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Canada participates fully in international efforts to ensure a 
lasting peace to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and to 
provide relief to its victims. Since the signing of the peace 
agreement for Bosnia and Hercegovina and the agreement on the 
peaceful reintegration of Serb controlled territory in Croatia, 
Canada has focused its efforts on promoting security as well as 
social and economic rehabilitation.
<P>
	Since January 1996 Canada has maintained about 1,000 troops in 
Bosnia and Hercegovina as part of the NATO led peace 
implementation force, IFOR.
<P>
	Canada's humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflicts 
amounted to over $65 million between 1991 and 1995. These funds 
purchased and delivered food, medical supplies, clothing and 
shelter. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for 
International Co-operation announced in April 1996 that Canadian 
reconstruction assistance would total up to $40 million this year.
<P>
	Finally, on the issue of war crimes, Canada has consistently led 
and supported efforts to investigate and prosecute cases involving 
war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to follow up on a question that I asked in this House 
in late September prior to a meeting of federal and provincial 
finance ministers on the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	I urged the government at that time not to rush into changes to 
the Canada pension plan but rather to take the time to consult 
seriously and study more carefully the impact of its regressive 
proposals and look at progressive changes to the CPP instead of 
hitting the most vulnerable beneficiaries of the system.
<P>
	Many Canadians believe that the CPP is in a state of crisis, that it 
will soon be bankrupt. Nothing could be further from the truth. The 
CPP was established in 1966 as a publicly administered socially 
insurance program. It is funded entirely by contributions from 
employers and employees. There is no government funding. It has 
had a significant impact on reducing poverty among the elderly. It 
is a pay as you go plan which has been strongly endorsed by the 
chief actuary of Canada who says: ``It provides all the flexibility 
needed to avoid bankruptcy''.
<P>
	Because of the weak economy and the high levels of 
unemployment and bankruptcy the level of contributions has been 
lower than anticipated and disability claims up to 1994 were 
higher, although since then they have dropped dramatically. Thus 
there is certainly a need to readjust the level of contributions from 
both employers and employees to ensure future viability. This 
review process is built already into the CPP.
<P>
	Instead of looking at how we can strengthen and improve the 
CPP, in particular to enhance the level of benefits of the lowest 
income seniors, the Liberal government aided and abetted by the 
Reform Party and its right wing allies in the Fraser Institute and the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> is laying the groundwork to attack the fundamental 
principles of the CPP.
<P>
<B>(1915 )</B>
<P>
	In February, the Liberals issued a so-called information paper. It 
was full of distortion and inaccuracies. It ignored some proposals 
for improving the CPP and took as a given that benefits must be 
cut. Indeed, the Liberal MP for Winnipeg North Centre, who 
chaired the rushed consultations, suggested that current benefits be 
cut for CPP beneficiaries. There was absolutely no analysis of the 
disproportionate impact of the proposed cuts on women despite 
evidence that it would be women who would be most hurt.
<P>
	The Reform Party has suggested that we abolish the CPP and 
instead adopt the model proposed by Chilean dictator Augusto 
Pinochet: individual private RRSPs for everyone. This would 
destroy income security for millions of elderly Canadians and 
eliminate the many advantages of the CPP.
<P>
	I urge the government to stop this rush to weaken the CPP and 
instead examine ways that public pensions can be strengthened. 
This is all the more important when an increasing number of 
Canadians are working at part time, temporary and contractual 
labour with no workplace pensions. Certainly RRSPs are not the 
answer. Too many Canadians simply cannot afford to save and 
more and more are cashing them in.
<P>
	The New Democrat governments of B.C. and Saskatchewan 
have opposed cuts in benefits and have suggested that along with a 
modest increase in contributions, the federal and provincial gov-
<P>

<B><A NAME="5641"> 5641 </A></B>
<P>
ernments consider increasing the maximum level of earnings  
subject to contributions. This has also been proposed by the 
National Council on Welfare.
<P>
	Finally, I want to urge the government to listen with care to 
people with disabilities and their spokespeople. They are deeply 
concerned about the impact of cuts in federal transfer payments, 
the elimination of the Canada assistance plan and the impact that 
has on disability programs. There are already totally unacceptable 
lengthy delays in adjudication of Canada pension plan disability 
claims. We understand that there may be even more cuts in the 
number of officers working in this area. Some individuals, 
including those with fibromyalgia, complain of serious problems in 
the present process.
<P>
	Therefore, let no one suggest that disability programs under the 
CPP be weakened or cut. People with disabilities are too often 
already living below the poverty line.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the Liberal government to strengthen the 
Canada pension plan and reinforce its basic principles instead of 
heeding the right wing voices that would destroy it. As well, the 
government should help to educate Canadians about the strengths 
of the CPP and help to rebut the distortions and myths that have 
given rise to a lack of confidence in the future viability of the plan.
<P>
	Canadian seniors have sacrificed much for my generation 
through the depression and two world wars. They deserve dignity 
in retirement. They deserve economic security. I trust that will be 
the objective of the review of the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his question. Unfortunately, he is a little bit misinformed.
<P>
	The federal government is certainly not trying to push through a 
package of cuts to the CPP. It is not trying to destroy the CPP but 
rather make sure it is there for all of us.
<P>
	Responsibility for the CPP is shared among the provinces and 
the federal government. Changes to the CPP require the agreement 
of two-thirds of the provinces with two-thirds of the population.
<P>
	The government has been working with the provinces to find 
balanced changes which both provinces and the federal government 
can accept to ensure that the CPP is fair and sustainable for current 
and future generations.
<P>
	The hon. member also alleges that the federal government has 
not consulted with Canadians on the CPP. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. The government and all provinces agreed to a 
consultation paper which was released last February.
<P>
	The federal government and all provinces held extensive 
consultations across the country from mid-April to mid-June. The 
federal government and all provinces released a report on the 
consultations in June.
<P>
	It may be that the hon. member has not read the report and is not 
aware of what ordinary Canadians think of the CPP. The federal 
government is continuing to work to find a package of balanced 
changes which all provinces, including British Columbia and 
Saskatchewan, can accept. The goal is sustainability and fairness, 
listening to Canadians' concerns about the CPP and responding 
with a package of changes that ensure it is there for all of us.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 11 I 
asked the Minister of Transport, considering the increase in the 
number of railway-related incidents and accidents in Canada, for a 
moratorium on the closure of one of the three track maintenance 
shops operated by CN in Charny, in my riding.
<P>
	In his answer, the Minister of Transport said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are from time to time minor variations among all provinces but essentially 
when we look at accidents in the various categories in which they are analyzed, there 
has been a slight increase in some of the derailments but not at all untoward and 
certainly not out of the ordinary with respect to the normal variation statistics.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hope this intervention produced some results, since last week I 
was told that CN had decided to extend the closure date. It will now 
be November 30 instead of October 30. I had hoped for a longer 
postponement, but still, a month is better than nothing.
<P>
	I did not want to let that pass. One question during Oral Question 
Period is not much. I wanted to explain why, and I had read an 
article published in <I>Le Soleil</I> on August 15, which said: ``A 50 per 
cent increase in derailments in Canada during the first seven 
months of 1996: from 97 in 1995, their number has now reached 
146. For the month of July alone, they more than doubled, from 9 
to 20''.
<P>
	I would like to give you some more statistics, since I have a few 
minutes left. For instance, the number of serious injuries as a result 
of accidents in 1995 was 40, but the annual average during the five 
previous years was 24. In 1995, the number of deaths caused by 
accidents was 87, while before it was 73. The total number of 
accidents for the last five years has gone up from 632 to 770.
<P>
	I hardly need recall the figures given by <I>Le Soleil</I> on the number 
of accidents on the main lines, a main line that goes as far as the 
Maritimes, where accidents increased by more than 50 per cent.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5642"> 5642 </A></B>
<P>
	These figures were not produced by an outside office but by 
the railway safety service of the Department of Transport, which 
is the minister's responsibility.
<P>
	This is not the first time I put this question to the minister. I had 
done so before, on June 12. And now, months later, after the 
summer recess, and despite the statistics and what we read in the 
newspapers, the minister answers: ``These variations are not 
important''. We are talking about 50 per cent, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis Gerard LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
respond on behalf of the Minister of Transport to what was said by 
the hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
	The decision by CN to close the Joffre Shop, which is 
responsible for track maintenance equipment repair and overhaul is 
a business decision and is not related to safety. Transport Canada 
cannot examine every business decision made by a private 
company.
<P>
	The relocation of the shop in Charny will have no impact on 
safety. The shop was responsible for the overhaul of track 
maintenance equipment. Equipment overhaul schedules have been 
modified to provide for more frequent light maintenance during 
operations instead of a complete overhaul. The location of the shop 
responsible for general overhaul has no impact on track 
maintenance itself. CN has announced that the shop will close on 
November 30, 1996.
<P>
	For 1996, the cumulative statistics as of September 30, the most 
recent figures on main line accidents produced by the 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada, show a drop in the total 
number of accidents in Quebec and New Brunswick.
<P>
	This fact is corroborated by the figures of Canadian National, 
according to which the Champlain district, which covers Quebec 
and the Maritimes, is the only district where the ratio of main line 
accidents has dropped between 1995 and 1996. Track maintenance, 
which is essential to safe operations, will continue with equipment 
that is always in good condition. Transport Canada works together 
with the railways in order to provide Canadians with the highest 
possible level of railway safety.
<P>
	Transport Canada railway safety officers monitor railway and 
track maintenance operations, equipment and level crossings to 
guarantee the safety of our railways. The Railway Safety Act 
authorizes them to restrict railway operations if they discover 
unsafe conditions and to impose fines on companies in case of 
violations.
<P>

House is deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
