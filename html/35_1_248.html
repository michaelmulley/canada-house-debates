tremendous pride in representing my community, and the petition I 
am presenting is one of the reasons. It was organized by Mr. Jakeet 
Singh, a student at Waterloo collegiate. A year ago a couple of 
students at WCI decided that with the referendum approaching the

country remain united.

<P>
	The petitioners request that in memory of Dawn Shaw, a six-year 
old girl who was murdered in my riding of Comox-Alberni, this 
petition be brought to the attention of Parliament.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament enact legislation to 
change the justice system to provide greater protection for children 
from sexual assault and to ensure the conviction of offenders.

Edward Island's national parks. These petitioners feel they have 
contributed their share to the economy over the years and enter the 
parks for sightseeing only and do not use any of the other services

Canadians from Uxbridge, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession that has not been recognized for its value to our society. 
They also state the Income Tax Act discriminates against families 
that make the choice to provide care in the home to preschool 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

people calling on Parliament to recognize that Canada recognizes 
two official languages but that our flag does not reflect this duality. 
Being only red and white it does not reflect the blue that has 
traditionally represented the French speaking population.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The petitioners are asking Parliament to legislate in order to get 
discussions underway on the renewal of our national emblem to 
include blue bands within the red borders to symbolize Canada's 
distinct francophone society and promote unity and harmony 
within the country. This addition would enhance the beauty of our 
flag.

who signed a unity scroll that originated with Mr. Norm Lalonde of 
Cornwall and several volunteers who have contributed many hours 
of their time to ask Canadians to sign this unity scroll.
<P>
	These petitioners draw to the attention of the House their belief 
that all Canadians want the same from life in Canada and that 
Canadians want the opportunity to prosper, to grow and to preserve 
the rich heritage and cultures that built our great nation regardless 
of where we live in this vast country.
<P>
	To begin this process they invite Canadians, particularly those 
who reside in Quebec, to stay within the Canadian family and join 
all Canadians in taking Canada to a united, stronger and greater 
future.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to unite and 
continue to build this great country.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.)</B>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-61, in clause 4, be amended by adding after line 23, on page 2, the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(b) prescribing criteria for determining whether an act or omission shall be 
proceeded with as a violation or as an offence''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, we are at report stage of Bill C-61, a bill 
that allows the Department of Agriculture,  under the jurisdiction 
of the minister of agriculture, to impose administrative monetary 
penalties for a violation to the various acts that were just read in the 
House and to seek compliance agreements to ensure the violations 
do not continue in the future.
<P>
	My party and I support the concept of administrative monetary 
penalties. We also support the concept of compliance agreements. 
The House will see in the amendments we have proposed today that 
none of them would disallow the use of administrative monetary 
penalties to implement or to penalize violations of acts, 
particularly those that would affect regulations dealing with 
agriculture, health, safety and the like. Nor do any of the 
amendments we propose, including the one we are dealing with 
right now, preclude the minister reaching a compliance agreement 
with an offender or with a violator of any of the offences in the acts 
we are dealing with today.
<P>
	Our amendments attempt to qualify and quantify the powers of 
the minister, the powers of the tribunal to which violators can 
appeal, and to clarify certain parts of the acts and the rights and the 
responsibilities of both the violator and the minister in enforcing 
and administering the monetary penalties and forming compliance 
agreements.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 is incorrectly printed in the Notice Paper. It says 
that the minister shall prescribe ``criteria for determining whether 
an act or omission shall be proceeded with as a violation or as an 
offence''. The amendment requires the minister to have regulations 
determining the differences between a violation which the AMPs 
address and an offence which the court system addresses. We feel 
this clarification would respond to some concerns in the industry 
about the matter.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food was 
given information by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food that a number of institutions and 
associations impacted by the legislation support Bill C-61. The 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture circulated a 
list in the committee of several organizations such as the Canadian 
Horticultural Council, the Canadian Meat Council, the Canadian 
Animal Health Institute, the Canadian Veterinary Medical 
Association, the Canadian Nursery Trades Association, the 
Canadian Egg Marketing Agency, the Canadian Seed Growers 
Association, the Council of Forestry Industries of British 
Columbia, the Canadian Fertilizer Institute, the National Dairy 
Council of Canada and the Holstein Association of Canada.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary indicated to the committee that all 
these associations and organizations supported Bill C-61. The list 
that he circulated in the committee was titled ``Organizations 
which support Bill C-61''. He said that he would supply letters of 
support for the bill to members of the committee. We sought those 
letters of support, and when we received them only  one of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15840"> 15840 </A></B>
<P>
letters was dated after the introduction of Bill C-61. In other words 
all the letters the parliamentary secretary suggested indicated 
support for Bill C-61 were written in 1992 and 1993, which is 
before the current government was elected and before Bill C-61 
was in the drafting stage, let alone introduced into the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	We took note of what the individuals who wrote those letters said 
and found that while they supported the concepts of AMPS and 
compliance agreements, they wanted to review the legislation once 
drafted and to comment on it.
<P>
	To my knowledge the minister of agriculture and his officials 
have not yet supplied us with any letters, other than one letter from 
the Canadian Meat Council, that actually support Bill C-61. I bring 
that forward as a concern and as a rationale for some of the 
amendments we are proposing.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 would require the minister to have regulations 
determining the differences between a violation which the AMPS 
address and an offence which the court system addresses. This 
must happen in any case. The amendment ensures that the minister 
is required to do it. The criteria must be more open and more well 
known in the industry and if the criteria are wrong we will know in 
advance, before the regulations are administered, whether or not 
they will be done in a fair and reasonable manner.
<P>
	Departmental officials say that they are doing a great job of it 
right now, that they are very fair minded, very reasonable in the 
way they administer penalties on violations and deal with offences 
under the acts. That may very well be; I am not here to challenge 
whether or not they are doing a good job. However over time, 
situations change. A few years ago we had a Mulroney government 
that was very arrogant. We may have a Liberal government that 
becomes more arrogant or we may have some new arrangement in 
the Parliament of Canada in the years ahead where ministers and 
departments overstep their bounds.
<P>
	The amendment is not criticizing the current administration. It is 
not a criticism of the Department of Agriculture. It is not a 
criticism of the minister's officials. It is ensuring that in the future 
the criteria will be very public, that no one could be biased in their 
determination of whether a violation would follow the AMPS and 
compliance route or go the court route, perhaps based on 
someone's politics, on which part of the country they live in or on 
some other unreasonable criteria unacceptable to Canadians.
<P>
	The minister must set out a criterion to determine the 
differences. This minor amendment would ensure that happens. It 
would ensure the AMPS and the compliance agreements would 
have a reason for introduction. If the  department decided not to go 
the AMPS route or the compliance agreement route and decided to 
take the matter to the courts, to the justice system, we would know 
the criteria on which the decision was made. It is a more open, 
transparent way of performing one's responsibilities.
<P>
	I urge the House to accept the amendment. It certainly is not 
partisan by nature; it certainly is not unreasonable. Therefore I ask 
for the support of all members.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity in the House today to deal with Bill C-61 and the 
various possible motions in amendment that have been put on the 
Order Paper with respect to Bill C-61.
<P>
	In beginning the discussion on Motion No. 1, I start by making 
reference to a matter the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
referred to in his opening remarks, the level of industry support for 
the measure as it appears in the form of the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	My parliamentary secretary, in dealing with the issue before the 
committee, indicated that there was broad support for the 
legislation as it appears before the House of Commons. In 
indicating the kind of correspondence presented to verify the 
support, my parliamentary secretary was not in any way misleading 
or attempting to mislead members of the committee. He stated 
quite accurately that letters of support had been received for the 
principle and the concept of the legislation from 11 key industry 
organizations. The names of the organizations have already been 
referred to by the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	Consultation on the legislation began a long time before the bill 
was actually drafted. In October 1992 Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada wrote to all industry associations to inform them of the 
intention to move forward with an administrative monetary penalty 
system. After that consultation various letters of support were 
received broadly from the industry. Also a variety of industry 
groups reaffirmed their support for this type of legislation during 
the regulatory review process conducted by my department during 
the course of 1992.
<P>
	Once the bill was actually drafted and tabled in the House of 
Commons on December 5, 1994, a letter and substantial 
documentation were sent to 132 industry associations informing 
them that the bill had been tabled. The letter went on to detail the 
significant features of the legislation. It specifically provided a 
contact point to enable further discussion and information upon 
request from the various industry organizations.
<P>
	In response we received a few inquiries seeking certain specific 
clarifications about some detailed points contained in the draft 
legislation, but there were no letters and no other forms of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15841"> 15841 </A></B>
<P>
communication indicating  any fundamental change on the part of 
the industry in terms of support for the legislation.
<P>
	At the same time a press release was issued to over 1,000 media 
and industry contacts. It indicated that the legislation had been 
tabled and that the concepts previously discussed in various forms 
of consultation had now been transformed into legislative form and 
were about to proceed through the House of Commons.
<P>
	As the bill has been before the House for some considerable 
length of time, various industry representatives have been kept 
informed of the progress of the legislation. Certainly the indication 
is that a broad measure of support in the industry continues for Bill 
C-61.
<P>
	In view of the concerns expressed at committee stage by 
members of the opposition wondering if the previous expressions 
of support continue to the present time, this week my officials have 
contacted a number of the groups and organizations previously 
consulted. This week my officials have also spoken with the 
Canadian Horticulture Council, the Canadian Egg Marketing 
Agency, the Canadian Seed Growers' Association, the National 
Dairy Council and the Canadian Meat Council. All the 
organizations again reconfirmed their support for the bill.
<P>
	While I appreciate the question about earlier support and later 
support being raised by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, the evidence before us indicates fairly 
clearly that a broad measure of support was there in the beginning 
and continues to the present time.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	Specifically Motion No. 1 talks about the possibility of 
prescribing in regulations the criteria for determining whether any 
contravention should be considered as an administrative violation 
or an offence. I have a couple of observations I would like to make.
<P>
	At the present time, every contravention can be prosecuted 
through the court system. What this bill does is it gives to the 
minister of agriculture an administrative option where prosecution 
is seen to be too harsh or too drastic a measure. In arriving at his or 
her decision as to whether to proceed immediately through the 
court system by way of prosecution or proceed under the auspices 
of administrative monetary penalties, the minister of the day will 
be guided by a compliance and enforcement policy. That policy 
establishes criteria to advise and instruct the department in making 
decisions on the use of the various enforcement options that are 
available, the more severe and the less severe.
<P>
	The compliance and enforcement policy is a public document. It 
would not be prescribed by way of regulation, but it would be on 
the public record for the public to know about, to understand, to ask 
questions about, and potentially even to suggest changes to.
<P>
	The choice to be made by the minister in any given set of 
circumstances is as to whether to prosecute or whether to issue a 
monetary penalty. This is akin to a choice that is often before 
prosecutors in criminal matters where a decision has to be made 
about whether to proceed by way of indictment, which is a more 
serious method of proceeding through the court system, or by way 
of summary conviction, which is a somewhat less serious method 
of proceeding.
<P>
	Because the choice in any given case is so heavily dependent 
upon the individual facts of the situation, there is obviously a 
requirement here for some degree of flexibility. I would say to my 
hon. friend across the way that I do not believe it is practical or 
realistic to have hard and fast rules set down and prescribed by way 
of regulations. The necessary flexibility that has to be there in 
making these judgment calls is best offered by relying on a policy 
statement, a policy document, rather than trying to etch all of that 
in the more rigid framework of regulations.
<P>
	I repeat the point I made earlier: The policy document on 
compliance and enforcement matters dealing with how decisions 
are to be made on the choice of the various enforcement options 
that might be available will be open to the public. One of the 
fundamental things we are trying to achieve by means of this 
legislation is an open, fair and transparent process.
<P>
	I would simply conclude by saying that in making these choices, 
which are difficult choices and require judgment calls to be made 
and some measure of flexibility, depending on a wide variety of 
factual situations that may confront the minister of the day, it is 
important for these matters to be dealt with in the form of a public 
policy document as opposed to trying to etch them in the more rigid 
form of regulations. While I understand the general point my hon. 
friend is trying to make, I would not be in a position to recommend 
support for Motion No. 1.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (LotbiniÃ¨re, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must take 
part in the debate on Bill C-61 today, because this bill cannot be 
agreed on as presented by the government, on the basis that it 
would save time and money for the taxpayers.
<P>
	I entirely agree with the principle, and so does my party, but the 
government always has to leave the door open to all kinds of 
adverse consequences.
<P>
	This bill could have serious consequences in terms of disregard 
for judicial fairness. If the department introduces a system of 
monetary penalties, it must be because it believes that this will 
significantly reduce the need for enforcement actions, thus 
generating substantial savings for taxpayers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15842"> 15842 </A></B>
<P>
	The big problem is that the government did not foresee the risks 
that making totally arbitrary decisions on the enforcement of such 
penalties entail. We object to reducing penalties imposed on 
offenders by concluding compliance agreements. That is unfair.
<P>
	It would have been enlightening for the government to advise us 
of the potential savings resulting from this bill. This legislation 
contains a totally unacceptable principle, authorizing the person 
designated by the minister to conclude an agreement with the 
offender, whose fine would be reduced by $1 for every $2 invested 
by the business into improving its process, buying new equipment 
or training its employees. As far as I know, penalties are not 
negotiable in our justice system. Bargaining fines is not something 
we do in Quebec. Anyone who was stopped for speeding knows 
what I mean: either you are guilty and you pay the full amount of 
the fine or you go to court and let the judge decide.
<P>
	The existing justice system provides that the person who is 
guilty of a fault must bear the consequences of his or her actions. 
Instead, with this bill, a wealthy offender, one who can more easily 
afford making investments to remedy a particular situation, is 
rewarded. In the way of unequal treatment, you can hardly find 
worse. This is preferential treatment based on the financial 
capability of an individual or business, and that is unfair.
<P>
	I would also like the government to tell us who will be in charge 
of assessing the cost of the efforts made by offending individuals or 
businesses to remedy the situation. Training, equipment, all that 
can cost more in one region than in another. In a region where it 
costs more, offenders will be penalized. Moreover, will they be 
informed of all the means made available to them to correct the 
situation? And what if an offender, in collusion with suppliers, 
presented inflated bills? Frankly, there are tax or other incentives 
which could be used to promote investment and training by 
companies. For heaven's sake, let us not negotiate penalties.
<P>
	Another unacceptable provision in this bill is the one which 
provides for a 50 per cent reduction of the penalty if the offender 
pays it without appealing the decision or asking for a hearing. With 
that provision, the government undermines the presumption of 
innocence. A number of members of this House are lawyers and 
they know that the presumption of innocence is a fundamental 
right. Indeed, under our legal system, a person is deemed innocent 
until there is evidence to the contrary.
<P>
	Let us take an unclear situation where there would be grounds 
for challenging the decision. The minister would tell the individual 
or business that it is in their best interest to keep a low profile, 
otherwise, they would of course have to submit to a hearing-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are not discussing the right motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry: </B>What is the problem?

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is everything all right? Fine. Let us stop for a few

I have a question.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member wish to continue the debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to address Motion No. 2. I 
apologize. I spoke too soon. I am sorry.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Thank you. Resuming debate. We are still 
discussing Motion No. 1. The debate is on Group No. 1.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for a westerner to be able to speak to this motion. I 
begin by pointing out that there has been in both recent and 
historical terms a need to address the problem this bill and this 
motion seemingly are dealing with.
<P>
	The minister is charged with the duty to look at any circumstance 
in which there has been an infraction under the law and take that 
circumstance and assess whether or not it is ``a very serious 
situation''. Perhaps even out of ignorance a person may become 
involved in a set of circumstances that really potentially is serious 
if not checked.
<P>
	The biggest point that needs to be addressed is the bill and the 
minister are trying to bring about some compliance to the degree 
that this infraction or this problem can be rectified.
<P>
	Under the present situation, every contravention must be 
prosecuted. The reason the bill is being put in place is to have in 
place some discretionary powers whereby the bill will in fact still 
bring about compliance while recognizing that there are some 
circumstances that need not produce criminal records.
<P>
	To prescribe by regulation, as the motion puts forward, the 
criterion for determining whether a contravention should be 
considered as a violation or an offence perhaps is on the surface 
rather difficult, but once it gets operating sets of criteria will flow 
and will become apparent.
<P>
	I will give a couple of examples. Let us suggest that somebody 
has entered material into the food chain that is very harmful. This 
would require penalties that perhaps would be approaching the 
criminal level and should be dealt with very seriously.
<P>
	At the standing committee my colleague said perhaps a person 
who is hauling animals will be putting too many animals into a 
trailer and unknowingly breaking the regulations. Consequently, all 
we need to do is deal with that individual on a user friendly basis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15843"> 15843 </A></B>
<P>
	I feel the motion on the criteria situation is one that in time 
will flow and the decision of whether or not to prosecute or put 
in place the monetary penalties when necessary will bring about 
the desired effect of compliance. The minister has the duty to 
make known what those criteria are as the events unfold.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose Bill C-61, because we feel 
it is unacceptable in its present form.  Myself and my party fully 
agree with the underlying principle, which is to save taxpayers time 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15844"> 15844 </A></B>
<P>
and money. However, it seems that the government always opens 
the door to all sorts of harmful effects.
<P>
	This bill could have a major adverse impact on compliance and 
fairness. Moreover, if the department is setting up a system of 
monetary penalties it is because it feels such a system can greatly 
simplify the procedures used to ensure compliance, and therefore 
result in major savings to Canadian taxpayers. The problem is that 
the government did not anticipate the possibility that some 
decisions related to the process may be totally arbitrary. We oppose 
the compliance agreements which allow the designated person to 
reduce the penalty imposed to an offender. Such a procedure is 
unfair.
<P>
	The government should also have told us about the potential 
savings associated with the implementation of this bill. Allowing a 
person designated by the department to enter into a compliance 
agreement with an offender is totally unacceptable. Under such an 
arrangement, the offender's penalty would be reduced by one dollar 
for every two dollars that the company would invest to improve its 
procedures, buy new material or train its staff. As far as I know, our 
justice system does not allow an offender to negotiate his or her 
penalty. Bargaining penalties is not part of our way of doing things. 
Just ask those who get arrested for speeding: either you are guilty 
and pay the full amount of the fine, or you challenge the decision 
before the court and the judge makes a ruling.
<P>
	Under our justice system, an offender must assume the 
consequences of his acts. An offender who has the means to invest 
money to correct a specific situation would benefit from that 
provision. This bill is as unfair as you can get. Such preferential 
treatment is based on the spending power of an individual or a 
company, and that is unfair.
<P>
	Moreover, can the government tell us who will evaluate the cost 
of efforts made by the individual or company to remedy the 
situation? Training, equipment, all these things cost more or less, 
depending on where you live. Offenders would be penalized if they 
live in a region where these costs are high. What is more, will they 
be informed of all of the approaches available to them for 
correcting the situation? And what if, with the complicity of 
suppliers, our offender produces padded invoices? Frankly, there 
are tax or other incentives which could be used if we are seeking to 
step up investments or training in a company. But for goodness' 
sake , let us not link it with negotiation of a sentence.
<P>
	Another unacceptable point: the bill calls for a 50 per cent 
reduction in the penalty if the person committing the violation pays 
the fine without contesting or requesting a review. Here the 
government is attacking the very foundations of presumed 
innocence. A number of hon. members are lawyers and they know 
this is a  fundamental right. A person is considered innocent until 
proven otherwise in our legal system, is he not?
<P>
	Let us look at an obscure situation in which there were grounds 
to request a review. The minister would tell the individual or 
company that it would be in his or its best interests to be seen and 
not heard. Of course, he could ask for a review, but with a gun at his 
head. He will be told that he has already been found guilty and that, 
if he wants to reduce his penalty, he has only to pay up without a 
fuss.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Where does the right of any individual to representation come 
in? Who will help the person presumed to have committed the 
violation to defend his point of view?
<P>
	The individual may obtain a hearing before a tribunal, however, 
if he insists. But beware of conflicts of interest. Listen carefully to 
how the thing works: the tribunal is appointed by the minister. The 
members, whose mandate is renewable, have to assess decisions 
made by departmental employees.
<P>
	And the latter answer to the minister. That is how it goes. It 
seems to me that the tribunal members could very easily be 
appointed by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food after an assessment of whether the handling of certain 
cases has or has not caused problems. Another point not made clear 
is whether the individual will have to travel to Ottawa for a hearing.
<P>
	This government just loves to complicate things. Another 
department I will not mention, Transport Canada, uses a system of 
monetary sanctions. Unlike Agriculture and Agri-Food, however, 
Transport Canada has no mechanism allowing it to reduce penalties 
if the offending individual decides to pay up without an argument. 
There is no reduction either if he decides to invest in improvements 
to the facilities which earned him the fine.
<P>
	It is unnecessary to offer some sort of penalty reduction bonus as 
an incentive for violators to pay up, because in many cases, 
contesting the penalty costs more than the penalty itself.
<P>
	The government wants to save money. So do we. The bill before 
the House today proposes to amend eight acts. Most of these acts 
concern areas that are already administered by the provinces.
<P>
	Did the government start by consulting the provinces to find out 
whether the monetary penalty system is a concept they would 
recognize, and did it then consider whether the provinces would not 
be in a better position to administer the system? It is high time we 
put an end to unnecessary duplication in inspection services.
<P>
	Too often the federal inspection system's only excuse for being 
there at all is the international standards it  enforces in order to 
meet international trade requirements. Why not let the provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15845"> 15845 </A></B>
<P>
enforce these standards themselves? Then we would certainly save 
money.
<P>
	In concluding, we support initiatives that help relieve pressure 
on the courts. Consequently, as I said at the beginning of my 
speech, we support the principle of Bill C-61. However, we do not 
agree with the double standard the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food wishes to introduce by reducing penalties for violators 
who plead guilty without asking for a review or who will invest to 
correct the situation.
<P>
	In fact, the agreement process the department wishes to impose 
is certainly not essential to the bill, especially since it is a potential 
source of arbitrariness and inequity. I would urge the House to vote 
in favour of the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, in 
order to correct a bill that might otherwise have a disastrous impact 
on the concept of equity in our legal system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the individuals who looked at the bill and came forward with 
amendments looked very hard at the issues they are attempting to 
address. I have to say their attempts to remedy or improve the bill 
is evident.
<P>
	However I have to take exception that the actual function they 
are bringing forward will be a benefit to agriculture in general. I 
would point out that in Motion No. 15 they are asking to legislate 
what the maximum time frame should be tied to six months within 
which time the review tribunal must complete its review.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	Many times when a tribunal is involved in matters it would be 
rather imprudent to be fixed to a particular time frame and attempt 
to guarantee this time frame in legislation where reason dictates 
that flexibility would be required and needed. Therefore, a 
six-month time frame would not always be suitable. I think we 
would have to say that some flexibility in timing would be 
required.
<P>
	Another purpose of the motion is to remove from the minister 
the ability to enter into compliance agreements whereby penalties 
could be reduced in recognition of costs incurred by industry by 
taking corrective measures. The important thing in these matters is 
that compliance is achieved. Whether or not there is a reduced or an 
increased penalty is secondary in most cases to bringing about the 
change by the perpetrator of the infraction.
<P>
	By authorizing the department to enter into these agreements the 
bill gives the department the tool to negotiate the implementation 
by industry of measures that would change the violator's practices 
and process. That is the key. At the same time, the violator may pay 
a reduced amount of penalty in exchange for compliance. These 
funds to effect the necessary improvements leading  to a future 
compliance may also be used to remedy certain situations.
<P>
	Compliance agreements result in immediate corrective actions. 
Note that we are saying immediate. When that has happened of 
course, the ministerial or departmental approval would be 
achieved. Immediate corrective action leads to a better product, 
improved health and safety, and more effective enforcement. 
Compliance agreements are optional and no one is forced to enter 
into these agreements. The bill provides an incentive to enter into 
compliance agreements by making it possible to reduce the amount 
of monetary penalty. As we have said, the most important outcome 
is that there has been a change and there has been a remedy and 
compliance is achieved.
<P>
	To remove the possibility of a ministerial review of a notice of 
violation is also deemed not suitable by this amendment. I would 
like to speak against that point as well. A ministerial review 
enables a violator who wishes to challenge a monetary penalty to 
have a fast, inexpensive and informal way to do so. Under current 
legislation he must do so through the court system. As we know, 
that can be slow. We also know it can be very expensive. 
Consequently, when we hear concerns from opposite sides that we 
do not have enough savings by these changes, we admit that we 
perhaps do not have a fixed number, but we know that by taking it 
out of the court system we will be putting a number of dollars into 
agriculture rather than into the hands of people in the legal system.
<P>
	The ministerial review is optional in any event. The violator may 
choose to proceed directly to the review tribunal. Furthermore, 
anyone who elects to have a ministerial review may appeal its 
outcome to the review tribunal.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to comment on whether or not to remove the 
possibility for a violator to pay less than the full amount of 
monetary penalty where the violator does not request a review. In 
other words, we would be putting in place a mechanism whereby 
there would be a smaller amount of money taken from the 
perpetrator of an infraction without his even asking for it.
<P>
	The intent behind including in the bill a provision that enables 
this to happen is twofold. First, it is to enable a violator who does 
not intend to challenge the assessment of a penalty to pay a reduced 
amount of penalty if the department is satisfied that the violator 
would act in good faith and take the necessary corrective measures. 
Again, the compliance component is paramount here. Second, it is 
to promote compliance without engaging in long and costly 
hearings.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	Hearings are of course expensive, as we said earlier. There are 
other regimes. It is estimated that the average hearing cost is about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15846"> 15846 </A></B>
<P>
$1,400, and some might be more. If  we can save that $1,400, we 
will all be ahead of the game.
<P>
	We are informed these types of reductions are common under 
other monetary penalty regimes both in Canada and the U.S. In 
these other regimes reductions are informally made on a case by 
case basis while taking great care to make a decision appropriately. 
Bill C-61 formalizes the procedure and makes the practice 
transparent and available to anyone.
<P>
	I conclude my remarks at this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is rather heavy slugging; I hope you are enjoying 
the debate this morning.
<P>
	We are dealing with quite a large number of amendments in 
Group No. 2. I am not going to speak individually on all of the Bloc 
amendments, but I will lump them together. It seems the Bloc's 
intention in proposing these amendments is to actually do away 
with the formulating of compliance agreements altogether. That is 
not a position I or my colleagues share. We are not opposed to the 
concept. We want to clarify, quantify and qualify some of the act to 
make it work better, which is the purpose of our amendments.
<P>
	If the compliance agreement is properly administered and 
properly enforced, if it is balanced and gives a proper and 
reasonable amount of protection to both the minister and his 
department and to those violators or alleged violators who are 
affected by this legislation, it can actually be a useful tool that will 
take violators out of the courts and allow the situation to be dealt 
with in a less costly and more efficient manner.
<P>
	Having said that about the Bloc amendments, I suspect the Bloc 
would have been wiser to simply oppose the bill and offer no 
amendments at all rather than to actually destroy the intent of the 
bill.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly to the motions we have put forward 
in this grouping. I will begin with Motion No. 10, which concerns 
clause 10. We would amend it by replacing line 17 on page 6 with 
the following: ``reasonable security, in a form and in an amount''.
<P>
	This motion deals with the granting of security to ensure 
compliance of someone who has violated the regulations under one 
of the acts dealt with in Bill C-61. We suggested there should be 
criteria in the process, and I appreciate the minister saying that he 
already has a policy manual in place. I do not know why he and his 
government would oppose ensuring that policy manual continues 
and is very open to the public by means of the amendment we have 
proposed. I cannot understand why the government would not be 
supportive of the word reasonable in front of the word security. We 
all want to be reasonable people; I am sure the minister wants to be 
reasonable, as does his government.
<P>
	Let us use an example of what this would prevent. It would 
prevent the minister and his department from demanding an entire 
meat processing plant for security if the cooler was of a value at 
least twice as great as the penalty that would be imposed upon the 
processor for any violation he had committed. That type of 
approach is reasonable and would prevent abuses by the minister 
and his department. On the other hand, it would also preclude the 
minister from going to the other extreme and just demanding the 
meat grinder for security when the violation was serious enough 
that he should have more security to ensure the compliance 
agreement is complied with.
<P>
	That is a reasonable amendment. It makes the bill stronger. It 
again qualifies the bill and leads me into Motion No. 11, which 
deals with the same matter of reasonable security.
<P>
	Motion No. 11 is that Bill C-61 be amended in clause 10 by 
adding after line 11, on page 7, the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4.1) Where security has been given under paragraph (1)(a), the notice shall 
also state that the security shall not be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of 
Canada unless the amount of security is less than twice the amount of the 
penalty set out in the notice of violation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	This qualifies what reasonable security in this case would be. It 
prevents the minister and his department from demanding an 
unreasonable amount of security in ensuring a compliance 
agreement is complied with.
<P>
	This is common sense. It is reasonable. It protects the 
department; it protects the minister; it protects the Canadian 
taxpayer. It is an incentive for the offender or the violator to 
comply with the agreement, yet it prevents abuse.
<P>
	I will go on to Motion No. 15, which is also in this grouping. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-61, in clause 14, be amended by replacing lines 3 and 4, on page 
9, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>14.(1) No later than six months after the Tribunal receives a request for a 
review under this Act, it shall, by order, as</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This seems a bit disjointed when it is read, but a tribunal is 
established under the act that can review disputes if they are not 
voluntarily complied with by the violator. If the offender is not able 
to make an agreement with the minister and his department, he 
does have recourse to a tribunal.
<P>
	As we know, we have seen in the justice system in the United 
States and to a degree in Canada that sometimes these cases drag on 
and on. They are very costly. They are certainly not fair to the 
person who is accused or the person who has been alleged to have 
made a violation, and they are certainly not fair to the taxpayers 
who bear a large portion of the cost of this process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15847"> 15847 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, this is just a qualifier that ensures that the tribunal cannot 
delay making a decision forever and ever. In fact, it stipulates that 
in no case can the tribunal delay its action for more than six 
months. It requires the review tribunal to complete its review 
within six months of receiving the person's request for review.
<P>
	Can the minister offer a very good reason why that is not 
reasonable or that does not protect taxpayers, why it does not 
protect the person who is alleged to have made a violation and even 
protect the department from ongoing cases where this situation is 
not resolved? It is better for all parties involved in this process.
<P>
	I request that all members in the House look seriously at Motion 
No. 15. I suggest they support that as being fair and reasonable, 
making it a better act rather than a weaker one.
<P>
	The purpose of these amendments is not to in any way criticize 
the government or do a one-up on the government; it is to make 
better legislation that is going to affect us all. It is in that spirit that 
we bring these amendments to the House.
<P>
	I request that members opposite have a fair look at these 
amendments and see whether or not they can support them as being 
reasonable in this legislation, in this case suggesting reasonable 
security and a reasonable amount of time for decisions to be made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, these are certainly very difficult and challenging 
times in the field of agriculture. We see a lot of changes going on 
throughout the sector worldwide. We have seen with the 
globalization of trade that is occurring and with the tight fiscal 
situations governments find themselves in all around the world that 
this is imposing certain constraints on the way we carry on 
business.
<P>
	This government and the minister are facing many challenges in 
the area of agriculture. Certainly this government and the minister 
in particular has achieved a number of very significant successes in 
dealing with these challenges of globalization and dealing with the 
challenges of a tight fiscal situation.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	When we look at the fair and thorough handling of the Crow 
payout issue in western Canada, the protection of the supply 
management system at the GATT talks and the successful 
completion of the GATT talks shortly after the election by the 
minister and the very favourable settlement of the durum wheat 
disputes of the U.S., in each instance the minister has dealt with 
these issues in a fair and thorough fashion, getting good results for 
the agricultural producers of Canada.
<P>
	The minister has proven to be a very forceful and successful 
advocate for all the country's farmers, whether in the west, in 
Quebec, in Ontario, or in the maritimes.  He has always ensured 
that when dealing with the issues of farmers, each group of 
producers in each region has its issues dealt with on the merits of 
the case. This bill is another fine example of dealing with the 
pressures and challenges facing the agricultural sector. This can be 
looked at as yet another success.
<P>
	It is very important to point out that we are dealing with a piece 
of legislation that allows for compliance agreements. Therefore 
when there is a violation of a regulation within various parts of the 
agricultural sector, the usual route is to charge the individual. The 
individual gets a lawyer; the government gets a lawyer. The 
government pays for the expense and time of a tribunal to hear the 
case. Down the road a year or two later there is finally a decision in 
the dispute. Thereafter, in the event the charged individual or 
corporation is found guilty, their practices are changed.
<P>
	This legislation allows for a speedy and fair resolution of the 
violation when it occurs. It allows the producers or the person 
charged to come to a very quick resolution of their dispute. The 
offending behaviour can be quickly remedied.
<P>
	In a legal dispute in which charges are laid, a person will not 
change his behaviour for fear that change will lead to an admission 
of guilt.
<P>
	When there is the ability for a person to simply change 
behaviour and get on with business, this is what we really want to 
see. We want to see our food safe, our industry competitive. Both 
these issues are dealt with very favourably by this legislation. That 
type of settlement is encouraged.
<P>
	As we do not have the resources we used to, the solution put 
forward by the minister is excellent because it allows cutting the 
costs of corrective measures. This is very important for all 
Canadians. It allows industries to continue to be very competitive, 
to spend their resources doing their job of processing and selling 
products better rather than spending resources, time and energy 
worrying and trying to deal with a charge. In this respect the bill is 
excellent and handles a number of these changes in a very positive 
manner.
<P>
	When dealing with the security required to ensure a violator 
complies with a compliance agreement, it has always been the 
intent of the minister that it be reasonable. If not included explicitly 
within the legislation, it is always included implicitly.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	If the matter were subject to dispute, I have no doubt the courts 
would simply read into the legislation that the security required by 
the minister or the department would be reasonable. However, I 
suppose one could look at this amendment and say it is exactly 
what the intent of the legislation is and therefore would be 
reasonable to include it within the legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15848"> 15848 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the motions seeks to remove the possibility for the 
violator to pay less than the full amount of the monetary penalty 
where the violator does not request a review. The intent behind 
the bill includes the provision which enables a violator to pay less 
than the full amount of the penalty which otherwise would be 
taken if the procedure were to go to court.
<P>
	The intent behind it is twofold. It enables a violator who does not 
intend to challenge the assessment of the penalty to pay a reduced 
penalty and to get on with life. It encourages the person to take 
corrective measures. It also promotes compliance without 
engaging in long and costly hearings. That makes sense. There is a 
large benefit to the person charged or who has committed a 
violation to simply change the behaviour and to get on with 
business. That is what the legislation is all about. If the possibility 
for the violator to pay less were not there, we would not see many 
violators voluntarily changing their behaviour.
<P>
	The legislation deals with the fiscal realities of the government. 
It encourages a change of behaviour on the part of violators within 
the agriculture and agri-food sectors. It encourages the 
improvement of behaviour. Canada will continue to produce high 
quality goods in the agricultural field and will continue to have a 
competitive industry. The legislation also assists Canada to 
compete in the international market because the resources of the 
companies and the government will not be diverted into long legal 
disputes.
<P>
	The legislation accomplishes a number of goals. It is another 
example of the minister's dealing effectively with the challenges 
we are facing in the agri-food sector today. I congratulate the 
minister and all the people who have worked hard to make this 
legislation a reality.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the 
motions we are discussing in Group No. 2, Motion No. 2 and 
Motions Nos. 6 through 17. They are all part of our discussion at 
the present time.
<P>
	Remarks were made earlier by the hon. member for LotbiniÃ¨re 
regarding overlap and duplication in agricultural policies and 
programs between the federal government and provincial 
jurisdiction. I will address that point for a moment.
<P>
	That there might be some measure of overlap is probably to be 
expected since under our Constitution agriculture is specifically 
and explicitly a joint federal-provincial responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	When we look at the duplication that actually exists, it is truly 
remarkable that the amount involved in agriculture is tiny. Two 
studies were conducted within the last year or so by the 
Government of Quebec. One was released in the spring of this year 
and the other was released earlier this fall.
<P>
	One study indicated that at the very worst the amount of overlap 
and duplication between the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Quebec with respect to agriculture might involve a 
cost in the order of 2.5 per cent. According to the other study, it was 
more like 1 per cent. According to the studies it is very minor.
<P>
	On a number of occasions in the House and publicly I have 
indicated to the Government of Quebec and every other provincial 
government to the extent that overlap and duplication exist in the 
field of agriculture, that we should talk about it. We should work it 
out of the system so we have it at the absolute minimum, even 
though it is already very small to start with.
<P>
	There really is no substantial argument to be made on the point 
of overlap and duplication because there is not much in the first 
place. To the extent that it does exist the Government of Canada is 
completely prepared to work with every provincial jurisdiction to 
identify problem areas that might exist and to work them out of the 
system so that overlap and duplication are minimized.
<P>
	In the remarks of the member for LotbiniÃ¨re I also heard an 
attempt to demean or diminish the importance of the Canadian 
federal inspection system in agriculture. That system is vital to 
Canadian farmers, exporters and consumers in terms of providing 
this country with the safest and highest quality of food in the world.
<P>
	Studies, some of which we released at the time of the federal 
budget last February, indicated Canadians have a very high 
confidence level in our food system in terms of its health and its 
safety because of the Canadian food inspection system which ranks 
among the very best in the world in terms of health and safety 
standards. That gives our consumers a very strong and positive 
feeling about the quality of products they buy from the Canadian 
food system. It also provides our customers abroad with a very high 
level of expectation about the standards they can receive when they 
buy from Canada.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to visit with our customers in foreign 
markets, in the Asia-Pacific region, in Latin America, in Europe 
and in other places around the world. They have repeatedly told me 
that when they buy from Canada they know they buy the very best 
and they rely heavily on the high quality, high standard inspection 
system.
<P>
	It is not accurate or appropriate to dismiss that as something 
frivolous or unmeaningful. It matters a lot to Canadian farmers, to 
Canadian exporters and potential exporters, to Canadian consumers 
and to our international customers. That inspection system is 
exceedingly important to all Canadians.
<P>
	I have heard that comment repeated to me over and over by 
exporters and potential exporters from Quebec who know the value 
of the Canadian inspection system and who want to see it 
maintained in the best interests of Quebec agriculture and Canadian 
agriculture.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15849"> 15849 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Can we make our inspection system even better? The answer to 
that is obviously yes. At the present time we are working very hard 
in co-operation with the private sector and in co-operation with all 
provincial governments to make that system better. We are working 
on areas where we can avoid costs in the system. We are working 
on areas where we can reduce costs in the system. We are working 
on areas where we can share costs in the system when there is an 
appropriate sharing of benefits at the same time. We are looking at 
a whole range of ways in which we can introduce new technology 
into the system to take advantage of the advances in science and 
technology in the field of food inspection systems.
<P>
	We are also pursuing new approaches that have international 
acceptance such as an approach called HACCP, as it is known by its 
acronym, the hazard analysis at critical control points system. It is 
deemed in many jurisdictions around the world to be the very best 
system to move toward for the future. Many Canadian companies 
are already beginning to adopt that approach in their inspection 
standards.
<P>
	Finally, there is the issue of more co-ordination and co-operation 
among all those in the system who have some responsibility for 
inspection.
<P>
	I have seen examples of inspection situations in the country 
where three or four federal government departments are involved 
in some aspect of inspection, perhaps two or three departments at 
the provincial level and on occasion, some departments at the 
municipal level. That is an area where there is some overlap we can 
seriously work at removing from the system. We are trying to do 
that in two ways.
<P>
	First, at the federal level we are working very hard on a single 
federal approach to inspection so that we do not have overlapping 
activities on the part of several federal departments all inspecting 
the same thing but simply repeating the process over and over 
again. We are making progress at working out those illustrations of 
federal overlap so we get the inspection job done but we do not 
cause repetitive actions that are in fact counterproductive and 
costly.
<P>
	Second, we are working very hard with the provinces, as is 
evidenced by the last several federal-provincial meetings of 
agriculture ministers, to develop a Canadian national food 
inspection system. It is a system where all jurisdictions and all 
levels that have responsibility work in greater co-ordination with 
each other so that at the end of the day the very best inspection 
work gets done at a very high level with excellent standards and 
calibre, but we avoid costs in the system, overlap and duplication. 
We then have a system that performs to the very high standards we 
want at the very least possible cost.
<P>
	The story of food inspection is one in which Canadians can have 
confidence and of which they can be very proud both for today and
<P>
for the future. Having said that, I would add this one final sentence. 
It is critically important that we maintain our vigilance with respect 
to food inspection so that Canadians cannot only have a past 
reputation for being the very best in the world, but can have the 
absolute confidence that their reputation will continue forever into 
the future.
<P>
	In the group of motions that are specifically before us, Motions 
Nos. 2, 8, 9 and 12 have already been dealt with, I believe, by my 
colleague for Brandon-Souris quite effectively. Similarly, 
Motions Nos. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16 and 17 have been dealt with by the 
member for Brandon-Souris in considerable detail. I do not 
propose to repeat what he said.
<P>
	I want to focus on Motion No. 10, presented by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, where he suggests the insertion of the 
word reasonable. It is obviously our intention, with respect to the 
matters dealt with under Motion No. 10, to be reasonable. I have no 
difficulty with the inclusion of that word with respect to Motion 
No. 10. I would suggest though, as a consequence that it would not 
be necessary to accept Motion No. 11 because the point is already 
covered effectively by the amendment we are prepared to accept in 
Motion No. 10.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	All other motions in the package I would recommend against. 
However, the government is prepared to accept the amendment 
proposed in Motion No. 10.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, we are making a little progress here. Let us 
see if we can make more.
<P>
	The minister says he has some good news and he has some bad 
news. The good news is that he has listened to Reform once. 
Perhaps the bad news is that he did not listen to us on the first 
amendment which he should have supported as well.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> The bad news is he is 
a Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> We are dealing with motions which my party 
submitted in this group, Motions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 18 and 19. I will try 
to be quick and discuss the substance of the motions, dealing first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15851"> 15851 </A></B>
<P>
with Motion No. 3. It is to  suggest that Bill C-61 in clause 4 be 
amended by replacing some lines. We are reducing the 
administrative monetary penalty for first time violations.
<P>
	There is a matrix in place which begins to do this, but the matrix 
is not included in the legislation. In our judgment, this reinforces 
that matrix component and ensures that the principle is enacted in 
the legislation.
<P>
	The administrative monetary penalties fall into three maximum 
ranges. The first one is for a minor violation, having a maximum of 
$2,000, a serious violation having a maximum of $5,000 and a very 
serious violation having a maximum of $15,000. For a second or 
subsequent violations we think this is reasonable. However for a 
first violation, often dealing with small business and with 
producers, this seems rather severe.
<P>
	I understand also there can be a warning issued as well for a 
violation. The minister and his department have that option. I am 
not so concerned about the norm as I am the extraordinary 
circumstances that this legislation has to be prepared to deal with. 
It is only reasonable and right that the legislation should contain 
the principle that on a first violation the amount of the penalty be 
reduced by half to protect small business and smaller producers and 
smaller processors.
<P>
	We have another amendment farther along. If I knew that 
amendment was going to be passed, this one would not be quite so 
important. My suspicions are it may not be and that precludes an 
alleged violator being able to use due diligence and having burden 
of proof put on the minister. If that fails, it is even more important 
that Motion No. 3 pass and the first time violations not be subject 
to quite as severe a monetary penalty.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 is another real common sense amendment to which 
I hope the minister is listening and which I hope he will agree to 
pass. It suggests that when a person is notified of the violation, 
besides having his or her name served on the notice, the person who 
is serving the notice has to identify him or herself as well. This is 
an agent of the Department of Agriculture, an agent of the minister.
<P>
	This is common sense and common procedure that someone who 
is imposing a fine, an administrative monetary penalty, on someone 
who is alleged to have violated regulations under the agriculture act 
should have the person who served that notice put his or her name 
on that same piece of paper. That is only common sense. It will be 
useful, valuable and will also protect the person who is alleged to 
have made the violation.
<P>
	Motion No. 5 amends clause 7. The legislation states that the 
minister may make regulations prescribing anything that by this act 
is to be prescribed. That is a pretty blank cheque, particularly when 
it comes to time frame and some of these specifications.
<P>
	When a person is served a notice of violation, we do not know 
how long he or she has to respond. This act  does not indicate 
whether that person has 24 hours, 24 days, or 24 months to respond 
and to make a decision whether they will ask for an appeal, an 
appeal to the tribunal, agree to pay the monetary fine or seek 
compliance.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Nothing in the act suggests a time frame for the decision to be 
made by the person accused of the violation. The amendment we 
are proposing would suggest that the person have at least 45 days to 
make a decision on what route they will go.
<P>
	The minister could argue that it should be 30 days, 25 days or 60 
days. I am willing to listen to his arguments. However the fact that 
there are no restrictions in the act whatsoever is irresponsible and 
could be dangerous if at some future time Agriculture Canada 
became very heavy handed and gave people two days to decide 
what course of action they wanted to follow. Several courses of 
action are permitted in this piece of legislation.
<P>
	This gets confusing. I thank members for bearing with me. I 
want to make sure I have covered all the motions in this grouping. 
There are two more motions I want to briefly touch on. In Motion 
No. 18 we are inserting the word reasonable into clause 15 on line 
13. If the minister and his department seize goods and dispose of 
them, the expenses incurred by the department in disposing the 
seized goods are charged to the violator.
<P>
	If the word reasonable is not included in the clause, the minister 
could hire Lloyds of London to come in and hold an auction to sell 
something of small value that has been seized, say a load of 
produce. We do not want to see these extremes employed by the 
department. We want to make sure reasonable means are used and 
only reasonable expenses are incurred in the sale of seized goods.
<P>
	Motion No. 19 amends clause 18. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a person named in a notice of violation has a defence by reason that the person</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) exercised due diligence to prevent the violation; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) reasonably and honestly believed in the existence of facts that, if true, would 
exonerate the person.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There has been extensive debate in committee over this issue. 
Many members, even members on the Liberal side, were concerned 
that the act authorizing administrative monetary penalties and 
encouraging compliance of those accused of violations does not 
allow those alleged to have violated to use due diligence as a 
defence. This is a violation of some of the common law protection 
in Canada.
<P>
	It allows for a heavy handed department to preclude people 
asked to pay the fines under the act from normal defences, normal 
access to the justice system and the normal common law defence of 
due diligence and honest belief in the facts as presented to 
exonerate people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15852"> 15852 </A></B>
<P>
	We were moving into an area where perhaps the rights of those 
charged under the act were being abused. There needed to be some 
changes. This was the best way that we could ensure it was an 
even handed piece of legislation that did not unduly burden and 
persecute those charged with a violation and preclude them from 
the defence they required if they were to adequately defend 
themselves from a department that may get carried away or go 
a little too far.
<P>
	Again I ask members opposite to seriously consider each of the 
amendments. I appreciate that they supported one amendment that 
made a lot of sense. There are some here that also make a lot of 
sense. If they have not considered them, I ask them to look at the 
amendments to see which ones they can support.
<P>
	I invite all members of the House to support each of the 
amendments in Group No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster made an important point in his last 
statement when he said we support amendments that make sense.
<P>
	The difficulty with these amendments, I am sorry to say, is that 
in terms of the effectiveness of the legislation they do not make 
sense. I will speak on most of them.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	On Motion No. 3, we have to understand current maximum 
penalties are relatively modest. The bill does not make a distinction 
between the first and subsequent violations for the purpose of 
setting a maximum penalty that could be assessed.
<P>
	I am surprised to a certain extent that a reduction for a first 
offence is being requested, given that very often when dealing with 
violations of law or quasi-law the Reform Party wants to go all out 
and go for the jugular. In this case you are asking for-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the member to put his remarks 
through the Chair. I know it is a bore but it is required by our 
procedure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> I will do that. In this case the regulations will 
determine a base penalty amount range in circumstances under 
which penalties may be increased or reduced. Compliance history 
will be one of the factors set out in the regulations whereby 
penalties will be reduced for violators with no previous history of 
non-compliance and increased for those who commit subsequent 
violations.
<P>
	Under clause 4(3) of Bill C-61 penalty amounts may be 
increased or decreased based on the degree of intention or 
negligence on the part of the person who committed the violation, 
the amount of harm done by the violation and the compliance 
history of the person who committed the violation.
<P>
	In terms of Motion No. 3 the legislation has to remain as is to 
give the flexibility needed to enforce compliance.
<P>
	On Motion No. 4, as I understand it the basic purpose of the 
Reform amendment is to have a notice of violation to identify the 
designated person serving the notice. I do not see the need for that. 
The bill allows that a notice may be served by various means.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It is a speeding ticket.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> I try not to get speeding tickets. I might inform the 
hon. member that where I come from in Prince Edward Island we 
do not need to speed to get from place to place, it is such a 
wonderful place to be. I can understand the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster wanting to speed to get to P.E.I. some 
time because of its great people and great industries. We would 
welcome him any time but we will not pay his speeding tickets.
<P>
	The bill allows for a notice to be served by various means and 
the server of a notice may not necessarily be the designated person. 
By definition the designated person is the person who issues the 
notice. Service of the notice is a procedural matter best addressed 
by maintaining a degree of flexibility. The bill allows the matter of 
service of all documents including notices to be addressed by 
regulations, for example paragraph 4(1)(g). The regulations will 
make provision for service in person or by registered mail, which is 
appropriate.
<P>
	On Motion No. 5, the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
could correct me if I am wrong but its purpose is basically to 
legislate a minimum time of 45 days within which a penalty may be 
paid. This is a procedural matter to be determined by regulation. 
There is certainly reason for determining some of the procedures 
by regulation.
<P>
	We must be careful not to be overly restrictive in terms of the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The member mentioned earlier that the department could 
become overly heavy handed. I certainly know that if it became 
overly heavy handed with the current minister it would be 
addressed. I would expect members opposite to be forever watchful 
in that regard. Under this legislation I do not expect the department 
could become overly heavy handed.
<P>
	I will deal specifically with Motion No. 5. To include time 
frames such as these in legislation is impractical because it is very 
difficult to make future changes. Procedural details are generally 
contained in regulations or in policy documents.
<P>
	The regulation process is open and fair. The preparation and 
drafting of regulations include consultation with the industry and 
the prepublication of regulations in <I>The Canada Gazette</I>, part I. 
The process will ensure that a reasonable time frame is put in 
regulation for the payment of a monetary penalty. It gives us some 
flexibility in reviewing it in the future to redress it through 
regulation. It might be easier to take the member's concerns into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15853"> 15853 </A></B>
<P>
consideration in the future, maintaining that flexibility by way of 
regulation.
<P>
	The purpose of Motion No. 18 is to clarify that the expenses 
recoverable by Her Majesty with respect to the disposal of forfeited 
goods are reasonable. I was surprised by the hon. member's 
comments that maybe the minister would hire Lloyds of London to 
sell some goods. As he very well knows the government-and 
sometimes it is to the point of being of concern to some of us-is 
very concerned about how departments spend their limited dollars.
<P>
	The House could be assured that the government or the ministry 
would not spend money in an unreasonable way. I challenge the 
member on the comment that we would go that far astray. It has 
always been the government's intention to administer the bill in a 
reasonable way. One thing about the government is that it does not 
need everything in legislation to be reasonable. We are a reasonable 
bunch to begin with and that is very well known in the community.
<P>
	The last motion is Motion No. 19. Its intent is to enable a 
violator to rely on the defence of due diligence. We would have to 
oppose it. Bill C-61 allows for the issuance of monetary penalties 
on the basis of absolute liability. The department only needs to 
prove the alleged violator committed an act in violation of the 
regulations. The bill does not allow a defence of due diligence by 
which a violator can avoid liability by establishing that he or she 
was not negligent.
<P>
	Under Bill C-61 there is no possibility of imprisonment, no 
record of conviction for an offence created, and penalties are 
modest rather than punitive in nature. Because of these factors 
there is no constitutional or other legal impediment to proceeding 
on the basis of absolute liability. It is worth mentioning that 
although the due diligence defence does not apply, other common 
law defences are available to a person to whom a notice of violation 
is issued. Those are my comments on the motions.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this group of motions and to some 
extent to the thrust of the bill.
<P>
	I represent an urban area, not a rural area. One might be curious 
as to why a city boy is standing up to talk on an agricultural bill. 
My family and I eat the food, I acknowledge that. We depend on 
this constituency for survival.
<P>
	I did take an interest in the bill from when it was first introduced 
in the House. Initially it raised some concerns with me. These 
concerns were expressed to the ministry and to colleagues. They 
were reduced to writing, it was not just talk. In the end I see the 
department has adapted  the bill and made changes at committee. 
We are still making a few minor changes in the House.
<P>
	What is really significant here is that the House will delegate to a 
department an administrative penalty program that involves a huge 
constituency, the whole agricultural community. Up until now the 
House has not delegated that kind of authority. The ability to 
police, to levy penalties and fines has usually been in the field of 
criminal law.
<P>
	We do not delegate that kind of authority out of the House 
without making sure it is set out very specifically in our laws. In 
this case we have. It was done earlier in relation to airports and the 
field of aviation, however, in that area we are dealing with a very 
small constituency. Here we are doing it with the agricultural 
community and thousands and thousands of Canadians will be 
participating in and subject to this new administrative monetary 
penalty system.
<P>
	We must be vigilant in the House, as I know all members are. 
The opposition is certainly vigilant, which is its job. My colleagues 
on the government side have been vigilant about how this process 
is to evolve.
<P>
	We should look at other areas of Canadian life where there are 
rules and penalties. One that comes to mind, which is a little 
bizarre, is the National Hockey League in which Canadians play 
hockey for a living and voluntarily subject themselves to a system 
of rules. On the ice, hockey players can be fined and suspended. 
Granted it is a very small constituency but it happens in other areas 
of amateur hockey in Canada as well.
<P>
	In this case we are talking about the entire agricultural 
community. As the minister has pointed out, it has bought into the 
new system. It is a recognition of evolution and modern 
government that the old way of doing things does not work any 
more. It is too cumbersome. Just because somebody ends up with a 
badly shaped potato should not be a matter subject to a criminal 
offence or a quasi-criminal offence.
<P>
	We have a new system evolving here and I think we will make it 
work. The government has adapted and recognized the extreme 
difficulty in applying standards of strict and absolute liability. 
While in the beginning we perhaps were not as sensitive to the 
issues involved, as my colleague from Malpeque pointed out, the 
department and the legislation have the issue down very well.
<P>
	The motions for further changes to the bill by the opposition are 
useful for the record even if my colleagues on this side of the 
House do not accept them all. I know some have been. However, it 
is a further good faith attempt to refine this legislation so that it 
will work to the benefit of Canadians.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15854"> 15854 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to indicate my support for the bill generally. I am 
sorry I cannot support all the opposition motions for amendment. 
The minister has the proper system and it will fly well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise on the bill a second time.
<P>
	Within my riding there are urban areas and there is also a large 
rural area where agricultural producers provide the food which we 
all eat and enjoy.
<P>
	With respect to this motion I will go over a number of the 
proposals for change put forward by members opposite. There is a 
motion which seeks to vary the maximum allowable penalty 
between the first and subsequent violations. While there could be 
some merit to these suggestions, in light of the fact that the current 
maximum penalties are relatively modest, it would not be in our 
interests to start making distinctions between first and subsequent 
violations for the purpose of setting a maximum penalty which 
could be assessed. That does not mean that where there is a 
subsequent violation a larger penalty could not be assessed.
<P>
	The legislation allows for maximum flexibility when 
determining the level of penalty to be assessed when regulations 
have been violated. This flexibility takes into consideration the 
compliance history in determining the level of the fine. That is, it 
does not automatically lead to a greater fine. One must also 
consider all of the circumstances surrounding the alleged violation 
in determining the penalty.
<P>
	In clause 4(3)(a) of Bill C-61 the penalty amounts can be 
increased or decreased based on the degree of intention or 
negligence on the part of the person who committed the violation, 
the amount of harm done by the violation and the compliance 
history of the person who committed the violation. Therefore we 
have a system in which all factors are considered in dealing with 
the maximum level of penalty to be set.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 proposes that the designated person serving the 
notice of violation be identified. The bill seeks to achieve 
administrative simplicity, an inexpensive yet effective system. This 
is one of the quasi-judicial procedures required by the legislation. I 
do not believe it would be efficient to have individuals designated 
within the legislation. By the definition included within the 
legislation, the designated person issues the notice.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The service of the notice is simply a procedural matter. What we 
want to see is a flexible yet efficient system for ensuring that the 
violator of a regulation gets notice. We also want to ensure we are 
not overburdened with large expenses or complicated mechanisms 
to get the notice to the person.
<P>
	The amendments to the act will allow for the provision of service 
to the person by registered mail. The nature of the offence is a very 
important factor when considering how a person should be served 
or notified of the offence. These offences are absolute liability 
offences. Therefore the procedural requirements to ensure 
notification, et cetera, are at a minimum level.
<P>
	At the other end of the scale we have criminal law, the violation 
of which requires a lot more procedural care, a very much higher 
standard of proof. Because these offences are of a minor regulatory 
nature, the service need not be such that it leads to any type of 
inefficiency.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 5, there is the suggestion to legislate 
the minimum time of 45 days within which a penalty may be paid. 
Dealing with time frames within legislation, at one time in our 
system of government it may have been quite reasonable to include 
within legislation time frames within which penalties may be paid 
or within which certain actions may be taken. However, as our 
legislative requirements have grown it has become more 
complicated.
<P>
	Acts have become far more comprehensive. We are dealing with 
what goes into an act and what should be within the regulations. 
Acts are not easily amended or changed. Therefore if a provision in 
an act such as a time frame is found to not function properly we 
may be stuck with that time frame for a considerable length of time 
if we are looking at amending legislation to get the change.
<P>
	What is being proposed is that these time frames be contained 
within the regulation where it is appropriate. If found to be 
unworkable or in need of an amendment they can be changed with 
the minimum amount of disruption to the system. In a cheap, 
effective manner they can be changed as quickly as is practical. 
This is what insertion of time frames within the regulations would 
allow.
<P>
	Motion No. 18 is another motion to insert the word reasonable 
within the statute. It is to clarify that expenses recovered by the 
crown in respect of the disposal of forfeited goods are reasonable. 
While this was not in the legislation, certainly it was always the 
intention of the department to be reasonable in the charges and 
requirements it makes of people who forfeit goods. This is implied 
within the legislation.
<P>
	The term reasonable would no doubt be implied in the legislation 
anyway. Obviously where the goods are forfeited they will not be 
able to make exorbitant charges. There are limitations.
<P>
	The Reform Party has put forward a sensible amendment which 
reflects the intent of the legislation and which therefore should be 
accepted. It shows the openness of the government and the 
minister. It shows a lot of flexibility, and I appreciate that 
flexibility on the part of the minister.

<P>
	The issue of allowing the violator to rely on the due diligence 
defence has been carefully addressed by a number of my other 
colleagues. I will echo those remarks.
<P>
	Once again, I appreciate the effort that has gone into making this 
bill such a success. Congratulations to the minister for yet another 
fine piece of work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, it has been 
brought to my attention that there is one more error in the Order 
Paper. I would like to bring that to the attention of the House to 
make sure it is corrected.
<P>
	On my Motion No. 11 in the Order Paper and Notice Paper it 
states: ``That Bill C-61, in clause 10, be amended by adding after 
line 31, on page 7, the following'', and it goes on to state my 
amendment. That in fact is an error. The amendment falls after line 
11, not line 31. If we look in the bill it raises it on page 7 before 
subclause (5) rather than after subclause (5).
<P>
	I suspect that those members who looked at this carefully and 
perhaps felt they could not support the amendment when they saw 
where it was supposed to be will change their position and support 
my amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. The table 
officers will check into this matter and the Speaker will get back to 
the House on that issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am indeed delighted to have the opportunity 
to address this House on the subject of Bill C-61, as I represent a 
region where agriculture is fundamental, where it is one of the 
underlying sectors of the economy.
<P>
	I would first like to congratulate the minister and all the 
members of the House standing committee, who studied the bill 
and have proposed amendments.
<P>
	I think Bill C-61 is further proof that our government has paid 
heed, throughout this 35th Parliament, to all that Canadians from 
coast to coast have said about the need for the various levels of 
government and the different departments to manage time and 
money more effectively.
<P>
	When producers have less bureaucracy to deal with and less of 
an investment in time to make the result is a lower product cost; the 
financial benefits they reap are passed on to food product 
consumers. In the end, less bureaucracy and less time invested for 
producers means a lower product cost, which consumers also 
enjoy.
<P>
	However, when we look at Bill C-61, we note that all the 
measures to protect Canadian consumers are still there, along with 
the added protection afforded by the effective action of 
departmental officials.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This additional protection for all those who violate the various 
agriculture-related bills will make it possible to adjust their 
penalties immediately.
<P>
	And I also think we will save money if we transfer all these 
penalties with the possibility of an appeal before a quasi-judicial 
tribunal. In this way we are saving both time and the taxpayers' 
money the federal government would otherwise spend to bring all 
these violators before the courts. The violators themselves may not 
have to appear in court, but we all know about legal fees and what it 
costs to be represented in court. What is particularly important in 
this bill, as in other bills and measures initiated by our government 
in the past two years, is that it will make our economy, our 
bureaucracy and our judicial system more efficient.
<P>
	I think that is what I see as the central focus of all bills on 
agriculture, because that is what Canadians from coast to coast 
have asked us to do, and we acted accordingly. We did this in a 
number of departments. I want to commend the Minister of 
Agriculture for having the foresight to make changes in these bills 
so that we can be more efficient.
<P>
	According to the text of the bill and the proposed amendments, 
the bill will allow the imposition of penalties through an 
administrative process, in addition to the criminal sentences 
authorized by law. The department's officials will be able to set 
penalties of up to $15,000, based on various criteria provided in the 
form of tables in the regulations.
<P>
	It is also worth mentioning that all consultations with the 
agricultural sector were held before the bill was prepared. When a 
governments acts in good faith, all the people involved in the bill 
appreciate the various consultation mechanisms we set up and 
support the various options we provide. The bill also provides for a 
reduction of the penalty when the offender pays it within the time 
limit without challenging it or demanding a hearing to reduce it.
<P>
	This is another measure that will allow all stakeholders, 
including governments, producers and those who market agri-food 
products across the country, to become more effective and efficient 
and to benefit from large scale savings.
<P>
	In fact, the industry supports the consulting process and the work 
done by the standing committee on this bill because we indeed have 
the effective enforcement of Canadian standards, especially with 
respect to imported products.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Regarding the importation of agri-food products into our country 
and the time required to process offenders through the judicial 
system, we can take measures on site to discipline these offenders 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15856"> 15856 </A></B>
<P>
under the threat of monetary penalties. We can provide even 
greater, almost immediate protection for Canadian consumers.
<P>
	When I look at the various aspects of this bill and of some 
amendments put forward by the standing committee, I think that 
our government has taken a giant step in assuming its 
responsibilities toward our agricultural industry and toward 
Canadian consumers. I have no hesitation in supporting this bill 
and the amendments proposed by the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The table officers have considered the 
matter raised by the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister. 
He is absolutely correct. It changes nothing. It will be amended in 
accordance with his sharp-eyed advice to the Chair. We thank him 
for making that correction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my comments perhaps will be somewhat limited, because 
I plan to deal with only one aspect of the legislation. That aspect 
deals with Motion No. 19 and the suggestion that the defence of 
due diligence should apply to the legislation.
<P>
	As much as I believe in the system of justice we have and that we 
must always put in all defences possible for the enforcement of 
laws and the defendant should have defences such as due diligence, 
et cetera, available, I am suggesting that the motion should be 
defeated and that such a defence should not be allowed and not be 
applicable in a bill such as Bill C-61. There are a number of reasons 
why I suggest this. It comes from looking at the system we have in 
Canada in the food processing industry, which is perhaps one of the 
best in the world. If we allowed such a defence of due diligence to 
apply, we would be diluting the system we have. We would be 
regressing rather than progressing.
<P>
	Let me give an example of a possible occurrence. I have earned 
money in the past by defending individuals using defences like 
this. Let me give an example of why the system perhaps should not 
have this particular defence.
<P>
	If an importer brings in a particular product, whether it be 
cheese, bread or whatever, and there is something wrong with the 
product and it is contrary to the legislation and therefore subject to 
penalty under this statute, the person could be brought forward and 
could claim due diligence. He could say: ``I contacted the 
manufacturer and he absolutely guaranteed that there was nothing 
wrong with this product. The foreign processor told me that every 
precaution was taken to make sure this food was safe. The foreign 
processor told me that spot checks, et cetera, have been done on 
this food and it is fine. I have used all due diligence in making sure 
the product is safe.''
<P>
	If the defence is available, the person should not be subject to the 
penalties. That certainly does not help the consumer who may be 
ingesting this food and getting ill or perhaps even dying from that 
food. The importer must go further.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	If the importer is subject to the penalties in this act, the importer 
must be in a position to say: ``I did spot checks. I tested this food 
and I made certain it was safe''. It is not good enough because if 
due diligence applied, the importer could always rely on it and 
always bring in unsafe food although the processor in the foreign 
country indicated it was good enough.
<P>
	We require this rule so foreign processors cannot bypass the 
safety standards of our country. We require it so that if the importer 
is in violation of this act, the importer can go back to the foreign 
processor and say: ``What you told me was not good enough. You 
must take other steps to ensure and guarantee this product is good. 
If you do not do that, I will change suppliers because I do not want 
to be brought forward again and punished for being in 
contravention of the act''. That is why due diligence should not 
apply.
<P>
	Due diligence is applicable in many other areas of our justice 
system but should not be in the food processing industry. Again, 
this shows why Canada has one of the best food systems in the 
world. If we allow such a defence we are going to be regressing 
rather than progressing in the future, regressing because errors will 
not be corrected and the same problems will arise. If we allow it, 
this would be small comfort to an individual who might ingest an 
adulterated food that might cause serious injury or possibly even 
death.
<P>
	The system put in place by Bill C-61 is a quick system. It is 
effective but it will not be painless. It cannot be painless. There has 
to be some pain but it does not have to be overly excessive. The 
person who violates the provisions of the bill must be brought to 
task for what has been done. However, Bill C-61 does not provide 
for imprisonment. It does not give the person a record of conviction 
of an offence and the penalties are rather modest but they are 
punitive to some extent and therefore serve the purpose required. 
The person who is contravening the legislation does not want to be 
brought back over and over.
<P>
	Absolute liability offences are absolutely necessary in the food 
industry. They are absolutely necessary to protect people. Everyone 
knows this. I am sure the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
knows how important it is that any grain produced on his farm is 
not adulterated, that it has not been treated or accidentally 
adulterated with some chemicals, then sold and put into the food 
processing chain for someone else to eventually consume. It is as 
important there as it is in the processing industry. It is as important 
there as it is in the importing business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15857"> 15857 </A></B>
<P>
	How do we deal with it? Do we adopt a system where a person 
ends up going through a regulatory system with charges laid and 
the process going on and on? People like me in my other world 
relish such a system where things would work well for me. Or 
do we put in a system that is effective and efficient? I suggest 
when it is contraventions in the food industry, it has to be done 
quickly. It has to be done effectively because we cannot afford 
to have contraventions that continue over a period of time with 
adulterated food that keeps entering and maintaining itself in the 
food system while the possible contravention is being dealt with 
in the court system. It has to be quick. It as to be effective. The 
health of our public is too important.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	The health of the people to which we export is too important. 
Canada's reputation is too important. We cannot afford to tarnish it 
by having our food system in any way hampered and looked on by 
people in this country and foreign countries, saying: ``We do not 
know if we can rely on it. It is generally a good source, but it is not 
that good a source''. We cannot afford such a reputation. The 
reputation has to be that ours is superior to everyone else, or as 
good as the best that there is.
<P>
	The policy obviously is to maintain a very high standard. We 
must maintain it. It helps exports in the future and it certainly helps 
in the production and the processing of products.
<P>
	As indicated by the hon. member for Malpeque, other common 
law defences are still available to a person. Due diligence is not the 
be all and end all if we do not accept it.
<P>
	For the reasons I have given, I suggest that due diligence should 
not be a defence. Motion No. 19 should fail.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a brief word or two with respect to 
the motions that are in Group No. 3, Motions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 18 and 
19. The members who have already spoken in detail about these 
proposed amendments have very clearly indicated why the 
majority of them are either inappropriate or unnecessary. I would 
like to congratulate the members who have participated in the 
debate on these motions in putting forward the arguments very 
clearly.
<P>
	I would like to indicate that Motion No. 18 is fundamentally 
acceptable. As a matter of legal interpretation, it may not be 
absolutely necessary, but as the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster indicated earlier with respect to Motion 
No. 10, if it is the government's intention to proceed in a 
reasonable manner, which obviously it is, then is there any harm 
done by including that specific word reasonable?
<P>
	In the circumstances pertaining to Motion No. 18, it may as a 
matter of legal interpretation be a bit  redundant. Some may say it 
is sort of gilding the lily, but it is clearly the government's intention 
to administer the bill in a reasonable fashion. If it improves the 
perception of the legislation by accepting Motion No. 18 and 
including the word reasonable in this context, the government has 
absolutely no problem with that. Motion No. 18 is certainly 
acceptable in this group of motions, whereas we would have to vote 
against Motions Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 19.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be 
able to speak this morning on the agriculture and agri-food 
administration of monetary penalties act. It is good legislation in 
the circumstances.
<P>
	Presently, when an inspector under the agri-food act determines 
that offences have been committed under the statute, he must 
proceed through the criminal justice system and the whole process 
gets rolling. An information is laid through the attorney general's 
office, appearances begin in court, adjournments are made, the cost 
and time of not only the court administration, the cost of defence 
counsel, the cost of prosecuting counsel and the time it takes from 
beginning to end could be months if not years, depending on what 
the situation is.
<P>
	The alternative method proposed in Bill C-61 is to establish a 
system of administrative monetary penalties, so that an inspector 
when he determines that an offence has taken place under the 
agri-food act, can impose a fine on the offender immediately, rather 
than proceeding through the judicial system. I think that is a very 
good procedure to be following.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The objective is to create a system that allows the officials of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada to issue monetary penalties for 
serious or repeated violations of the regulations. The monetary 
penalties vary from $15,000 for companies to $2,000 for 
individuals. The legislation also establishes an independent 
tribunal to hear appeals of the proposed monetary penalties. 
Safeguards are still built into the system.
<P>
	The AMP, if I may refer to that acronym, adds to the 
enforcement options available to agri-food prosecutors. The 
system still provides the department with appropriate responses 
when dealing with the violations of regulations such as in the 
marketing of inedible food products or the inhumane transportation 
of animals.
<P>
	The term administrative monetary penalty is used to differentiate 
the monetary penalties which are administrative in nature from 
fines which are imposed by the court system for convictions of 
regulatory offences.
<P>
	I will speak to some of the motions involved, but I submit that 
this is good government. It still provides a framework wherein 
Canada's high standards for food safety are maintained. That is 
essential. We are also assisting Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15858"> 15858 </A></B>
<P>
to enforce  health and safety standards consistently, not only for 
imported foods but for domestic food products as well.
<P>
	Further, we are regulating in a more efficient and cost effective 
way. In this time of restraint, cost effectiveness is a very important 
item. Therefore, we are going to require less time and money to 
pursue these offences than we would otherwise do through the 
provincial court system.
<P>
	The maintenance of a safe food supply is essential and Bill C-61 
allows for the issuance of monetary penalties and is necessary to 
encourage industries to adhere. We do not really want them 
punished if they do not comply but we do want compliance. It is 
necessary that they adhere to these regulations such as in the areas 
of pesticides and animal and plant health. On matters touching 
food, the food chain and public health standards of conduct, they 
must be extremely high and the reasons are obvious.
<P>
	I would also like to refer to the competitiveness of Bill C-61. I 
suggest that it supports the competitiveness of the agricultural 
sector by responding to requests for more equitable enforcement of 
regulations for imported and domestic products. Our domestic 
industry has complained for years that the standards for safety and 
quality are more strictly applied to them than to their competitors, 
especially offshore competitors and that is not fair.
<P>
	Our industry supports the system because it allows Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada to respond quickly and effectively when 
importers or domestic industries market products that do not 
conform to our high standards in the area of food safety or in the 
safe use of pesticides. Equal enforcement of these standards for 
both imports and domestics enhances the competitiveness of the 
agricultural sectors.
<P>
	Giving Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada the proper tools to 
effectively enforce these standards will help it to maintain 
Canada's fine reputation for healthy and safe food products. It is 
the reputation of our agri-food sector that suffers when exported 
products do not meet our health standards. They blame it on us, as a 
domestic supplier and that is not fair. Let us bring it all up to the 
same standards.
<P>
	As an alternative to prosecution and with my background, I think 
this is a very key item in times of restraint. In the current climate of 
restraint, we need simple, efficient, cost effective ways for dealing 
with industries that do not comply with the regulations for food 
health and safety. Bill C-61 provides a fair but quick and expedient 
method for responding to regulatory violations.
<P>
	The administrative procedure provided by Bill C-61 is an 
alternative to prosecuting regulatory offences in the provincial 
courts. It is faster and far less costly to both the department and the 
offender. We have to also  remember the offender has to put up the 
cost of legal counsel and is away from the business, et cetera.
<P>
	Administrative penalties are another step in the 
decriminalization of regulatory infractions. Unlike the situation 
where regulatory principles are prosecuted by the courts, Bill C-61 
creates a decriminalized system. It does not provide for 
imprisonment or receiving a record of conviction of an offence. We 
do not want to make criminals out of these people, but we do want 
them to comply.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Administrative monetary penalties are a much fairer way of 
enforcement for most regulatory infractions. When it hurts you in 
the pocketbook, it hurts. A record may be a stigma in perpetuity, 
but when you have to come up with some hard cash out of your 
pocket you often think twice, and deservedly so.
<P>
	Another aspect is negotiated settlement possibilities. This allows 
for negotiated solutions to non-compliance. What we really want 
them to do is comply. Even the monetary penalties can be reduced 
to zero if they would use the money to buy corrective equipment. 
Immediate action to correct the situation is much better than money 
into the coffers of the judicial system.
<P>
	I might address some of the motions that have been put forward. 
Dealing perhaps with Motion No. 3, to vary the maximum penalty 
between first and subsequent violations, the current maximum 
penalties are relatively modest when we look at them. The bill does 
not make any distinction between first and subsequent violations 
for the purposes of setting a maximum penalty that could be 
assessed. However, the regulations will determine a base penalty in 
the range amount and circumstances under which the penalties may 
be increased or reduced.
<P>
	Compliance history is one of the factors we set out in the 
regulations. Penalties will be reduced for violators with no 
previous history of non-compliance and increased for those who 
commit subsequent offences, as they deservedly should. Under 
subclause 4(3) of Bill C-61, penalty amounts may be increased or 
decreased based on the degree of intention or negligence on the part 
of the person who committed the violation, the amount of harm 
done by the violation, and the compliance history of the person 
who committed the offence.
<P>
	Perhaps I could address Motion No. 4. The purpose is to have a 
notice of violation identify the designated person serving the 
notice. Service is an essential point of any court proceeding, and 
sometimes technicalities arise on service that result in the offender 
walking from the situation.
<P>
	I suggest that the bill allows that a notice may be served by 
various means. That is progression. The server of the notice may 
not necessarily be the designated person. By definition, the desig-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15859"> 15859 </A></B>
<P>
nated person is the person  who issues the notice. Service of the 
notice is a procedural matter and is best addressed by maintaining a 
degree of flexibility. We want to be flexible.
<P>
	The bill allows that the matter of service of all documents, 
including notices, will be addressed by regulations. For example, 
the regulation will make provision for service in person or by 
registered mail. We have these procedures in other court systems, 
in family law, et cetera. That is not unreasonable.
<P>
	The purpose of Motion No. 5 is to legislate a minimum of 45 
days within which a penalty may be paid. Again I suggest that this 
is a procedural matter which could be determined by the regulation. 
To put time frames such as this in legislation really is impractical. 
It makes it very difficult to make changes in the event that the 
penalty could not be paid within the time frame.
<P>
	Procedural details are generally contained in regulations or in 
policy documents. That is where they belong. The regulation 
making process really is open and fair. The preparation and 
drafting of regulations includes consultation with industry and the 
prepublication of the regulations in The Canada Gazette to give 
everyone sufficient notice. The process will ensure that a 
reasonable time frame is put in regulations for the payment of a 
monetary penalty. They are not going to escape. We have to be 
reasonable. Forty-five days may not be, as the minister of 
agriculture has suggested.
<P>
	Motion No. 18 seems acceptable to us. The object of the motion 
is to clarify that expenses recoverable by Her Majesty in respect of 
the disposal of forfeited goods are reasonable. We want to be 
reasonable and we accept this motion as certainly reasonable in that 
situation.
<P>
	The purpose of Motion No. 19 is to enable a violator to rely on 
the defence of due diligence. Bill C-61 allows for the issuance of 
monetary penalties based on absolute liability. That situation 
happens when the department only needs to prove that the alleged 
violator committed an act that was in violation of the regulations. 
The bill does not allow for the defence of due diligence by which a 
violator can avoid liability for the offence by establishing that he or 
she was not negligent.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Under Bill C-61 there is no possibility of imprisonment. There is 
no record of conviction for an offence. Penalties are modest rather 
than punitive in nature. Because of these factors there is no 
constitutional or other legal impediment to proceeding on the basis 
of absolute liability.
<P>
	From a policy perspective, the use of absolute liability is 
essential to encourage the food industry to exhibit a high standard 
of care. This is important for matters involving the food chain and 
is consistent with the approach of courts in civil matters. The 
concept of absolute liability is important to the effectiveness of the 
system as a preventive measure.
<P>
	We had the situation of some children being allergic to peanut 
butter. There was a very important incident where a young lady 
reacted to peanut butter and died rather quickly.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 20</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Clause 19 be amended by striking out line 19 on page 11 and substituting the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``violation are reviewed by the Minister or by the Tribunal, the Minister must''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 23</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-61, in Clause 29, be amended by adding after line 37, on page 14, the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(3) For greater certainty, no lobbyist or party to a contract with the public service 
of Canada shall be appointed as a member of the Board or the Tribunal.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, our caucus should have discovered the 
word reasonable a long time ago. Perhaps we would have more 
good laws passed in the House of Commons. I wish we had used 
that in Bill C-68, the gun control bill. We probably would not have 
had  registration. And maybe we would not have had Bill C-64 
introduced at all.
<P>
	In any event, back to Bill C-61. I appreciate support from the 
other side for a couple of my amendments, which were reasonable 
and included the word reasonable and were adopted by the House.
<P>
	We have now moved on to the fourth group of motions. I will 
address Motion No. 20, which deals with clause 19. It strikes out 
line 16 and substitutes the following: ``violation are reviewed, the 
minister or the tribunal''. Currently in this clause it is stated: ``In 
every case where the facts of a violation are reviewed, the minister 
must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the person named 
in the notice of violation''.
<P>
	This ensures that the facts of a violation should be reviewed both 
by the minister and by the tribunal. It is not a matter of either or, 
but in fact it is both. This again is a common sense amendment. It 
ensures that the burden of proof is on the minister in the case of a 
ministerial review. It ensures that there is burden of proof on the 
tribunal when a case of a violation is referred to the tribunal. This is 
just good common practice. It is sensible. It again puts some 
qualifiers and quantifiers into the legislation to make it not only 
effective but also balanced and fair.
<P>
	I cannot see why members on the opposite side would have any 
problem whatsoever with this amendment. Therefore I encourage 
them to support it.
<P>
	Moving on to Motion No. 23 which deals with clause 29, this 
motion adds after line 37 on page 14 a new subclause (3), which 
would say: ``For greater certainty, no lobbyist or party to a contract 
with the Public Service of Canada shall be appointed as a member 
of the board or the tribunal''.
<P>
	The clause prior to that says: ``A member of the tribunal shall 
not accept or hold any office or employment that is inconsistent 
with the member's duties or take part in any matter before the 
tribunal in which the member has an interest''. We certainly 
support that clause, but it does not go far enough. All it says is that 
a member of the tribunal shall not be able to enter into a contract 
with the federal government. What it does not preclude though is 
the actual appointment to the board of a lobbyist or someone with a 
contract with the public service.
<P>
	We have had a rather negative light cast upon government and 
upon politicians for quite some time because of the ethics we 
impose upon ourselves. That perhaps might be better stated as a 
lack of ethics we impose upon ourselves. Yes, there are conflict of 
interest guidelines. As you are well aware, Mr. Speaker, there has 
been some question as to the effectiveness of the conflict of interest 
guidelines currently, even upon us as members of Parliament. 
There is concern in the public sector that conflict of interest 
guidelines be rigid, clear and enforced.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15861"> 15861 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Other legislation precludes members of Parliament or members 
of provincial legislatures from serving on a board or body such as 
this tribunal. However what is not precluded is the fact that 
lobbyists, people who are working for the public service and have a 
vested interest in the work of the tribunal, are currently not 
excluded from appointment. This dips into the whole area of 
patronage appointments that are repulsive to Canadians. It seems 
that lobbyists have an inside track and are able to have influence 
behind the scenes far beyond their worth.
<P>
	I suggest the House support Motion No. 23 that goes one step 
further than the conflict of interest in clause 29(2) by stipulating 
that no government lobbyist or person who has a contract with the 
federal government may be appointed to the tribunal. I appreciate 
the progress we have made this morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will deal 
with the two motions in Group No. 4.
<P>
	On Motion No. 20, again showing how reasonable we are, I 
agree with the motion. The amendment possibly brings a little 
more clarity to the bill. It clarifies that the minister carries the 
burden of proof in both the ministerial review and the review by the 
tribunal that the person named in the notice of violation committed 
the violation. This is precisely what the current wording of the bill 
provides. I have no objection to accepting the proposed 
amendment; maybe it clarifies the matter a little further. It shows 
how reasonable we are on this side of the House.
<P>
	The intent of the legislation is to set up the administrative 
monetary penalties act. At present an inspector with responsibility 
for enforcing the agri-food act determines there has been an 
offence under the statute. There has been much mention that he or 
she should proceed through the criminal justice system to obtain a 
penalty for the offence. The inspector must file a complaint with 
the attorney general who will, where appropriate, commence 
proceedings against the offender.
<P>
	Currently whenever a penalty is sought, the entire judicial 
system must be brought to bear regardless of the seriousness of the 
offence. The expense and delay inherent in the procedure is often 
disproportionate to the particular offence. In some cases the fines 
imposed are very small and in other cases they create a criminal 
record, which is perhaps too severe a penalty.
<P>
	In terms of seeking an alternative the government established a 
system of administrative monetary penalties so that an inspector 
who determines there has been a violation of the agri-food act 
could impose a fine on the offender immediately rather than 
proceed through the judicial system. Basically the government is 
creating efficiencies in government, being fair and reasonable to  
all and protecting the interests of the public under the act.
<P>
	I will mention a couple of points and why the minister must 
carry the burden of proof. There is a lot at stake and it is important 
the minister carry the burden of proof. The administrative 
monetary penalty system will be one that allows the FPI to levy 
monetary penalties for non-compliance with branch acts and 
regulations. As has been mentioned by others in the debate, it is 
less costly, would not tie up the court system and creates a great 
deal of efficiency.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The administrative monetary penalty system will lead to more 
equitable enforcement of regulations by allowing the department to 
take effective action against importers and domestic companies 
marketing products that do not meet Canadian health, safety and 
quality standards.
<P>
	As the system starts to evolve, the industry will recognize the 
pressure the new system puts on it. The industry will continue to 
comply with the regulations without having to get into any great 
enforcement measures. That is important. That is the objective of 
the system. The criminal prosecution system will remain an option 
and is available should it become necessary.
<P>
	It is important that monetary penalties can be offset through 
compliance agreements. The proposal is to reduce the fine by $1 
for every $2 a company spends on new equipment, process changes 
or staff training to prevent the recurrence of non-compliance. That 
is also an incentive for the industry to comply with the regulations. 
In this way the system emphasizes compliance, not punishment for 
behaviour, which is certainly a great step in the right direction. The 
administrative monetary penalty system fits with the government's 
regulatory review agenda to improve regulatory effectiveness and 
decriminalize most regulatory offences.
<P>
	The intent of Motion No. 20 is a good one and can be supported. 
However Motion No. 23 is a horse of a different colour and I cannot 
support it. The amendment provides that ``no lobbyist or party to a 
contract with the Public Service of Canada shall be appointed as a 
member of the board or the tribunal''.
<P>
	The bill requires that members of the tribunal have technical 
qualifications related to the areas of agriculture and agri-food and 
are not in positions of conflict of interest relative to the matter 
before them. In addition, it has been clearly set out that no member 
of the tribunal may be employed in the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
	The intent of Motion No. 23 is taken care of in other ways. If one 
were to incorporate the amendment, in essence it would make the 
legislation more cumbersome. In effect Motion No. 23 is 
unnecessary and I have to oppose it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15862"> 15862 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in dealing with this group of amendments I will address 
two related and relevant issues.
<P>
	Our efforts to fine tune the legislation in the House and earlier in 
committee have been primarily directed toward ensuring a proper 
balance between the rights and liberties of Canadians in the sector 
we are dealing with and the administrative exigencies as they 
evolve in the agricultural sector. Because we are dealing with food, 
in many cases some of the exigencies tend to be relatively urgent 
and require a prompt solution as opposed to a slow, 
administratively cumbersome solution.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	As we strive to seek that balance in the House with the 
legislation, we must keep in mind that the House realizes it cannot, 
as is sometimes said, micro-manage the sector. We simply do not 
have the ability to micro-manage in all detail everything that goes 
on in a particular field. That is why the House by way of regulation 
delegates authority to administrators in government to make 
regulations which deal in a more specific way with the exigencies 
in the field.
<P>
	Even then it is tough. Even then it is probably impossible to 
micro-manage. Many decisions that have to be made are being 
made in a warehouse at a border. Perhaps they are being made in a 
barn somewhere by inspectors and people who are growing and 
transporting the commodity. We ought to resist the urge in the 
House to overly micro-manage the field, and that is why we 
delegate.
<P>
	We are trying to find that balance in the House and that is tricky. 
There is a further challenge for Parliament. Every time we delegate 
we say that we are giving authority or power to an official of the 
government. That official, in concert with the department, will be 
making decisions about property of others and what others can or 
cannot grow and transport in this field.
<P>
	The challenge for Parliament is not so much today; it is down the 
road. We have a committee that deals ex post facto with the 
regulatory authority delegated by the House, the Standing Joint 
Committee for Scrutiny of Regulations. The more the House 
delegates, the more work there is for the standing joint committee. 
Given the large degree of delegation taking place under this statute, 
I see a further challenge for the standing joint committee to deal 
with the scrutiny of this type of regulatory delegation.
<P>
	One criteria of the committee is described as the unintended or 
unexpected use of power. I agree it is perhaps a little fuzzy. 
However, should an official, the department, the minister or the 
cabinet at some future date authorize the taking of a step that could 
be construed as an unexpected or unintended use of power, the 
committee would point it out to the House. The committee also has 
the power of disallowance which it  has used a half a dozen times in 
the last four or five years. It prefers not to do so. It is a procedure 
the House would rather not have the committee use but when 
necessary it does so.
<P>
	To the extent we are delegating and trying to fine tune that 
delegation, there will remain to a greater or lesser degree a 
significant challenge to the committee structure created by the 
House in reviewing the appropriateness of the use of the authority 
and power we delegate.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	It is not to detract from our efforts here to find the right balance 
between rights and liberties and administrative efficiency.
<P>
	I think all members have the same view and I will continue to 
participate in this debate in the hope that we achieve the proper 
balance so the administrators, the minister, the deputy ministers, 
departmental officials and the cabinet will have the right tools and 
the right balance so our citizens will get the best services and the 
best considerations under this statute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to once again address 
some of the motions by members from the other side of the House 
in relation to the agriculture and agri-food administrative monetary 
penalties act.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to allow for expedience and resolution 
to breaches of regulations in the agriculture and agri-food industry. 
It is designed to make it a lot easier for the department and those 
involved in breaches of regulations to resolve their difficulties.
<P>
	It is designed to ensure we get compliance with the regulations 
as soon as is reasonably possible. The bill does not inhibit the 
rights of people accused of violating the respective statutes to have 
the option to gain the full procedural and substantive protection 
that can be gained from the law if they so choose to defend 
themselves in traditional fashion of court hearings and due process. 
This is still available to those who violate the act.
<P>
	The purpose of Motion No. 20 according to hon. members 
opposite is to clarify that the minister and the Government of 
Canada carry the burden of proof in both the ministerial review and 
the review by the tribunal that the person named in the notice of 
violation committed the violation. This is certainly what the 
current wording of the bill provides for.
<P>
	We have no objection to this amendment. This is another 
amendment the minister has accepted from members opposite. 
This shows a responsible attitude by the minister of agriculture in 
the sense that where there are amendments that enhance the act, 
where there are amendments that do not do any harm to what is 
sought to be accomplished by the act, regardless of who brings 
them forward, if they improve the legislation and make it  a bit 
clearer, the government is certainly willing to hear them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15863"> 15863 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation makes clear that the minister carries the burden 
of proof in both the ministerial review and the review by the 
tribunal that the person named in the notice of violation is the one 
who committed the violation. This goes back to one of the 
fundamental bases of the Canadian justice system of due process. 
The system is based on many administrative procedural protections 
granted to people who run afoul of regulatory or sometimes even 
criminal law.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Our common law system has always sought to protect those 
accused of violations, whether regulatory offences, criminal 
offences such as under the highway traffic act, provincial offences 
or somewhere in between. Our legal system always provides 
safeguards to the person accused of the violation commensurate 
with the penalty and the seriousness of the breach involved.
<P>
	Our justice system on a very fundamental basis seeks to ensure 
innocent people are not convicted or not held responsible for 
violations they did not participate in. That is why even within the 
common law I do not think there is even any need to suggest the 
minister carry the burden of proof. The state in matters of breaches 
of criminal violations, regulatory violations and provincial statute 
violations always carries the burden of proof.
<P>
	It is probably better that a few guilty people are acquitted rather 
than innocent people being subjected to the raw power, the sanction 
of the state when they were not guilty of what they were charged 
with.
<P>
	In relation to the first motion, we are accepting it. The 
fundamental principles of Canadian law that the minister carry the 
burden of proof is simply a foregone conclusion and one we accept. 
This is not the case in all countries. Sometimes one is presumed 
guilty and must prove one's innocence. In Canada, the British 
Commonwealth system, the common law system, different 
considerations apply.
<P>
	Motion No. 23 of Group No. 4 seeks to provide that no lobbyist 
or party to a contract with the Public Service of Canada shall be 
appointed as a member of the board or the tribunal.
<P>
	The government in appointing individuals to these tribunals 
always appoints well qualified people who are known for their 
fairness so that people can trust the correctness of the decisions 
made by these tribunals. Each of these appointments is very 
carefully weighed. The people must be qualified in order to 
participate in these issues.
<P>
	Once again common law clearly requires that people with a 
conflict of interest not serve on boards or tribunals such as this. As 
has been the track record of the minister to date in other 
appointments, as well as other ministers  in other departments, the 
people sought to be placed in positions like this are qualified 
people. They will carry out their duties in a manner that will 
respect the government and also the people accused of various 
violations of agriculture and agri-food penalties.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	No one in a conflict of interest will end up on these tribunals. 
They are quasi-judicial bodies and as a result will have to be above 
reproach. Common law provides many administrative remedies 
that could be taken through the courts should there be any 
reasonable apprehension of bias or other grounds on which the 
decision of the appointed person could be put in question.
<P>
	People with these types of connections will simply not be 
appointed. If a situation arises in which there could be any type of 
conflict whatsoever, administrative law procedures are available 
through the courts to ensure people who are being judged in this 
fashion are fully protected.
<P>
	While Motion No. 20 says exactly what the bill says and follows 
the philosophy and basic underpinnings of the law in Canada, the 
minister will be accepting a recommendation to further clarify and 
ensure the law is clear and known.
<P>
	With respect to the second motion, this will be taken care of in 
the same manner the government has done to date. Remedies are 
available to anyone who feels aggrieved by a decision, who feels 
there may be a problem, to deal through the courts with such an 
issue.
<P>
	I again thank the minister for his efforts in bringing these 
changes forward, changes that will certainly improve the-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of Bill C-61.
<P>
	This bill adds to the enforcement option available to certain 
legislation administered by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada by 
allowing administrative monetary penalties to be imposed. The bill 
also authorizes the minister, if requested, to conclude compliance 
agreements with persons who commit violations.
<P>
	Under compliance agreements, administrative monetary 
penalties can be reduced or cancelled if persons agree to take the 
appropriate steps to ensure future compliance with agri-food acts 
and regulations. The administrative monetary penalties are subject 
to review by an independent tribunal. Now every contravention can 
currently be prosecuted.
<P>
	The bill gives the minister an administrative option where 
prosecution is seen to be too harsh a measure. In arriving at his 
decision the minister will be guided by a  compliance and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15864"> 15864 </A></B>
<P>
enforcement policy-I underline the word policy because it gives 
broader perspectives-that establishes the criteria to guide the 
department in making decisions on the use of all enforcement 
controls or options.
<P>
	The policy is a public document. The choice to be made by the 
minister of whether to prosecute or issue a monetary penalty is akin 
to a prosecutorial choice. It is such as we would find in a criminal 
case in which the decision is made as to whether a matter should 
proceed by way of indictment or by summary conviction. Because 
the choice is heavily dependent upon the facts in each situation, 
flexibility is required. This flexibility is best offered by relying on 
policy rather than regulations.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	It has always been the intention to administer this bill in a 
reasonable manner. We on this side of the House are happy to 
accept this approach to the bill. However, compliance agreements 
form an integral part of the proposed scheme. The object of the 
scheme is to obtain compliance rather than to penalize the violator. 
It is a common sense approach to bring those who are the users into 
a compliance mode without using the heavy hand of the law or 
penalties.
<P>
	By authorizing the department to enter into these agreements the 
bill gives the department a tool to negotiate the implementation by 
industry of measures that would change the violator's practices and 
processes. The emphasis here is on change. At the same time, the 
violator may pay a reduced penalty in exchange for committing 
funds to effect the necessary improvements leading to future 
compliance. The bill provides that kind of flexibility.
<P>
	Compliance agreements result in immediate corrective action 
which is the desired result of the bill. Of course, immediate 
corrective action leads to a better product, improved health and 
safety, and more effective enforcement. Compliance agreements 
are optional and no one is forced to enter into them. The bill 
provides an incentive to enter into compliance agreements by 
making it possible to reduce the amount of monetary penalty.
<P>
	The nature of the bill is to achieve compliance. For those who do 
not comply and who are found out, they are counselled into 
compliance. If they do not comply, the second stage is enacted. The 
nature of the bill is to encourage people to comply.
<P>
	Current maximum penalties are relatively modest. The bill does 
not make a distinction between first and subsequent violations for 
the purpose of setting a maximum penalty that could be assessed. 
However, the regulations will determine a base penalty amount and 
the range and circumstances under which the penalties may be 
increased or reduced. The regulations will determine a base penalty 
amount and the range and circumstances. The compliance history 
will be one of the factors set out  in the regulations whereby 
penalties will be reduced for violators with no previous history of 
non-compliance. Again, it is the nature of the action. If there is a 
perceived resistance to compliance the enforcement of the 
regulation is the only tool the government has.
<P>
	Penalty amounts may be increased or decreased based on the 
degree of intention or negligence on the part of the person who 
committed the violation, the amount of harm done by the violation, 
and the compliance history of the person who committed the 
violation. Flowing through this is a series of steps that is known in 
law as the law of natural justice. Was this a one-shot affair? Was 
there fair warning? Was there counselling? That is the rule of the 
land in our country: no one is caught out the first time. In that sense 
it shows fairness. If it is not fair, the person who is charged has the 
right to appeal.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to sit through the clause by clause 
deliberations in committee. A number of very good concerns were 
raised, mainly by the opposition but from the government side as 
well. I see that some of them have been incorporated in this bill. It 
speaks for the bill having some input from members who are not of 
the government party.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I see this adhering to the laws of natural justice and due process 
is outlined clearly in this bill. I would like to review a few points in 
the bill that may give it a bit more light.
<P>
	Bill C-61 allows for issuance of monetary penalties on the basis 
of absolute liability; that is, where the department needs only to 
prove that an alleged violator committed an act that is in violation 
of the regulations. The bill does not allow a defence of due 
diligence by which a violator can avoid liability by establishing 
that he or she was not negligent.
<P>
	Under Bill C-61 there is no possibility of imprisonment, no 
record of conviction for an offence is created, and penalties are 
modest rather than punitive in nature. Because of these factors, 
there is no constitutional or other legal impediment to proceeding 
on the basis of absolute liability.
<P>
	From a policy perspective, the use of absolute liability is 
essential to encourage the food industry to exhibit a high standard 
of care, which the people of Canada expect. This is important for 
matters involving the food chain and consistent with the approach 
the courts take in civil cases. The concept of absolute liability is 
important to the effectiveness of the system as a preventative 
measure.
<P>
	Let me give an example of the standards necessary in the food 
chain. To someone with peanut allergies, even a minute amount of 
peanut dust is enough to send them into an anaphylactic shock. To 
such a person, the issue is not whether a company exercised due 
diligence. When we see the breakout of products, even when we 
have HP  sauce included, it is far more detailed than any other 
country I know of in this world. As a preventative measure, finding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15865"> 15865 </A></B>
<P>
that a product is mislabelled in not indicating the presence of 
peanuts in itself warrants finding liability. That is presently in the 
law.
<P>
	The focus of Bill C-61 is on preventative and remedial action 
and not in finding of fault. The use of absolute liability is also 
provided for in an effective and efficient enforcement system.
<P>
	The resource base for enforcing regulations is shrinking. Bill 
C-61 deliberately designs a simple and efficient system to deal with 
those importers or domestic companies that do not follow our 
health, safety, and quality regulations. It is worth mentioning that 
although the due diligence defence does not apply, other common 
law defences are available to a person to whom the notice of 
violation is issued.
<P>
	Bill C-61 is in my judgment a fair bill, presented and debated 
openly in committee. It follows the natural laws of justice and 
includes due process. On that basis, I give my full support to this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just a couple of brief words 
about the group of motions we are now considering, Group No. 4, 
which deals with Motions 20 and 23.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 20, the purpose of this motion is to 
clarify that the minister of the day essentially carries the burden of 
proof under this legislation in both the ministerial review process 
and the review by the tribunal that is proposed under this 
legislation, the burden of proof that the person named in the notice 
of the violation in fact committed the violation.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	That is how I understand the meaning and intent of the member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminister in putting forward this motion. I 
can say without any shadow of a doubt that if I have understood his 
meaning correctly, that is precisely what the intention of the 
government is in the wording that is presently proposed in this 
provision in Bill C-61.
<P>
	Again in the spirit of co-operation that we demonstrated earlier 
today in other clauses of this bill, if it is the view of hon. members 
that inserting the wording proposed in Motion No. 20 clarifies this 
point, makes it more certain, more definite, I certainly have no 
objection to accepting this proposed amendment. It is completely 
consistent with the government's intention in the first place.
<P>
	I suppose legal scholars and draftsmen could have some 
interesting discussions about how pretty the language is. Those 
superficial arguments notwithstanding, the meaning and intent on 
both sides of the House on  this point are absolutely consistent. I 
have no problem with the amendment the hon. gentleman has put 
forward.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 23, I do have a problem with this 
amendment. The manner of appointment for members of the 
review tribunal by the governor in council that is set out in the 
version of Bill C-61 that we have before us at the present time 
follows a well established practice. It is a practice that has been 
endorsed in this country by the courts of law, assuring the 
independence of the tribunal from outside interference.
<P>
	The bill requires very clearly already, without the amendment 
that is proposed in Motion No. 23, that members of the tribunal 
have the necessary technical qualification related to the area of 
agriculture and agri-food and are not in any position of conflict of 
interest relative to any matters that may come before them for 
adjudication. In addition, specifically, no member of the tribunal 
may be employed in the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
	Those provisions that are already in Bill C-61 adequately cover 
the point that has been raised by my hon. friend in his Motion No. 
23. Therefore I think Motion No. 23 is unnecessary. It could, 
depending upon legal interpretation, add some uncertainties to a 
situation, which I am sure my hon. friend does not intend. I 
presume his intention is to make things more certain and not less 
certain. With the greatest of respect, we would be better off, in 
connection to the subject matter to which Motion No. 23 pertains, 
to leave the draft language as it stands now and reject Motion No. 
23. The substance of Motion No. 23 is already otherwise covered in 
the legislation.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-61, the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary 
Penalties Act.
<P>
	I will explain Motions Nos. 21 and 22, on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois. These motions seek to limit the discretionary power of 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	Clause 29 of Bill C-61 provides that the chairperson and 
members of the review tribunal are appointed by the governor in 
council. Motion No. 21, tabled by us, provides that Bill C-61, in 
Clause 29, be amended by replacing line 5, on page 14, with the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``nor in Council with the approval of the committee of the House of Commons 
that normally considers agricultural matters, one of whom shall be ap-''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As for Motion No. 22, it provides that Bill C-61, in Clause 29, be 
amended by adding immediately after line 6, on page 14, the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(1.1) No person may be appointed to the Tribunal by the Governor in Council 
without the prior approval of the committee of the House of Commons that normally 
considers matters relating to agriculture''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These proposed changes seek to establish a more transparent 
process regarding the appointment of the tribunal's members and 
chairperson. We cannot let the minister appoint members alone. I 
strongly objected to that a few moments ago. If he so wishes, an 
offender could be heard by the review tribunal.
<P>
	In its present form, the bill provides that members of this 
tribunal are appointed by the minister and that their mandate can be 
renewed. These members must review decisions made by 
department officials who, of course, are accountable to the 
minister. Earlier, I alluded to possible conflicts of interest, and I 
still think that such a risk exists.
<P>
	Could people appointed by the minister be pressured into 
making decisions which they would not otherwise make? No 
matter how small the risk, we simply cannot take that chance. It 
would make a lot more sense if members of the tribunal were 
appointed by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-food, after reviewing whether or not certain issues posed 
problems in terms of how they were dealt with.
<P>
	We simply want to avoid any risk of arbitrary decisions or 
patronage appointments. We understand and accept the principle 
underlying that bill, but we oppose any compliance agreement or 
arbitrary appointment by the minister.
<P>
	This is why we are asking this House to at least support the 
amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. I certainly hope that 
we are not the only ones here who seek transparency.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are now dealing with amendments brought 
forward in group No. 5, Motions Nos. 21 and 22, in relation to Bill 
C-61, the agriculture and agri-food administrative monetary 
penalties act. I appreciate the opportunity to address the matter.
<P>
	The purpose of Motions Nos. 21 and 22 is to change the process 
of appointing members of the review tribunal by having the 
governor in council appointments approved by an agriculture 
related committee of the House of Commons before the 
appointments are effective.
<P>
	A point that should be made with regard to this matter is similar 
to one made in relation to an amendment brought forward by the 
Reform Party that the current appointment process and the one in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15867"> 15867 </A></B>
<P>
the present bill and as stated by the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food is a tried and true process, one approved of by the 
courts.  The courts posses the ability to ensure that all decisions are 
according to the administrative law of the land.
<P>
	It is proposed that an agriculture related committee approve the 
people who are put forward to sit on these tribunals to hear disputes 
between the regulators and those who may have run afoul of 
various agriculture and agri-food regulations pursuant to a number 
of acts. What is being proposed is going to make the procedure 
more cumbersome. The whole intent of the legislation is to find 
efficiencies in the way the government does business, to make the 
process cheaper, to ensure that the rules of fundamental 
administrative justice can be achieved and that it is balanced with 
administrative ease.
<P>
	In my view, the proposal adds to the cumbersome nature of the 
appointment process. The time required to deal with the 
appointments will be increased. The committee could refuse to 
recommend any of the incumbents to these positions thereby 
effectively preventing these positions from being filled.
<P>
	It is also important to say that this represents a move toward a 
more American style hearing process for the approval of various 
appointments to positions.
<P>
	If we look south of the border we see these monstrously 
expensive, cumbersome processes to appoint various individuals. 
These individuals are subject to such scrutiny, they are basically 
put in a position where they are unable to defend themselves from 
the most vicious, partisan types of attacks.
<P>
	This takes away from the dignity of a person sitting on a 
quasi-judicial body. It makes it difficult for people of good quality 
to want to subject themselves to this type of situation. Even if they 
are good people and are willing to submit to this type of 
interrogation and partisan attack on their credibility, whether they 
make it through the process or not, they will not be what is needed 
to maintain the respect of both the government regulators and the 
people who have run afoul of various regulations in various 
agricultural statutes.
<P>
	There are a number of reasons why I am opposed to these types 
of situations arising. The situation we have now is tried, it is true. It 
has been upheld by the courts as a method of approving these 
people. It takes away from the partisanship which could really 
detract from the dignity of the process, the dignity of the office of 
the person participating and assisting the country.

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently I 
attended a meeting of the mayors from the Toronto region. At this 
meeting, 30 mayors and five regional chairmen unanimously 
passed a resolution expressing their desire for a united Canada that 
includes Quebec.
<P>
	The resolution reads as follows: ``WHEREAS, the mayors of the 
greater Toronto region have recognized and approved, by the very 
fact of their meeting, the strength and benefits that unity provides; 
WHEREAS the unity of Canada and its people enhances the 
strength of and the benefits accruing to each of our regions; 
WHEREAS approximately four million residents of this region 
have, together with the people of Quebec, built this great country of 
ours; THEREFORE it is resolved that the mayors of the greater 
Toronto region, on behalf of its residents, express their desire to 
support the unity of a Canada that includes Quebec''.

the future of Quebec, it is a question about the future of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (LotbiniÃ¨re, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the vision of 
doom and gloom of the No side has just been refuted in a report 
released by a major American brokerage house. Indeed, the New 
York firm of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette argues that, should the 
sovereignty option prevail, first, the credit rating of the Quebec 
government would not be affected, second, market uncertainty 
would be short-lived, and third, the economic situation would 
remain stable.
<P>
	This is similar to the findings of a recent study undertaken by the 
advisory director of the fourth major commercial bank in the 
United States, who said, and I quote: ``In conclusion, according to 
the rating and the views of the capital markets, if the people opt for 
sovereignty, the most likely result would be between neutral and

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
trucking company in Winnipeg which carries Canadian mail is 
planning to reroute a significant amount of its traffic between 
Montreal and Winnipeg and Toronto and Winnipeg through the 
United States. Test trips are soon to begin with exact locations for 
refuelling laid out in detail to take advantage of savings in fuel 
costs.
<P>
	This raises a number of issues. There is the issue of the higher 
than necessary cost of gasoline in the country and the government's 
refusal to lean on the gas companies to take less of a profit. It also 
shows how the free trade mentality has changed our ways, 
eliminating borders in our minds as well as on paper.
<P>
	In a week when we are properly talking about our love for 
Canada, what are we to say of the fact that Canadian mail addressed 
from one part of Canada to another is being rerouted through the 
United States, thus eroding the tax and economic base that funds 
things like medicare?

found within these borders, not beyond. However the upcoming 
referendum to be held on October 30 will decide whether Canada is 
10 equal provinces or two nations.
<P>
	All provinces should have certain rights. Reformers believe the 
federal government should withdraw from provincial areas such as 
natural resources, manpower training, language and culture, 
housing, et cetera. As an equal province Quebec can work within 
our country for a new federalism which will address its needs for 
change.

other parts of Canada are looking for change as well. I hope on

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
in his speech to the nation, the Prime Minister wanted to reach out 
to Quebecers by telling them, and I quote: ``I have also heard, and I 
understand, that the disappointments of the past are still very much 
alive''.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, on the basis of 
what we heard last night, tell us whether the Prime Minister, like 
the Minister of Labour yesterday afternoon in this House, hopes 
that before they vote in the referendum, Quebecers will forget what 
he did in the course of his career and consider only what he has 
done in the past two years which, in our opinion, is not any more 
reassuring?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, our government has accomplished a great deal since it 
came to power.  Between 1984 and 1993 we were not there, 
unfortunately, but in the February 1995 budget we announced a 
major shift toward decentralization. Through our program review, 
we have to restrict the role of the federal government in the various 
areas for which it is responsible.
<P>
	Furthermore, in addition to offering the provinces a mechanism 
for reducing duplication, we signed 64 agreements to that end 
within the past 18 months, including a dozen agreements with 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs can go ahead and repeat his 
set speech which is meaningless to Quebecers. That is his privilege. 
He decides how to answer the question.
<P>
	I would like to ask him this: Even assuming that Quebecers 
forget the Prime Minister's past, as he asked them to do, and 
consider only the last two years of his mandate, do the minister and 
his colleagues realize that every time the Prime Minister referred to 
the Quebec referendum question, he said it was not in the cards, he 
did not want any of it and even that we would get a drubbing?
<P>
	Does the minister think this is the sort of thing that would make 
Quebecers trust him?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the opposition should be very careful when it attacks the 
past of a man who has dedicated more than 30 years of his life to 
politics and by whom the interests of Quebec and Canada were well 
served.
<P>
	The people in the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois and 
their separatist leaders have made a habit of attacking the person of 
the Prime Minister instead of sticking to the issues. They obviously 
have no more arguments of substance to prove that separation 
would be a good thing, so now they attack personalities. There is no 
doubt that the federation has evolved in a positive way in recent 
years.
<P>
	The hon. member for Roberval says it is meaningless. Is it 
meaningless to acknowledge that the quiet revolution took place in 
Quebec within the federation, within Canada?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Is it meaningless to acknowledge that Quebec's language rights 
were asserted, protected and augmented in recent years within 
Quebec and Canada? Is it meaningless to point out that Quebec 
industrialists have managed to win back Quebec's economy and 
play a far more important role than they did 20, 25 or 30 years ago, 
in Quebec and Canada?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the man 
who is responsible for closing the CollÃ¨ge de Saint-Jean without 
justification has a tendency to talk about issues for which he is 
not responsible. Since he mentioned the Prime Minister's career 
and said the Prime Minister served Quebec well, allow me to quote 
the Prime Minister who said in April 1992, and I will quote him 
verbatim: ``It is pretty obvious what happened. We did not try to 
shaft Quebec, but we did outsmart them''.
<P>
	Considering these comments about Quebec, does the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs think Quebecers should trust the man 
whom the minister is defending and who represents the status quo 
for tomorrow, if Quebecers were to say no in the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy </B><B>Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first of all I may remind the hon. member for Roberval 
that Saint-Jean was one occasion when the ministers of the Parti 
Quebecois failed to deal with the problem. When the PÃ©quistes 
could not agree, we made arrangements with the Conseil 
Ã©conomique du Haut-Richelieu to keep the CollÃ¨ge de Saint-Jean 
open. That is the honest truth.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member quoted what the Prime Minister of 
Canada said a few years ago. Perhaps we should ask the Leader of 
the Opposition what he said when he was a Conservative, or what 
he said when he was with the Union nationale, because he changed 
his position several times. What matters is the truth of what he said, 
not his position at the time.
<P>
	As far as truth is concerned, I would really like to know why, 
when Mr. Bouchard, the Leader of the Opposition, spoke to the 
people of this country last night, what he said in English was so 
different from what he said in French?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, most of the quotes attributed this week to the Prime 
Minister have come from his book, an interesting book worth 
reading.
<P>
	In <I>Le Droit</I> on April 8, 1982, the present Prime Minister, 
Minister of Justice at that time, was quoted as saying he was not in 
the least surprised and was very pleased that the Quebec appeal 
court judges had been unanimous in rejecting Quebec's claim of 
entitlement to a veto.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. How could Quebecers today trust a Prime Minister who 
says that no constitutional change affecting Quebec's powers will 
be made without the consent of the people of Quebec, when that 
same man stated in 1982 that he was not in the least surprised and 
was very pleased that the Quebec appeal court judges  had been 
unanimous in rejecting Quebec's claim of entitlement to a veto?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I see that the opposition is unfortunately resorting to 
personalities and is attempting to assassinate the character of the 
Prime Minister. I feel this is a deplorable tactic. It is a tactic which 
lessens the credibility of the opposition when it is trying to 
convince people it has the ability to govern a country.
<P>
	Because we have proven our ability to govern a country, proven 
our ability to make it fiscally responsible, something the PQ has so 
far refused to do. We have proven our ability to downsize 
government as was necessary, something the PQ government has 
not done. We have proven our ability to support the interests of 
Quebecers within Quebec, while the Official Opposition, Messrs. 
Parizeau and Bouchard, have no reality to offer, just promises.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is insulting the 
Prime Minister by saying that quoting him is character 
assassination.
<P>
	The sovereignists are proposing that in future Quebec will 
negotiate with Canada, equal to equal, nation to nation, for the first 
time in history.
<P>
	I am asking the minister to confirm that the federalist option is to 
see Quebec negotiate equal to equal, on the same footing as the 
other provinces, on the same footing as PEI and Newfoundland? 
That is their view of equality.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, when the Parti Quebecois, in the person of its Minister of 
International Affairs, Bernard Landry, attacks the president of the 
United States for having stated his position with respect to Canada, 
when the members of the opposition are attempting to interpret 
everything said in such a way as to indicate their disbelief, for 
instance, that they do not believe the Canadian provincial premiers' 
offer of assistance with questions relating to the distinct society, 
one wonders. One wonders how they can believe they are preparing 
to negotiate with other NAFTA partners or other provinces of 
Canada when they spend all their time insulting them.

	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought I would get some respite after the questions of 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we are plunging again into constitutional 
questions. In these questions, I would like to indicate how much 
this government has indicated that it is ready to change. Not only 
have we talked about questions such as distinct society and right to 
veto; more importantly, we have indicated that we are ready to give 
to the provinces a large number of powers. We indicated this in the 
last budget.
<P>
	In the last budget we showed clearly that we are ready to reduce 
the actual size of the federal government. We have reduced our own 
departments by close to 20 per cent. We said that we would recentre 
our responsibilities and let the level of government that is the most 
efficient fulfil their responsibilities. That is the greatest opening to 
change that one can see.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not asking about change in the Constitution or in the 
distribution of powers. I was simply asking about changes in the 
federal institutions.
<P>
	In many federations the upper chamber of parliament is the place 
where the distinctive interests of various parts of the country are 
represented and reconciled. Accountable and representative upper 
chambers can serve as a shock absorber for potential unity 
problems.
<P>
	Countries like Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and the United 
States have upper chambers that actually work. Unfortunately our 
Senate is not even democratically accountable let alone able to 
represent and reconcile regional and provincial interests.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	In order to demonstrate its openness to the reform of federal 
institutions, is the federal government willing to  commit to at least 
the democratization of the Canadian Senate, another change which 
can be made without constitutional amendments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the time to approve these changes would have been in 
Charlottetown. Unfortunately the leader of the third party did not 
approve them. There was a lot of discussion at the time on 
questions such as those. The leader of the third party chose to 
oppose Charlottetown.
<P>
	At present the question we face is not the approval of 
Charlottetown. At present the question we face is the possible 
separation of the province of Quebec from the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The burden of proof is on the separatists, and the separatists have 
not discharged the burden of proof. They have not given us a single 
good reason why Quebec should get out of the federation. That is 
what we must hammer at until the vote on Monday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister does not even address the substance of the 
questions being put to him.
<P>
	We are not talking about constitutional changes like the 
Charlottetown accord. We are not talking about changes to 
relations between the provinces and the federal government. We 
are talking about some simple changes in federal institutions which 
the federal government can make unilaterally which would send a 
signal of things changing to Quebec and other provinces.
<P>
	I repeat my first question. Is the federal government open to 
changing federal institutions, Parliament, the Senate and the Bank 
of Canada, to make them more accountable and representative?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the reason I am not addressing the specific question about 
changing federal institutions is this is merely a diversion from the 
present problem we are facing of why it is necessary to prevent the 
separation of Quebec from the rest of Canada. In this I hope to have 
the support of the Reform Party because that is the important 
reform.
<P>
	To change the supreme court or to change the Senate, although it 
is a very important question, has nothing to do with the question we 
are facing today, the separation of Quebec from the rest of Canada.

supplement, the spouse's allowance and the senior citizens' tax 
credit will be combined into a single new program requiring an 
income test.
<P>
	How does the minister explain the Prime Minister's statement 
yesterday in his speech that the best way to protect our social

he is preparing to exclude thousands of seniors from old age

a range of documents.
<P>
	However, as I have said before many times in the House, such 
recommendations or proposals have not been presented by me or 
the Minister of Finance to the cabinet. The cabinet has decided it is 
not the policy of the government. It is simply a leak upon a leak 
which the Bloc Quebecois and its allies have developed.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this

there will be a single program with an income test-in other words, 
the absolute end of universality.

the words ``deliberately hidden'' and to withdraw them before 
continuing with your question.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

reality check with the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	On April 6 in the House the member for Mercier claimed there 
would be tens of thousands of people coming on the welfare rolls in 
Quebec. In August I received a document from the Government of 
Quebec that pointed out the number of people on welfare had been 
reduced, not increased.
<P>
	On June 22 the member for Mercier claimed that as we were 
reorganizing the department and decentralizing we would reduce 
Canada Employment Centres in Quebec to 28. What we announced

his efforts to persuade Quebecers to vote no and that he would be 
open to change, including in some cases constitutional change.
<P>
	My question is the one I asked yesterday which I did not get a 
response to. Is it still the policy of the Liberal Party, as it is the

would have to be submitted to and approved by the people of 
Canada in a national referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Queen's Privy Council

past constitutional changes have been submitted to referenda, the 
normal way in the future would be to go through referenda.
<P>
	However, I do not know that we have talked about that as a

that.

the people of Quebec would always have a voice in changes

<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> What happened, Bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> I knew that was coming. During that campaign the 
Liberals made certain promises and commitments to a group of 
Canadians who were hurt by the way Route Canada was privatized 
by the previous Conservative government. They made promises 
that the injustices done to these people would be resolved.
<P>
	I ask whoever is speaking for the government on this matter 
today to say what progress the government feels it has made. When 
will those commitments be kept? When will the injustices done to 
those employees of Route Canada be finally resolved to their 
satisfaction?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his interest 
in the matter, along with a number of my colleagues on this side of 
the House who are very concerned about the question.
<P>
	The bankruptcy trustee and the RCMP conducted extensive 
investigations into the company's conduct. Charges and sentences 
have followed. I take this opportunity to ensure members of the 
House and former employees of CN Route Canada that the rumours 
their pensions and pension benefits are at risk are wrong.
<P>
	If they need additional information I encourage them to call the 
CN pension office. I assure them that their pension benefits have 
been protected by the government and that other issues will be 
looked at.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

by my colleague from Calgary West.
<P>
	After he asked his question and received an answer from the 
government the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans pointed at me, 
the member for Beaver River, my seatmate from Calgary 
Southwest, and my colleague from Calgary West who had asked 
the question and said: ``You're an ass, you're an ass and you're an 
ass''.

Mr. Speaker, there are only three things in the world I am sure

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
December 1, 1994 I placed the following question on the Order 
Paper:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For each department, agency and crown corporation, how many employees, 
including parliamentary agents, governor in council appointees, armed forces 
personnel and RCMP personnel receive, or will receive, the following benefits 
for one year or more: (a) a living allowance for a second residence and (b) a 
transportation allowance (or transportation) from home to place of work where 
distance exceeds 40 kilometres, and if any receive the foregoing, (i) what is the 
cost per individual recipient, (ii) what is the rank, position or title of each 
recipient and (iii) is the tax deducted at the source for these benefits''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thought it was a fairly simple question.
<P>
	Next Tuesday it will be 11 months since I placed that question on 
the Order Paper. The question was prompted by the revelation that 
the Commissioner of Official Languages was being chauffeur 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15880"> 15880 </A></B>
<P>
driven between Montreal and Ottawa each week and had an 
apartment supplied to him in Ottawa courtesy of the government, 
all because the job was in Ottawa but he preferred to live in 
Montreal.
<P>
	Standing Order 39(5)(a) gives a member the right to ask for a 
response in 45 days. This is not a problem of  delay but a problem 
of avoidance on the part of the government. Questions on the Order 
Paper are methods by which we as the opposition to the 
government, on behalf of Canadians in general, may hold the 
government accountable and obtain the facts concerning benefits 
given to its appointees that are not available to the public at large.
<P>
	I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to look into the matter for me pursuant to 
Standing Order 39(5)(a) and find out why I do not have a response 
from the government to my question.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know the hon. member and Job have a lot in common when it 
comes to patience. I respect the fact the hon. member has been very 
patient in waiting for a reply, but he read his question and therein 
lies the problem in getting the answer.
<P>
	He has asked for every department, agency and crown 
corporation how many employees meet certain criteria and he has 
asked for specifics on each of the employees. When we add up all 
the agencies, crown corporations and departments, including the 
armed forces, the RCMP and so on, the Government of Canada has 
over half a million employees as far as I am aware.
<P>
	Every department will have to go through every list of every 
employee and every agency will have to do the same, including the 
Department of National Defence and the Armed Forces of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> How much is this going to cost?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> This will cost a fortune. The hon. member does 
not care about that despite their pretence of claiming they are 
interested in thrift. He will insist on this answer. We will get him 
the answer. It is nearing completion, but I am sure it will be an 
extremely voluminous answer.
<P>
	I hope he has a long holiday coming up from Parliament so he 
can sit down and read it when he gets it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is the matter settled?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Can I respond to that?

	<B>The Speaker:</B> No, I do not want to get into a debate today. You 
have both made your points.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTUREANDAGRI-FOODADMINISTRATIVEMONETARYPENALTIESACT">AGRICULTURE AND AGRI-FOOD ADMINISTRATIVE 
MONETARY PENALTIES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-61, an act to 
establish a system of administrative monetary penalties for the 
enforcement of the Canada Agricultural Products  Act, the Feeds 
Act, the Fertilizers Act, the Health of Animals Act, the Meat 
Inspection Act, the Pest Control Products Act, the Plant Protection 
Act and the Seeds Act, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and of Motions Nos. 21 and 22.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are resuming debate on report stage of Bill C-61. I 
believe we are at the final grouping of the amendments put forward 
by my colleague from the Bloc, the hon. member for LotbiniÃ¨re. 
My colleagues and I can support the two amendments because they 
are amendments we considered. Had not the Bloc submitted them I 
believe we would have introduced them.
<P>
	Prior to question period I listened to debate on the two 
amendments by the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River. I confess that I disagree with almost everything the hon. 
member said.
<P>
	He did not seem to want more accountability in our system. He 
did not want public servants in quasi-judicial bodies to be 
accountable or more accountable to Parliament. He did not want 
the role of members of Parliament in committees to be increased. It 
seems it would be too burdensome for the hon. member and too 
onerous for this astute body to look into the affairs of government, 
hold it accountable and diligently watch what it is doing.
<P>
	The red book, if I recall correctly, promised some parliamentary 
reform. We got into that issue to a degree earlier in question period. 
Perhaps it is appropriate to raise the subject at this time. The red 
book talked about parliamentary reform and about strengthening 
the roles of parliamentary committees.
<P>
	The two amendments the hon. member put forward would cause 
the appointment of members to the tribunal to be ratified or 
reviewed by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. In my eyes that would seem to comply with the red 
book promise of giving the committees more responsibility and 
giving the committees a more meaningful role, making them more 
than window dressing as they have been notoriously described in 
the past.
<P>
	I expected members on the other side to have applauded the 
proposal, but the member for Prince Albert-Churchill River 
seemed disconcerted by the suggestion that standing committees 
would have more work to do and would play a more responsible 
role in the life of Parliament.
<P>
	The role of parliamentary committees is more of a babysitting 
service for Liberal backbenchers. And prior to that it was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15881"> 15881 </A></B>
<P>
babysitting service for the Conservative backbenchers, something 
to keep them busy while those in the cabinet ran the affairs of the 
country, something to keep them away from the decision-making 
process, something to keep them away from the actual 
development of legislation, the meaningful review of bills  in the 
committee and meaningful clause-by-clause study of bills and an 
interest builder in the actual departments of government that were 
held responsible to review and investigate and monitor.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In our particular committee, the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, we received wrong information from 
the parliamentary secretary, which seems to indicate to me that the 
department, the minister, the parliamentary secretary, or whoever 
was responsible did not feel the work of the committee was that 
important. They did not really do their homework that well.
<P>
	We went through clause by clause on Bill C-61. It was kind of a 
scripted thing where the member for Dauphin-Swan River 
jumped in at the appropriate time with the amendments that were 
supported by the government and Liberal members sort of turned 
off their minds. We could see the lights going out, that they were 
going to accept these amendments and no others. In fact that is why 
we brought our amendments to report stage rather than in the 
committee. Experience has taught us that introducing meaningful 
amendments in the committee is a waste of time. The minister is 
not there to review the amendments to see if they are acceptable. 
The government does not want any possible changes to the 
legislation without a lot of scrutiny. It does not trust backbenchers 
to have minds that could actually propose some constructive 
amendments in clause-by-clause or in the committee stage. This is 
just a make-work project for the backbenchers.
<P>
	What these amendments put forward in Group 5 would in fact 
accomplish is the committee would have a meaningful job to do of 
reviewing appointments to the tribunal that would be an appeal 
body for the administrative monetary penalties should someone 
who has violated the regulations of Agriculture Canada so appeal to 
that tribunal. That makes a lot of sense. That is moving this House 
of Commons and the members of Parliament to more meaningful 
work, a more direct contact with the administration of government. 
It is more of a hands on role. It is a role with which members can go 
back to their constituents and say they have something to do that 
counts and is important.
<P>
	The Liberal government does not seem willing to give the 
committees the added responsibility. The promises in the red book 
ring pretty hollow if in fact these two amendments are not passed.
<P>
	The minister and his departmental officials have said that the 
spirit of Bill C-61 is good, that they have good intent. I believe 
them. I believe they have good intent. I believe they want this new 
process of administrative monetary penalties and compliance 
agreements to work to reduce the onerous burden on our justice 
system. I believe they do want it to work. I believe it is also 
paramount that in giving these powers to his department,  his 
public servants, and to himself as minister, it is also responsible to 
put some parameters around that authority and responsibility that 
are reasonable and responsible.
<P>
	In summing up my response not only to these two amendments 
but to the entire bill, it all fits together. What we have tried to do is 
build those reasonable fences around the bill that allow enough 
latitude within for the minister and his department to effectively 
administer the powers they receive under Bill C-64.
<P>
	Why they would not want the committee on agriculture and 
agri-food to play a more meaningful role in the ratification of 
appointees to the tribunal is beyond my understanding. It just 
seems to be the mindset of this government. I think it is wrong. I 
think it is unfortunate. It is sad. Perhaps it is even part of the reason 
we are experiencing some trouble right now.
<P>
	I would appeal to the minister and the members to reverse this 
trend, to start to make government more open, more transparent, to 
make the public service more accessible and accountable to not 
only the ministers but to all members of Parliament. Therefore, I 
would support these two amendments. I would heartily endorse 
these two amendments and ask other members in the House to do 
the same.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are discussing Group 5, Motions 21 and 22.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want 
to deal with Motions 21 and 22, but I do want to take issue with a 
couple of the comments made by the last speaker, the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	Earlier today we were talking about being reasonable in this 
House. We did in fact agree with some of the amendments put 
forward by the hon. member in the third party. After the comments 
he made in his last remarks, one would wonder why we would be 
reasonable. He commented that in putting amendments forward on 
behalf of the government the Liberal members merely put them 
forward and the lights went out. Those amendments had taken 
serious consideration of the discussions, what the department had 
said and what our members had said, the discussion that Reform 
members had brought forward before the committee. Those 
amendments were given due consideration and were well thought 
out and do indeed improve the bill, as do some of the amendments 
put forward by the third party.
<P>
	He also alluded to, and I want to take issue with it, the remarks of 
the parliamentary secretary. I want to say, having sat in on those 
meetings, that the parliamentary secretary tried to provide the 
comments from the community. In response to the member that 
night, when Bill C-61 came out the department issued a release to 
quite a number of organizations that had raised concerns. It issued 
an overview of that particular bill. Having been a leader in the farm 
community myself for a number of  years, I know organizations 
look at that overview, look at the draft legislation, and respond 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15882"> 15882 </A></B>
<P>
accordingly. I believe they did have the opportunity to respond, and 
the parliamentary secretary was trying to outline to committee 
members the views of the community. I respect him for having 
done that.
<P>
	I do want to say that we on the government side of that 
committee have considered these amendments very seriously, 
including those from the third party.
<P>
	As to the motions we are now debating, I want to state that I 
oppose those particular amendments. The minister spoke earlier on 
another amendment and I think his comments apply to these 
particular amendments. The manner of appointments of members 
of the review tribunal by the governor in council that is set out in 
this bill follows a well established practice, endorsed by courts of 
law, of assuring the independence of the tribunal from outside 
interference.
<P>
	This is what is so important in terms of the appointment of 
members to committees. I know from previous experience that 
there is nothing more difficult than appointing members and trying 
to do it in a balanced, fair, and equitable way. If we had members of 
the committee trying to push certain members to be appointed to 
committees for political or other reasons, we would be into very 
great difficulty indeed in terms of trying to find balance on 
committees.
<P>
	In terms of appointments to tribunals and so on, the minister is 
always accountable and responsible. Therefore, he takes a great 
deal of discretion in terms of making those appointments. I can tell 
you that if the minister appointed the wrong individual, the first 
ones standing up in this House would be members of the 
opposition, complaining about that appointment and trying to hold 
the minister accountable and responsible. But how could the 
minister be held accountable and responsible for appointments 
pushed by committee members and sometimes by the opposition 
parties? I think that as a committee we would be in difficulty.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I know the intent of the member for LotbiniÃ¨re is good. The 
objective he is putting forward is good. However, it is very 
problematic in terms of how it would work in practice. Let me give 
an example.
<P>
	I am from P.E.I. and the hon. member is from Quebec and we 
both might be pushing two individuals for our own reasons for our 
own provinces. It could create confusion and problems on the 
committee. It would take a lot of committee time unnecessarily. I 
prefer the present approach: hold the minister accountable and 
responsible for those appointments. That is how it should be.
<P>
	Let me make a couple of other comments in opposition to the 
amendments.
<P>
	The bill does require that members of the tribunal have technical 
qualifications related to the area of agriculture and agri-food and 
are not in a position of conflict of interest relative to the matters 
before them. To ensure that people are not found to be in a conflict 
of interest, it means their backgrounds and rÃ©sumÃ©s must be 
examined. It is much better to do that in a private forum, rather 
than in the public forum the committee entails.
<P>
	Having the standing committee approve all appointments would 
raise a number of concerns. First, the time required to deal with the 
committee recommendations might add considerably to the length 
of time required to make the appointments.
<P>
	Second, the committee might refuse to recommend any of the 
incumbents to these positions, effectively preventing the positions 
from being filled. As I mentioned earlier, the opposition to 
incumbents might be based purely on political reasons rather than 
sound judgment in terms of the ability of the individual to do the 
job.
<P>
	Third, I think this kind of amendment would be a move toward a 
more American style of government. In the past we have seen what 
incumbents who are looking for positions go through when they 
appear before boards and committees. Sometimes individuals who 
could do an effective job are lost because of the process. I think that 
is wrong.
<P>
	Finally, a committee debate on the selection of tribunal members 
could be conducted in public and might involve hearing witnesses, 
raising privacy concerns, and possibly deterring applicants from 
even considering sitting on these tribunals.
<P>
	I know the amendments are put forward in good will. I know the 
intent to be more productive is there, but I believe they would be 
problematic. On those grounds, I oppose these amendments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been considering the 
various amendments to Bill C-61 at report stage since 10 a.m., 
which has given us over four hours of very detailed discussion. For 
the most part, that discussion has been quite useful.
<P>
	As the member for Malpeque mentioned, during the course of 
the debate and discussion the government has in fact accepted at 
least three of the proposals put forward by the opposition 
pertaining to various administrative matters in the legislation.
<P>
	On the final two motions that are now before the House, Motions 
21 and 22, I think the arguments advanced by the member for 
Malpeque are very convincing and sustainable arguments as to why 
these two motions should not be among those that are accepted.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15883"> 15883 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	I might elaborate on one of the reasons advanced by the hon. 
member for Malpeque, which is the distinction between the 
Canadian parliamentary system of government and the American 
congressional system of government.
<P>
	Under the American system there is a certain method for making 
appointments. It involves in certain circumstances public hearings 
before congressional committees. In Canada traditionally we have 
not taken that approach. One of the reasons we have not taken that 
approach is the difference between the congressional system in the 
U.S., which has a different system of checks and balance on the 
whole executive authority of government, and our parliamentary 
system, which has a very fundamental rudder to it. You see it from 
your chair every day, Mr. Speaker, in question period. That is a 
characteristic absolutely unique to our system.
<P>
	Members of the U.S. cabinet never have to appear in a public 
forum like the House of Commons. They appear from time to time 
in carefully controlled circumstances before congressional 
committees. Members of the American cabinet are not members of 
the American Congress and therefore are not present in either the 
Senate or the House of Representatives. They are aloof, separate 
and apart from the legislative branch of the American government.
<P>
	The Americans have an array of checks and balances they 
believe holds their system together quite appropriately. That is 
their system. It is a different system. They do not have the open 
forum of Parliament in which every day Parliament sits the 
ministers of the crown are in the House to face the accountability of 
the opposition in the open question period. It is a unique feature of 
our system, one that argues very well for our system as compared 
to theirs.
<P>
	That distinction, among others, is one of the reasons we should 
reject the kind of administrative suggestions proposed in these two 
motions and stick to the bill as it is presently before the House.
<P>
	Earlier in the day the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster raised questions about certain 
comments made in committee by my parliamentary secretary. I 
answered fully those questions with respect to the views expressed 
by my parliamentary secretary. The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster has once again in his most recent 
intervention repeated the allegations without indicating that those 
allegations have already been completely and fully answered in the 
House. They ought not to be repeated without the indication that 
they have been answered. I answered them earlier today. He was 
not paying attention.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman also engaged in general criticism. I hope he 
did not mean it seriously. It was general criticism about the conduct 
of government members with respect to the work done on the bill in 
committee.
<P>
	From my experience as a minister the government members who 
worked very hard on the bill took their responsibility very 
seriously. Apart from the hours they spent working on the bill in 
committee, they spent additional hours doing their homework in 
their offices, writing letters, asking questions, getting answers and 
understanding the legislation so that when they went to the 
committee they were well prepared to deal with the issues in a 
thoroughly conscientious and efficient manner.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster criticized them 
for being ``well organized''. I commend our members for being 
well organized. I know the depth in which they studied the 
legislation because I was the one inundated by their questions as to 
how to put the legislation together in the best and most proper 
fashion.
<P>
	Government members have done extraordinarily well in 
ensuring the legislation came out in a way which serves the 
national interest.

	The House resumed from October 25 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-99 
and about how the government is acting on its commitment to 
provide leadership in helping small business grow and create jobs.
<P>
	I will spend some time discussing the consultations that have fed 
into this legislation and the initiatives we have taken to help small 
business grow and prosper.
<P>
	Small business has always played a crucial role in the Canadian 
economy, be it a local corner store, a remote fishing camp, parts 
suppliers to the aerospace industry or a computer software 
developer.
<P>
	Small businesses are a vital job creator and are contributors to 
our country's wealth. Today there are about 2 million small 
businesses in Canada. They account for almost two-thirds of the 
jobs in the private sector and 60 per cent of Canada's economic 
output. It has been stated many times that small business creates 82 
per cent of all new jobs.
<P>
	In my riding small business played a pivotal role in the opening 
up and the development of the north from small aviation companies 
that led the way, to the service industries that followed to support 
the growth, to an increasing number of aboriginal owned and 
operated companies which provide the services needed and which 
drive the engine of economic growth in the communities.
<P>
	I now illustrate some of the dynamic things small businesses are 
doing in the north. People in my riding are becoming increasingly 
aware of the potential for growth when we work together to create 
the economic and social development so needed. An excellent 
example is the Dogrib Nation group of companies. The Dogrib 
Treaty 11 Council recognized that the best way to address the needs 
and priorities of its communities was to play an active role in 
partnership with the businesses that deliver the services needed. 
Therefore it created the Dogrib Nation group of companies to 
address economic development needs from investments in 
hydro-electric power generation to forestry, heavy equipment 
supply, aviation in partnership with Canadian helicopters and 
commercial catering.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The group pursues a number of industrial and human resource 
development activities for and on behalf of the four Dogrib Nation 
communities. This is a living testament to the empowerment 
potential that can be unleashed by small business initiatives.
<P>
	Another example is the Northern Transportation Company 
Limited, originally a crown corporation. NTCL's primary objective 
is to provide cost effective, reliable and comprehensive marine 
transportation and related services in northern Canada and the 
Arctic. Now NTCL is the wholly owned subsidiary of NorTerra 
Incorporated, which in turn is owned by two aboriginal 
corporations, the Inuvialuit Development Corporation and Nunasi 
Corporation. The Inuvialuit people of the Western Arctic and the 
Inuit of the Nunavut are the beneficial shareholders of NTCL.
<P>
	There is recognition for those small businesses that have been 
able to achieve equity. Recently NTCL was the recipient of the 
federal locators award given to those companies that demonstrate 
they can bring in the groups under-represented in the general 
population or general labour market areas.
<P>
	When we bring small business down to the human grassroots 
level, we look at small communities like the community in my 
riding of Fort Resolution. The people have undertaken to commit 
themselves to the small business of running a sawmill, a very 
industrious and skills related industry. The community can see the 
results of it and have the participation in terms of jobs and watch 
exactly how small business grows. They have been able to develop 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15885"> 15885 </A></B>
<P>
an economic development arm which has allowed them to provide 
some of the supplies they need  in order to build their homes and to 
provide the region with some of those facilities.
<P>
	They have taken it upon themselves to get into an industry that 
would produce some of the materials needed for building homes 
such as moulds to create bathtubs and all the other things needed 
for use inside a home.
<P>
	There are a number of other items they produce. They are 
expanding and diversifying which is the key to successful small 
businesses to either focus and do something very specialized they 
are good at or to capture a market. This seems to be what they are 
doing, and doing it very well.
<P>
	During the recessionary years when large multinational 
corporations were laying off workers, small businesses were 
responsible for almost all of the net new jobs created. Why are they 
so successful? Small businesses embody the dynamism and 
flexibility to respond quickly to new challenges. They know they 
have to innovate aggressively in order to compete.
<P>
	Canada is now moving into a new economy, one characterized 
by rapid technological change, intense global competition and 
innovation. Small business has the right stuff to succeed in this 
environment. However, small business cannot do it alone. It needs 
the right environment and the right tools to get the job done and 
that is our responsibility.
<P>
	The task of the government is threefold in terms of small 
business being successful. The first thing we must do is create the 
best economic conditions and institutions that will allow these 
innovators in the private sector to get on with it. It always helps to 
have a country as politically stable as it is economically stable. It 
helps to create the right condition and the right climate for those 
small businesses to flourish. It helps to create an environment 
where new ideas are spawned and where ideas, technology, and 
new production processes move quickly throughout the economy. 
It helps Canadians realize that innovation does not just happen; it 
thrives best in countries that consciously understand the process 
and take steps to create a national system of innovation. This 
means we must work with the private sector to identify strategic 
opportunities and channel our resources toward fulfilling those 
opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In February 1994 we asked the small business community to 
help us create the environment and the tools they need to succeed. 
The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, the 
private sector small business working committee, the chamber of 
commerce, and many other groups contributed to one of the most 
comprehensive reviews of small business ever undertaken.
<P>
	Four primary messages emerged from the review. Small 
business told us that with the proper support they  have a vast 
untapped
<P>
potential for creating jobs and wealth. This is no secret. This is 
something that is quite well known and has been demonstrated time 
and time again. Reducing the deficit is one of the most important 
steps toward unleashing this potential, we were told by the various 
proponents. Government programs must become more efficient, 
effective, and relevant to the needs of small business. Who knows 
best? Of course small business does, with their various proponents. 
Finally, the vibrant small business sector that Canada needs cannot 
be created by the government alone.
<P>
	We have listened to these messages and we have acted on them. 
We have placed the needs and concerns of small business at the 
centre of our job creation agenda. Our consultations reaffirm that 
high deficits and a rising debt burden spoil even the best prospects 
for any country's economic growth. We need stable economic 
policies for sustained growth and job creation. The fiscal policies 
we are pursuing address this need.
<P>
	We in Canada recognize the serious debt-to-GDP problem we 
face, and we are responding to it with the biggest budget cuts since 
demobilization following World War II. The 1995 Canadian budget 
will reduce the federal government's borrowing requirements to 
1.7 per cent of GDP by the next fiscal year, 1996-97. This is the 
lowest of all the G-7 countries.
<P>
	We also set an inflation target range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent 
and we have in fact kept inflation below the midpoint of that range 
since 1991. In terms of inflation, Canada is the Switzerland of 
North America in the 1990s.
<P>
	Also in the last budget the Minister of Finance announced a 
rollback of unemployment insurance premiums from $3.07 to $3 
per $100 of wages to lighten the burden of profit-insensitive taxes. 
We are refocusing our remaining programs to reduce duplication 
and serve the needs of small business in the best way we can.
<P>
	The red tape and associated paper work and complex regulatory 
hurdles faced by any venture can be discouraging, if not 
insurmountable. We have eliminated 250 regulations. We are in the 
process of reviewing another 370 in an effort to achieve a more 
efficient and effective framework for business.
<P>
	We continue to work with the private sector financial institutions 
to improve their ability to serve small business. They have 
responded with new services, including specialized lending units to 
serve the needs of knowledge-based firms. We recognize that there 
are some areas the private sector will not be able to serve very well.
<P>
	We have responded by reviewing and then giving a new mandate 
to the former Federal Business Development Bank. The new name 
Business Development Bank of Canada is intended to highlight the 
bank's new approach. The bank will focus on filling  our four 
marketing gaps. First is the knowledge gap, gaining an 
understanding of the information technologies, software, and 
related indus-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15886"> 15886 </A></B>
<P>
tries in order to serve businesses where the principal assets are 
between the ears of the owners and not conventional hard assets.
<P>
	Second is the size gap, finding ways of providing smaller loans 
to meet small business client needs while still breaking even 
financially. People do not go into small business to go broke. 
People go into small business in order to flourish, in order to 
specialize and develop and diversify if they have to, to capture 
those markets that are out there. Essentially, small business means 
business; essentially that is what it is.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Third is a flexible financing gap, providing loans and other 
forms of financing on flexible repayment terms, to take account of 
clients' variable cashflows, particularly in the early years.
<P>
	Fourth is the risk gap, lending up the risk curve to provide clients 
with appropriately priced access to capital. This tends to be 
generally a big problem where you do not have a lot of built-in 
infrastructure, where you have a lot of difficulty for those small 
businesses to succeed in areas where they may be very remote and 
do not have the kinds of infrastructures that are available in a more 
broadly based population.
<P>
	We recognize that implementing this new mandate as a 
complementary lender will require nothing less than a cultural 
revolution. The bank is developing a corporate plan that will give 
effect to this new mandate. We expect that the new Business 
Development Bank of Canada will become recognized in Canada 
and around the world as a leader in developing new financial 
instruments for small business. The example set by the new bank 
will show the major banks that small businesses are worth their 
time and effort and will inspire them to greater participation in 
small business financing. Access to financing remains an important 
issue for entrepreneurs. However, development of a business 
climate that encourages growth and job creation is equally 
important.
<P>
	We are determined that the business framework laws shall be 
part of Canada's comparative advantage. We are seeking to forge 
new partnerships among the innovative players in the economy to 
ensure a vibrant small business sector. We recognize that support 
for innovation must be sharply focused on the commercialization 
of science and technology. We are concentrating our efforts in two 
key areas: building partnerships between all players, especially 
innovative small businesses, and improving strategic access to 
information.
<P>
	We have launched a Canadian technology network that will help 
small business acquire and manage new and complex technology 
by putting them in contact with the Canadian research community 
and we will provide  business with rapid access to information on 
domestic technology.
<P>
	We have established the technology partnerships program to 
promote collaboration between Canadian universities and small 
and medium-sized businesses to turn university technologies and 
ideas into new and improved products and processes and services. 
It will bring together universities and businesses in cost-shared 
efforts to demonstrate, develop, and market promising 
technologies.
<P>
	Perhaps nowhere is there greater opportunity for innovative 
businesses to realize their full potential than through the 
information highway. The federal government is moving quickly to 
develop an information highway strategy that will build on national 
strengths in telecommunications and information and information 
technologies to create jobs through innovation and investment, 
reinforce Canadian sovereignty and cultural identity, and ensure 
universal access at reasonable cost.
<P>
	We established this commitment to small business in the Liberal 
Party's red book because we recognized that they are the engines of 
Canadian economic growth. We put this commitment into action by 
announcing proposals designed to help small business grow. We 
furthered this commitment with the measures contained in the last 
budget, and we will continue to maintain this commitment to 
ensure the health and prosperity of Canadian small businesses.
<P>
	We brought forward Bill C-99 to enable the completion of the 
process of modernization that moved the SBLA program to full 
cost recovery. This renewal will relieve the financial burden of the 
program on Canadian taxpayers while enabling the SBLA to 
continue to provide its benefits to small business.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize the importance of what can be 
accomplished when we work together in partnership as Canadians. 
Earlier I talked about some of the innovative and dynamic things 
that are happening in my riding as a result of people working in 
partnership and co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The United Nations recognizes Canada as the best country in the 
world to live in. We accomplished this by living and working 
together. We created the environment, economically, socially, 
politically, and the opportunities for all Canadians to empower 
themselves and in turn contribute to society. It is through these 
actions that we will also fulfil our promise of creating jobs and 
prosperity for all Canadians.
<P>
	The north is no different. As proud Canadians in the north, we 
too want to contribute to society, we too want to contribute to the 
overall economy and well-being of our country. It is through an 
innovation like this that perhaps those opportunities and those 
doors of opportunity become more available.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15887"> 15887 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member 
for Western Arctic for participating in this debate, for supporting 
the bill and talking about the importance of small business, 
especially in the north.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question that arises from an experience I 
had three weeks ago when I was travelling in Austria. I met some 
Austrian businessmen who had travelled to the north on tourism 
trips to hunt and to enjoy the beauty of the Arctic. They felt there 
was tremendous potential and opportunity for tourism in the north, 
especially if there were more extensive promotion in Europe. They 
also thought there was an opportunity to develop a tourism 
infrastructure in the north.
<P>
	I wonder what the member's experience has been when she talks 
with the small business men and women in her community who are 
tourism operators, who have incredible potential with the resources 
of the north. What has been the experience of those small business 
entrepreneurs with the financial institutions in this country? Do 
they find the financial institutions are becoming much more 
progressive in their thinking and are supporting these small 
businesses with loans to build those businesses so they can promote 
these opportunities? What has been her personal experience as a 
member of Parliament serving the tourism operators in the north?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood has brought forward this 
question. I am very appreciative of his question. If there was ever 
an industry that would be next to the resource industry in the north, 
it is the other resource industry, tourism.
<P>
	We do need the infrastructure. I suppose one of the dreams we 
have as politicians and one of the things I often refer to as an 
infrastructure requirement would be the completion of the 
Mackenzie Valley highway. That would open up a tremendous 
potential and complete the loop of having to come down to travel 
the Trans-Canada Highway right into the north, go right up the 
Mackenzie Valley and travel along 1,800 kilometres of river on a 
highway. It would allow the resource industry that is there to have 
access to the Mackenzie Range and the Nahanni National Park. It 
would open up a tremendous amount for Canada to see. That is 
what makes this country so wonderful. That is what makes this 
country so beautiful. It makes us appreciate all parts of this 
country.
<P>
	The Reform Party laughs. When we talk about our individual 
areas we tend to appreciate and respect each other, not laugh at 
each other. The hon. member has been to my riding. It is really 
important for members to see that beauty, to see that vast expanse 
which says this is part of Canada. This is what we are debating 
today. We cannot describe how wonderful and beautiful our 
country is. As Canadians we have the opportunity to build on it,  to 
continue to expand and make it even better than it is by building 
that infrastructure.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The financial institutions my colleague referred to have provided 
this opportunity with the revamping of the Business Development 
Bank of Canada. It is going to open the doors of opportunity to 
those small businesses and tourism operators to do what was 
suggested and make it accessible.
<P>
	There is an influx of European tourists from Germany, Austria 
and Japan. They are going to see the pristine north, to see the flora 
and fauna species which are not available in their own countries. 
That resource is worth sharing with Canada and the world. The way 
to do that is by making these institutions and resources more 
accessible by changing the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to clarify some of the accusations that came this 
way. We were not laughing at the minister. What we were laughing 
at is the fact that the Liberals have frittered that infrastructure 
money away on all kinds of pork barrel operations. Now when a 
highway needs to be built, there is no money left.
<P>
	I would like the minister to comment on why that infrastucture 
money was not used for true infrastructure.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
back-handed compliment from the Reform Party. It is unfortunate 
it could not just be an up front compliment.
<P>
	I understand what Reformers are saying. In terms of the 
infrastructure, I must say that all projects the infrastructure money 
has gone to are priorities set by the people in the north. We gave 
them the money and they decided what they wanted to do.
<P>
	If we are going to talk about building a highway, in 1984 it cost 
$1 million a kilometre. Simply put, Canada does not have that kind 
of money. There are a lot of kilometres of road to be built and we 
do not have that kind of cash.
<P>
	I am happy the Reformers are lobbying for a road in my riding. I 
would welcome them to transfer their infrastructure money to help 
us build the MacKenzie Valley highway. That would be great. Let 
me say that it is a tremendous investment and even though I would 
like the government to make that commitment, it cannot do so at 
this time. In light of deficit reduction, we must be realistic in all the 
priorities we set. It is a long term goal, a dream of mine and a 
dream of northerners. It is something I appreciate the help of the 
Reform Party on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had the good 
fortune to visit my hon. friend's constituency this past summer. I 
concur that it is one of the most spectacular parts of the country.
<P>
	I visited a number of business people in her constituency. One 
runs a small hotel or lodge and has  been trying to sell it for about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15888"> 15888 </A></B>
<P>
15 years. He would find a potential buyer and they would try to 
arrange financing. He found the difficulty was that he lived in an 
environment that often was rather vague in the minds of southern 
bankers. It is dark for half of the year and has an unusual tourist 
season. It was not clear what the season was, whether it was 
summer or winter, and consequently, the individual could not get 
financing.
<P>
	My question in a sense is a take-off from my hon. friend for 
Broadview-Greenwood. When it comes to financing, particularly 
with respect to tourist related enterprises in the north, does the hon. 
member agree it is a major area and that financial institutions 
simply do not have the financing mechanisms in place to meet the 
demands and needs of the emerging northern economy?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no dispute of the 
fact that certain operators and owners of businesses, be they big 
game hunters, lodge owners or whatever have had trouble because 
the economy has not allowed for people to buy into those 
opportunities. There has been some difficulty in accessing those 
resources.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I must reiterate that changing the Small Business Loans Act will 
make these resources more available. Not only that, some of the 
Canadian banks are developing partnerships, for instance with 
aboriginal communities. There is more cash available now since 
we have settled land claims. Potential partners are speculating and 
looking at new opportunities. Things are actually getting better, but 
there are no magic solutions.
<P>
	We were very lucky. If I might compliment my colleague, my 
riding was made more beautiful by his presence as a tourist. I 
welcome more people to the north.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to have the opportunity to say a few words regarding Bill C-99, an 
act to amend the Small Business Loans Act. At second reading 
stage the assumption is that we are talking about the principle of 
the bill. On that point I want to register a deep disappointment with 
this initiative.
<P>
	We have heard thoughtful presentations from all sides of the 
House regarding the value of small business, the importance of 
small business and the critical nature which small business has 
taken on in the changing economy. If this is any indication of how 
the government plans to react to these needs, to this new sense of 
dynamism in the country, it is pathetic.
<P>
	My hon. friend from the territories indicated that this is a major 
step forward. This is not a major step forward. Quite frankly, this is 
a little technical housekeeping which will build total cost recovery 
into the legislation. Actually, it will probably make it a bit tougher 
for people to obtain a loan because of the loan guarantee being 
decreased to 85 per cent from 90 per cent. That will  cause the 
banks to be a bit more wary in terms of lending.
<P>
	Then of course there is the provision that through order in 
council the government can make changes to the legislation. I have 
seen changes in my short time as a member of Parliament. At one 
time there was a 100 per cent guarantee. Then it decreased to 90 per 
cent. Now it is being decreased to 85 per cent. It is fair to say that if 
this trend continues, we will soon see the guarantee being 
decreased to 75 per cent, 50 per cent, or whatever, which would 
essentially make it a non-program.
<P>
	I am concerned about the influence which, behind closed doors, 
cabinet will have to change this crucial piece of legislation. I 
happen to think it is a good piece of legislation. However, I do have 
a deep concern that this is the only initiative which we are 
discussing.
<P>
	Let me put this into context. I am one of many members who 
believe that the small business sector is the crucial job creating 
sector in the country today and will be even more so in the future. 
As a result of both government and private enterprise downsizing, 
the role of the small operation, the independent operator and 
entrepreneur has become more important than ever.
<P>
	We are visited regularly in our constituency offices by young 
people who have sent out 200 resumÃ©s, who have filled out 100 job 
applications or who have knocked on 50 doors trying to find 
employment. Often these young people are well educated and well 
trained. They have marketable technical skills and good research 
abilities. They are self-starters and so on. Yet they are having 
difficulty finding a job using the traditional process for finding a 
job.
<P>
	The young people of the future who will be employed will be 
those who actually create their own enterprise. They will realize 
that they will not be working for a firm. They will not be working 
for an accounting company. They will not be working in a small 
manufacturing firm. It will be up to them to actually start their own 
enterprise from scratch. They will be the ultimate entrepreneurs, 
able to take a concept, see an opportunity and put that into play.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Today we see two different types of small business operators. 
One type is the small business operator who finds himself 
attempting to start a small business or is looking for ways of 
starting one. He has very little experience in the world of business 
and probably never thought he would actually start a business.
<P>
	Because of the layoffs in the private sector and the downsizing in 
the public sector people like him simply find themselves out of 
work and the only solution they see is to start an enterprise. One of 
the areas where government could help would be to find ways and 
means to enable those men and women to obtain the necessary  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15889"> 15889 </A></B>
<P>
skills to start a small business and to run it successfully, or to 
upgrade their skills or obtain retraining.
<P>
	I appreciate there are programs in place now. I am thinking in 
particular of some of the work done by the Business Development 
Bank of Canada and others. This is one area where government can 
provide some service to encourage the development of these, let us 
say, incubator centres.
<P>
	The other type of business people are the individuals who have 
wanted to be in business all their lives. Simply by their nature, 
instinct and character they are business people. They have 
developed the necessary skills or perhaps have them innately and 
have enrolled in programs or courses to bring themselves up to 
speed to be successful business operators.
<P>
	These two types of operators are now becoming increasingly 
more familiar on the economic landscape of the country.
<P>
	In Kamloops we are in the process of celebrating Small Business 
Week. I heard the definition of a small business person the other 
day and I thought it was very apt. I realize that when it comes to the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business and other business 
organizations, economic organizations, banks and other financial 
institutions, they all have their own definitions of what a small 
business operation is.
<P>
	The one this person came forward with was that a small business 
person is one who works 18 hours a day, seven days a week for the 
equivalent of about an eight hour daily wage. In today's economic 
environment that pretty well sums it up. These people are dedicated 
and committed to their enterprise. They are prepared to dedicate 
literally their entire lives. It becomes a lifestyle to see a new 
business start up or an existing business to continue to expand. 
These are the people we need to encourage in all ways.
<P>
	The question is: How do we encourage them? What can we do? 
Personally I have wrestled with this for many years. I sent out a 
questionnaire to the small business operators in my constituency a 
while back. I asked them to help me with ideas as to how they 
thought the government could help them.
<P>
	Summarizing what they said, they said three things: ``Get out of 
our way; get out of our way; get out of our way. We will take care 
of ourselves. We do not actually need help. If you could allow us to 
more easily spend time on developing a new enterprise, new 
technologies, new processes, new marketing programs, that is what 
we need to do. We need to spend time on that as opposed to filling 
out countless forms''. Mountains and mounds of red tape confront 
the typical small business operator. There is a lot of truth in that.
<P>
	Underlying all of this is the recognition of the hated GST and 
what that has done and continues to do particularly to small 
businesses. I look across the aisle at  my Liberal colleagues and do 
look forward to the day when that GST is replaced. I do not mean 
that the name be replaced; I mean that the actual tax be eliminated 
and we come up with a system that is less cumbersome and more 
fair for the small business community.
<P>
	There are three good features we have seen developed over the 
last number of years. On the top of my list in terms of support, 
assistance, encouragement and nurturing for small business 
operators is community futures. I do not know what other people 
have had in terms of experience with community futures but I want 
to mention what I have experienced.
<P>
	In the Kamloops area we set up a community futures called 
Thompson Country Community Futures Society. Over the last 
number of years hundreds of new businesses have resulted from 
that government program, but not the government program per se. 
Obviously individuals who had the ideas, the energy and the 
dedication to see these businesses through to completion were the 
critical ingredient.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	However the community futures program was able to provide 
start up funding in two ways. One program working in co-operation 
with Employment Canada enabled people to continue receiving 
unemployment insurance while they started up a new enterprise. It 
has been very helpful and very successful. Everyone would 
acknowledge that the chance of a person starting up a small 
business getting into a profit making situation in the first few 
weeks or months is very remote.
<P>
	The program enabled individuals who had lost their jobs and 
were eligible for unemployment insurance to continue receiving 
unemployment insurance for a number of months while they 
started their new enterprises. That made the difference. That gave 
them a leg up, a small opportunity to provide for their families at 
the same time as they were starting their new enterprises.
<P>
	Another program attached to community futures was the one 
where small businesses with good business plans could apply for 
up to $75,000 in funding. The decision is made by successful local 
business people who know the region, know the area and perhaps 
even know the individual. They have a very sound appreciation for 
what businesses are successful, what businesses have a good 
chance at being successful and what risky areas should be watched. 
They evaluate business plans put forward often with help from the 
Thompson Country Community Futures Society and make 
decisions.
<P>
	They are loans, not grants, with modest interest rates attached to 
them with often generous payback programs that are rather creative 
in terms of paying back the money being borrowed. They are 
provided to new firms, particularly the ones that do not qualify 
easily in terms of usual categories for bank funding, particularly 
people  who are trying new market areas, new technologies or 
creative new age businesses that do not have a lot of inventory to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15890"> 15890 </A></B>
<P>
use as collateral in the traditional approach to lending of financial 
institutions.
<P>
	The Business Development Bank of Canada is playing a more 
positive role now than it has in the past. Over the last number of 
years to say that I have been disappointed with the role it has 
played would be understating my concern. I looked at the old 
FBDB operation and compared it to the Royal Bank of Canada, the 
Bank of Montreal or whatever. It seemed that it was the most 
conservative lending institution on the landscape and was certainly 
of little help to small business when it came to lending. When it 
came to case counselling and so on it was another matter. That has 
changed somewhat and I appreciate the thrust of the new 
legislation is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	As my friend from Western Arctic indicated, banks and other 
financial institutions are changing slightly. They are moving 
slightly in the right direction. A lot of credit goes to members of 
Parliament, other individuals and organizations that have mounted 
pressure. They pointed out that banks were simply not fulfilling 
their roles or were not being helpful to this growing and creative 
sector.
<P>
	There have been significant movements in terms of bank policies 
with the creation of a small business trouble shooter all banks now 
have in place. It is somebody to phone, to complain to or to ask 
questions about why a loan was turned down. There is much greater 
sensitivity in terms of funding women entrepreneurs, women 
business persons and aboriginal borrowers.
<P>
	It is not that I think banks are not particularly creative 
themselves. They are responding to public pressure. They now 
realize these are areas they have to move into. Perhaps a little less 
altruistic, they are responding to the fact that as First Nations 
peoples settle land claims vast amounts of money may be involved. 
I suspect some banks are looking forward to getting involved in 
that operation as a financial growth possibility and perhaps have 
more of an interest in funding aboriginal enterprises. Nevertheless, 
in reality there is positive movement in all those areas.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I point out what I think is a particular problem area. Again I 
acknowledge there have been some improvements in the last little 
while. The government's procurement programs have assisted a 
number of small enterprises in my own constituency. A variety of 
programs assist small businesses to develop new technologies. 
Hopefully we are looking forward to the information highway 
strategy. It is not only necessary but will be helpful in the 
development of small enterprises.
<P>
	There is a need for more flexible financing, particularly in some 
critical areas of growth in the  country such as the tourism or 
hospitality business. One situation that brings this to mind in my 
own constituency is an operation called Mike Wiegle Heli-Skiing 
Operations. It has been in operation for many years. It is a very 
successful heli-skiing operation that caters almost exclusively to 
overseas skiers from Europe who come for a week or two to ski 
down the glaciers of the mountains in central British Columbia. It 
is superb skiing. To set up a major resort in an isolated area far 
from airports or population centres and to obtain financing 
arrangements that allow some flexibility is extremely difficult. The 
Western diversification fund was helpful in the start up period, but 
if we are to assist businesses to expand into new areas and if we are 
to be successful, we have to find ways to be more creative, and I 
aim these comments particularly at financial institutions.
<P>
	The legislation is pathetic. I will not say much about it. Enough 
has been said. It will go to committee. It is a continuation of the 
same. It is certainly helpful. The SBLA has been helpful to many 
small business operators across the country including the 
Kamloops region, but there is much more we could do.
<P>
	Let me summarize by indicating a critical initiative we need to 
take. When I say ``we'' I do not mean as a Parliament or as a 
government; I mean as a country. We all acknowledge that for a 
business to be successful or perhaps even for an individual to be 
successful there has to be some kind of plan, strategy or blueprint. 
There has to be a flexible business plan that acknowledges 
changing times and so on.
<P>
	We need something similar as a country. We could call it the 
business plan for Canada. We could identify areas where obvious 
growth potential exists and where we would be putting our special 
efforts as federal, provincial, regional and local governments, 
financial institutions, business organizations, investors and 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	We can look around the world at countries that have been more 
successful than ourselves when it comes to economic development 
and job creation. It tends to be countries that have a business plan 
in place which everyone acknowledges. Maybe they do not agree 
with it but at least it is acknowledged. It sends a signal to banks of 
the direction of the country for the next decade. It signals 
entrepreneurs and investors of a direction, whether it is in 
pharmaceuticals, agri-business, tourism or whatever.
<P>
	Some kind of national Canadian business plan would be 
appropriate. Then we would have to find out where we fit into it. 
What role would the federal government play, if any? What role 
would the provincial and regional governments play, if any? I 
suspect there would be significant roles. With that plan we would 
be much more successful.
<P>
	Granted, this is most successful with smaller countries in which 
it is a lot easier to come up with a consensus in terms of direction 
and development. We are the second  largest country in the world 
geographically and it causes problems that we are experiencing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15891"> 15891 </A></B>
<P>
virtually as we speak. It is something we must look at, and it would 
be a business strategy for the country for the next decade or two.
<P>
	I will take leave and look forward to committee work and to 
debating the bill at third reading.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-99, 
an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the great things the member 
for Kamloops brings to the House is his ability to remind the 
Liberal Party from time to time when it tends to move a little too 
far to the right. The Reform Party influence is pretty obvious in the 
bill, but we have to focus on some of those matters.
<P>
	The bill will go to committee. Contrary to what the member said, 
the bill cannot be amended by regulation. We will make that 
amendment in committee. Hopefully all members will continue in 
the same spirit we have had in the committee to amend the bill.
<P>
	The member alluded to an idea in the first part of his speech 
about young entrepreneurs needing access to start up capital. It was 
a very important insight into a very important issue all of us in the 
House must address. Even Reform Party members would agree. I 
notice they are agreeing.
<P>
	I also noticed something in my own community. I ache when I 
see some young talent that has just finished  engineering school or 
university and the old institutions or the larger corporations that 
used to be there to provide their first jobs are no longer hiring 
young people. Many of them are frustrated, and we have not 
addressed the issue head on in terms of providing entrepreneurial 
support systems that are required if they are to get going.
<P>
	I am thinking aloud. When we go into committee I would be 
interested in the member's views or thoughts on looking at the 
whole list of criteria in the Small Business Loans Act. Should we 
look at the notion of including a clause in the bill that deals with 
young entrepreneurs? The bill could be a tool used by banks to 
make them a little more sensitive. Obviously the bill will help bank 
managers take the extra risk they probably would not take on their 
own.
<P>
	What would the member for Kamloops say about possibly 
looking into that area as a way of altering the bill to look after 
young entrepreneurs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, we acknowledge that in the early days 
SBLA was intended to be a mechanism to provide encouragement 
for bankers to lend money to small businesses. In the same spirit, 
there is a new concern out there which the hon. member has 
described well. It may be an opportunity to encourage the banks to 
take advantage of the SBLA to provide necessary funding to these 
newly emerging group of entrepreneurs.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	A mechanism is about to be put in place to track the lending of 
financial institutions and to see where the loans are going and to 
what extent the banks are responding to the new needs in society. It 
is a useful step.
<P>
	It is time to look at new mechanisms and I will very briefly 
mention one. Some states in the United States had a vehicle called 
agri-bonds, that were somewhat like Canada Savings Bonds, to 
provide agricultural funding. These were set aside for agricultural 
use only. Farmers and ranchers were encouraged to invest in 
agri-bonds knowing that the money would go back to assist hard 
pressed farmers in their state. That is a bit of a generalization but it 
summarizes the point.
<P>
	Troublesome areas, such as tourism related businesses, where it 
is difficult to find funding for new tourist related projects, should 
be identified. Could we not consider the development of a ``toury'' 
bond as opposed to an agri-bond? Investors would put their money 
into a toury bond, knowing that the money would go to help new 
Canadian hospitality related businesses to expand or be created. It 
would be a way to direct money to tourism, as opposed to the old 
favourite of much of the money, the RRSP, a certain percentage of 
which is being invested overseas or in other countries. I would like 
to see a little more channelling of some of these funds into 
troublesome areas such as tourist or hospitality related industries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15892"> 15892 </A></B>
<P>
	It is another idea on which my friend from 
Broadview-Greenwood could respond at some later time. The 
Canadian toury bond could be a take-off on the U.S. agri-bond.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to tell the member for Kamloops that I found 
his speech very interesting. I share his enthusiasm for small 
business and realize the importance of it. I am concerned about one 
particular item, community futures. I would like to have his 
expertise on this.
<P>
	Taxpayers' money is being used by community futures. Granted, 
some of the businesses that apply do very well and have some 
excellent results. However a high rate of those businesses do not 
succeed and, at least in the ones I happened to scrutinize, there does 
not appear to be any accountability for losses. This is the 
taxpayers' money and I am sure taxpayers feel they should know 
how it is being spent. The Privacy Act seems to get in the way when 
we inquire about accountability.
<P>
	I wonder what the member for Kamloops feels regarding losses 
in the community futures program and does he feel there should be 
some accountability?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. Of course there 
needs to be more accountability built into the program. I would 
identify that as one of the continuing areas of concern with the 
community futures program.
<P>
	In my estimation and my experience the value of the program 
depends on the personnel who manage it and the expertise of the 
individuals who decide who gets a loan and who does not.
<P>
	In Kamloops we have had a very high success rate. But there will 
be losses, just as there are losses with bank loans and other kinds of 
loans. Even if there was a certain loan loss, it might be an 
indication of some success. The role of community futures seems 
to be to provide funding for those relatively high risk business 
ventures that cannot, for whatever reason, obtain funding from 
more traditional lending sources and therefore appeal for support 
from community futures boards.
<P>
	If I may use this opportunity to mention a shortcoming of the 
existing system, it is that individuals who have submitted business 
plans and have what appear to be good business ideas and are 
encouraged to continue, but when they are rejected it often seems 
to be just luck. They are just rejected. The client walks away after 
spending many weeks or months preparing a thoughtful, careful 
business plan only to have dreams and hopes shattered. We must 
have a better system of appeal or a follow-up educational program 
to indicate to those men and women where they may be a little in 
error in their planning. This is another shortcoming.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Of all federal government programs of which I am personally 
aware and have some understanding of their use and value, this 
community futures program is far the best.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin my comments I should note that I was listening closely to the 
member for Kamloops. I know of his interest in the banking 
industry, of his lengthy experience here in the House and I believe 
on the finance committee.
<P>
	In his remarks he used words such as deeply disappointed and 
pathetic and other kinds of language. However, I recall being in 
Toronto recently with the Standing Committee on Industry where 
we heard from the banks. I believe the testimony was in July or 
August. In the promotional material from either the Royal Bank or 
the CIBC, in which the hon. member had spent six weeks, it was 
using comments of his praising the banks. I was disappointed to see 
that.
<P>
	It gives me pleasure to speak to this bill. The provisions of the 
bill are the result of consultations with leading Canadian business 
people such as the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. 
Equally if not more important to the undertaking was the report of 
the Standing Committee on Industry ``Taking Care of Small 
Business''. I had the privilege to sit on that committee as a 
government member from western Canada.
<P>
	The legislative measures introduced in Bill C-99 are ultimately 
about access to capital for small business. Following the recession 
which began around 1990 small businesses in Canada had 
undergone unprecedented restructuring for a new and emerging 
global economy. These challenges have been more difficult 
because of the impediments and constraints to access to much 
needed capital.
<P>
	Bill C-99 through amendments to the Small Business Loans Act 
will provide a more predictable relationship between the banks, the 
Government of Canada and the business community. I will not 
reiterate here the specific provisions of the SBLA but will merely 
state its intent and purpose is to enhance that financial environment 
and relationship between borrowers or small business and the 
Canadian financial institutions.
<P>
	Stated very simply, the Government of Canada agrees to stand 
with small business and where the banks have refused to take the 
risk on new or expanding businesses, the government will partner 
and stand with small business to ensure small business loans are 
available to those who need it the most.
<P>
	It is instructive to state that legislative changes are, in addition to 
reacting to the recommendations of the business community, in 
keeping with the government's belief that small business wants this 
government, and  indeed all governments in Canada, to reduce their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15893"> 15893 </A></B>
<P>
expenditures including those which include direct and indirect 
subsidies to small businesses.
<P>
	In recent years the SBLA program has cost taxpayers almost $20 
million to $30 million a year. However, the loan loss coverage for 
the year 1994-95 is estimated to run at close to $100 million, 
threatening the sustainability of the program itself.
<P>
	Of equal importance is the fact that 40 per cent of the loans 
covered by this insurance program would have been made 
regardless. We are told by outside experts analysing the loan 
applications made through the banks that 40 per cent of those loans 
would have been made anyway. They did not need this expensive 
coverage that government was providing.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Without the high cost of the subsidy these firms would now be 
seeking financing at a much lower cost than under the provisions of 
this bill. Furthermore, this will allow those firms that really need 
financing to have those 40 per cent move out into the traditional 
lending areas and those new small businesses will occupy the space 
at the bottom or the top of the lending priorities and we hope 
creating new jobs.
<P>
	During the presentations made to the committee on industry the 
witnesses told members that they would be willing to pay higher 
premiums, for instance, in the knowledge based industries if they 
could get the capital needed. Repeatedly the 60 interveners and 
witnesses that we saw and an equal number the presentations that 
were submitted to the committee were saying to us that they did not 
mind paying 1 or 2 per cent more on a loan because if they have a 
knowledge based industry they are prepared to pay that kind of 
money to the financial institutions if they are willing to take a risk 
on them. The point spread was not the real issue.
<P>
	It is quite interesting to note that the small business community 
continually talks about the importance of the cost of borrowing 
money. They were so convinced of their product, so convinced of 
their market access, so convinced of their success in those small 
businesses, that they did not mind paying another point or two. 
They needed an opportunity and somebody to stand with them to 
take a risk on those businesses.
<P>
	I would like to talk for a moment about western Canada and in 
particular of my riding of Provencher in Manitoba. Farming and 
small business is really the backbone of that constituency. 
Increasingly I am told by finance officials in the department of 
finance in Manitoba that small business in the agricultural sector is 
going to increasingly in the 21st century provide the cash receipts 
for the finance department as well.
<P>
	This reflects the fact that in western Canada the number of 
people employed in small businesses is almost 40 per cent. What is 
really striking, and a lot of folks  perhaps do not realize it, is that in 
Ontario it is only 32 per cent. These statistics are quite revealing 
and demonstrate clearly to me, as a member from Manitoba, the 
importance of small business in western Canada and in the next 
five or ten years how important this sector will become in our area.
<P>
	During the first quarter of 1994 in Manitoba, for example, 
companies with up to 50 employees accounted for almost 20,000 
jobs, far in excess of those larger companies with 300 employees or 
more. In 1994 companies with less than five staff also accounted 
for many of the growing small businesses in Manitoba. I am told 
4,737 new business name registrations were filed in Manitoba in 
1995.
<P>
	A profile of these is very important. I speak to this issue as a 
member from rural Canada, from rural Manitoba. A profile of the 
start-up businesses in western Canada demonstrates that a typical 
new firm, 87 per cent, have less than five employees and for the 
most part, 57 per cent, are located in rural areas and run out of the 
homes of the operators. In other words, most of the small business 
growth is probably a young or middle aged couple who have started 
a small business out of their home, are looking for a loan, probably 
less than $25,000 to start. This is what we are told in the data we 
have received from the banks. These small businesses are creating 
the jobs in rural Manitoba and indeed in my riding of Provencher. 
There have been great gains made in terms of the start-up of 
companies. In 1990 there were almost 600 registered bankruptcies 
in Manitoba. In 1995 there have been 96. That demonstrates quite 
clearly what is happening. The economy and the dynamics of 
capitalism are restructuring. Larger companies are laying off 
people but young entrepreneurs are stepping up to the plate, trying 
to get access to capital in order to start a small business.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Here we see a profile of the 21st century entrepreneur who is 
younger, working out of the home and more likely to be involved in 
agriculture related small business.
<P>
	What is the federal government doing? In addition to the 
changes to the SBLA and the Small Business Development Bank of 
Canada, what other kinds of measures is the government 
employing, particularly in western Canada, to help these people?
<P>
	Through the auspices of the Department of Western Economic 
Diversification the government will provide a fund of $30 million 
for debt capital. These resources will be directed toward 
biotechnology and agri-biotechnology with loans ranging from 
$50,000 to $500,000. There is also an innovative ten-year program 
creating a $100 million capital pool to assist Canadian agricultural 
value added processing firms through patient debt capital. The 
government will partner these agreements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15894"> 15894 </A></B>
<P>
	The banks have complained both publicly and to the standing 
committee that in responding to the needs of the business 
community the government was bank bashing. I want to make it 
clear this was never the intention of the committee. It was merely 
to prod the banks, as the hon. member for Kamloops suggested, 
to open up their gates for small business to have access to capital.
<P>
	Congratulations to the banks for doing that. The Royal Bank of 
Canada and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have joined 
with the western economic development fund to provide this 
patient debt capital and they should be applauded for that. 
However, there is a lot of work to do and a long way to go.
<P>
	What the government is prepared to do through these public and 
private instruments is reach to the small business community, to 
stand with it and encourage it to take the necessary risks.
<P>
	There have been a number of recent initiatives in my riding 
which are important and give testimony to the growth in the 
agricultural and small business sectors. There is a great change 
going on not only in the small business sector. As we have heard 
many times, the government is cutting back on its expenditures. 
That is what the Canadian people have asked it to do. The 
government has made changes to the Western Grain Transportation 
Act and those subsidies to business pursuant to its obligations 
under the WTO.
<P>
	What has been the outcome of these programs in western 
diversification? Recently I had the privilege with the Minister of 
Western Economic Diversification to join with 25 farmers from the 
Altona region of southern Manitoba, where we produce some of the 
best durum wheat in the world, to provide them with a $1 million 
loan for a pasta plant.
<P>
	These are the initiatives young farmers are asking the 
government to undertake with them. They intend to build a $5 
million plant. They will put in $1.5 million of their own money and 
hopefully there will be a financial institution, perhaps in southern 
Manitoba, which will step up to the plate and say it believes in the 
process as well. It will create jobs in the community of Altona and 
St. Jean.
<P>
	It is vital to not only ship our raw resources out of the country 
but to keep them within our borders, to create the value added, to 
create the jobs, to keep the wealth and the technology in Canada. 
This is increasingly important.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Recently there was an announcement by McCain of a $55 
million expansion of its potato processing plant. I had the privilege 
of joining with some private sector investors and my colleagues in 
the province of Manitoba, the provincial government, to make an 
announcement for a $55 million canola crushing plant.
<P>
	Farmers, rather than paying $800 to ship their canola to the west 
coast or through Thunder Bay, can now drive their trucks 50 or 100 
miles down a two lane highway to deliver that product to that plant. 
The jobs and the wealth from the value added of that product will 
stay with those farmers.
<P>
	The pasta plant provides such a dramatic example of that. 
Farmers last year were getting about $160 a tonne for durum wheat 
used for pasta. Astoundingly, Canadians had imported 77,000 
tonnes of pasta, packaged, at a price of almost $1,600 a ton. It is a 
great idea that the Government of Canada would stand with those 
25 farmers and say: ``Instead of shipping your product to the U.S. 
where it is being processed and shipped back to Canada, we will 
provide you a loan, not a grant, not a giveaway, a loan''. Through 
that loan and working with those people that $1,600 will stay in our 
communities. That is a good thing, a positive thing.
<P>
	We are expecting within a few months, after the announcement 
of the changes to the Crow, close to $500 million of investment in 
Manitoba alone. The banks have a role to play in this. The 
government cannot repeatedly be the instrument and the primary 
catalyst for these kinds of undertakings. The banks have a fiduciary 
responsibility, having the privilege of banking in this country, to 
act and react and join in partnership with small business. This is the 
one of the key areas they have forgotten.
<P>
	I conclude my comments on a recent initiative in my riding of 
Provencher, again through the auspices of the minister responsible 
for western economic development, with the francophone 
communities in Manitoba. The francophone communities have 
developed a francophone chamber of commerce with ten different 
communities, six of which are in my riding.
<P>
	We have said we are willing to stand with those communities and 
work with them to utilize their capacities of their French language, 
their entrepreneurial skills, their low labour costs, their style of 
living which is outside of Winnipeg in wonderful communities. If 
they choose they can send their children to an English school or to a 
French school. There are both there. We have stood with these 
mayors and reeves and people in the French communities to 
provide funding of up to $1.5 million over five years to work with 
them.
<P>
	We hope and believe that people from across the country and 
indeed the world will invest in those French communities and 
capitalize on their capabilities in precisely the same way thatMr. McKenna in New Brunswick has been doing over the last two 
years.
<P>
	This is a clear example of a French community in western 
Canada, in rural Manitoba, whose origins are from the St. Maurice 
valley in Quebec, LagimodiÃ¨re and the first settlers who came from 
the St. Maurice valley and settled in the west, whose descendants 
are Louis Riel,  the first member of Parliament for Provencher, the 
seat I now occupy.
<P>
	I am here to report to the House that these French people I 
service and have the privilege of servicing in the riding of 
Provencher in rural western Canada are doing very well indeed. 
They have their French language. They have their French culture. 
They have their French communities.

<P>
	They are not asking to remove themselves from Canada. They 
are not asking to tear themselves apart from the people of 
Manitoba. They are telling me to tell the House they are doing very 
well and that they are joining with the Government of Canada in 
these kinds of initiatives.
<P>
	They are not abandoned. We are with them. The Government of 
Canada is with them and I believe all Canadians are with them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
enjoying the speeches of the hon. member and the hon. member for 
Kamloops.
<P>
	One certainly has to agree and be thankful and glad for 
individuals being successful in the member's riding on these new 
enterprises. The help they got is great.
<P>
	The difficulty was mentioned by the speaker from Kamloops 
when he talked about a survey he did in his riding. He talked about 
what we can do to help enlighten the ideas of new enterprises and 
help them begin and grow; not just for new entrepreneurs but for 
older ones who may change careers from time to time.
<P>
	All of that is very important. It is especially important when one 
hears his response when they say get out of the way, get out of the 
way.
<P>
	In the early part of the 1990s in my area of Wild Rose, which is 
likewise rural and small towns, many small businesses through the 
first two or three years following the GST went into receivership. 
In many of the cases they declared the GST was the straw that 
broke the camel's back.
<P>
	They were struggling. They were having a tough time. Along 
came the GST and that really brought the final crunch. That was not 
the case in all of these. I am sure every member would be able to 
find some enterprise that flopped specifically because of the GST.
<P>
	People say to the governments get out of their way, stay off their 
backs, stay out of their pockets and they will make it. Give them 
that initial boost they need. I certainly support that idea.
<P>
	I carry with me in my briefcase the red ink book, the book of 
broken promises. It says the Liberal government will replace the 
GST with a system that generates equivalent revenues-I worry 
where that equivalency will come from-is fair to consumers and 
to small business  and minimizes disruption to small business, all 
very key statements and very important.
<P>
	I also read of the mandate of 12 months for this to happen. We 
are now in the 25th month and nothing has happened with the GST. 
It would not be fair of me to ask the hon. member why the deputy 
minister has not resigned with the promise of doing so within this 
12-month period.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could enlighten the House in any way as 
to what small business has to look forward to beyond being able to 
get started. That is the first step. Will we achieve things to help 
them continue and get out of the way and not be disruptive?
<P>
	Will we see the GST replaced? How long will it take? Obviously 
it will take longer than this book says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
He raises some valid points and concerns. It is no small secret that 
the Canadian business community is very concerned about the 
goods and services tax. It was concerned about it when it was 
announced and of course it still is. However, that never did the 
government or the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister 
say that we did not need the revenue. In its previous form as the 
manufacturers' sales tax in 1984 of 9 per cent and then moving up, 
I believe, in 1992-93 to about 13 per cent or 14 per cent, prior to 
being changed to the GST, the Government of Canada has been 
dependent on those revenues and will continue to need them.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The difficulty is the structure and the nature of the tax. The 
member is quite correct when he states that the imposition of the 
GST had an inflationary effect and stalled purchases. For example, 
someone may want to build a home in the riding of Wild Rose or 
Provencher. That person would order a $100,000 of materials and 
then there would be labour involved. When taking that lumber out 
of the yard that person would be stopped at the gate and charged 
another $7,000. That, of course, is going to kill investment and 
purchases. I think people have been painfully aware of that.
<P>
	The government has made it quite clear, particularly leading up 
to the next budget that we will be addressing the matter. The 
parliamentary secretary has spoken about the GST only in the last 
couple of days and mentioned that we are equally concerned about 
it on this side of the House.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member from Alberta to speak to his provincial 
counterparts and ask them to join with the other provinces and with 
the Government of Canada to work out some reasonable solutions 
to deal with a harmonized tax which will be in the best interests of 
all Canadians and, therefore, the Canadian economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate  at this time to 
recognize the member for Provencher for all the work he has done 
in our industry committee during the last two years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15896"> 15896 </A></B>
<P>
	When we started the debate on how we could improve access to 
capital a lot of people thought we would have one or two meetings, 
bring the banks in and they would probably give us a good public 
relations speech which would take our eyes off the ball and we 
would then lose focus on the issue.
<P>
	I want to say to the member that his courage, commitment and 
support in keeping a rigid focus on making sure that the whole bank 
attitude toward small business really changed. It was not just a PR 
show and then put it on the back burner. It is something we have 
stuck with over the last two years. The member for Provencher has 
made a fabulous contribution to the industry committee. I know all 
members from the Reform Party and from the Bloc Quebecois 
would certainly support the view I express here today.
<P>
	My question for the member has to do with the great story about 
the past operation in his riding, the value added. That was an 
exciting story for me to hear. I felt like I wanted to rush out to 
Manitoba. It sounds like there is more action there than in a lot of 
the regions in the country. I salute the member for that.
<P>
	I want him to tell me why those entrepreneurs got so excited and 
moved from exporters of raw products into taking the risks of 
turning themselves into manufacturers, taking a raw product and 
going to the finished packaged good? How was that done?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would simply ask the 
member for Provencher in his response to please keep it within the 
next two minutes if possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. Basically, the 
praise for this particular initiative rests not with the member for 
Provencher but with the Prairie Harvest farm group from Altona 
which came up with the idea.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	I can only tell the member that the role of the Government of 
Canada throughout this whole process has been one of facilitator. 
These kinds of innovative ideas with respect to secondary 
processing of our natural resources, which the World Bank has just 
said that Canada is number two in the world, have been there for 
quite some time.
<P>
	I want to point out our trade difficulties with the U.S. and the cap 
on durum wheat which was unfairly placed on us by the Americans. 
The Government of Canada responded to that unfair trade action by 
going through the office of the Prime Minister to the minister of 
agriculture and indeed the minister of western economic 
development to say: ``Okay, if we cannot ship our durum over the 
border, let us be really smart and keep it  in our own back yard. We 
will process it and sell it to Canadians and Americans''.
<P>
	The short answer of course to the parliamentary secretary is that 
the Prairie Harvest group out of Altona came up with an idea, 
approached the Government of Canada for some help and we were 
glad to act as a lever on this important project.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for Provencher for his co-operation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not intend to speak on this bill but there are some 
things that have concerned me for some time about small business 
and this is an opportunity to say a few things.
<P>
	Bill C-99 gives access to capital for small businesses in Canada. 
My concern is basically if it is really looking at small business, the 
value of small business to our country and just what small business 
needs. That is where my concern stems from, where the banks have 
refused to take a risk. I contend that the banks should have taken a 
risk in the past. We do have the Federal Business Development 
Bank which was in the past supposed to be the bank of last resort. 
Often this has not been the case and somebody else has had to come 
up with the funds.
<P>
	If we are talking about other programs for small business, like 
community futures, it really does depend, as the member for 
Kamloops said, on the expertise of those that run those programs. I 
have had some experience with it and I have found that perhaps that 
is one of the reasons why some of the losses are a little greater than 
they should be.
<P>
	Of course there is risk involved. There is a risk involved for 
anybody going into a small business and we expect some losses. 
However, we do not expect the amount of loss to be higher than 
normal businesses would have going through the banks.
<P>
	There have been some successful businesses through the 
community futures. Some good ones are still running right now in 
my community. However, the difficulty with the community 
futures program is that some of the businesses that are successful 
could have been funded by the Federal Business Development 
Bank which is the bank of last resort. It should have been funded 
there, not with the taxpayers' dollars in another program.
<P>
	What I am trying to say is that community futures has to be 
accountable. There is no bottom line. We have a Privacy Act and 
we cannot access that information. That is not acceptable to the 
Canadian taxpayers. I found the rate of losses higher and, being 
unaccountable, therefore unacceptable to me as an MP responsible 
for taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	I felt that the people going into the community futures program 
were protected so that perhaps the incentive to succeed may not be 
as great if one knows one does not  have to worry if one has a loss. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15897"> 15897 </A></B>
<P>
In small business there is always a challenge and a risk. Those 
people who go into a small business are usually entrepreneurs who 
have some wonderful talents and expertise. We usually see good 
results. Unfortunately, often in community futures we do not see 
this because the accountability is not there. Wherever we do not 
have accountability we have a future problem of breakdown.
<P>
	The purpose of the Federal Business Development Bank is that it 
is a bank of last resort. It is supposed to be the money lender of last 
resort.
<P>
	The member for Kamloops said it very well. He said that small 
businesses just want the government to get out of their way. Being 
in small business myself I can say that this is exactly true. We need 
a healthy marketplace if we are in business. We need to have fewer 
burdens on us.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The tax structure is far too heavy today to encourage anyone to 
go into small business. The first couple of years are difficult. In the 
past if businesses had troubles the Federal Business Development 
Bank was not always there to back them up but often put them into 
receivership at a time when all they needed was some support to get 
through. I would suggest the Federal Business Development Bank 
has not always done its job in the past.
<P>
	Small businesses want less government interference. They need 
some incentive. We are talking about younger people coming into 
the marketplace. I have often mentioned this in my community and 
I have talked to small businesses in my community about this. 
There is a program in Europe where small businesses apprentice a 
younger person coming out of a college, a technical school or 
whatever. If our small businesses apprenticed a young person for a 
year, they would be providing a training program built into the 
most natural area possible. It would be built into the marketplace, 
the economy, into a natural spot in the economy, in a working spot 
in the economy.
<P>
	I honestly feel when speaking to small businesses this is an 
avenue we could travel. Considering small business supplies about 
80 per cent of jobs, I feel this is an ideal opportunity for our young 
people that are unemployed with nowhere to go to get the training 
they need if they do not have it.
<P>
	Why is the small business person going to do this? There would 
obviously have to be some incentive. Perhaps a tax break in some 
area would help as small business is overtaxed already. They have 
the fewest tax breaks. Big business seems to qualify for them where 
small business does not. I would really like to see the government 
take a look at some serious ideas for helping small business in this 
area.
<P>
	The banks have not always lived up to their responsibilities. 
They are there to encourage small business and they are there to do 
it in a realistic way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have enjoyed today's debate because it clearly illustrates the 
different philosophies of the different parties. We on this side 
believe the role of government is to act as facilitator, to aid small 
businesses, to give them the types of tools required not only in the 
financial sector but also in the development of human resources.
<P>
	The hon. member who has just spoken cited some of the areas in 
which she would like to see an improvement. She was referring to 
the concept of developing an apprenticeship system which might 
give some tax breaks to small business and providing the sorts of 
incentives that would result in the development of the type of 
workforce that may be more in tune with the economic reality of 
today's marketplace.
<P>
	I would like to tell the hon. member that the federal government 
has initiated a number of programs in co-operation with the private 
sector which speak to the issues raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	I had the pleasure on August 28 to be in the province of Quebec 
with the president of Chrysler Canada, the CARS Council and a 
local school board to engage in the type of partnership that will 
lead to approximately 1,000 jobs for young people. This is done 
through the youth internship program in co-operation with the 
National Sectoral Council.
<P>
	I would like to speak about these initiatives because they address 
the human resources planning that a modern, developed nation 
should be addressing. In fact, surprisingly, the minister of 
education from the Parti Quebecois was present and co-operated 
with the federal government in kicking off this initiative.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	What does this really mean? It means that we on this side of the 
House have realized we cannot have a program for every challenge 
we face. The answers are really found at the community level, at 
the industry level. Our role as a government is to bring about the 
meetings of the minds around the table, so that we can institute 
programs which deal with the challenges of the ever changing 
nature of the workforce.
<P>
	At that announcement, Chrysler committed itself to provide an 
internship program for 200 young people. The sectoral council 
initiative committed itself to a cumulative number of 1,000. That 
means these young people will go through an internship program 
and will have a job waiting for them at the end of their one year or 
nine months worth of training.
<P>
	This federal government initiative has been extremely 
successful. Under our red book commitment we  originally stated 
that 24,000 young people would participate in this program. To 
date, 27,000 young people are participating. They are participating 
in programs I am certain will bring about positive changes in their 
lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15898"> 15898 </A></B>
<P>
	Equally important is that for the very first time all sectors of our 
society, the educational institutions, industry, labour and 
management, together are addressing standards for the industry. 
They are addressing issues and concerns that have blocked the 
progress of a particular industry.
<P>
	Whom are we linking these industries with? We are linking them 
with Canadians who are willing to learn a profession or trade so 
that they will have the type of skills required in the ever changing 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	Why are we excited about these prospects? We are excited 
because we see our role as a facilitator to be a very important one in 
setting the parameters of economic development within our 
country. That is one initiative which has worked very well. We 
have linked our initiative not just to any industry, but we have 
linked our initiative to industries that provide jobs with a future.
<P>
	For example in the automotive industry, gone are the days when 
there were mechanics. Those are jobs of the past. My father was in 
the trucking industry for a number of years. He would have the 
local mechanic look at his truck and the mechanic would put his ear 
near the engine to hear the noises. That is gone. Computer chips are 
now a very important part of the engine. The job of a mechanic is 
obsolete. What do we do? We have to retrain people to become auto 
technicians, to give them the tools to understand how the new 
engines work.
<P>
	I give that example because I think it is a fundamental one. It 
clearly illustrates how quickly our country and our economy is 
changing. In the same way we cannot fix a 1995 car with a 1965 car 
repair manual, we certainly cannot fix the challenges we face in 
1995, whether it is labour market strategy or small business 
initiatives, with 1965 programs.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	This is very important to this government. It is for this reason 
that we have taken up the challenge to modernize Canada's social 
security system. This is the reason we are reviewing all our training 
programs. This is the reason we are promoting innovative 
programs and effective and strategic partnerships that speak to a 
modern economy.
<P>
	How does this translate to the local reality where I live in my 
riding? What does this all mean to the residents of Aurora, 
Woodbridge, Maple, Richmond Hill, Oak Ridges, King and 
Nobleton? What does it mean to the over 260,000 people I 
represent in the House of Commons? How do I as a member bring 
about this vision of how we modernize and become more 
innovative in real terms? How do I make the translation from this 
beautiful Chamber of the House of Commons on to where the 
people live, play and work?
<P>
	Yesterday was our anniversary as elected officials here. I have 
spent the past couple of years building the partnerships required to 
have real change occur at the community level. Last year I began 
planning and setting priorities for my area. I developed the York 
North technology strategy. Today I take this opportunity to outline 
some of its major principles.
<P>
	Along with the residents of York North, I have realized quite 
clearly that in order to succeed in the new economy we cannot fear 
technology. We cannot fear technology infusion in the workplace. 
We cannot fear that in certain cases technology may reduce 
employment opportunities in old economy industries.
<P>
	Instead of fear, the response I received from the residents of 
York North was one of excitement. Change in a society brings 
about two emotional responses: one either gets anxious about 
change or one gets excited. The people of York North decided that 
there was no great happiness in being anxious about change and 
technology and that we should not only absorb the technological 
revolution which is occurring globally but we should also find 
ways in which we could lead the way in our area.
<P>
	I called a meeting of local stakeholders in my community, 
mayors, business representatives, members of labour unions. I 
called local school boards and people from the Career Foundation, 
the foundation which brings all these people together. I said that 
perhaps we should begin to experiment to find new ways of dealing 
with the technological changes that were occurring.
<P>
	On September 11, 1995 we announced a major local economic 
development strategy, the York region strategic alliance. For now, 
it is a pilot project. What does it do? It gives the businesses in my 
area an opportunity to place their business in a database which can 
be accessed worldwide. We are not happy with just being able to 
access it within Canada. We understand the potential for export. We 
also are fully committed to building worldwide strategic alliances 
in order for business in my community to prosper. This is what 
some of the partners have said about the initiative.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Steve Quinlan, president of Seneca College, said that Seneca 
College, York region, the federal government and other partners 
have co-funded and developed a strategic alliance partnership to 
strengthen opportunities for jobs and growth. This initial research 
is a valuable resource, using information systems technology to 
rapidly assess regional needs in response to a changing global 
economy. This initiative is a pilot model to show how business, 
government and education can in fact work together.
<P>
	Eldred King, chair of the Regional Municipality of York, stated 
that the strategic alliance initiative is an important component of 
the region's visions and plans for the 21st century. The region must 
provide leadership if change is to occur. He said that their plans 
strike a  balance between economic growth, healthy communities 
and sustainable development.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15899"> 15899 </A></B>
<P>
	Mayor Lorna Jackson from the city of Vaughan said that she was 
very excited that Vaughan was chosen as the test site. Not only is it 
one of the fastest growing cities in Canada, it is a bastion for 
industry. She stated: ``I have no doubt that we will serve our 
country proud''.
<P>
	The reason I bring these names to the floor of the House of 
Commons is to clearly illustrate to Canadians that partnerships at 
the local level can work. Government, business and labour can 
come together to create the type of environment in which jobs 
flourish. This partnership is not just found in the riding of York 
North, it is found in every single community in Canada.
<P>
	I say to hon. members that they should return to their ridings and 
engage local stakeholders to take charge of the future of the 
community. They should excite people about the new economy. 
There are great opportunities.
<P>
	If there is one thing about the information highway, if there is 
one thing about the new economy, it is that they have redefined 
time and space. They have made geography less important. Now 
we are linked by satellite. The information highway will link us to 
the world. This is something we should be getting excited about.
<P>
	We need to give people the tools. That is why I am happy with 
the commitment of the federal government to establish the 
Canadian Business Development Bank, which is providing people 
with the important capital to start their businesses.
<P>
	That is why I am happy that on October 2 of this year I was able 
to establish the Vaughan Technology Enterprise Centre where 60 
young people will be taught entrepreneurial studies. They will be 
linked with small business people in the community in a 
mentorship program. They will acquire the skills which are so 
important in creating jobs.
<P>
	That is why I am so happy that the federal government has a 
program called self-employment assistance which has enabled 
34,000 unemployed Canadians to create their own businesses. 
Better still, not only have they created businesses, they have 
created over 68,000 jobs.
<P>
	That is the type of transition we want. We want people to get off 
the unemployment rolls of the country and onto the payrolls of this 
nation. It is happening in every single community.
<P>
	I have a very clear message that we on this side of the House 
understand the important role small business plays. We want to 
clearly reach out in as many ways as possible to bring about 
positive change, jobs and healthy communities throughout this 
land.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to inform the 
House, particularly the parliamentary secretary, that when we 
resume debate on Bill C-99 he will have approximately five 
minutes remaining, should  he so choose, when the bill comes back 
to the House for debate.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-315, an act to complement the present laws of Canada that 
protect the privacy of individual with respect to personal 
information about themselves obtained by certain corporations, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to the House today on the issue of personal 
privacy and specifically on Bill C-315.
<P>
	Canadians are living in a world that seems to get smaller with 
each passing day. The distances that separate us from our families 
and friends are becoming easier to traverse. It has become easier to 
communicate with our families and with others around the globe. 
Sometimes, though, it feels like these same distances are becoming 
a little too short and the rest of the world is getting a little too close.
<P>
	What has led to this dramatic change in our society? The answer 
is simple: the industrial and technological revolution that has so 
dramatically changed the face of Canada over the past 100 years. 
The telephone has brought friends and family from hundreds of 
miles away to within earshot of our voice. The car and the 
aeroplane have reduced long distance trips from months to a matter 
of hours. The computer has put volumes of information at our 
fingertips. The Internet has provided a gateway for the free flow of 
information to a knowledge hungry world.
<P>
	Each of these changes has brought convenience to our daily 
lives. With each change came a loss of some small piece of our 
personal privacy. Historically our laws and traditions have 
responded to some aspects of the loss of our personal privacy. 
Trespassing laws and exclusion orders, for example, keep those we 
do not want to associate with at a distance.
<P>
	Recent telephone innovations like call display and call blocking 
help us see who is trying to contact us and help us prevent 
unwanted calls.
<P>
	Where we as a country fall short, though, is in our response to 
the growth of computer technology. This technology has the ability 
to retrieve, store and send vast  amounts of information. The 
information age has brought a booming industry, creating a $300 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15900"> 15900 </A></B>
<P>
million per year industry in the buying and selling of personal 
information.
<P>
	Ontario's assistant commissioner for privacy recently exclaimed 
that privacy as we know it may not exist in the year 2000. The 
Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Mr. Bruce Phillips, agreed when 
he stated earlier this year that Ottawa should consider protecting 
the right to lead a private life and that in the next year or two is 
really going to tell the tale. Mr. Phillips clearly believes it is time 
for action in protecting personal information.
<P>
	The Privacy Commissioner of Canada is not the only one who 
believes the time is now to protect privacy. The information 
highway advisory council, created by the Ministry of Industry, 
reported last month: ``Manipulation of data may occur without the 
consent of the individual from whom it was collected. Moreover, 
the information is often used for purposes unrelated to those 
purposes for which it was originally collected. Because of the 
enormous potential for abuse there is a need for effective privacy 
protection. Only Quebec has enacted specific legislation governing 
its private sector. The council believes strongly that there should be 
national legislation to establish fair information practices on the 
information highway''.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	A recent Gallup poll conducted for Anderson Consulting, a 
private financial consulting firm based in Toronto, found similar 
concerns about privacy and the information highway: 
``Notwithstanding strong interest in the information highway, 
Canadians have a high level of concern as to how it may affect their 
privacy. Asked to indicate their level of concern for their privacy 
because information about them might be collected by companies 
involved in the information highway, 83.7 per cent described 
themselves as very concerned or somewhat concerned''.
<P>
	Bill C-315 responds to these calls for privacy protection. I 
should put forward a definition of the term personal information. 
The definition of personal information used in crafting Bill C-315 
refers to data on an individual that are recorded. This could include 
name and phone number, business address and phone number, any 
identifiable physical characteristic, religion, national or ethnic 
origin, age or any information about education or financial history.
<P>
	This information is recorded in many ways, including 
electronically such as on a floppy or hard disk, manually on paper 
or microfilm, or virtually as in computer memory or an electronic 
network.
<P>
	Historically there are several sources that reaffirm the right to 
personal privacy. There is the right to privacy as guaranteed in both 
Bill C-62, an act respecting telecommunications, and in the 1989 
case of the Queen v.  Dyment, when it was established that the right 
to privacy does exist in Canada, that it existed before the charter of 
rights and freedoms and that the charter has not diminished that 
right. The CRTC has been vigilant in protecting this right 
especially with regard to junk faxes and messages.
<P>
	There is the right to anonymity as determined by Telecom 
decision CRTC 92-7. In other words, all Canadians have the right 
to be left alone and the right to remain anonymous as they go about 
their daily activities.
<P>
	In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, of which Canada is a member, has established a set 
of basic principles to help define and support the protection of 
personal privacy. These principles share a common theme that the 
collection of personal information should be open, accountable and 
limited to the purposes intended.
<P>
	Canadians are often surprised when they learn how information 
is being collected and where it ends up. Personal information on 
Canadians is being collected in a wide variety of ways. Credit card 
applications, contest forms, polls and surveys, warranty cards, 
magazine subscriptions and other means are all used in one form or 
another to collect personal information.
<P>
	By combining these individual client lists a detailed profile of an 
individual can be made without the knowledge of that individual. 
Firms in Canada and around the world are able to have multiple 
lists, cross referenced, and create a remarkably accurate portrait of 
an individual.
<P>
	Allow me to quote from a recent consumer report study: ``By 
overlapping the data available through thousands of information 
systems it is now possible to create a remarkable picture of anyone. 
That picture could include your age, income, political party, 
marital status, the number of children you have, the magazines you 
read, your employment history and your military and school 
records. A database might also know what kind of breakfast cereal 
you eat, the make of the car you drive and even the brand of diapers 
your children wear''.
<P>
	A recent article in ``Telecommunications Policy'' entitled ``Will 
My House Still be My Castle?'' added to this concern: ``In the 
future things will be very different. It will essentially be one stop 
shopping for the data gatherer in the digital super highway. 
Information gathering, analysis, correlation and dissemination can 
all be automated, depersonalized and made inexpensive. The time 
to establish coherent public policies and safeguards is before such 
systems are in place and adverse precedents and vested interests 
become established''.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Currently Canadians enjoy very little personal privacy 
protection. The current Privacy Act, Bill P-21, is limited to 
information 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15901"> 15901 </A></B>
<P>
held by the federal government and certain federal institutions. 
Similar laws exist in eight of our twelve provinces and territories.
<P>
	In the Northwest Territories, the Yukon Territory, Prince Edward 
Island and Alberta action has not yet been taken to protect personal 
information held by these provincial and territorial governments.
<P>
	When it comes to controlling information held by the private 
sector the picture is far less promising. Only Quebec has taken the 
bold step of limiting the sale and access of this personal 
information.
<P>
	Through bill 68, the province of Quebec has given its citizens the 
power to say no to the sale or exchange of their personal 
information. No other provincial government has acted as 
decisively as Quebec in this important area. I applaud Quebec for 
its initiative here.
<P>
	Even Quebec's law, though, is far from complete. Many areas of 
business such as banking, cable television and numerous 
transportation companies are beyond the reach of Quebec's bill 68. 
This leaves Quebecers as vulnerable to privacy breaches in the 
federal jurisdiction as their counterparts in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Private industry, in a bid to avoid further federal and provincial 
control, has tried to address these privacy concerns. The Canadian 
Direct Marketing Association has created a bureau to deal with 
client list complaints and circulates the names of individuals who 
do not want their names on any member lists. However, individuals 
must repeat the request several times a year to ensure their names 
stay off the computer lists. As well, not all direct marketers are 
members of the CDMA, making privacy protection a hit or miss 
exercise.
<P>
	Recently the Information Highway Advisory Council called on 
the Canadian government to regulate the flow of personal 
information. The Canadian Banker's Association has also created a 
set of voluntary privacy guidelines. According to a director with 
the office of the privacy commissioner, though, these guidelines 
are wide enough to drive a logging truck through. The bank 
guidelines are so ineffective that the Royal Bank of Canada 
admitted in 1993 that it sometimes included client card numbers, 
names, ages and addresses to market research firms without the 
client's knowledge.
<P>
	We have to face the facts. Self-policing is not working. I have 
seen case after case in which guidelines and bureaus have turned 
their heads when the corporations break the rules or, at the very 
best, have given them a very light slap on the wrist. Industry has 
clearly failed Canadians in this area and it is time for Parliament to 
take action.
<P>
	With this in mind let us turn our attention to Bill C-315. The bill 
stems from the concerns of a constituent of mine, expressed to me 
when he learned he had ended up on some questionable mailing list 
through which he had received advertisements for explicit 
pornographic material. After doing some extensive research I 
learned  the federal government has yet to seriously address the 
issue of personal privacy.
<P>
	Bill C-315 is the first step in addressing this serious oversight. 
The bill was designed to work in harmony with provincial privacy 
laws such as Quebec's bill 68 and to respect provincial jurisdictions 
as outlined in the Constitution. At the same time, it sends a tough 
message to companies around the country that the misuse of 
personal information is a concern and that the privacy of people has 
to be respected.
<P>
	Bill C-315 would require all companies covered by the Canada 
Labour Code to abide by some very strict privacy protection 
guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Before selling any list containing an individual's personal 
information, the person shall be sent a notice stating, first, that 
personal information about the individual as listed in the notice is 
held by the company; second, that permission is needed to keep the 
person's name on the list; and, third, that the person shall be told 
his or her name can be removed at any time at no cost to the 
individual.
<P>
	At the same time any corporation using purchased lists shall 
send each individual on the list a notice containing, first, the source 
of this information; second, a description of the information held; 
and, third, a statement outlining how the individual can have that 
personal information removed from the list at any time and at no 
cost to themselves.
<P>
	Companies receiving a removal request must comply within 10 
days and confirm with the individual that his or her request has 
been acted on. Breaking this law would be classified as a summary 
conviction. For a first offence a company or individual breaking 
this law would face a fine of up to $5,000. A repeat offence could 
double the maximum to $10,000. Charges would have to be laid 
within one year of the offence.
<P>
	I will be the first to admit that these are tough measures. In my 
view they only reflect the importance people place on their own 
privacy. Polls have shown time and time again that Canadians feel 
their privacy is at risk and action must be taken to reverse this 
trend.
<P>
	Interesting enough, the criticism I have received concerning the 
fine limits is that the proposed fines are not high enough, that for 
large institutions affected by the bill the suggested fines would 
merely be a nuisance or a slap on the wrist.
<P>
	The Canadian public wants to have more control over personal 
information. A national privacy survey published in 1993 
discovered that 71 per cent totally agreed that privacy rules should 
apply to both government and business. Sixty-six per cent believe 
that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15902"> 15902 </A></B>
<P>
government should be working with business to come  up with 
some guidelines on privacy protection in the private sector.
<P>
	The Privacy Commissioner of Canada estimates that the average 
Canadian has his or her name crunched through various computers 
across the continent perhaps five to ten times daily. He further 
estimates that in the private sector alone $300 million a year 
annually changes hands in the buying and selling of client lists.
<P>
	This industry is growing at an incredible rate as technological 
information becomes more widespread. The privacy commissioner 
thinks that now is the time to take action in the protection of 
personal information and I agree with him wholeheartedly. The 
rights to anonymity and privacy are constantly being threatened in 
the pursuit of information. It is time to restore a balance and return 
to Canadians their right to have some control over their personal 
information, privacy and anonymity.
<P>
	Let us respect this right by supporting Bill C-315 when it is 
brought to a vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity 
to speak on Bill C-315, a private member's bill put forward by the 
member for Cariboo-Chilcotin.
<P>
	I came into the House not as supporter of the bill initially when I 
read it. However after listening to the member's speech I became 
more and more convinced that he had the basis of a solid piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	I cannot stand here today and make a final decision on what the 
government will decide in terms of voting on the legislation, but as 
a government we will have to look at the bill to see if there is some 
way to get it into committee.
<P>
	Basically I support the aim of the bill. I want to make it perfectly 
clear that the way to achieving that aim should be modified. Some 
views have been put forward indicating that the bill is unduly 
burdensome on the industry and that it has a narrow focus when 
broad based measures are needed to ensure a level playing field for 
industry while protecting the privacy of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Let us deal with the issue of it being unduly burdensome. The 
bill, and I am not saying it cannot be amended, would require that 
each time a mailing list is sold would necessitate notification and 
individual consent. More flexible approaches have been suggested 
such as the one using a combination of general principles and 
legislation coupled with industry self-regulation.
<P>
	Another concern that has been put forward is about the focus of 
the bill being too narrow at this time. As the bill is written now it 
applies only to the sale of lists containing personal information 
when in reality the normal business practice is the rental of such 
lists. The bill focuses narrowly on lists when a vast amount of  
personal data can be blended and put together from the consumer 
transactional data currently exchanged between firms or within a 
large organization. The definition of personal information provided 
in the bill is unduly narrow. It is more restrictive than the definition 
of personal information found in the federal Privacy Act.
<P>
	Also the bill only applies to corporations when mailing list 
information is often transferred between individual proprietorships 
and partnerships that are not organized into corporate forms. That 
can be fixed also.
<P>
	Bill C-315 applies to the narrow range of corporations engaging 
in a federally regulated activity. As used in the bill, federally 
regulated corporations would include, most notably, those firms 
operating in the interprovincial and international transportation 
sectors: broadcasting, telecommunications and the banking 
industry. Needless to say, many corporations and sectors are 
exchanging personal data that fall outside these delineated 
categories.
<P>
	The effect of the bill is to protect consumers in a narrow range of 
circumstances from a narrow range of commercial actors in a 
burdensome fashion without any co-ordination or harmonization 
with other current or proposed privacy initiatives. If passed in its 
current form, the result would not be a level playing field of the 
clear and consistent privacy rules applying to all sectors but a 
patchwork quilt of uneven privacy obligations from sector to 
sector, firm to firm, and jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
<P>
	Other initiatives currently under way might provide a better 
approach. At least we can listen to some other initiatives. We are 
currently studying the options, as the hon. member knows. Most 
notable is the Canadian Standards Association model privacy code 
ratified in September by a committee consisting of a broad cross 
section of consumer, private sector and government representatives 
including Industry Canada's office of consumer affairs, Spectrum 
Information Technologies and telecommunications units.
<P>
	Three years in the making the model code sets out 10 principles 
governing how personal information should be collected, retained, 
kept up to date, used and disclosed by the private sector. Adoption 
of the code by firms using mailing lists would tend to ensure that 
consumers are informed of the existence of such lists and are given 
the opportunity to consent to their use and to verify their accuracy.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The code is voluntary in nature but a number of different parties 
have suggested that it could become the basis for flexible 
framework legislation, leaving it to industry sectors to determine 
how they would meet the CSA, the Canadian standards.
<P>
	The CSA code provides a clear example of the commitment and 
ability of consumer groups, the private sector and governments to 
work together to develop  privacy protection solutions. As the 
member mentioned in his speech, the Information Highway Advi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15903"> 15903 </A></B>
<P>
sory Council recommended a broad based, flexible privacy 
framework legislation drawing on the CSA model code as a basis. 
We have also received a recommendation from the Canadian Direct 
Marketing Association urging the creation of a flexible national 
privacy framework legislation using the CSA model privacy code 
as a basis.
<P>
	The essence of both recommendations is the recognition of the 
need for coherent national privacy standards, protecting the 
consumer while providing the private sector with a flexible and 
level playing field.
<P>
	The member has done a lot of terrific work on the legislation. We 
have heard him put forward many good ideas in his speech. Over 
the next while we will have to review the bill to see if there is some 
way to make some of the necessary amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak on Bill C-315, entitled the protection of 
personal information obtained by certain corporations act, 
sponsored by my colleague from Cariboo-Chilcotin. The bill 
seeks to enhance the protection of every citizen's right to privacy. 
Each and every citizen has a right to privacy that protects any 
confidential information.
<P>
	Personal information is much more than data, much more than a 
simple product. It is the essence of who we are and defines our 
uniqueness. It not only describes the facts but the nuances of our 
life patterns and our choices. The importance of the right to protect 
that individuality is a measure of the importance of the individual 
in society.
<P>
	The right to privacy is well established in our constitutional and 
legal history. It is recognized in our common law and has been 
recognized to be included in the charter of rights and freedoms. In 
Canada we value privacy to such an extent that we established a 
Privacy Commissioner of Canada in 1983. There are also 
provincial and territorial privacy commissioners including in my 
home province of British Columbia.
<P>
	The importance of privacy for individuals and Canadian families 
is shown in that through 1994 and 1995 the federal office of the 
privacy commissioner processed over 1,300 investigations and 
dealt with over 10,000 inquiries from the public.
<P>
	I should like to focus upon the relationship between privacy, 
family and our current laws. Family is the fundamental building 
block in our society. It is the family that provides the social 
cohesion necessary for stability and prosperity in society. Many 
things are needed to promote and provide stability for families. 
Privacy is one of the essential elements needed to ensure 
inviolability of the home.
<P>
	Increasingly, though, the family home is being subjected to 
intrusion from a number of sources. The age  of contemporary 
information technology has meant that personal and confidential 
information has entered into the public realm with little or no 
safeguards established to protect the use and distribution of the 
information. With technology, data collection and assimilation 
become easier and less subject to scrutiny. Information from a 
multitude of sources can be accumulated, cross-referenced, and 
misrepresented with increasing facility and speed. While the public 
becomes increasingly conscious of uncontrolled information flow, 
they worry that the knowledge may lead to manipulation and 
intervention into their lives.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	There is increasing public unease over the issues surrounding 
privacy. Almost 90 per cent of Canadians recently replied that they 
are concerned about their privacy. There is a mounting public 
pressure to initiate greater control to prevent abuse.
<P>
	Of course the single largest collector of information on people is 
the government itself. We have legislation in place to attempt to 
control that information through the Privacy Act. A quick look at 
the statistics from the privacy commissioner is meaningful. 
According to the 1994-95 privacy commissioner's annual report, 
the number of complaints increased over 38 per cent from the 
previous year. The number of inquiries has risen from just over 
1,000 in 1985 to nearly 10,000 in 1995.
<P>
	The use of the multiple information database can construct a 
complete information profile on an individual or that individual's 
family. It can contain everything from their name to their age to 
their political affiliation, military service, and even information 
about related family members. As my colleague mentioned, it can 
contain the stores you shop at, the kinds of food you eat, and 
perhaps even your medical history.
<P>
	The privacy commissioner has estimated that the average 
Canadian's name is processed through a computer five to ten times 
on a daily basis. I believe it is crucial for us to take the measures 
that are necessary to safeguard the privacy of individuals and their 
families. I believe Bill C-315 will do much to assist that.
<P>
	Under the federal Privacy Act only government departments, 
ministries of state, and certain federal institutions are covered. This 
bill would expand those privacy laws by increasing protection to 
include federally regulated institutions. This bill would require that 
those companies that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal 
Canada Labour Code notify an individual whose personal 
information will be sold as part of a list to another corporation or 
client. It would also require that the individual concerned give their 
permission if they want their name on the list. This notice would 
outline the source of the personal information, a description of the 
information held, and a statement that the individual can have their 
name removed from the list at no cost to them. If an individual 
requests that his or her name be  removed from the list, then the 
company concerned will be required to comply with that request 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15904"> 15904 </A></B>
<P>
within ten days and send a confirmation of that removal to the 
individual concerned.
<P>
	This bill expands protection by amending section 2 of the 
Canada Labour Code to include banks, radio broadcasting 
companies, air transportation companies, any shipping lines that 
operate between provinces or between Canada and another country, 
any company involved in the railway, canal, telegraph, or other 
industries linking provinces, and any work identified under the 
Canada Labour Code or deemed for the general advantage of 
Canada. All these fall under federal jurisdiction and are federally 
regulated.
<P>
	The dilemma of privacy issues has been all too common in our 
news lately. The news stories illustrate the tension that exists 
between cost efficiencies and the protection of the integrity of 
information for the protection of the individual.
<P>
	For example, in my province of B.C. the provincial jurisdiction 
of privacy limits was recently tested with the introduction of a 
database on prescription drug usage. This program was introduced 
in the name of cost efficiency in the ever-diminishing health care 
system funding and for the health benefit of preventing 
incompatible or dangerous prescription overlap. However, there 
was a huge public outcry that the privacy of citizens would be 
threatened by the potential misuse of this database. The 
government did set about to dispel those fears and in fact has come 
up with some instructive examples of safeguards for a shared 
database.
<P>
	I want to draw to the attention of the House a statement by the 
B.C. privacy commissioner, Dave Flaherty, who said that too many 
people have too much access to too much information on the 
computer system. That pretty well sums up much of the problem of 
all the world as we proceed with this privacy debate.
<P>
	The banks are probably one of the largest non-governmental 
processors of private information and are also one of the strongest 
resisters to privacy legislation. They maintain that their voluntary 
code should be sufficient. There have been noteworthy attempts in 
all sectors to voluntarily protect the privacy of information. In 
addition to initiatives by the banks, in 1993 the Canadian Direct 
Mail Association adopted a compulsory code of conduct for its 
members.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	I commend those in the private sector for voluntary measures 
they have taken. However, it is interesting to note that one of the 
largest public outcries to the privacy commission was as a result of 
a recent Visa gold card application of the Royal Bank. Typically, 
banks require a social insurance number specifically and solely for 
the issuance of interest statements under the Income Tax Act. 
Unfortunately, the Royal Bank's recent request for  consent was far 
broader. It reads: ``If I have ever given you my social insurance 
number you may treat it as information and use it as an aid to 
identify me with credit bureaus and other parties. Even if I am no 
longer your client or this agreement terminates, you may keep 
information in your records and use it for the purposes noted 
above.''
<P>
	It is such liberties that make the unbiased and arm's length 
controls of information necessary. With banking institutions 
offering services in diverse fields of deposit taking, trust 
processing, securities and insurance subsidiaries, it is necessary 
that the interests of the consumers and the marketplace be 
protected by comprehensive guidelines.
<P>
	Potential for abuses must be recognized both in what services are 
allowed and in the regulation of the privacy of the information that 
is collected. With legislative rules and penalties there will come a 
predictable and enforceable protection for citizens.
<P>
	Like all government initiatives, privacy regulation involves cost. 
Quebec introduced privacy legislation in the private sector two 
years ago. The Quebec experience would seem to indicate that their 
new private sector privacy commissioner has generated minimal 
resistance, very mild activity, with only 300 complaints, and 
minimal cost. This would seem to indicate that there can be an 
ongoing affordable privacy control within the private sector.
<P>
	Ideally, the federal system should be designed to be self-funding 
if possible. The one question I would have of my colleague's 
proposal is the possibility of cost recovery for the program. The 
penalties imposed on large institutions seem small and may not 
serve either as a deterrent or be cost-effective.
<P>
	The challenge of protection of the right to privacy is great. The 
growth of that challenge will be exponential as new technologies 
and falling international, provincial, and private borders become 
more and more a reality, not only in the marketplace but in our 
homes. Government and voluntary attention must be given to this 
crucial concern.
<P>
	Today I urge my colleagues from all parties to support my 
colleague on Bill C-315.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I resume debate, 
there has been an oversight by the Chair. In the normal practice of 
private members' hour on the first round I would see if a member 
from each of the official parties was seeking the floor and then 
revert to the normal procedure of government, opposition, and so 
on. An oversight caused me to fail to recognize a member from the 
Bloc Quebecois on the first round. I will now go to the hon. 
member for Drummond and then I will look to the government 
side, if in fact one should choose to speak. That will bring us 
approximately to the conclusion of the first hour of debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15905"> 15905 </A></B>
<P>
	If there should be any questions, feel free to approach me at 
the chair and I will explain it further with the appropriate time 
allocations that have been distributed evenly this evening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
the House today to speak to Bill C-315 standing in the name of the 
hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to complement the present laws of 
Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to 
personal information about themselves obtained by certain 
corporations. It is part of a debate that has been going on for several 
years about the best way to protect personal information obtained 
or held by federally regulated private corporations.
<P>
	In the public sector, the federal Privacy Act already protects 
employees and the public against abuse of this information. 
However, this legislation does not in any way affect the activities of 
private companies that are subject to the Canada Labour Code. The 
latter are therefore free to act as they see fit.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Although it is certainly not my purpose to point an accusing 
finger, we must admit that in some cases, this could lead to abuse 
both unpleasant and unfortunate.
<P>
	In Quebec, as the hon. member pointed out on first reading of 
this bill, a number of unique legislative measures were introduced 
to improve the protection of personal information. In fact, 
Quebec's Civil Code deals with the issue of protecting individual 
privacy, which provisions came into force by a decision of the 
National Assembly in 1993.
<P>
	The Commission d'accÃ¨s Ã  l'information, chaired by the former 
director of <I>Le Devoir</I>, is responsible for implementation of the 
various provisions included in the Act respecting access to 
documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal 
information. Finally, since 1994 the same commission has been 
responsible for implementing legislation on the protection of 
information in the private sector.
<P>
	This goes to show that the protection of personal information, 
both in the private and public sectors, requires considerable 
co-ordination between the various acts and regulations and the 
activities of those responsible for compliance and enforcement. 
Although I did not say so explicitly, it is of course not easy to 
protect privacy fully and effectively. In this respect, Bill C-315 
may seem to be somewhat lacking.
<P>
	First, in its present form Bill C-315 regulates only the sale of 
lists. These lists of names containing personal and confidential 
information could therefore be lent or given away without breaking 
the law. Since these are still the same lists with the same 
information, it seems to me that the mere fact of passing them on to 
various  organizations, for purposes for which they were not 
intended initially, should be prohibited and punished in the same 
way, whether or not any money changed hands.
<P>
	Another aspect I think is unsatisfactory is the description or 
enumeration of what constitutes personal information. As we read 
the bill, we see that information as important as mother tongue, 
place of birth, sexual orientation and political affiliation is not 
included. Does this mean that this kind of information is not 
important enough to warrant protection? It would be important, in 
my opinion, for all information liable to trafficking, or rather to 
commerce, to be protected.
<P>
	Another point: Bill C-315 deals with the transmission of lists 
containing personal information. This implies that any 
entrepreneur so desiring may, in total legality, sell information 
concerning one individual without risking any sanction. This point, 
in my opinion, constitutes a significant glitch in the very principle 
the bill is defending.
<P>
	Before I conclude, looking at the sanctions set out in the bill, it 
will be seen that fines for noncompliance range from $5,000 to 
$10,000. To large companies, which generally have fairly sizeable 
lists, these fines do not mean much, particularly when we know the 
price a list containing confidential personal information can 
command.
<P>
	There is no point here in continuing to examine Bill C-315 line 
by line. Merely reading its contents, plus a proper knowledge of the 
situation it is trying to control, is enough to understand that this 
bill, although well intentioned, is far from being equal to the 
objective it has set itself. There are many shortcomings in this bill. 
A number of amendments could be made to it. It seems to us that 
the best way of ensuring a complement to the present laws of 
Canada that protect the privacy of Canadians might have been to 
follow the same path as the new Quebec Civil Code. However, 
since the bill represents at least a small step forward, the Bloc will 
support it.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
applaud the efforts of the hon. member to address a practice that is 
of concern to many consumers. He and I are two of them.
<P>
	It is certainly true that when we speak about the problems of 
protecting personal information, probably at the top of the list are 
complaints and calls by telemarketing firms that usually call at the 
dinner hour and follow those calls up with unwanted flyers and 
advertisements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15906"> 15906 </A></B>
<P>
	While I agree with the spirit of the bill, I have discovered that it 
has its gaps. It is also cumbersome and overly restrictive, 
particularly in light of the more broadly based and flexible options 
that are currently on the table. I will get back to that in just a 
moment.
<P>
	As part of a global economy, we can expect that cross-border 
consumer transactions will of course only increase, and with them 
a related growth in direct-to-home sales of the type that make 
regular use of mail lists in order to gain access into Canadian 
homes.
<P>
	Mailing lists, when combined with other transaction related 
databases such as credit ratings and financial accounts, can be 
assembled into profiles of individuals. These records can cross 
national borders, be exchanged, resold, re-used, or integrated with 
other databases often without consent or remuneration for purposes 
unrelated to those for which the data was originally collected.
<P>
	In some ways this type of information sharing can be beneficial 
to Canadians in the sense of targeting marketing of services and 
products to consumers with particular interests in particular items. 
However, consumers are frustrated and angry when subjected to 
perceived intrusions by commercial interests into their personal 
domain.
<P>
	Personal information privacy is an issue of considerable 
importance to Canadians. I have a copy of a survey released earlier 
this month, October 5 to be exact, conducted on behalf of two 
Canadian consumer groups, indicating that 90 per cent of 
consumers are concerned about personal information being shared 
between private firms. However, that same survey also suggests 
that consumers do not want any additional burdens imposed on 
them in order to protect their privacy.
<P>
	While I think my friend across the way has presented some good 
ideas, and my colleague for Broadview-Greenwood has suggested 
that a little bit of tweaking in the bill might find some favourable 
response, the approach adopted in this particular bill is truly highly 
restrictive and even burdensome.
<P>
	The bill would require that an organization notify each 
individual on a mailing list each time the list is sold to another 
organization and then ensure that an individual's consent has been 
received. In addition, it requires that the organization buying the 
list also notify the same individual that their name has been 
obtained. Organizations would have up to 10 days to comply with 
the requests from individuals to have their names or certain 
elements of information removed from the lists. Fines for repeat 
offenders-I think I heard it correctly-can reach $10,000 or more.
<P>
	Not only is this burdensome for the consumers, preventing them 
from consenting to occasional mailing list exchanges between 
firms in prearranged circumstances, it is also burdensome to 
individual firms. More often than not, increased burden to firms 
translates of course into increased costs for products and services 
ultimately paid for by, guess who, the consumer.
<P>
	Bill C-315 also has a number of gaps in the following areas. 
First, it applies only to the sale of lists containing personal 
information, when in reality the normal business practice is the 
rental of such lists.
<P>
	Second, the bill focuses narrowly on the lists, when in fact a vast 
amount of personal data can be blended and put together from the 
type of consumer transactional data currently exchanged between 
firms or within a large organization.
<P>
	Third, the definition of personal information provided in this bill 
is narrow and more restricted than the definition of personal 
information found in the federal Privacy Act.
<P>
	Fourth, the bill only applies to corporations, when in fact 
mailing list information is often transferred between individual 
proprietorships and partnerships that are not organized into 
corporate forms.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Fifth, Bill C-315 applies only to that narrow range of 
corporations engaging in a federally regulated activity. As used in 
the bill, federally regulated corporations would include those firms 
operating in the interprovincial and international transportation 
sectors, broadcasting, telecommunications, and banking. Needless 
to say, there are many corporations and sectors exchanging 
personal data that fall outside of those categories.
<P>
	The effect of the bill then is to protect consumers in a narrow 
range of circumstances from a narrow range of commercial entities 
in a restrictive and even burdensome fashion without any 
co-ordination or harmonization with other current or proposed 
privacy initiatives. If passed, the result would be a patchwork quilt 
of uneven privacy obligations.
<P>
	The hon. member might not be aware of other positive initiatives 
that are currently under way. I think some of them have already 
been referred to by my colleague, the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. I do not know if the hon. member is 
familiar with the Canadian Standards Association model privacy 
code. It was ratified last month by a committee consisting of a 
broad cross-section of consumer, private sector, and government 
representatives, including Industry Canada's office of consumer 
affairs and spectrum information technologies and 
telecommunications units.
<P>
	Three years in the making, the model code sets out 10 principles 
governing how personal information should be collected, retained, 
kept up to date, used, disclosed by the private sector. Adoption of 
the code by firms using mailing lists would tend to ensure that 
consumers are informed of the existence of such lists and given the 
opportunity to consent to their use and verify their accuracy.
<P>
	The CSA code provides a clear example of the commitment and 
ability of consumer groups, the private  sector, and governments to 
work together to develop privacy protection solutions. The 
Minister of Industry is currently considering the recommendations 
of the Information Highway Advisory Council, which reported to 
him September 27. Among other issues, the Information Highway 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15907"> 15907 </A></B>
<P>
Advisory Council addressed the privacy implications of interactive 
converging telecommunications and information technologies.
<P>
	The Information Highway Advisory Council stated, and I quote: 
``In order for consumers and users to benefit from electronic 
information networks, there is a need for a coherent national 
standard as to what constitutes effective privacy protection in an 
electronic environment among business, consumer organizations, 
and governments. The council believes that such a standard can be 
best achieved through legislation.''
<P>
	As well, the council stated that the federal government must take 
leadership through the creation of a level playing field for the 
protection of personal information on the information highway by 
developing and implementing a flexible legislative framework for 
both the public and private sectors. The legislation would require 
sectors or organizations to meet the standards of the CSA model 
code while allowing the flexibility to determine how they will 
refine their own codes.
<P>
	The minister has also received a recommendation from the 
Canadian Direct Marketing Association urging the creation of 
flexible national privacy framework legislation using the CSA 
model privacy code as a basis. I am reiterating the CSA's model 
privacy code as the basis for these different approaches, but that 
seems to be the foundation for those approaches. The essence of 
both these recommendations is recognition of the need for coherent 
national privacy standards, protecting the consumer while 
providing the private sector with flexibility and that level playing 
field we have been speaking of. The CSA model privacy code 
represents a potential basis for development of flexible national 
standards.
<P>
	Let me just say that I am in agreement with the spirit of Bill 
C-315 as put forward by our colleague opposite and I can applaud 
the efforts of the hon. member in this regard. However, because of 
the gaps and some inconsistency for the national perspective and 
some of the burdensome regulations that are addressed in the bill, I 
cannot support its contents.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity of addressing Bill C-315.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While there are seven 
minutes remaining in Private Members' Business, it would be my 
intention to allow the next speaker, the member for Elk Island to 
conclude his remarks in their entirety, the full 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
honour to stand in defence of the private members' bill offered by 
my colleague.
<P>
	All of us have characteristics and facts about us which are of 
interest to many people. I cannot begin talking about all the 
information private firms would like to have about us without also 
thinking of that vast array of information the government has about 
us. We know of some of the abuses of that information, its lack of 
accuracy and its inaccessibility to the individual in order to check 
its accuracy.
<P>
	There was a very interesting case about which I will not divulge 
all the details. As a member of Parliament, I was approached by an 
individual who was caught in a cross web of government databases. 
Before he knew what was going on, he was having some very 
serious problems with the government. The government thought 
there was money owing on a student loan account but there was 
not. It took a lot of work to get that straightened out. The 
information was wrong. He had a lot of trouble finding out what 
information the government had on him. Information was missing. 
The government said that because it did not have that information, 
what he was alleging was not true. It went on and on.
<P>
	The same thing is true with data which is gathered by private 
firms in order to know more about us. To a degree, I agree with this. 
There is a value for organizations like financial institutions to 
maintain databases. It protects us. That is if the databases are 
properly managed and there is accountability built into the system.
<P>
	For example, I do not think credit ratings are all wrong. I like the 
ability of applying for a loan and receiving speedy service. That is 
only possible because businesses can very quickly check whether I 
paid my last loan. If they could not do that quickly and reliably then 
of course it would take them longer to check it out.
<P>
	Also, as a consumer I could end up paying for more people who 
take loans and then disappear without paying for them. With the 
modern database systems it is possible to find out a person's 
history and consequently deny that person a loan because of his 
unreliability in repaying. As a person who pays interest to financial 
institutions I could then be spared the cost of picking up the tab for 
both the principal and the interest which was lost.
<P>
	There is some merit to this but certainly as in many other areas, 
whether it is government or corporations, there needs to be 
accountability. We ought to look very seriously at the proposed bill 
in terms of the accountability and accessibility it would provide to 
a person who wants to find out what is known about him.
<P>
	The government likes to have all kinds of data on us, income tax 
information, where we earned our money, how much, how much 
we gave to charity and all the  details of our personal financial 
lives. This data needs to be accurate. Like government, 
organizations like to keep census. They like to know everything 
about us, our religion, how many children we have. They want to 
know whether we own or rent our residence. They want to know 
whether other people live with us. On and on it goes. There 
definitely needs to be a limitation on business and government on 
how much data can be gathered.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="15908"> 15908 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	In order to make this efficient there should be a procedure where 
individuals give consent at the time of giving the information or 
where they may refuse it. Although the private member's bill says 
the firm which proposes to sell a list needs to check with the 
individual on the list to gain permission, it would be much better if 
each database were flagged. If I indicate at the time I give 
information that my name is not to be passed on to another buyer of 
the list, it could simply be another field in the database. Then that 
information would not be given and it would not incur the cost the 
hon. member opposite was complaining about.
<P>
	Certainly to mail consent forms to thousands of people on a list 
would be very costly. This could be done in advance and would 
protect individuals from having their data circulated all over.
<P>
	I was able to find a few examples of people who use databases 
incorrectly. Many of us are now involved with the Internet. I 
remember when I first signed on with the firm I am using, at the top 
I was asked: ``Do you give permission for your name and your 
Internet address to be in the database that is searched by other 
members?'' I gave permission because I want people to be able to 
find me. If they look for my name in the city where I live, my name 
and my Internet address will come up.
<P>
	There have been some serious examples of breaches of this 
principle. An example to which I take great offence is from New 
Zealand. A chocolate factory there obtained a client's list from a 
weight reduction clinic and used that client list to produce some 
personalized advertising for their chocolates. That is an unfair 
intrusion into a part of the population that might have a weakness 
in that regard. That type of thing also needs to be prohibited. Of 
course there have been many cases of people who have used 
databases for illegal purposes.
<P>
	It is most important that consent be given either in advance or at 
some future time before the data is passed on to another firm or 
another business.
<P>
	I had a very interesting example of my name coming up. I 
received a brochure that was mailed to me personally. It had my 
name and my correct address. When I opened it I was amazed to 
find out it was totally in French. Unfortunately I do not speak 
French, I wish I did. I could not understand it but I could figure out 
that it had to do with a contest. There was a picture of a new car. I 
thought: ``This has to be my lucky day. They have  written me a 
personal letter to tell me that I have won this car''.
<P>
	I wrote a letter back and apologized for not knowing the 
language. I also told them that clearly from what information I 
could gather I had won this new vehicle and I would be very willing 
at their convenience to show up at the specified place to collect it. I 
thanked them greatly for that.
<P>
	That is a very dramatic way to emphasize it but I knew that I had 
to do something that was really spectacular in order to get their 
attention because of other situations where I have received 
information and could not get off the mailing list. I tried and I 
could not. I wrote a letter and the mail kept coming. It seems these 
data lists go from one owner to another and even though the last 
purchaser may purge the list of my name, the next week the parent 
corporation sends an update of the list and my name appears again. 
It is virtually impossible to find out from where the name 
originates because these lists are passed from one firm to another to 
another.
<P>
	I commend my colleague for this bill. It certainly points out a 
need. I am not sure that in all details it totally answers the question.
<P>
	I would like to see that little amendment to give a disclaimer or a 
refusal to pass on the information at the time of giving information. 
In general the principle of the bill is sound and I am glad to support 
it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.35 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
