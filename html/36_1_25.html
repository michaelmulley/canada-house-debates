</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 will enable peace officers to enter dwellings for the 
purposes of arrest in a manner which conforms to constitutional 
requirements. The bill essentially creates a warrant scheme by 
which peace officers may obtain judicial authorization before 
entering a dwelling to arrest someone. The bill also sets out 
certain circumstances under which such warrants or authorizations 
are not required.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, on May 22, 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada 
rendered a decision which has a significant impact on the way police 
forces may exercise their power of arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of determining whether, under common law, an arrest 
can take place in a dwelling house with no prior judicial intervention. 
In the Queen v. Feeney decision, the five majority judges ruled that, 
because of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, police forces 
must first secure a warrant for entry to carry out an arrest in a 
dwelling house. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the Criminal Code does not specifically provide a 
mechanism for obtaining judicial authorization prior to entering 
a dwelling for the purpose of arrest, a majority of the Supreme 
Court of Canada in R. v. Feeney suggested that such a provision 
be read in pending the appropriate legislative changes. It is to 
that invitation that Parliament is asked to respond today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you that the judicial uncertainty caused by the 
decision in the Feeney case was of great concern to law enforcement 
authorities across Canada. In fact, provinces and territories responded 
to this decision by proposing temporary and singularly different 
solutions to enable police forces to perform their duties as best they 
could while taking into account the new requirements of the Canadian 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As requested by the attorneys general of British Columbia, Alberta, 
Canada, Ontario and Quebec in the days following the decision in the 
Feeney case, the Supreme Court of Canada granted a stay of proceedings 
for six months from the date of the decision on application of the 
Feeney decision. 
Consequently, unless the stay is extended, any amendment to the Criminal 
Code should be made by November 1997 at the latest to prevent a 
legislative vacuum after that date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is prepared to co-operate with the hon. 
members of this House, on both sides of the floor I might add, to meet 
the deadline set by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice believes that Bill C-16 contains a system 
to obtain entry warrants which, on the one hand, is designed to serve 
the interests of those responsible for law enforcement by giving police 
forces the power to enter dwelling houses with or without an arrest 
warrant and, on the other hand, respects the privacy of individuals in 
their dwelling houses, as guaranteed under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the public and law enforcement officials could argue 
that the bill does not go far enough by not giving police officers the 
same powers of entry and arrest they had before, I repeat before, the 
Feeney decision. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, given that Feeney was decided on constitutional 
grounds, it would not be possible to restore the common law power 
to enter a dwelling to arrest. To put it plainly, the court has 
ruled that the privacy interests must be balanced against the 
interests of the state to arrest in a dwelling house and that 
balancing of interests must be done by a judge. If the legal 
framework is flexible enough, there should be a way to balance 
those competing interests without jeopardizing the safety of 
Canadians. Bill C-16 does just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other end of the spectrum, some people would argue that 
the supreme court has suggested that in all cases the police 
would have to obtain an arrest warrant which would be accompanied 
by an authorization to enter the dwelling. From this perspective 
the police would have to formally charge someone before obtaining 
an authorization to enter.  We do not think that this is needed 
in order to satisfy the constitutional requirements imposed by 
the supreme court.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is constitutionally mandated is that an impartial 
arbitrator decide whether the entry on private premises should be 
permitted in order to effect an arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the view of the Minister of Justice, requiring that someone 
be charged before a warrant for entry can be issued would result 
in a rigid and ineffective warrant scheme which would frustrate 
the proper administration of justice in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice believes the legislation strikes a proper 
balance. Under the bill, the police could obtain the judicial 
authorization to enter a dwelling to arrest a person, without having to 
formally charge this person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the bill will afford the police as much flexibility 
as possible, given the limits imposed by the charter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the bill is the product of extensive consultations with 
interested parties such as the provincial attorneys general, the 
RCMP, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the Canadian 
Association of Police and the Canadian Bar Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation contains a realistic compromise between 
positions that either lack necessary flexibility or are 
constitutionally flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to review the different 
features of this legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill primarily seeks to provide a legislative system under 
which the police can request the judicial authorization to enter 
dwellings to make an arrest. The system provides that such an 
authorization is required in the three situations listed below. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when an arrest warrant has already been issued, a police 
officer can request a warrant to enter a dwelling to make an arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when no arrest warrant has been issued, a police officer 
can request a warrant to enter a dwelling to make an arrest, provided he 
has convinced a judge or a justice of the peace that there are grounds 
to make an arrest without a warrant, as provided under section 495 of 
the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if a police officer is requesting a warrant for the arrest 
of a specific person, he can, at the same time, ask the judge or the 
justice of the peace to authorize, in the warrant, the police to enter 
a dwelling, particularly if the officer believes the person for whom the 
warrant is issued is in that dwelling or will be found in it. The 
authorization will be granted if, when the arrest warrant is later 
executed, the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the 
person for whom the warrant is issued is in that dwelling. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also addresses exigent circumstances as an exception to 
the need for an authorization to enter.  It is not always 
possible for the police to obtain a judicial authorization prior 
to entering a dwelling for the purposes of arrest or 
apprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Feeney, the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada 
acknowledged this fact and reaffirmed the common law power of 
entry in situations of hot pursuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the court clearly recognized that hot pursuit is an 
exception to the requirement that there be a warrant for entry, 
this legislation does not address this issue which has been dealt 
with conclusively by the Supreme Court of Canada.  The question 
of what other situations would justify an exemption from the 
requirement of prior judicial authorization was left open by the 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, therefore, contains an non-exhaustive 
definition of certain exigent circumstances under which entry 
into a dwelling for the purposes of arrest or apprehension would 
be allowed in the absence of prior judicial authorization. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice believes it is important that parliament 
expresses itself on what exigent circumstances would justify the 
state entering a dwelling house without a warrant for entry to 
effect an arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entry would be expressly allowed in the absence of a warrant 
where the police have reasonable grounds to suspect that entry 
into the dwelling is necessary to prevent imminent bodily harm or 
death.  The integrity of a human being is a value sufficiently 
important that the state can intervene without getting prior 
judicial authorization to enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entry would likewise be expressly allowed where the police have 
reasonable grounds to believe that evidence relating to the 
commission of an indictable offence is present in the dwelling 
and where that entry is necessary to prevent the imminent 
destruction of such evidence.   We stress it is evidence that 
will be destroyed, not merely information or intelligence to 
which the state would like to have access, if the arrest is not 
effected before a warrant of entry can be obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also contains provisions concerning 
consequential amendments.  In particular it contains a proposal 
to amend the Interpretation Act to extend the scheme set out in 
the Criminal Code to arrests or apprehensions made pursuant to 
other federal statutes.  This is needed because the Feeney 
decision is concerned with the balancing of interests in cases of 
arrests in dwelling houses which extends well beyond the 
application of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other federal legislation provides for arrests on the basis of 
warrants issued pursuant to the particular legislation.  There is 
a need to remedy the problem caused by the Feeney decision of the 
supreme court.  The proposed amendment to the Interpretation Act 
extends the Criminal Code regime to these statutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the legislation includes a preamble which states its 
purpose, and which clearly establishes that the bill is not meant to 
limit the power to enter granted to police under other acts or under 
common law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the constitutional limitations set out in Feeney and in 
other Supreme Court of Canada decisions concerning privacy 
rights, the Minister of Justice believes the legislation 
represents a way of ensuring that the appropriate balancing of 
interests can take place without jeopardizing the safety of 
Canadians and the proper administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates tools that will enhance the privacy rights of 
Canadians while providing law enforcement officers with the kind 
of flexibility needed to do their difficult task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the Minister of Justice encourages all hon. members 
of the House to support the bill.  I look forward to working with 
hon. members to make sure we meet the deadline the supreme court 
has set. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my 
opinion the justice minister should have intervened with the 
Supreme Court of Canada to request a suspension of the decision 
or the application of the decision.  The justice minister should 
have asked for a reasonable suspension in terms of time so we 
would not have to ram the bill through and we would be able to 
call witnesses from both sides of the equation and fully flesh 
out all aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a trademark of the justice department to bring in 
bills against a deadline that has denied members of the House an 
opportunity to fully express their views and concerns on such 
bills, to have witnesses appear before the standing committee, to 
determine the constitutionality of all aspects of the bill, and 
to satisfy members on both sides that the bill would do what the 
government and the people of the country want.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of debate on Bill C-16 I point out that it is 
unfortunate our new justice minister seems to be following in the 
footsteps of the former justice minister when it comes to bills 
such as Bill C-45 that was brought in against a deadline.  We on 
this side certainly remember that had Bill C-45 been brought in 
on time it may have stopped the likes of Olson from getting his 
full court press before a judge and jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was brought in against a deadline, exactly as this bill is 
being brought in against a deadline.  We have to hurry it through 
to meet the deadline of the November 22.  Otherwise, as the 
officials who briefed the news media and ourselves yesterday 
pointed out, it could cause very serious concerns and an 
extension.  That cost would have to be requested from the Supreme 
Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the approach and the modus operandi the government is 
using which are unsuitable to the parliamentary system.  We ought 
to have an unrushed opportunity to examine the bill carefully.  I 
am hoping we will have time to do so and that the bill will reach 
the other place in time for the deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that it should have been the justice minister and not 
the attorney general from British Columbia that intervened with 
the Supreme Court of Canada requesting the suspension.  Why not 
make it 8 months or 10 months?  Why not make it sufficiently long 
enough so that we would have the time to express our concerns and 
examine the bill carefully? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill but we decry the supreme court decision 
which made the bill necessary.  The Feeney decision undermines 
the traditional powers of the police.  The bill is designed to 
deal with a decision that undermines the traditional tools and 
powers of the police to investigate crime, bring perpetrators of 
crime into the courts and to justice, and thereby create and 
maintain the safety of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now let us look at the Feeney decision.  It is an horrendous 
decision when it comes to the impact it has had upon law 
enforcement.  What happened?  An 84 year old man was beaten to 
death.  At the scene of the crime the police officer found blood 
spattered all over the place and had reason to believe that blood 
would be on the assailant.  What did he do?  In his investigation 
he approached the residence of Mr. Feeney, knocked on the door 
and there was no answer.  He opened the door, did not kick it in, 
and found Mr. Finny lying on the bed, his shirt covered in blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Sopinka, speaking and writing on behalf of the majority, 
said that it was an unlawful entry, an unlawful arrest and 
therefore all evidence gathered as a result was not admissible in 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did that mean?  That decision of the five Canadians sitting 
in the Supreme Court of Canada, according to the legal opinions 
we have heard, will allow the man to walk free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this say to the people of Canada with regard to their 
faith in our courts and our justice system?  What does it say to 
the people who live in that community?  What are they saying and 
how do they feel about the decision rendered by five people 
sitting in judgment who are there to protect the rights and 
safety of society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always look for a reasonable balance.  I noticed that in the 
supreme court decision article 1 of the Constitution, the 
override clause, was not used.  It was not even mentioned.  I 
wonder why.  In the decision the majority said that in general 
Mr. Feeney's privacy interest in the dwelling house outweighs the 
interest of the police.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does “outweighs the interest of the police” mean?  What 
interests do the police have if not our interest and the interest 
of society?  It is the interest of the police but it means the 
interest of the safety of society.  What are the jobs, sworn 
duties and responsibilities of the police?  They are to protect 
society.  How?  It is by gathering evidence sufficient to warrant 
an arrest for a full and fair hearing before a court of competent 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the majority in this case says that in general Mr. Feeney's 
privacy interest in his dwelling house outweighs the interests of 
the police, it is really saying it outweighs the interests of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the interest of society in a case like this?  According 
to the Supreme Court of Canada what do the police do if they 
knock on the door and there is no answer?  They spend hours 
surrounding the place like they did in the Kitimat case after 
this decision, and five hours later when the warrant to enter 
finally arrives they find that the suspect has gone.  This is 
what the bill attempts to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That decision means the police may now have to obtain a warrant 
to enter, a warrant to arrest in certain circumstances and a 
warrant to search.  If the police have a warrant to enter but not 
to search, they can gather whatever evidence is obvious before 
them, but they cannot search the attic, the basement or the rooms 
beyond their vision.  They can only gather the evidence that is 
obvious before them.  They will have to go through this 
rigmarole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill is the authority for telewarrants.  What is a 
telewarrant?  A police officer phones a justice of the peace or a 
judge in the middle of the night and says “I am Constable Joe 
Blow and I need a warrant.  Here are the facts”.  Given the 
attitude of supreme court expressed in this decision, will a 
telewarrant system stand a charter challenge?  Not a hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking in the best interest of the safety of society. 
Should we not consider that article 1 of the charter, which 
states that the rights of the individual can be overridden if the 
interest of society is an overriding concern, should be applied 
and can be applied?  Are we to ignore that?  I saw no mention in 
the decision of the supreme court of the override clause. Perhaps 
for some reason or other the supreme court considered it was not 
applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the dissenting opinion that was written by 
Madam L'Heureux-Dubé.  What did she say?  What did the supreme 
court judges say?  They said the entry was legal.  They said the 
arrest was legal.  They said the gathering of all the evidence 
was legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had one more justice agreed we would not be here today and we 
would not need this bill.  The common law tools and powers of 
peace officers prior to the Feeney decision would still be in 
force.  The police would have the tools to move as quickly and as 
expeditiously as possible to protect society against someone who 
brutally murdered an 84 year old man.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we will support this bill.  We want to hear witnesses.  We 
want to understand the fullness of the bill.  The main thrust of 
the bill everyone will support.  We have to do something to deal 
with the Feeney decision which was brought down by the Supreme 
Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we examine bills there are always details that we 
want to ensure are included.  We want to understand the bill so 
that all members from all parties can make recommendations and 
bring forward amendments which they think will strengthen it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must restore these tools for the police so that they can 
maintain safety within our society and deal with those who are a 
threat to society, particularly individuals like Mr. Feeney. This 
man was convicted of murdering an 84-year old man and he is on 
the loose. According to legal opinions he will continue to be on 
the loose because they are saying that the evidence gathered 
after the arrest is not admissible in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé say about it?  It is very 
interesting what she said about the decision to deny the 
admissibility of that evidence, even though it is DNA evidence. 
She said that the police should be commended, not rebuked, for 
their actions. She said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—perhaps it is time to recall that public respect and 
confidence in the justice system lies not only in protection 
against police abuse, but also in the system's capacity to 
uncover the truth and ensure that, at the end of the day, it is 
more likely than not that justice will have been done. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us ask that question.  Let us apply that test to the Feeney 
case.  What have we got? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have evidence cast out which conclusively in the lower courts 
convicted Feeney for the murder of an 84-year old senior citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand with Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé.  She is expressing 
the common sense of the vast majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that police officer entered the trailer, what did he do 
that hurt anyone?  What did he do that was not an act in the 
defence of the safety of society?  What did he do that was 
outrageous in the discharge of his duties and responsibilities to 
protect the community in which he lived and served?  What did he 
do?  I do not see anything that he did which was horrendous or 
wrong or a deviation from normal police practices, established on 
the basis of common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was designed over the summer.  It has been introduced 
too late.  It may not meet the deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill there is not a definition of hot pursuit.  They are 
saying that the police could have entered that place if they were 
in hot pursuit.  What does that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the briefing yesterday, Stephen Bindman from the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> asked more than once why is there not in this bill 
a definition of hot pursuit so that police officers would know 
where they stand.  Why is it not in the Criminal Code?  That is a 
fair question.  It is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference between hot pursuit and fresh pursuit? We 
do not know.  The police do not know.  Is there a precedent? Is 
there a legal precedent that will guide them?  We do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inasmuch as we do not place it in the law, and we do not create 
legislation to explain what hot pursuit and fresh pursuit mean, 
we are leaving it up to the courts to decide.  The Supreme Court 
of Canada will have to decide what hot pursuit is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is case law that deals with hot pursuit, but why not put 
it in the Criminal Code?  Why not legislate it so that we are 
telling the courts what we the people believe hot pursuit and 
fresh pursuit mean? What we the people want is police officers to 
have the tools to protect us from people like Mr. Feeney and 
others who will attack people, commit assaults, murders, rapes 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision of the Supreme Court of Canada has reduced the 
safety of society by placing a greater burden on our police 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill attempts to get around that or at least provides a 
legal avenue to continue to allow police officers to enter 
dwellings but not without another burden on them. They are 
going to have to wait in order to get a search warrant unless 
there is hot pursuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They may have to get a warrant to arrest as well as to enter the 
premises.  As I indicated earlier, if they want to search the 
entire building they may have to get a third warrant to do that 
very thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may all sound well, fine and nice in an ivory tower but 
what about these remote conditions as in northern B. C. where 
this incident took place?  What about some of these other areas 
where tele-warrants are impossible?  What about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to support this bill but we want it fleshed out. We 
want hear people from both sides, those who oppose the opinion 
and the decision of the supreme court that brought about the 
bill. We want to hear those who support it. We want to understand 
as much as possible whether this bill truly strikes a balance 
that the decision on the Feeney case by the Supreme Court of 
Canada has demanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of my concerns. Those are some of my thoughts.  I 
guess that my greatest concern is that we in this House should 
not pass legislation that leaves interpretation open to the 
courts. We should be telling the courts what we want done by the 
legislation that we pass and it should not be open ended.  If it 
is open ended we are going to be back over and over again to deal 
with this kind of situation where the Supreme Court of Canada 
decides. Instead of the elected representatives of the people 
acting in the best interest of the people we are going to have 
the courts deciding really what is the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hearing it over and over again and we heard it yesterday 
during the briefing that it is not the elected representatives of 
the people who are making the law.  It is nine unelected people 
in the Supreme Court of Canada who are doing that for us.  The 
warning was clear yesterday that we must stand on guard over this 
particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that during July of this year an Angus Reid poll 
indicated that over 50% of Canadians have little faith in our 
courts, not in just our justice system.  I could understand if 
they said it about the overall justice system.  We know how they 
feel about the YOA, the faint hope clause and all these 
ridiculous situations that have been created by our law and our 
justice system.  I could understand if the majority had lost 
faith in just the justice system but that is not the case in this 
poll.  They have lost faith in our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  They have lost faith in the decisions 
being made by our judges.  This is the question that went through 
my mind as soon as I read the Feeney case. Does the decision by 
the Supreme Court of Canada enhance or reduce the faith the 
people of Canada have in our courts and in our justice system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what the answer would be if we go back to the scene of 
the crime and ask the neighbours of the victim of Mr. Feeney what 
they think this decision has done in terms of enhancing or 
reducing their faith in our court system and in the decisions our 
judges are making.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very troubling matter and it lies at the heart of this 
whole bill and the decisions made by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read the decisions and the case law from the Supreme Court 
of Canada with regard to the absolute need to ensure that all 
that can be done is done to maintain the faith and the trust of 
Canadians in our courts and our judicial system, we will see why 
there is need for alarm and concern. These kinds of decisions 
make it more difficult for the police to protect us, our families 
and our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no alternative but to support this bill and to fight to 
restore the powers and the tools which the police lost to a 
certain extent.  To a large extent the old common law tools that 
they had are gone.  Why?  The Supreme Court of Canada says in 
general the individual's privacy, Mr. Feeney's privacy interest 
in his dwelling house outweighs the interest of the police, the 
interest of society, the safety of society. That is why we are 
here debating this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will receive support from members from all 
parties for this bill.  I suggest that all members better stand 
on guard to protect the balance that we need between the right of 
the individual and the right of members of society to adequate 
police protection, protection from the courts and protection from 
the administration of our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the alarm bell which is ringing.  We had better be very 
careful in the way in which we design our laws so that we are 
telling the courts what we want done on behalf of the Canadian 
people and not have the courts do that for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We leave opened ended things like hot pursuit. This is what 
Stephen Bindman was talking about.  Why leave it in doubt?  Why 
do we not tell the courts what we think on behalf of the Canadian 
people what hot pursuit means?  Where do fresh and hot pursuit 
begin and end?  Is it fresh pursuit?  Is it hotter than hot 
pursuit or is it the other way around?  We do not know.  Do the 
police know?  They should be able to open the Criminal Code and 
see their authority.  But they do not have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some areas in the bill on which we will be asking not 
only the justice officials to give us their opinion but also some 
of the witnesses who are players on both sides of the issue in 
courts of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by reiterating that I am of the sincere 
opinion that it is unfortunate that this bill had to be brought 
forward in the first place.  I stand with Madam L'Heureux-Dubé in 
supporting our police officers in their need for reasonable tools 
to do their job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to start by saying that I am happy to hear my colleague from the Reform 
Party say that when there are vital issues a society must address, the 
decisions must be made by the democratically elected representatives of 
the people, and not by nine unelected individuals. I felt I have to 
point out this little fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing something that is very important, and that is the 
balance between, on the one hand, the authority of the state, in this 
case the powers that a society gives its police officers, and, on the 
other hand, the rights and freedoms of individuals.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that the government took 
so much time to introduce this bill, because the Supreme Court has set 
a deadline, which is November 22. When we are discussing such an 
important issue as the balance between individual rights and freedoms 
and the powers of the state, it seems to me that we should be doing so 
in a calm, collected, and comprehensive manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important here, and what the bill is trying to do—I will 
come back to this later—is to clarify the rules for police officers. 
Yesterday, a highly skilled crown attorney told me that this Supreme 
Court judgment, the Feeney case, had the effect of tying the hands of 
police officers because they no longer knew the rules governing their 
powers. The bill attempts to clarify these rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to highlight the issues involved in this bill. The bill 
proposed by the Minister of Justice deals with an important value in our 
present society: respect for privacy. In fact, as the Supreme Court 
pointed out, arrests made in private dwellings must be carried out with 
respect for individual rights, and especially the right to be secure 
against unreasonable search or seizure, which is protected under section 
8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of the right to privacy and to protection of one's 
property is neither new nor unique. In fact, a British ruling in common 
law, which forms the basis of our criminal law dating back to 1604, 
almost 400 years ago, describes the importance of the right to privacy 
in the following manner: “A man's home is his castle”. The protection of 
privacy in our society dates back more than 400 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this same judgment, called the Semayne case, a limit is imposed 
however on the concept of inviolable castles. In other words, it is not 
because an individual is in a house that the power of the state stops at 
the door. It goes on to say: “In all cases where the King is involved, 
the Sheriff can, if the doors are not open, use force to gain entry into 
the house in order to arrest the person or to execute the King's 
judicial instrument.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, even in those days, society recognized that an 
individual's rights and freedoms with respect to privacy could be 
curtailed when the public interest and safety demanded it.  It 
therefore comes down to a question of balance, as I said in my 
introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if the state can give itself the authority to act in the 
sphere of individuals' private affairs, the intrusion must respect 
the rules laid down by law, whether that law be the common law, 
statutes or the charter.  These standards were analyzed by the 
supreme court in the well known Feeney decision, which I will now 
look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were the facts in this case?  First of all, Mr. Feeney 
was suspected of murdering one Frank Boyle.  After collecting 
evidence, the police went to Feeney's dwelling, knocked on the door 
and said “Police, open up”.  There was no response.  The police 
therefore entered Feeney's dwelling, went over to him and touched 
him to wake him up. 
Feeney was thus arrested without a warrant and evidence was seized. 
He was tried and found guilty of second degree murder.  He appealed 
on the grounds of violation of section 8 of the charter, the 
section against unreasonable search or seizure, and section 10 
which provides for the right to counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were the applicable laws?  First of all, there was the 
common law, on which our criminal law is based.  This is an issue 
with which our courts were already familiar.  There was the Eccles 
case in 1975, which dealt with the right to make an arrest in a 
dwelling following forcible entry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court at the time ruled as follows “Entry can be 
made against the will of the householder only if (<I>a</I>) there are 
reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person 
sought is within the premises and (<I>b</I>) proper announcement is made 
prior to entry”.  This is the basic test in Canada, the first truly 
important ruling by the supreme court on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, eleven years later, in 1986, came the Landry case.  The 
supreme court stipulated that the police may enter a dwelling 
without permission to make an arrest without a warrant if the 
conditions of Eccles and section 495 of the Criminal Code are met. 
That section reads as follows “A peace officer may arrest without 
warrant (a) a person who has committed an indictable offence or 
who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about 
to commit an indictable offence—” 
That is what is called the objective criterion because what is 
stated is that there are reasonable grounds to believe. That is 
subjective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, the supreme court came up with a more objective 
criterion and added a final condition.  In order for an arrest 
without warrant to be legal, there must be reasonable and probable 
grounds to make that arrest. 
No longer is it just “reasonable grounds to believe”, what the 
police officer himself or herself thinks, but a reasonable person 
looking calmly at the situation would also have to agree to. There 
are, therefore, two criteria:  subjective and objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we include the criteria in jurisprudence, we could 
summarize the rules of common law as follows.  An arrest without 
warrant made after forced entry of private property is legal under 
common law if: (a) the police officer making the arrest has grounds 
to believe that the person sought is indeed present there; (b) a 
standard statement is made; (c) the police officer believes he or 
she has reasonable grounds for making the arrest; and (d) there are 
reasonable and probable grounds to make the arrest—the objective 
criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not just common law, however. Now we have the charter 
of rights and freedoms. 
The right to privacy has become very important in Canada since the 
arrival of the charter.  As I said earlier, section 8 is now 
enshrined in the Constitution through the charter.  Legislation 
cannot therefore infringe this section in the same way as the 
protection offered by common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Hunter, 1984, the supreme court decided that searches and 
seizures were permitted only with authorization, that is, a 
warrant, from an independent legal body, which had considered the 
reasonable grounds of the projected search or seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the criteria in Hunter and the other cases 
relating to section 8 of the charter, we conclude the following. 
Under section 8 of the charter, searches conducted without warrant 
in areas where the occupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy 
are unreasonable.  The party conducting the search must prove that 
it is reasonable.  A reasonable search must meet the following 
conditions: (a) it must be permitted under the law; (b) the law 
must not unreasonable of itself and (c) it must be conducted in a 
reasonable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrest in this particular case was illegal, because the 
conditions for making an arrest without warrant under section 495 
of the Criminal Code were not met and because the police can make 
arrests without warrant in a private home only in exceptional 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the court say in Feeney at the time?  “The police did 
not subjectively believe that there were reasonable and probable 
grounds for arresting the appellant before making forcible entry, 
without a warrant, into the house where he was sleeping.  Besides 
the effect of the charter on the conditions required for arrest 
without a warrant in a residence, the absence of subjective belief 
in the existence of reasonable grounds indicated that the police 
could not have arrested the appellant legally under section 495 of 
the Criminal Code even if he had been in a public place”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What effect did this have? It came as a bombshell as I said 
earlier. Police officers said “Wait a minute, what are we supposed to do 
now?” The government decided to introduce this bill to clarify the rules 
and help police officers do their work, which, let us not forget, is 
essential in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 essentially introduces three changes. First, to enable 
peace officers to obtain judicial authorization to enter dwelling 
houses, and this follows on the heels, so to speak, of the jurisprudence 
in Hunter and Feeney. 
Second, to enable peace officers to enter dwelling houses without prior 
authorization in exigent circumstances and where provincial or federal 
legislation or common law authorize entry. Third, to amend the 
Interpretation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key clause of the bill states that a warrant to arrest or 
apprehend will authorize entry in a dwelling house by a peace officer if 
the judge or justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that the person named in the warrant for arrest is present in 
the dwelling house. This is the subjective criterion. The peace officer 
can execute the warrant only if he himself has grounds to believe that 
the persone to be apprehended is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 529.1 enables a judge or justice to issue a warrant to 
enter a dwelling house described in the warrant—note that it must be 
the dwelling house described—to carry out an arrest with or without 
an arrest warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are exigent circumstances, as mentioned by other 
members. When time is of the essence, it is not possible to go and to 
get a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 529.3 of the bill allows a peace officer to enter a dwelling 
house without a warrant, if the conditions under section 529 or 529.1 
exist, that is if he has reasonable grounds to do so, and if, by reason 
of exigent circumstances, it is necessary to do so. An attempt is made 
to define “exigent circumstances”: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a) reasonable grounds to suspect—” 
</UL></UL>
<This is important. We are not talking about “reasonable grounds to 
believe”, but “reasonable grounds to suspect”. Time will tell whether 
the definition will pass the constitutionality test. The issue has to be 
raised. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that entry into the dwelling-house is necessary to prevent 
imminent bodily harm or death to any person. Exigent 
circumstances also include circumstances in which there are 
reasonable grounds to believe— 
</UL></UL>
<This is a higher criterion 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that evidence is present and that entry is necessary to prevent the 
imminent destruction of that evidence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the exigent circumstances, as defined in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 529.4 of Bill C-16 deals with the issue of omitting to make 
a prior announcement of the entry. In the Feeney case, the supreme court 
stated that a peace officer was required to announce himself before 
entering a dwelling-house. However, the Supreme Court also pointed out 
in the Eccles case that this obligation could be waived in case of an 
emergency. This is the case of battering a door down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be argued that the exceptions listed in clause 529 reflect 
the case law. It is the case with regard to battering a door down.

that led to Canada's DDT ban; the implementation of the North 
American waterfowl and management plan, a model for habitat 
conservation with projects across the continent that have brought 
millions of hectares under protection; and the national wildlife 
areas and migratory bird sanctuaries that protect over 11 million 
hectares of land.

here we go again.  The reason the Liberals cannot answer the 50 
questions is because of the process they are using to cook up 
this deal.  They are developing a position in secret.  There has 
been no public discussion on it.  They refuse to wait for all the 
provinces to sign on to the deal and they have actually already 
committed to signing the deal in Kyoto when the treaty has not 
even been written yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of process did not work when we went through our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

abandoned its principled position where it says that the party 
believes that environmental considerations must carry equal 
weight with economic, social and technical considerations.  What 
happened to the Reform principles?  Have Reformers abandoned 
these principles?  Is the position of the Reform Party nothing 
more than what was done by the tongue troopers in the Reform

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
a government that is supposed to govern, the answers get weaker 
every day.  Every day this government fudges the answer is 
another day that taxpayers worry about what position this 
government is cooking up behind the doors.  Studies by the 
conference board say that the Kyoto deal could cost the average 
Canadian thousands of dollars per year.  The Canadian Association 
of Petroleum Producers warns that it could cost a lot at the gas 
pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I ask again, and please just give us an answer.  Canadians

Resources Development, who is responsible for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two important figures clearly stand out in this dossier.  In 
1997, there were 35% more people unemployed than in 1989, and yet 
there are 33% fewer employment insurance recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister finally admit that his reform has gone much 
too far, and that it deprives the unemployed of the minimum income 
they require to support their families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our employment insurance reform 
was necessary, and all Canadians agree totally with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation was such that our system was totally unsuited to 
today's labour market.  We therefore had to carry out an extremely 
significant reform, a courageous one, and what I can tell you is 
that we are following this reform very closely in order to ensure 
that it continues to serve Canadians well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister is showing his flagrant and 
unacceptable disdain for the unemployed, for those who cannot make 
their money last until the end of the month, who are unable to make 
ends meet to feed their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, in light of the figures released yesterday morning, can 
the minister be proud of his reform, when only 36% of the 
unemployed draw benefits, the surplus in his employment insurance 
fund is up to $12 billion, and two-thirds of the unemployed are 
going hungry? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

an excessive attachment to a system from the past, a system which 
encouraged dependency on government funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our reform focuses on active return-to-work measures.  If we 
look at the concrete situation instead of just using big words, it 
will be seen that welfare figures in Quebec have not gone up since

the poverty.  I, for one, am proud to represent a Montreal riding 
that is dealing with poverty.  It makes me very aware of the 
situation, because I am there every Friday afternoon.  I see and 
experience this poverty with my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why our government made it a priority in the last

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

with the solution we found for the problem of Yolande, Huguette and 
Maryse, who were not covered by the old system because much of the 
part time work in our economy is done by women.  The fact that the 
current system is based on hours resolves the problem of many women

from the Minister for International Trade as to whether or not 
Canada is seeking at the MAI negotiations to achieve a set of

The minister has been unwilling to give us a straight answer on 
this.  Can he give us a straight answer on this today?  If he is 
not willing to do so, will he at least tell us why he is not 
willing to give us and answer?  Canadians deserve to know what 
the Canadian government position is, or why it is not willing to 
tell us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has been briefed.  His party has been briefed.  All 
the trade critics have been briefed.  We have sent packages to 
members of Parliament.  We have been answering on the floor of 
the House in terms of the highest standards for both environment 
and labour, and the other key issues in the MAI discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also has to recognize and let Canadians know that 
obviously, we as one of the 29 countries have to respect the 
process as well as respect the fact that we are also consulting 
with provincial governments who obviously share jurisdiction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, other countries are on record as seeking binding, 
enforceable labour and environmental standards at the 
negotiations. Why is it that the Canadian government is unwilling 
to join other governments, the government of the U.K. and social 
democratic governments in Europe, in seeking these kinds of 
binding and enforceable standards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about high standards and low standards.  We 
want to know if he is seeking binding and enforceable.  Will he 
use the words binding and enforceable, and whether he is against 
them or for them?  We want to know the answer to that question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to the member there is no Canadian and no political party 
in this House that wants a lower degradation for our environment 
or lower standards of workers rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question on the matter is that this is a negotiation with 29

is exactly what we will do, despite how high he jumps or how

it met with the envoys and we learned nothing as a result of that 
meeting.  Nothing new is on the table.

backbone for the families on the west coast of British Columbia

would be made public”.  On September 7, 1995 Canadian Vandoos 
in Croatia set fire to their own mess in an apparent attempt to

the matter is we have raised human rights issues continually with

human rights where we have an opportunity, unlike most countries, 
to engage them directly on a number of human rights matters. I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is one important component of retirement 
income.  Others are the old age pension and the GIS.  They are 
both tied together and they are both scheduled for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, why has the government not tabled legislation 
on the seniors benefit which will replace the old age pension so 
that in fairness Canadians and Parliament can deal with the whole 
package at the same time?  Or, is the minister simply saying to 
us that when seniors return from his house this Hallowe'en night 
they had better check their apples for razor blades? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought the question was 
directed to my colleague in the finance department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the finance committee the other day we had a long 
discussion on the merits of CPP reform.  We were looking into a 
number of aspects.  I think we are doing very well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that 
was the weakest answer I have heard in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government table legislation on the seniors 
benefit so we can deal with the whole package?  The seniors 
benefit and the CPP are interlinked.  The CPP provides about 25% 
of retirement income and is based on a universal old age pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to continue to try to abolish the universal 
old age pension.  Is it afraid to table legislation because it is 
under pressure from senior citizens? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  It is absolutely to the 
contrary, Mr. Speaker.  We are very pleased with the package we 
have been able to introduce because it will bring a benefit to 
75% of seniors.  Ninety per cent of single senior women will 
benefit under the package.  It is one we are proud of.  It is one 
that is sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel it is a fair package.  We are looking forward to 
bringing forth legislation in a timely manner so that all

known for some time that the Government of Canada would divest 
the fish hatcheries.  We have done that after talking with the 
fishing communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most cases fish hatcheries have been sustained by developing 
a partnership in some cases with provincial government and in

has moved forward in terms of getting its financial books in 
order we have had to make cutbacks in certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservation does remain a priority of the federal government in 
terms of the fishery.  We have been able to do things in a

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development received a letter from 
the union, which wants to put in writing the content of the discussions. 
So as to avoid any misunderstanding, the union put in writing what was 
discussed when they met with the minister. The two sides did talk about 
an improved POWA. The letter was addressed to the minister, who misled 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek the unanimous consent of the House to table the letter 
addressed to Mr. Pettigrew. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due 
respect to the hon. member opposite, I think first of all that accusing 
the minister of misleading the House is unparliamentary—I see that 
the Minister of Human Resources Development is in the House, so he may 
want to take part in the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development,

Rimouski—Mitis may very well have a letter dated October 30 and 
addressed to me, but I can assure you that I never misled the House when 
I said I had not yet read that letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a limit to making such claims. The member claims I misled 
the House, but I want to make it clear that I did not do so in any way.

said.

perhaps help shed some light on the debate, to move things ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member, on a question of privilege or a point of order, is 
asking that a letter sent to the minister be tabled.  I am certain 
the minister has no objection whatsoever to the letter being made 
public, in the interests of transparency for all members of the 
House, which will help us to proceed with the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> No, it is not.  The member is saying 
that that is another matter, but it is the crux of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unanimous consent is being sought.  On behalf of the members 
of my party, I offer that consent.  That is the first question 
asked of the House, the question to which we must reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After what the minister has just told us, I can hardly see him 
objecting to tabling the letter after unanimous consent.  That 
would be a complete contradiction.

will continue the debate from where I left off before the brief 
interruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a brief overview of the key clauses in the bill in 
question, Bill C-16, it is now important to state that we have 
certain reservations about the bill in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will, first of all, be necessary to discuss the 
“discretionary” powers assigned to peace officers in relation to 
the reasonable and probable grounds to believe. 
There is a need for a thorough discussion of this aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to listen—we do not want to be rushed by the 
government—and we want to give both sides a chance to be heard. 
As I said a while ago, but it bears repeating now, this is a 
fundamental debate on the balance between individual rights and 
freedoms on the one hand and the powers of the state on the other. 
It is a debate that needs to be carried out in a leisurely and 
thorough manner.  We want to hear the proponents of both sides, 
those in favour of this bill and those opposed to it, with the 
reasons for their positions. It will also be very important to hear 
from the men and women who will have to put this bill into 
application, or in other words from the police officers across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the respect the Bloc Quebecois holds for privacy, given 
the duty the state has to respond to situations that require it to 
intervene in the private sphere of individuals in order to protect 
the public interest, and given as well that the action of the state 
is subordinate to the rules set out in the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, and more specifically section 8 in this case, given the 
importance of the amendments proposed to improve the administration 
of justice, given the Supreme Court judgment in the Feeney case, 
and the examination of precedents in the matter, and given that the 
amendments proposed seem—I use that word advisedly, as this will 
need verifying—to respond to the requirements of the 
jurisprudence, we in the Bloc Quebecois declare that we are in 
favour of Bill C-16. That is the end of my statement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to discuss Bill C-16 and to 
express the views of the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to echo some of the comments which have been made 
to date about the haste with which this bill is being pushed 
through the House of Commons.  I will speak to some specific 
concerns about that in a moment, but this is not a very effective 
way to achieve law reform and, in particular, criminal law reform 
because of the concerns Canadians have, quite rightly, of their 
sense of security in their homes and in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the parliamentary secretary for setting 
out clearly the provisions of Bill C-16.  Those who were watching 
and those who will read the proceedings will not be left in any 
doubt exactly what the government is attempting to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a response to the ruling of the Supreme Court of 
Canada in the Feeney case.  The proposed amendments to the 
Criminal Code would enable the police to obtain a warrant from a 
judge to enter a private home to arrest or apprehend a person. 
Also the legislation is intended to clarify that authorization 
from a judge is not needed in urgent circumstances where it is 
not practical to obtain a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Feeney case the Supreme Court ruled that in order to 
protect the privacy rights of Canadians under the charter, police 
must obtain a warrant before they enter a private home to arrest 
or apprehend someone.  Of course, the ruling caused concern among 
the police across Canada and victims' organizations, concerns 
that perhaps public safety was being put at risk in certain 
circumstances as a consequence of the delay which was being 
suggested by the Supreme Court of Canada in order to obtain a 
warrant to enter the premises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considerable concerns were voiced in the law enforcement 
community across Canada, as well as by the many Canadians who are 
concerned about their security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, police officers obtain a warrant authorizing entry 
before they enter a private home to arrest someone. This 
legislation is intended to provide procedures to obtain such a 
warrant.  It also allows the police to obtain a warrant by 
telephone or by any other means of telecommunication where 
presenting themselves to a judge is simply not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also makes the obtaining of warrants more straightforward, 
somewhat easier, and will be particularly useful, the government 
contends, for those working in remote locations or when it would 
not be possible to both monitor a suspect and appear before a 
judge to apply for the warrant to enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not have any effect on the common law which permits 
police and other peace officers to enter private homes to arrest 
a suspect when they are in hot pursuit of that suspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that arises is whether this legislation strikes a 
reasonable balance between the powers available to the police to 
protect our safety and the privacy rights of Canadians.  The 
government, of course, contends that it does.  We will have to 
wait to see what the Supreme Court of Canada decides on that 
particular matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does pose another problem, which is generated by rushing this 
legislation through the House with insufficient time to consider 
these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested to hear the Reform Party praise the attorney 
general of British Columbia who led the way in successfully 
applying to the Supreme Court of Canada to suspend its judgment 
for six months so that Parliament could respond and so that the 
uncertainty within the law enforcement community could be 
addressed. It is a rare day indeed when the Reform Party commends 
the attorney general of British Columbia for anything.  I want to 
note the Reform Party did that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is before us as a result of the Feeney case. It 
is close to the deadline.  I believe November 22 is the deadline 
for this legislation to be implemented in accordance with the 
recommendation of the Supreme Court of Canada.  As has been said 
many times, it does not give members very much time or 
opportunity to look into the specific provisions to see whether 
the legislation answers the concerns raised by the Supreme Court 
of Canada. It gives little time to look into whether this 
legislation is a response which will enable the police forces 
across Canada to do their jobs effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that from time to time the Supreme Court of Canada has 
taken the point that the old way of doing things prior to the 
charter is no longer appropriate, bearing in mind the contents of 
the charter.  This is one of those examples.  It serves to remind 
us that it would be better if the government took a more holistic 
and complete approach to criminal law reform.  It could look 
through a number of the issues which the supreme court and other 
courts have raised with regard to the application of criminal law 
in the light of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police association has raised some concerns about this 
legislation, among others.  These concerns could have been dealt 
with had we had more time to consider the provisions of the 
legislation in depth.  The police have concerns with regard to 
the statutory authorization of entry at the time of the warrant 
issue.  As we know, it is not always possible to be fully 
cognizant of where somebody who has escaped from prison or a 
halfway house might be.  Yet it is clearly in the public interest 
that such persons be apprehended as quickly as possible.  It 
deserves to be considered in more detail how this legislation 
affects that possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know there is some concern about failure in the 
legislation to define exigent circumstances.  When is it 
appropriate for the police to respond in the old way based upon 
an urgent situation in which they have no choice but to go and 
apprehend immediately?  With uncertainty, the police will not 
always know what their responsibilities are or how best to 
protect the public safety in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might also have been better to have included in the preamble 
provisions which would make it clear the government's response 
should there be a section 1 argument under the charter presented 
to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other provisions that could have been addressed 
in a more comprehensive review of the legislation in committee if 
this bill had been put forward a little earlier than it has been. 
Clearly we have to respond to the Feeney case and the Supreme 
Court of Canada's suggestions that Parliament act.  The 
government has acted with Bill C-16.  As has been mentioned, 
there is all party support for this response to the supreme 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I merely want to point out that if we had this legislation in a 
more timely way, we could have had more opportunity to resolve 
whatever potential difficulties there might be.  Those concerns 
have been voiced by police associations across the country which 
have the responsibility for enforcing this legislation and for 
protecting Canadians in their homes and in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are aspects of criminal law reform that can only be done 
in a piecemeal way. 
We do not have a full view of the future. We cannot guess what 
the Supreme Court of Canada might consider needs to be addressed 
as a result of the charter affecting our criminal law.

many respects, and it is possible to see what the Supreme Court 
of Canada has said we should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be better for all of us if the government took criminal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the Progressive Conservative 
Party to speak to a bill introduced in the House to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Interpretation Act, specifically referring 
to the powers of arrest to enter into a dwelling house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key objective of Bill C-16 is to provide police across the 
country with the power to enter a home and effect an arrest of an 
individual.  This came about as a result of The Queen v. Feeney 
case in the Supreme Court of Canada on May 22, 1997. In the 
delivery of the decision in The Queen v. Feeney the court ruled 
that as a general rule police require a warrant to enter a 
private dwelling to effect an arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision overturned a longstanding existing string of case 
law that did not require police to obtain a warrant to enter a 
home in arresting an individual if that police officer had 
reasonable and probable grounds to effect that arrest or, prior 
to entering the home, indicated in the presence of the accused 
that the authority and reason for entry was part of the normal 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada found that in this situation the 
privacy of Canadians under the charter was not adequately 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter has been given broad interpretation by our courts 
and in this instance the police have been curtailed in their 
ability to carry out their duties as it refers to arrest. No 
doubt this ruling causes great concern among the police community 
and victims' organizations that public safety may be put at risk 
in certain circumstances as a consequence of the delay required 
to obtain a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members have spoken concerning this bill.  I listened with 
great interest to the comments of the opposition parties as well 
as the government.  There are various perspectives that have 
significant bearing on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I have is the issue of hot pursuit in a 
situation where a person suspected of a serious criminal offence 
is being pursued into a residence or business and the ability of 
police officers to carry out their duties by effecting an arrest. 
There are also concerns that tie into that with respect to the 
preservation of evidence and the overall issue of protection of 
the public through preventive measures that police officers are 
charged with in their daily duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attorney general of British Columbia joined with other 
provinces and the federal government and successfully applied to 
the Supreme Court of Canada to suspend the judgment that was 
issued in Feeney for a period of six months to give Parliament 
the time needed to address the effects of this ruling and to fill 
the void left by The Queen v. Feeney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, police feel they are in limbo on this issue and 
are anxiously awaiting definitive direction and action to be 
taken by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are looking at the government's response to the supreme 
court decision.  I acknowledge in essence—and I want to put this 
clearly on the record—that it is a positive position the 
government has taken on this decision.  It is the government's 
attempt to fill the gap left by The Queen v. Feeney case. 
However I want to put comments forward with respect to the bill 
and I say again that I support it in principle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Feeney decision could not be left to stand, lest effective 
law enforcement, including the arresting of individuals 
committing crimes would be jeopardized with the existing 
situation were it left as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into the substantive effect of the bill, I would 
point out to the House and to the government, with the greatest 
respect, one of my concerns. The government's response was 
somewhat slow to the situation and the timeframe that was 
allotted by the supreme court.  Six months is certainly 
sufficient time to respond.  Obviously the country went through a 
federal election in that time but the business of the day has to 
be carried out regardless of the fact that the country is going 
through an election. I would suggest that a matter that is 
certainly of significant importance to the law enforcement 
community could be addressed within that time period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a press release dated October 30, 1997, the Minister of 
Justice is quoted as saying that the bill “strikes a reasonable 
balance between the powers available to the police to protect 
their safety and the privacy rights of Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to hear this pronouncement and this assessment by 
the minister regarding the legislation.  However considering the 
fundamental implications of Bill C-16, and those implications on 
the rights of individual Canadians, I hope that the minister will 
take into account the need for the justice committee to properly 
and openly discuss the impact of the bill. All indications are 
that this will be moving to the justice committee this week.  I 
am encouraged by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be quite frank, I am unsure that this House has enough time 
left, with 11 sitting days, both to pass the legislation and 
fulfil the commitment to Canadians to act thoughtfully and 
responsibly with their best interests in mind. However, we are 
used to working under pressure in trying to respond quickly and I 
am pleased to say that we are going to endeavour to do this with 
the time allotment we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my position that this bill should be carefully studied at 
the committee level. That is why I raise the issue of delay.  I 
know that the minister and her officials are prepared to hear the 
response of the opposition parties as well as witnesses at the 
justice committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those witnesses I would suggest will include the Canadian Police 
Association, bar associations throughout the country and crown 
prosecutors who will be given an opportunity to testify and give 
their very important and insightful views on the bill and their 
suggestions on how this bill might be further tightened up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the time and the place to fix this bill and draft 
legislation that is going to effectively fill the gap left by 
Feeney and we should try to get it right the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for the standing committee on justice to do all of 
this, the time issue is a factor and I hope we will be successful 
in our efforts to respond before the deadline of November 22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By having tabled the bill today and with the debate on second 
reading, it would be easy to demonstrate to the supreme court 
that Parliament has already started serious study with respect to 
the work that has to be done.  A suspension could be requested if 
required and there is precedent for this.  It has happened in the 
past. We may have to make this request should the justice 
committee have insufficient time or the witnesses not be 
permitted sufficient time to speak to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn briefly to the bill and its objectives. What does 
this bill do and what should it do?  Without any doubt, and I 
think it is common ground, the first objective should be to help 
to protect and serve the community.  We also have to recognize 
that the police officers, the rank and file, the individuals with 
the badges that are on the beat, have to be given assistance when 
it comes to effecting arrest and carrying out their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-16 do all this?  Does it accomplish this and can it 
be improved?  Again, these are questions that members of the 
justice committee and hopefully those bringing forward testimony 
are going to help us answer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity to be involved in a number of cases that 
included search warrants and individual rights, and the balance 
that must be struck between the protection of the public and 
those individual rights was always at issue. Certainly any piece 
of legislation that addresses issues of arrest where police 
officers are entering into private dwellings or places of 
business to effect arrest has to be viewed in a very, very 
serious light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses of course enjoy a different degree of privacy than a 
private dwelling.  Certainly the police, as in many of the 
situations they face on a daily basis, have to be entrusted with 
the greatest of discretion.  We can never ever ignore the fact 
that police officers are looking for direction from the Criminal 
Code of Canada and those legislators who have input into the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific concerns I raised at the outset surrounding hot 
pursuit are issues which I hope will be the subject of lively 
discussion at the committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Domestic violence and the need for all police agencies to 
address this will be better served when the issue is completely 
ironed out.  Police officers are called upon daily to intervene 
in issues of domestic violence. They must be given the utmost 
support and assistance if they are to effectively combat this 
very, very serious problem in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug searches are another area where the bill will have an 
impact.  Police officers are facing an epidemic of rampant drug 
use throughout the country.  They must be given the discretion to 
enter into a dwelling house or areas where drugs are suspected to 
be housed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police are always working in a pressure filled environment and 
there is more and more attention drawn to police and the job they 
are entrusted with.  In my experience I have seen police exercise 
very good judgment and act responsibly and lawfully in the 
majority of instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the principles that underscore the bill are 
sound.  At present, police officers throughout the country are 
working under a system which is somewhat cumbersome and 
ineffective without a substantive position being put forward in 
the Criminal Code.  Some of the proposals in this bill would 
certainly clarify it and would help the police do their job more 
expeditiously and would give them the knowledge that they are 
acting on solid ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest however that the bill needs to be amended or at 
least tinkered with in some areas.  This would include when 
police officers are seeking an arrest warrant and the 
authorization to enter into a dwelling house and their ability to 
tell a judge about a specific residence they want to enter to 
effect an arrest.  This information is not always available. 
Again it ties into the immediacy of the situation where they may 
be in pursuit or they may be faced with an emergency situation 
where they have to act immediately to prevent further injury, to 
prevent hiding or disposing of evidence.  This is something the 
bill does not address effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True, I certainly acknowledge that it is possible at times to 
speculate where a suspect may be, but this information is not 
always predictable.  Surely in the public interest the 
apprehension of a suspected criminal where the police have 
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence has 
been committed outweighs the concerns about entering a hideout or 
a safe house where the criminal may be harbouring the proceeds of 
crime, drugs or weapons that may have been involved in the 
offence of which he is accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is with respect to the resources 
available to police officers when it comes to effecting a search 
warrant. There is really no mention whatsoever in the bill about 
the availability of justices of the peace or judges with respect 
to the issuance of such warrants.  This I would suggest is a 
glaring omission. Without the resources it is really nothing more 
than lip service. 
If we have a very specific procedure in place as to how a search 
warrant can be obtained but we do not have the justices or the 
judges available to sign those warrants and allow the police 
officers to carry them out, then all is for nought.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern that does arise from the decision itself, and an 
attempt has been made by Bill C-16 to address it, is the further 
definition of exigent circumstances which is the language that is 
used in the majority decision of Feeney.  It is not clear, I 
would suggest, to this point what those exigent circumstances 
would include.  The police I think are looking for further 
clarification on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True to form as in all legislation there are going to be 
challenges.  Certainly the government cannot simply be responsive 
to the fact that this is going to be challenged and therefore try 
to anticipate every single charter challenge that may arise but 
clarification is needed on that definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point with respect to the listing of multiple dwellings 
within a search warrant and entry authorizations, the 
Interpretation Act seems to infer that singular means plural and 
vice versa within that act as the wording is set out in the 
current bill.  I would suggest that there is still some vagueness 
surrounding the language as it pertains to multiple listings for 
residences or hideouts where a suspected criminal may be staking 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I do want to say that we in the Conservative 
Party are supportive of this bill.  I would also like to indicate 
that the Minister of Justice has done the right thing in 
responding in a timely fashion in this sitting of the House, 
keeping in mind my earlier remarks with respect to the work that 
has been done thus far to see that the bill is brought to 
fruition in the House.  There is some concern I have in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government obviously has a huge obligation when it 
comes to the Criminal Code of Canada.  The Minister of Justice is 
certainly the top dog when it comes to effecting change within 
the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the opportunity of having a direct impact on 
the final draft of this bill.  I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in the House to seeing Bill C-16 through to its final 
conclusion which will hopefully be put forward in a way that it 
is going to be very effective in ensuring that police officers 
are permitted to do their job and to help keep the streets in 
this country safe and sound. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Dewdney—Alouette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in this place a short while and in that time I am 
amazed at how it operates.  Yesterday the minister tabled 
legislation in response to a supreme court decision of last May. 
It took the Department of Justice with all of its resources over 
five months to prepare a response.  Members of Parliament are 
then provided a day in order to review that response, comprehend 
the ramifications and attempt a rational comment. No wonder the 
Canadian public often question proceedings in this place. It may 
also explain why the courts have been so eager to challenge our 
legislative power in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few short years ago the courts limited themselves to 
interpreting the law and they now seem to be making it.  It used 
to be that this placed made the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last Parliament the former Minister of Justice was 
known for legislating by panic.  He often left mere days to pass 
essential legislation.  I expected more, and Canadians expected 
more from our present Minister of Justice.  As many members of 
the Liberal backbench have been quoted as saying, the unelected 
bureaucrats from the PMO really make all the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Minister of Justice does not control her own agenda 
and she has been forced to play these political games whereby 
legislation is introduced with unreasonable timeframes resulting 
in inadequate review and consultation.  We can only hope this 
government has at least the decency to refer this legislation to 
committee and then provide sufficient opportunity for proper 
review and presentation of all concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the bill, I appreciate that it is almost 
entirely a reaction to the Feeney case, but I question whether 
this legislation will address the next case like Feeney.  The 
majority decision of Feeney held that the police did not have 
reasonable and probable grounds to arrest Mr. Feeney prior to 
entry into his abode. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I ask this question.  How will a formal process of obtaining 
a warrant to enter a dwelling make an arrest be obtainable if 
there are not the grounds to make that arrest?  Many critics have 
sided with the minority position but the fact remains that the 
majority decided it was wrong for the police to gain entry to the 
dwelling without a warrant in those circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point concerns the bureaucracy we are placing upon 
police officers.  I have had reason to spend much time with the 
police in my community over the past few years.  I make it a 
point every few months to ride along with them for a full weekend 
night shift.  If citizens only knew what goes on in their streets 
while they are snuggled away in their beds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more judges and legislators should do the same before 
rendering bonehead decisions or penning ill-conceived 
legislation.  Maybe they would come to appreciate the situations 
faced by these men and women, the ever present threats and the 
instantaneous decisions required to keep our streets safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation at least makes provisions for telewarrants. Not 
all police officers will be smothered by paperwork. Hopefully in 
those remote locations and in those circumstances where time is 
important, the advantages of the telephone will assist our 
already overworked and understaffed enforcement personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not had any experience with telewarrants but I hope they 
will work as well as anticipated.  I cannot help but wonder 
whether justices of the peace would not be more hesitant to 
authorize warrants over the telephone rather than when a police 
officer with proper documentation appears personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also wonder just how available justices of the peace 
will be in the wee hours of the morning when our police are out 
protecting the public and require these dwelling arrest warrants. 
I would like to hear more evidence of how telewarrants work in 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, as a result of this legislation the police now have 
to be concerned about obtaining proper authorization to enter a 
dwelling to make an arrest.  They quite likely may also have to 
obtain separate authorization to search those premises.  They 
could well have previously been required to obtain a basic arrest 
warrant.  Is this not something, perhaps up to three warrants 
just to get an individual into our justice system.  After 
spending all the time and effort to get the individual before the 
legal process, the police and our communities will continue to be 
astonished at how quickly the accused will be entitled to bail 
and release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder whether the police will actually utilize these 
warrant provisions.  When they obtain a warrant and enter a 
dwelling house there is no guarantee the individual will be 
there. Executing the warrant will likely provide notice of police 
interest toward that individual.  It will provide notice that the 
accused should attempt to disappear in many cases.  In some cases 
the police will be endangered as desperate accused prepare to 
protect themselves against arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am further concerned that in many situations the police may 
decide to wait to apprehend to when the individual is outside the 
dwelling house.  Of course such a delay in apprehension could 
result in more occurrences of crime by the individual.  We can 
certainly see how our interest in protecting the rights of our 
criminals results in added responsibilities to our police and 
added attacks to our security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue to be raised concerns the status of other cases 
before the courts.  We know that Feeney is the law as of the date 
of its decision.  It is not clear whether other cases before the 
courts prior to Feeney will be ruled illegal arrests and evidence 
ruled inadmissible.  It is not even clear whether cases since 
Feeney will be protected by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason I fully expect our present justice system will 
be just as eager to treat other offenders in the same way as Mr. 
Feeney, at least those who have committed their crimes and who 
have been dealt with by the police prior to the passing of this 
legislation.  Otherwise the bleeding hearts will cry that it is 
not fair that only Mr. Feeney obtained these lenient and 
controversial allowances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of this place can appreciate, the supreme court 
raised some interesting new developments in our law.  This bill 
is an attempt to react to those developments.  They must be 
thoroughly and properly addressed.  With respect, I wish to 
remind those listening that the Feeney case involved a vicious 
beating and death of an 85-year old man.  The offender could well 
go free for this horrendous crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any failures to properly address the inadequacies of our law 
could result in additional travesties of justice.  It places a 
heavy burden on all of us in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier I hope the government begins to see the 
light and provides proper opportunity to adequately address these 
shortcomings.  This minister has gotten off to a poor start by 
leaving the bill to this late date and then starting to rush it 
through Parliament. We have three weeks until the date set by the 
supreme court to provide legislation and one of those weeks is a 
scheduled break week.  I do not know if the public will ever 
understand this place and that is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I have met with family members of the victim in 
the Feeney case. I doubt if there is anybody in this place who 
can even begin to comprehend how this decision has impacted on 
them. 
Just think of it, a convicted killer found covered in the blood 
of your loved one may walk away unpunished because the police 
were unable to wake him from a drunken stupor before entering his 
premises to make an arrest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another classic example of how our justice system 
continues to revictimize.  It is another example of how our 
justice system has been hijacked by those who view life from 
ivory towers, far above the realities of everyday Canadian life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that the majority of Canadians have lost faith 
in our courts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we will support Bill C-16. However, the fact that this bill must 
be brought forward is a symptom of bigger problems with the 
entire justice system, as my hon. colleague just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear the government saying that things are going well, 
that crime is down and that things are looking better.  That is 
simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous capacity as a teacher, we had an acid test for 
the sign of a good teacher which was whether we would be willing 
to put our own child in a classroom with a particular teacher. If 
we were, then we knew that teacher was a good teacher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The acid test for Canadians is the effectiveness of the justice 
system.  Is this a case about which Canadians are going to say 
that is a fine finding and they can live with it?  In the Feeney 
case it is obvious that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that Canadians are feeling any safer today than 
in the past.  There is a great deal of trouble with our justice 
system and Canadians are telling us that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The travesty here is that Feeney will walk in this case. As my 
colleague from Crowfoot mentioned earlier, the community in which 
Feeney lives is certainly not feeling safer.  Those people 
certainly do not feel that the justice system is working well in 
their area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is troubling in this case is the larger problem of the 
entire justice system.  Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, in her 
dissenting opinion in the Feeney case, stated that the 
warrantless arrest was justified given that a very violent murder 
had occurred, that the arrest was made in a field and that it was 
extremely impractical to obtain an arrest or search warrant.  The 
arrest was in the midst of a fresh pursuit, which was continuous 
and direct, and there was reasonable fear that the killer would 
commit further violence.  We believe this test should be 
applicable in all cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell two short stories about some of my 
constituents who have told me about the problems they are 
encountering with the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the stories is about a man whose son, unfortunately, was 
one of the victims of Clifford Olson.  He lives in my community 
of Maple Ridge, which is the largest city in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young man of 18 I lived in the community in which Olson 
prowled.  That community was Coquitlam.  In fact, that very 
summer I taught a Bible club in the apartment complex where Olson 
lived.  One of Olson's victims was a young man of 18.  I was 18. 
I know the fear that gripped my community when that man committed 
those heinous acts.  It affected not only my community but the 
surrounding communities and our country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw the pain and the anguish on a man's face whose life had 
been changed forever.  Mr. Ray King talked to me just before the 
farcical trial which took place in Vancouver.  He told me about 
all he had been through.  His son had been lost.  His son had 
been taken from him.  It has ruined his entire life.  For 15 
years he has remained rather silent but now is starting to speak 
out for the victims of crime.  He is asking for changes to be 
made to the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot lose sight of victims.  If we do we lose sight of what 
our justice system is about.  It is about the protection of our 
society.  It is about the protection of Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the lack of foresight and vision when Bill C-45 was 
introduced by the government in 1996, only eight days before the 
end of the summer sitting.  With further vision and further 
foresight in correcting the problems of the justice system this 
could have been brought forward sooner so that Mr. King and the 
other victims would not have had to go through what happened in 
Vancouver.  They would not have to relive that pain and anguish. 
It certainly is a sign that there is some trouble with our 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill C-16.  We support our police.  We support their 
being able to do their job, to have the tools to be able to do 
their job, to arrest criminals, to protect our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate one more short story about one of my constituents 
who came to tell me his story about the problems he has 
encountered with the justice system.  His father was brutally 
murdered by his own step-brother in the early 1980s. It was a 
terrible act, a heinous crime.  The individual was convicted of 
first degree murder.  This criminal has been streamed from 
maximum to medium to minimum security, and now Mr. McGillvary is 
faced with the fact that the person who committed this crime has 
been placed in an institution just 20 minutes away from his own 
home.  This inmate, this criminal who committed this act, who had 
taken Mr. McGillvary's father from him, also threatened Mr. 
McGillvary's life.  Yet now he is placed in an institution just 
20 minutes away from his own home in a minimum security 
institution where there is a great chance he could get away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a case in another minimum security institution setting 
five minutes from my house a few years back.  Inmates left and 
committed a murder in Seattle.  We would hope this is not a place 
people are going to leave from daily but the fear is there for 
Mr. McGillvary.  He has been through the system to ask for 
changes.  Understandably he is fearful, yet he has been offered 
counselling services to deal with his irrational fear.  I do not 
see this as irrational.  Not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We apply the acid test to that case.  What would we do if we 
were in Mr. McGillvary's case?  We would be just as fearful.  We 
ask who holds the keys to the criminal justice system.  In Mr. 
McGillvary's case, he has been told that it would be a problem to 
transfer this inmate because the inmate could bring a court case 
against correctional services, a case which he would likely win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who holds the keys for where he is going to be?  The justice 
system should have the opportunity to put an inmate where he is 
deemed to be best placed.  We need a balance and the victims need 
to be remembered.  While we support this bill, we point out that 
the government needs to listen to Canadians and their cries for a 
substantive overhaul of the criminal justice system, to provide a 
balance, to provide truth in sentencing, and to restore 
Canadians' faith in the criminal justice system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member.  I appreciated his remarks.  It is 
important to remember that what precipitated the current debate 
and this legislation is a decision of the Supreme Court of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to ask the question of who holds the keys to the 
criminal justice system in this country.  I submit that 
Parliament is the right institution to hold those keys and not 
the supreme court.  While we respect the supreme court, its 
current method for appointing judges leaves the public no way of 
holding any of those justices accountable for the decisions they 
make. 
We know that at times there is the appearance that appointments 
are made on a political basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not agree that a big part of the problem with 
the Feeney decision is that of a situation where the public is 
going to have to live with the results of this absolutely 
unacceptable decision of the Supreme Court of Canada and yet the 
supreme court is not accountable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not something wrong with this picture and does it not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
colleague for Skeena for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I would say that there is a definite problem with the 
system. We are charged by our electorate to make laws in this 
place.  We are accountable to our constituents.  However, when we 
see the application of law such as in this case, there is a 
imbalance.  There should have been a common sense finding, but 
there was not.  More and more Canadians are wondering why such an 
obvious case was found the way it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a body of unelected officials interpreting the law and 
making decisions on the law which more and more seem to be 
getting away from what the majority of Canadians would find to be 
reasonable answers.  We need to overhaul the system and look at 
more accountable ways of appointing judges so that they would be 
held accountable for their decisions. We respect the supreme 
court, but in cases such as this we have to question the findings 
of such a decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the record is fairly complete here today in describing 
the background of the legislation.  I want to acknowledge the 
anticipated co-operation of colleagues on all sides of the House 
to dispose of the issue today and allow the matter to go to a 
committee where it can be treated with a bit more introspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do want to address a particular issue.  As a bit of a 
preamble, lot of MPs are curious about why from time to time we 
in the House have to revisit legislative areas because of 
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada.  It should not be a 
surprise. Since the charter was adopted as part of our 
Constitution we have had to adapt some of our laws to the 
guidance and interpretation of that court.  It was inevitable 
that some of this was going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one legislator, I wish that when the court deals with these 
things it would assess the impact of its decisions on criminal 
procedures on Canadian life.  In this case, I gather it did not 
want to make the decision and then the government lawyers had to 
go back and ask for a stay of six months.  We are now at the end 
of that six month window and we are attempting to correct that 
area of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that the paradigms within which we must work to do this 
are set by the courts.  I would rather we go back to square one 
and design a procedure that we all believed was appropriate and 
in compliance with the charter and fair to Canadians. We will 
probably have a chance to address some of those issues at the 
committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of brevity, I will get to the issue I want to 
discuss.  As a result of this decision there is a gaping hole in 
the criminal procedure which applies to police entering private 
dwelling homes for the purpose of arresting someone or securing 
evidence.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this decision, before entering a dwelling home without 
a warrant for the purpose of executing an arrest peace officers 
had to have reasonable grounds to believe they could arrest 
someone in the home, someone they had the right to arrest.  The 
person must have been guilty or believed to be guilty of an 
indictable offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the reasonable grounds peace officers would have 
to announce their entry: something equivalent to a knock on the 
door and a statement as to whom they were, followed by the entry. 
That was the way it was for almost 100 years based on what is 
called the Landry test.  It seems to have worked relatively well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the following scenario is proper.  Let us say 
an individual is suspected of either a rape or a bank robbery. 
Three weeks later the victim spots the perpetrator.  The person 
does not know his or her name but the perpetrator is spotted. The 
victim then goes to the police and says “I have seen the person 
who raped me” or “I have seen the person who robbed the bank”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police officer under the old rules would have said “Let's 
go and get him” and if he is in a dwelling house he would have 
made entry.  In this case the peace officer has to obtain a 
warrant if the accused happens to be in a dwelling house even if 
it is not his own dwelling house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only difficulty is the warrant procedure we have just 
designed in the bill requires that the accused be identified by 
name.  In my scenario we do not have a name.  We have an 
identification.  We know he is there but we do not know his name. 
Therefore we cannot get a warrant with the bill and the peace 
officer cannot go into the house.  In theory the accused can sit 
there for 30 years while we figure out how we can get into the 
house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be a problem with the legislation.  We will have a chance 
to address it in due course.  I am sure colleagues will 
co-operate as we address it.  I will leave my further remarks on 
the legislation for committee stage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Frank Boyle was murdered at Likely which is about one 
hour's drive, if one drives like heck and does not hit a deer, 
from Williams Lake where I live.  It is on the Quesnel River 
flowing out of Quesnel Lake.  It is an isolated community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the large tasks I have as the member serving 
Cariboo—Chilcotin is initial telephone hookups, lines to where 
residents live so they can get on the telephone system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to ask is about the telewarrants.  I am glad 
the member raised the question of warrants.  The legislation 
would probably work well in a city where the streets are laid out 
and the houses are identified.  However, how would they work in 
areas where there are shacks, trailers and accommodations in the 
bush?  People have lived for a long time in these areas.  People 
in isolated circumstances are encouraged not to take the law into 
their own hands as they have had to do in the past because there 
have not been police resources or a means of communicating with 
the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are telewarrants supposed to work when the police 
undertaking a legitimate investigation are unable to communicate 
with the justice of the peace, the judge or even their own 
headquarters in many instances because of isolation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to be another instance where the laws of our land are 
dividing rural and urban people.  Does the member have a comment 
to make about telewarrants and their effectiveness in the type of 
circumstance that happened in Likely? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises a good 
question.  Obviously members at the committee stage will have to 
make sure the design and procedure work.  The committee and the 
stakeholders will be consulting with the police community. 
Whether we are talking about telephone authorizations or 
telewarrants or whatever, we have to make sure when the bill 
leaves committee and comes back to the House we have a procedure 
or a mechanism that works and addresses the hon. member's 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ready to go to work on it and I hope he is too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise 
today to speak in support of Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before doing so I would like to thank the Minister of Justice 
and the officials in her department for their swift and 
comprehensive leadership on this issue.  I also thank the 
previous minister of justice for the bold leadership he 
demonstrated during our first mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our safe homes and safe streets agenda has been a tremendous 
success.  Our accomplishments include sentencing reform, a new 
national system of screening child sex abusers, amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act and tighter controls on guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach of the Liberal government to justice issues has 
emphasized prevention.  Prevention is the underlying philosophy. 
That is why we established the National Crime Prevention Council 
which continues to study what leads children into a life of crime 
and how to stop that pattern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have funded a national campaign against family violence.  We 
have also improved peace bonds to make them more effective in 
keeping abusers away from women and children.  To protect 
children from sexual exploitation we have brought in legislation 
to get tough on pimps and customers who prey on child prostitutes 
and prosecute Canadians who exploit child prostitutes in other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime is not a simple issue.  The Liberal approach avoids fear 
mongering and the kind of simplistic solutions we often hear in 
the House such as flogging petty criminals and throwing more and 
more people into expensive prisons for longer and longer 
sentences.  That is why that policy is doomed to fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move to why we are here today.  The bill was introduced 
to correct a procedural flaw in our judicial system, a flaw that 
has been chipping away at section 8 of the charter.  The section 
is one of the fundamental legal rights Canadians share that many 
people in other countries are still fighting for.  It is the same 
right many people undertake when they wish to make their points. 
I remind hon. members that the section reads “Everyone has the 
right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Feeney case presented the problem of whether Canadian police 
officers should have complete discretion to enter a premises 
simply because they are investigating an incident and then upon 
stumbling across incriminating evidence should be allowed to 
ignore section 8 of the charter and proceed with an arrest.  The 
officer in the case did not believe he had reasonable and 
probable grounds for the forcible entry.  Therefore the court 
found the law inadequate to allow the police to do their job and 
to protect citizens privacy rights.  I think there is a general 
consensus in the House on that background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opponents may feel these claims are not strongly founded. 
However the bill will neither add to nor subtract from the powers 
of the police.  The bill is designed to clarify the process so 
that the legal rights our opponents take for granted are 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Procedures will now be clear.  A peace officer will be able to 
apply in person or by phone to a judge or justice for a warrant 
authorizing the peace officer to enter a private dwelling to 
arrest a person, if the judge or justice is satisfied that a 
warrant of arrest for that person exists and there are reasonable 
grounds to believe a person is in the dwelling, or authorizing 
the peace officer to enter a private dwelling to arrest a person 
whose identity is known or can be identified, if the judge or 
justice is satisfied there are reasonable grounds for an arrest 
and to believe the person is in the dwelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation would also allow the judge when issuing 
an arrest warrant to authorize entry into a specific dwelling if 
the judge is satisfied there are reasonable grounds to believe 
that the person subject to the arrest warrant is or will be 
inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After explaining this some people will say there will be 
instances when peace officers will not have enough time to get 
the warrant.  We have provided for that.  The bill will allow 
police officers to enter the private dwelling without a warrant 
in exigent or pressing circumstances where it is not feasible to 
obtain one.  These would include but would not be limited to 
situations where there is a reasonable suspicion that entry is 
necessary to prevent bodily harm or death to anyone, or there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that entry is necessary to prevent 
imminent loss or destruction of evidence. 
In total the bill strikes the right balance between empowering 
police to do their jobs and protecting the fundamental right of 
the charter.

pleased to see a broad consensus within the House to support the 
bill.  For that I am truly thankful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his comments.  I 
have a question that relates directly to Mr. Feeney and the 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the legislation provide for Mr. Feeney to be retried using 
the evidence that the supreme court has already thrown out, or 
will he go free because the evidence is not admissible in court? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in anybody's mind, particularly and likely, 
that Mr. Feeney is guilty as hell.  The blood is on his hands. If 
that blood cannot be used in the subsequent court appearance, 
what good is it?  Justice is being denied.  Justice is not being 
served.  The law must serve justice and not simply the legal 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government build in retroactive provisions so that Mr. 
Feeney can be tried, using the evidence that the police have 
already collected to convict him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the questions brought 
forward by the hon. member are sound.  The place for him and 
members of his party to ask those questions is in debate in 
committee to see if those kinds of things can be worked through 
and a consensus can be brought forward.  I think the 
recommendations are worth while. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have talked with Canadians over the past little while, it 
seems to me they have some sense there are three untouchables in 
our society over which they have very little control.  Perhaps 
one would be the media.  The second would be the banking system. 
The third would be the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any thoughts on how we might be able 
to bring some kind of real reform to the judiciary that would 
make it more accountable to the people in general and somehow 
accountable to enforcing the law as passed in this Chamber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particular case that prompted this legislation is a case in 
point.  It seems that somehow the judiciary has taken precedence 
over the laws of the land and Canadians do not have faith in it 
any more.  We need to reverse that.  Does the hon. member have 
any suggestions on how we might change that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the process has been so 
long established that it would require some deep and serious 
thought about approaching such amendments or changes in the 
judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I am not a lawyer and I am not legally trained.  I 
think there could be a process if some members of Parliament come 
up with ideas substantiated with solid logic and support for 
change and have the support of the public of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment I have no instant answers for the member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I only have a few minutes to debate the 
issue.  I want to make a few comments and will debate it more 
fully at third reading if I am given the opportunity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a couple of the issues that have been brought 
before us on the amendment to the Criminal Code with respect to 
powers of arrest, to arrest and enter dwelling houses.  I also 
want to comment on some of the statements made by members 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that has to be clear is that we are not talking about 
legalese and how it should be, we are talking about a law that 
affects the rights and protection of the citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we in the House start putting laws in place which will not 
withstand an interpretation by the courts, then we have a 
problem.  The responsibility is not the courts.  It is the 
responsibility of members of Parliament to make sure that we are 
very clear in how we put words into legislation, to make sure 
that we word legislation so it is not open to misinterpretation 
of our intent by the courts. Therefore, the onus is on this House 
to make sure that Bill C-16 is very clear in its intent to 
protect the Canadian public and not to allow the accused criminal 
to escape justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the hon. member opposite say it is in committee that we 
should make sure that these changes, these rural versus urban 
concerns, are addressed.  It is in committee that we have to 
address these other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience is that committees are not always open to 
suggestions.  They are not always open to suggestions saying we 
have to be clear, we have to precise, we have to make sure that 
what we are saying is what the people of Canada are expecting to 
have written into the legislation.  The onus is on us to go into 
these committees with an open mind, not based on party politics, 
to make sure that the end product is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it in other legislation that has come from this 
House in the previous Parliament.  I use as an example 
alternative sentencing.  Because we were not specific, although 
some wanted to be, for who these alternative sentences could be 
used, we see dangerous and serious offenders being released into 
society without any incarceration because we were not definite 
and clear in our intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great expectations that the 36th Parliament will be 
different, that it will allow real changes to legislation in 
committee to make sure that the end product is the best product. 
We have to make sure that the end product is not going to be 
questioned and challenged in the Supreme Court of Canada and sent 
back to us to correct matters that should have been changed first 
time around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful that the evidence which was decided was illegally 
gained can be used in the next court case.  I am hopeful that the 
committee will ensure that the protection is there for the 
Canadian public.  I am hopeful that the hon. members concerned 
about rural people not having the same ability to have telephone 
warrants issued will be addressed in a meaningful and real way so 
that no Canadian citizen is denied the opportunity of the good 
that can come from this change in Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to impress on all members from all parties that 
Parliament should show a willingness in committee to have open 
and honest debate and be receptive to things which will improve 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say a few things in general on this bill.  It is very 
important to us as Canadians and as Reformers that our justice 
system do its work, that we have availability of evidence which I 
believe is the underlying premise of this bill, that evidence 
which is factual is admissible and that a member of the police 
force has the ability to do his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that when we have an alleged offence we do not want 
to incorrectly incarcerate a person who is innocent.  But at the 
same time we also want to make sure the person who is guilty is 
found guilty, is sentenced and is punished so that society is 
protected.  It is very important for our courts to be correct, 
for our justice system to be correct: to vindicate the innocent, 
to most certainly convict the guilty. It is very important that 
we have a justice system that responds to that need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We very strongly urge the government to take action.  We 
sincerely hope the committee will do its work so the justice 
system our people are so concerned about can do its work and so 
we can restore a trust in it which people are now lacking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say a few words. I want to say them 
because I know how concerned are the people of Likely about what 
has happened to one of their neighbours, Mr. Boyle.  There has 
been a travesty of justice. A man has been caught literally with 
blood on his hands and he has been freed.  There is more than 
indignation in Likely and in the Cariboo—Chilcotin over what has 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long time ago a lawyer told me that the legal system has 
nothing to do with justice, it has to do with keeping a refined 
set of rules.  In this instance the rules have not served 
justice.  It does not take a genius to know when justice has been 
denied.  In this instance it has been.  I call on this Parliament 
to consider the needs of justice and the needs of Canadians 
rather than to put the whole emphasis on the legal system and 
those who support it and operate it. Until we do this the legal 
system will be held in contempt and often the contempt which it 
deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on Parliament and the justice committee that will be 
reviewing this legislation to keep in mind that our laws are 
there to protect the Canadian people.  They are there to provide 
the tools to the police who give us that protection, to call 
people to account who have broken the law, who have done unjust 
deeds, who have hurt their fellow men, who have denied their 
fellow men the justice they have a right to expect.  We have to 
go beyond keeping rules.  We have to keep in mind what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice must be served.  I would call on the government for the 
sake of Likely, for the sake of Mr. Boyle who lost his life, I 
call on Parliament to consider first of all the needs of 
Canadians as they seek justice and to seek to live their lives by 
a system that provides justice.

act to amend the Access to Information Act (disclosure of results 
of public opinion polls), be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, most Canadians believe that this is the 
best country in the world in which to live.  They are proud of 
the country in which we live.  However, most of them would agree 
that the status quo is not acceptable.  We cannot keep on doing 
things the way we have always done them.  Now there is a demand 
across Canada for more open and accountable government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Open government means a free flow of information between 
government and its citizens.  It means government informs the 
public, rather than manipulating them.  Open government means 
that when tax dollars are used to commission polls about the 
thoughts and opinions of Canadians, then everyone has the right 
to access that information in a timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to be able to access to these poll results in an 
easy manner, not in a manner in which they have to jump through a 
whole bunch of bureaucratic hoops and satisfy a whole bunch of 
requirements before accessing the information.  If that is what 
has to happen, people will be discouraged from accessing poll 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Parliament of the Conservative Party which was very 
secretive, this Parliament has shown itself to be more willing to 
open up the process.  This government believes there should be 
changes and that things will have to be changed to satisfy 
Canadians.  As well, this government believes that Canadians 
should never have to face the situation, as happened in the 
Mulroney years, when the information commissioner had to take the 
prime minister to court in order to release information from 
publicly funded polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take a long time for Canadians to forget the reign of 
terror brought on by the Mulroney government and the secretive 
administration which existed then.  I am sure this government 
does not want to have a repeat of that sort of regime.  Of 
course, it does not want to leave those kinds of memories in the 
minds of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that this kind of backroom 
government that was so common before must be changed and it must 
be changed quickly.  The Canadian public will not accept any more 
of this sort of blind faith in politicians.  Canadians have 
learned from experience that they cannot trust politicians who 
tell them “trust me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians who selectively release important information to 
manipulate the public, particularly when the public paid for 
those polls, is just not acceptable.  To simply advance the ideas 
of the government through polling is just not acceptable.

massive numbers of polls and many focus group studies.  This was 
paid for by the Canadian taxpayer.  Then, of course, a number of 
people wanted to see the results of the polling and focus groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue which arises from this is the fact that the 
minister also chose his political friends for this hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in polling that was done.  David Herke, a 
former member of his leadership team, did most of the polling 
along with Elly Alboim, a former CBC journalist.  After the 
polling and focus groups were finished, the minister said this 
cannot be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question Mr. Windsor asked very clearly in his article was 
how we can the opinions of the Canadian people on the topic of 
taxation and say that they should be state secrets.  The minister 
is quoted as saying that this would be deemed injurious to 
conducting the Government of Canada and injurious to federal and 
provincial affairs.  He also said that it would be materially 
injurious to financial interests, and he went on.  Those were the 
grounds on which he said these polls could not be published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The access to information commissioner said it was not a 
national threat to the country or to provincial relations. The 
minister then requested that the information be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to show how far the finance minister would go, he hired his 
own lawyer to challenge the information commissioner on releasing 
polls that were paid for by the Canadian public. This blockage 
continued for 18 months. Finally, after his own lawyer advised 
him he cannot block these anymore, that if this goes to court he 
would lose, his lawyer advised him to release the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, 18 months after the polls which were paid for by the 
Canadian taxpayer were done, they were released. What did they 
contain that was so injurious?  I will quote from the 
actual poll results: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>[They] will be seen as a bribe and a waste of taxpayer's money 
if the reform is seen to be a political exercise unrelated to 
improving the tax system; the issue is political, not 
substantive; no evidence that people think the GST is in need of 
reform; the GST reform has no relief for consumers, it has a 
patchwork look and the appearance of more confusion for business 
and more bureaucracy; the GST commitment needs to be dealt with 
politically rather than substantively; the most effective method 
is likely to come clean now about the promise and the inability 
to fulfil it rather than pretend to have fulfilled it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the claims that were made by the opposition parties in 
this House about the harmonized GST.  Yet this minister took 18 
months to hold this public polling in secret just because it was 
politically against what he was trying to do. Obviously if the 
taxpayer is going to pay for it then the taxpayer has the right 
to know about it.  If a political party wants to do polling it 
certainly can keep it secret because it paid the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the current government, as I have said, has not been 
as secretive as the previous one, but the whole red book concept 
of open government obviously is really being held to question now 
when we examine the actual facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we are going to hear from members across the way that 
there is no need for Bill C-217, that they really are not 
interested in blocking any poll results.  However, what we are 
saying is that when any federal departments, boards or agencies 
commission polls paid for by the House they should be made 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of arguments that I think we will hear against the 
need for this bill.  I do not think I have to go through all of 
them other than to simply say that many Liberal members in the 
House have stood up and said that results should be open and that 
the justice minister is going to fix the access to information. 
We have been promised since 1994 that there will be substantive 
changes to the access to information.  Those have just not 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see a minister, as the example I have just described, 
doing that we can see just how old-fashioned and unwilling to 
change this government may have become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the Treasury Board changes which I can go through 
item by item.  There are seven major items.  I can provide that 
information to anyone who wants it.  The key thing is that the 
headlines probably say it all, “Liberal poll rules are much like 
the Tories.  Liberals will still allow polls to be kept secret”. 
That does not go with the promise by the Liberals of an open 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am standing here today pleading with this government to allow 
these polls to be subject to access claims, that it be done in a 
reasonable manner, not 90 days but 15 days from the time the poll 
is commissioned if it is paid for by the public, that these polls 
then be presented to the Speaker of the House, that he then has 
the authority to release that information in due course, and then 
the public has the right to know what those results are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the major part of the bill.  Those are the reasons 
behind it.  I think the government will be hard pressed to 
justify to those Canadians who are asking for accountability that 
a poll paid for by them should be kept secret.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House today is quite interesting.  It 
concerns one of Canada's principles, namely, democracy.  A simple 
principle of democracy provides that the electorate through its 
elected representatives must control the expenditures of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, if taxpayers' money is spent, taxpayers are 
entitled to know how it was spent.  This too is part of democratic 
control of government.  It is a very simple matter, it is a matter 
of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the role opinion polls play in our society.  They 
play an important, some say too important, role.  The fact is, 
their role is important because they provide not only qualitative 
information but quantitative information on very specific subjects. 
The government uses them to direct its policy, because all 
governments are influenced by opinion polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what the government is trying to achieve through these polls is 
to give direction to this policy, the information collected should be 
shared with all elected representatives, who need to be 
“enlightened” 
too, because while the government must do a good job, the elected 
members of this House must be as “enlightened” as the government team 
across the way in order to perform their duties as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue ties in with the problem of national unity, for we know 
what this government does with the polls it commissions in Quebec. It 
uses them to identify the fears and concerns of Quebeckers. Not only was 
Quebec taxpayers' money used to identify their fears, but it was also 
used to develop Plan B and to turn the information gathered against the 
same Quebeckers whose money was used to pay for these polls. 
That is utterly unacceptable.>These poll results are used to add fuel to 
the scare campaign and pervert the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, two years ago yesterday, a referendum was held 
in Quebec. There were passionate, serious, yet healthy discussions 
around the issue. I think that, with a 93% rate of participation in this 
referendum, we were a model of democracy to the world. We are proud of 
this. We are often accused of acting outraged. Well, we are boasting 
now, and with good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened since the Quebec referendum? There was the 
federal government's scare campaign and Plan B. There was the diversion 
of democracy toward unelected officials. They said the sky was going to 
fall if Quebeckers ever took their destiny into their own hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perfectly normal for Quebeckers to know what they are paying 
for. 
Quebeckers ought to know that the taxes they pay are used against their 
best interests. In a democracy, elected representatives should, as a 
minimum, monitor government expenditures and know what the government 
does with public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government decides to spend millions of dollars on polls 
which are sometimes totally ludicrous, it should be pointed out in the 
House to show that, fortunately, ridicule never killed anyone, otherwise 
there would not be many government members left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the government is using Quebeckers' own 
money to finance its fearmongering campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois will strongly and passionately 
support the motion tabled by the Reform member.

pleased to take part in the debate this afternoon.  I begin by 
acknowledging the hon. member from the government party who 
allowed me an opportunity to speak in order that I can return to 
my constituency this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an interesting debate.  There is absolutely no question 
that the government should and could do a lot more to let the sun 
shine in on the release of polling data that is paid for by the 
public.  As the hon. member of the official opposition noted in 
his speech earlier, the Minister of Finance went to great lengths 
to hide the poll results on the goods and services tax of 1996, 
including the retention of a private lawyer to try to keep that 
information out of the public view. Clearly that kind of 
behaviour in a free and democratic society is totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus is certainly supportive of change in this area. We 
also recognize and realize that we live in the real world. This 
private members' bill seems pretty utopian in its outlook. That 
is not surprising as it comes from a political party that is 10 
years and one day old as I have read in the paper, but a party 
which is much older in terms of some of its views and attitudes. 
It is also a party that has consistently refused to run 
provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Saskatchewan, the Reform Party is cosying 
up to the Saskatchewan party, that ridiculous blend of 
Conservatives and Liberals.  We see evidence of similar activity 
in the province of British Columbia. There is recognition and 
realization of why this is so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the official opposition is clearly a student of 
political history.  He knows what happened to his father's party, 
the Social Credit Party of Alberta.  He knows what happened to 
the Social Credit Party of British Columbia and he knows what 
ultimately happened as a result of that to the federal Social 
Credit Party.  When Peter Lougheed came into Alberta, the Social 
Credit Party disappeared. In this decade we have seen the demise 
of the B.C. Social Credit Party.  I stand to be corrected but I 
believe there has not been a Social Credit member in this 
legislature since 1979. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Stornoway does not want to see history repeat 
itself so he is not going to run the risk of having the Reform 
Party elected at the provincial or territorial level, thereby 
attempting to remain as pure as the driven snow. That is not the 
way we do it in our caucus and our party. I am very proud to 
represent a party which runs candidates federally, provincially 
and sometimes municipally.  As our party constitution states, if 
you are a member of the provincial or territorial New Democratic 
Party, you are automatically considered to be a member of the 
federal New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to what we do in Saskatchewan.  I will take a 
minute to set the scene.  There is no question that in the 1980s 
the Devine government, probably the worst government in the 
history of our province if not Canada, had flagrantly abused the 
public polling situation, as the member noted about the Mulroney 
government. 
In 1993 the Government of Saskatchewan introduced some 
significant reforms.  I want to go through them because they are 
legitimate. I hope the members on the government benches are 
listening because these are reasonable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan four times per year, once per quarter, the 
Government of Saskatchewan releases all polling information which 
has been completed for it during the previous quarter.  The 
government has been doing this for the last four years.  The 
information released includes all reports from polling companies, 
including both the questions asked and the responses made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The material is released by the government and provided free of 
charge to the media and opposition parties, and I assume as well 
to the speaker of the legislature.  The same information is 
available at a modest charge to other users, including interested 
individuals and corporations.  The only material which is not 
released by the Government of Saskatchewan on its polling data 
includes that which refers to questions of market research, 
commercially and prices, in the case of crown corporations for 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot more the federal government should be doing in 
the area of opening up the process and letting the sun shine in. 
There are some legitimate reasons why an appropriate or 
reasonable amount of time, 90 days, should exist before 
government polling is made public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak on Bill C-217 which would amend the Access to 
Information Act in relation to disclosure of the results of 
public opinion polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take offence to the hon. Reform member's contention that the 
PM's so-called friends are getting these contracts.  Once again 
the Reform Party has proven its non-partisan and different way of 
doing things in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to make a general comment immediately which is that I 
firmly believe the Canadian people should be able to get easy 
access to government information with few limited and specific 
exemptions.  In my opinion easy access to most government 
information is a cornerstone of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government supports the rights that Canadians have to access 
information about their government, except in certain specific 
cases where it is required for reasons of security intelligence, 
law enforcement and confidential commercial information received 
by the government from companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed Canadians would not tolerate a government that did not 
give them easy access to most of its information.  I believe an 
open government is essential to the trust that Canadians place in 
their government and to the preservation of the respect which 
members of the public give us as politicians representing them in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about specific amendments to the Access to 
Information Act proposed in this bill. I will explain my concerns 
and my reservations regarding the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to explain the concerns and reservations I have about 
this bill, I must describe the amendments being proposed to the 
Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amended act would require any department, branch, office, 
board, agency, commission, corporation or other body established by 
or pursuant to any Act of Parliament or established by or pursuant 
to any proclamation, order in council or other instrument made or 
issued by the Governor in Council or by those under his authority 
that commissioned a public opinion poll, to give notice thereof 
forthwith to the designated minister and to the Speaker of the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the amendment would apply to crown 
corporations, the Canada Labour Relations Board, the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission and various agencies of the federal government. 
But I could well be mistaken and that is precisely what worries me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By defining the institutions affected by the proposed 
amendment as it does, this bill completely departs from the 
structure of the Access to Information Act. 
This act applies to the 140 odd government institutions listed in 
the schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this list is to identify clearly the agencies 
or bodies to which the act applies and thus exclude the others. 
Departing from this kind of designation risks creating uncertainty 
about whether the act applies to a given institution and opening 
the way for legal challenges to settle the matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of Bill C-217 could be that institutions that were not 
covered by the act until now, such as Canada Post, would now be included 
because of this particular amendment adding section 5.1. In short, I 
find it inappropriate to include in the same law two procedures to 
determine to which institutions it applies, even if they are in two 
different parts. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect of Bill C-217 which strikes me as 
problematic also from the legal point of view. The Access to 
Information Act currently creates a legislative scheme whereby a 
person can make a formal request for government information 
specified in the request and pay a small application fee.  The 
information is then provided within a period of time specified in 
the act unless one or more of the limited and specific exemptions 
applies and the requester is denied access to some of the 
requested information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point in describing the process is to illustrate that the act 
does not oblige any department or minister to provide information 
to the public unless an access request has been received. This is 
because the act is not meant to replace existing ways of 
obtaining government information as specified in section 2 of the 
act.  The act is an additional way of obtaining government 
information by means of a formal request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, what would be the effect of Bill C-217?  It would create an 
anomaly in the Access to Information Act creating an obligation 
for ministers to report to the House on results of public opinion 
polls, thereby doing away with the formal request for information 
scheme. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we admit there is a case for creating a new system 
different from the one currently found in the Access to Information Act, 
I believe the proposed legislation could create another problem. The 
bill requires the minister to provide a report of the results of public 
opinion polls to the House of Commons or to the commissioner no later 
than 15 days after their completion. I think it can easily take longer 
than 15 days to analyze the results of a large scale public opinion 
poll. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a problem with the requirement that every public 
opinion research contract be reported to the minister and to the 
Speaker of the House of Commons, and that reports be tabled in 
Parliament or with the information commissioner and published in 
<I>The Canada Gazette</I>.  This would appear, in my opinion, to 
be overkill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned with the definition of public opinion poll which 
I find extremely broad in the bill. It would include quantitative 
and qualitative research conducted among members of the public 
using a prepared questionnaire or interview schedule. A good 
proportion of this research would be very limited public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the bill from a different point of view, my general 
position is that an existing piece of legislation should only be 
amended if there is a problem that needs to be fixed, and I 
stress that.  I would even go further and say that the problem 
should be a significant one if there is to be a bill containing 
just one amendment. If the problem is not particularly 
significant, although still valid, then I think the fixing of it 
should wait for a larger comprehensive review of the act.  I am 
not sure that this amendment would fix a significant problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the act already provides for access 
to public opinion polls.  Section 4 of the act in fact provides 
that everyone has a right of access to any record under a 
government institution. In so far as opinion polls constitute 
such records, they are covered by the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If specific poll results are not disclosed to the public, it is 
because in specific circumstances a legitimate interest that 
competes with a presumption of access is invoked.  It should be 
noted that the act performs a careful and complex balancing 
between a variety of interests and I am concerned that amending 
the act to address a specific and limited aspect of the act would 
disturb the various balances within the act at the moment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted also that the courts have already ruled on the 
application of the Access to Information Act to public opinion polls. 
The Trial Division of the Federal Court has in fact made a ruling on the 
issue of disclosure of results of public opinion research in the case of 
the Information Commissioner v the Prime Minister, that dealt with a 
public opinion poll requested in relation to previous constitutional 
negotiations. The Court ordered disclosure of the information to the 
person who requested the documents, because it was not convinced that 
disclosure of the poll results would be prejudicial to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to section 4 of the act and the Federal Court decision, 
there is a third reason why I would ask what great problem this bill 
could help solve.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretariat of the Treasury Board has issued guidelines for the 
disclosure of poll results by federal institutions. Broadly speaking, 
all departments are requested to make every effort to disclose the 
results of public opinion polls outside the formal framework of the 
Access to Information Act and its mechanisms. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that the issue does not require examination. 
Indeed, the disclosure of public opinion polls is one of the 
issues being monitored by the Department of Justice at this 
moment in assessing the need for a review of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is a need for Bill C-217. There is 
already a right of access to public opinion poll research under 
the current Access to Information Act.  There is case law which 
provides guidance to the government on disclosing such polls. 
There is a government policy on disclosing poll results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this issue is being examined together with other 
issues related to the whole act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all of this, I do not think it is appropriate or necessary 
to proceed with an ad hoc amendment on the specific issue of 
public opinion polls.  In addition, I have problems with the fact 
that the bill would introduce significant new bureaucratic 
reporting requirements, deviating from the way the rest of the 
act defines government institutions, which potentially could 
apply to research of a very limited public interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to speak to my colleague's bill on 
access to information regarding polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It boils down to a very basic premise.  If a poll is 
commissioned by public money, then there should be public access. 
It is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has also made the good point that if a political 
party commissions a poll, that is private.  If private money is 
being used, then there should not be access to the poll. However, 
when taxpayer money is being used to commission a poll, then 
surely the public has the right to ask for the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear about accountable government.  We hear it 
particularly during election time.  This government, which is 
supposedly accountable, is doing all that it can to suppress not 
only access to information regarding polling but also access to 
information in many other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key issue here is manipulation.  When the finance minister 
can stall for months and months and suppress information obtained 
from a poll, that is manipulation.  That is what we are trying to 
avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House, regardless of their political stripe, 
must agree that this is wrong.  We want to have free access right 
across the board.  There is nothing clandestine about it.  We are 
asking for open government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of thing is creating cynicism among Canadians.  They 
do not hold this place in esteem.  We as politicians, 
collectively, are on the scale somewhere down below snake oil 
salesman because of public cynicism, and rightfully so in many 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians pay their taxes.  They do not mind paying taxes if 
they know the money is being spent well and if they can find out 
how the money is being spent.  However, we are not allowed to 
discover that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is unwilling to change.  We often hear the prime 
minister talk about moving into the next millennium.  Let us do 
that.  Let us move this House ahead, and the other house for that 
matter, so that we can have a system of government that works for 
Canadians.  It does not work for Canadians when they have one 
hand tied behind their backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only private member's bill respecting access to 
information.  At the latest count there are four.  My colleague 
has presented this bill today.  I have a bill respecting crown 
corporations.  The government also has two bills relating to this 
subject.  On both sides of the House there are concerns regarding

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the comment from the member opposite 
saying that there may be a review.  I think a review of the 
access act is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that access to information is a cornerstone 
of democracy.  If she really believes that, I hope we will open 
it up, not close it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this to be a very good bill.  As such, I would ask for 
the unanimous consent of the House that this bill be deemed 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member from 
Nanaimo—Alberni has asked for unanimous consent to have this 
bill made votable. Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is not 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is customary that the member who moved the bill have a 
further five minutes of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to sum up what we have heard, 
and it is a rather ominous thing that we have heard, we have 
deteriorated even further than we did in the last session into 
looking at the past, thinking we need more big government, more 
government control, less accessibility for the public, less 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 on a similar type of bill a government member stood up 
and said “We are going to open up access to information and we 
are going to reform it and make it better.  It is under review 
within the next 12 months and the justice minister will be coming 
up with new legislation within 12 months”.  That was in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government members have the audacity to stand up and say 
“Some of these things are good and we have to open up 
government.  However, it is under review so we will not support 
anything like this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long can they keep saying that?  Going into the 21st century 
it is still going to be under review.  I trust the Canadian 
public will put them under review very carefully in the year 2001 
or before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks the talk.  Some of the opposition parties 
talk the talk.  It is very interesting that some of the 
opposition parties talk about changes and being accountable to 
people and yet most of their speeches sound like they come out of 
the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not feel we have moved very far.  We have a finance 
minister who conducts a poll, who has his former leadership 
member conduct that poll, a former membership of his team in 
1990, for which hundreds of thousands of dollars of Canadian 
taxpayer money is paid.  There is nothing wrong with that.  He 
then proceeds to keep it secret for 18 months because it was 
politically unwise to put it forward.  There were political 
reasons.  He decides to make it public after his own lawyer said 
he could never win in court.  Mulroney challenged the court and 
lost, and he even had some reasons.  He said the minister is 
going to challenge it and but does not have any reasons at all 
other than political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as a very negative point.  Obviously the government 
is not interested in accessibility and accountability in letting 
the taxpayers know what they are getting for their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, that is the reason we came down here.  We came 
here because we felt the status quo must be changed.  The 
Canadian people feel it must be changed and the debate today has 
further confirmed why we have to change the way this place 
operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper.
