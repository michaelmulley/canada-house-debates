</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 8 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-40, an act respecting extradition, to amend the 
Canada Evidence Act, the Criminal Code, the Immigration Act and 
the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and to amend 
and repeal other Acts in consequence, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
began my presentation yesterday and was interrupted, so I am 
happy to resume my remarks with respect to the position taken by 
the NDP caucus on Bill C-40, the changes to the Extradition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out yesterday, the NDP caucus has some reservations 
and concerns about Bill C-40, but in general we support the 
substance of it.  Today I would like to recap some of the 
concerns and reservations that the NDP has about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are not fully comfortable that the changes to the 
rules of evidence will be thorough enough to satisfy our justice 
critic.  Changes as to who may or may not be excluded from 
testifying is also of some concern.  We are concerned, as well, 
about the lack of clarity with respect to extradition to 
countries where the death penalty still exists. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the primary reservation the NDP caucus has about Bill 
C-40.  We wish the language was much more clear and thorough in 
dealing with this controversial subject.  The Canadian people 
have stated time and again that they do not believe in the death 
penalty.  They think it is barbaric.  They would like to believe 
that we are farther out of the trees than that.  It should be 
made very, very clear that in the case of extraditing criminals 
to a country where the death penalty exists, we do not want to be 
a party to that.  The NDP caucus is not entirely comfortable with 
that wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we even need to review all of the current 
examples of people who were convicted of serious crimes and who 
were later found to be innocent.  If we lived in a country which 
had the death penalty, it could be that certain people would have 
been executed when, given the fullness of time, they would have 
been found to have been innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also very critical of places where this has happened.  In 
the United States a fairly recent example was a man by the name 
of Caryl Chessman.  He was executed in New York state.  Later he 
was found to be fully innocent.  He went to the electric chair 
and he had done absolutely nothing wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even further along these lines is the fact that duality must be 
demonstrated.  That is, the crime for which we are extraditing a 
person to another country must also be considered a crime here. 
That is pretty plain and simple.  The crime has to be considered 
with the same severity in this country as it is in the country we 
are extraditing someone to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should not the same apply to forms of punishment?  It is not 
just the death penalty we are critical of, we are also very 
critical of countries that use cruel and inhumane punishment as 
part of their sentencing, whether it is torture, mutilation or 
anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think that Bill C-40 fully deals with the issue of 
extraditing someone to a country that deals with theft by cutting 
people's hands off.  We would like that to be a lot more firmly 
stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the rule is hard and fast about extradition to countries 
where the death penalty does exist, we are wondering about 
flexibility.  If we have a written agreement with the country 
with whom we have an extradition treaty that they will not 
execute the prisoner, would we then feel comfortable in 
extraditing the prisoner to that country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a specific example along those lines in my own riding 
where a Canadian citizen has been charged with murder in the 
United States.  The grand jury in the United States took only 
eight minutes to indict this person, the evidence being so 
overwhelming that the person was involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is that this person should not go to the United 
States to stand trial because the state of Florida, where this 
incident took place, has the death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the opportunity with Bill C-40 to look into these 
issues so that we will be able to deal with these eventualities 
as they come up.  I will talk more about that case later if time 
permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the existing system is flawed.  It is cumbersome. 
It is time consuming.  It is antiquated.  It is actually based on 
two pieces of legislation from the 1800s:  the Fugitive Offenders 
Act of 1882 and the Extradition Act of 1877.  It is very obvious 
that we needed to review how we deal with this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a recent letter from the Minister of Justice about the 
case I was speaking of.  Even the Minister of Justice is clear, 
given the tone and content of this letter, that she believes the 
process of extradition is slow, tedious and cumbersome.  She 
points out the two stages of extradition in the current system. 
She says that extradition from Canada involves two phases and 
this is one of the reasons it gets to be very cumbersome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first phase, which is often referred to as the judicial 
phase, an extradition judge must determine on the basis of 
affidavit evidence submitted by the requesting state whether the 
conduct in the foreign state would constitute an offence in 
Canada.  There is the duality I was talking about earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We first must satisfy ourselves that the conduct this person 
exhibited in the applicant state would be considered a crime of 
equal magnitude in this state. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the judicial phase that has to be satisfied.  As well, at 
that stage the applicant state has to demonstrate that there is 
sufficient evidence.  In the case that I was talking about, if 
the federal grand jury in the United States indicts, clearly 
there is ample evidence at least that the person should come to 
justice and stand trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phase, and this can even be a more lengthy phase of 
the extradition process, is the executive phase.  That is where 
the Minister of Justice gets involved.  The Minister of Justice 
must decide whether the fugitive should be surrendered to the 
requesting state in accordance with the relevant extradition 
treaty.  This is where it can really bog down and take many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the closing paragraph of her letter to me the Minister of 
Justice tried to give some solace or comfort.  She pointed out 
that the process has in fact speeded up dramatically due to 
changes in 1992 when amendments were made to the extradition 
legislation.  She claimed that this has shortened the extradition 
appeal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that went through in 1992 obviously did not do the 
job.  Six years have gone by since 1992 and the same cases are in 
fact being drawn out.  It is the “justice delayed is justice 
denied” point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the first one to admit that extradition law is a very 
complex body of law.  It involves many players.  We are dealing 
with international politics, we are dealing with criminal law, we 
are dealing with international law, we are dealing with 
conflicting laws, the courts, the federal minister of justice and 
the governor general.  It is a soup of interests that are in 
competition with each other.  Frankly, it is a field day for the 
lawyers who would seek to delay and would use a delay to their 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing extradition laws have been exploited by certain 
individuals.  We should never condone or put in place any kind of 
system where five and seven and even twelve years sometimes is 
the norm for bringing a criminal to justice, especially if there 
is evidence to indicate that at the very least the person should 
stand trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we have to remember, which makes it even more 
complex, is that the Immigration Act comes into it and often 
people get the two blurred:  deportation and extradition.  This 
again is a further complication at the early end of an 
application for extradition.  Often it is possible for 
deportation to take place if a foreign person within our borders 
has done something against our Criminal Code.  Obviously that is 
a matter where the immigration department deports and we do not 
have to extradite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to the case that I was talking about earlier. I 
have a special interest in extradition which should be of great 
concern to all here.  This is the case of a major in the Canadian 
air force who was posted to Florida.  He was murdered.  His name 
was Major David Threinen and he lived in my riding.  David 
Threinen's mother was in my office recently asking if there was 
something we could do to get involved, which led me to write to 
the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that David Threinen's wife, Monique Threinen, and 
her boyfriend at the time are the people who it is felt murdered 
David Threinen.  The boyfriend has now been convicted of first 
degree murder and is sitting in a Florida jail.  From the very 
first moment he has said “It wasn't me who struck the final 
blows, it was Monique Threinen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government intervened on behalf of Monique Threinen 
in the state of Florida.  A very short time after the death of 
her husband the Canadian government, the air force, swept her out 
of the country and returned her to Canada with her two children. 
They paid her the death benefit, which was something like 
$100,000, two years' pay.  They began immediately paying her the 
widow's pension.  She fled the country and the justice system to 
hide out in Canada with this windfall of money that the Canadian 
government paid her and with the $2,000 or $3,000 a month that 
the government is still paying her. 
All those involved and all those close to her from her former 
husband's mother, her former husband's family, to the father of 
her first child from a different marriage have come forward with 
statements to the effect that they want Monique Threinen to go 
back to the United States to stand trial for this murder.  No one 
is trying to prejudge the case.  They only want the judicial 
process to be allowed to follow through its course and for her to 
go to court and prove her innocence or guilt.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the windfall of money she received from the Canadian 
government she hired some of the best lawyers in the province of 
Manitoba.  They are fighting this tooth and nail.  They are 
fighting it with the comfort and confidence that if they use all 
the tricks at their disposal they can drag this out for three, 
five or seven years.  In the meantime this woman who may be 
guilty of murder has the advantage of living in relative comfort 
in Winnipeg, raising her children without allowing her other 
family members to see them.  The grandparents are horrified by 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a clear example why Bill C-40 is attractive to us.  Even 
if we do not think it is perfect, even if we think it is a little 
flawed, we are eager to see the process speeded up and simplified 
to where in a dramatic case like this one no one can hide behind 
the complicated and ponderous steps that must be taken in the 
current situation of extradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other examples where it has gone on far too long. I can 
point out an extradition hearing where the headline was 
“Activists are hot at Allan Rock over murder extradition”. When 
that member was the minister of justice an organization was very 
upset about the case of another person wanted in the State of 
Florida in a drug dealing murder, Edgar Garcia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spent five years in the Don Jail as a guest of the crown 
fighting his extradition even though there was ample evidence 
that he should have gone to stand trial in the other country. The 
real obstacle was that Florida had the death penalty.  I am the 
first one to argue we do not want to send anyone to a country 
where he or she might wind up convicted guilty and executed, 
because as a Canadian people we have decided over and over again 
that is fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the State of Florida was willing to say that if 
that person came back and stood trial it would not go for the 
death penalty.  The state prosecutor in the State of Florida 
agreed that they would not go after the death penalty.  I believe 
the minister was comforted by that to the point where they 
co-operated and eventually sent Mr. Garcia to Florida where he 
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I am glad to say that the NDP caucus can and will 
support Bill C-40 with the reservations I outlined earlier. The 
most glaring concern or reservation is the lack of clarity 
involved in the extradition of criminals to countries where the 
death penalty exists or where other types of cruel and inhuman 
punishment exists. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-40 which 
we will be opposing.  The reason is, as the member previously 
said, that it does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into some of the details on Bill C-40 I want to 
talk a bit about my concerns about the government and its 
legislation dealing with the criminal justice system in itself, 
which encompasses Bill C-40. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was dismayed to learn in my riding that there was another 
attempt to rob the store of a very good friend of mine, Brian Lee 
who owns Lee's Fine Jewellery.  This time it worked. 
Bandits came into his very fine jewellery store, stuck a gun in 
the face of one of his employees and walked off with about 
$100,000 worth of jewellery.  To somebody like Brian that is not 
only devastating but its hurts the store's income.  It hurts the 
confidence of the people in our community.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stand here to express my dismay about situations like 
this one, I go back once again to legislation brought up in the 
House pertaining to criminal justice.  One of them was the gun 
law.  We supposedly have a gun law to do deal with the crime 
problem.  Since the government has brought in the gun law, for 
instance, at least five people have been murdered by guns in my 
riding.  Brian's store was held up by someone with a gun in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five years I have stood in the House time after time to talk 
about criminal justice matters.  Time after time the same things 
recur and recur again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are on Bill C-40 dealing with extradition and I want to 
talk a bit about some of the comments in the press release put 
out by the government in this regard. It says fighting global 
crime is high on Canada's agenda and Canada needs modern 
legislation to succeed.  I could not agree more with that 
statement.  However, when we look at the legislation tabled in 
the House we wonder how it fits with the PR exercise the 
government goes through after it tables something in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another press release the government said that Canadians have 
expressed concerns about Canada's extradition laws; they want to 
prevent their country from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. 
Yes, we do.  I am not a lawyer but I have fought enough criminal 
refugee and immigration cases in the last five years, in fact 
more than anybody in the House.  These comments do not fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that this is a safe haven.  It has 
been a safe haven internationally for criminals.  It will 
continue to be a safe haven internationally for criminals.  It is 
not just extradition as the NDP member previously said.  It has 
to do with deportation although there are differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous member who spoke about deportation indicated that 
it was a little easier to deport than it was to extradite.  I 
assure the House that is not the case.  I have been there and I 
have been through those battles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I have been in and out of refugee hearings and 
deportation hearings so often that I just shake my head when I go 
in because I know what I am going to be dealing with.  Now I have 
managed to have four or five people deported from the country. It 
is a monumental exercise.  I do not think the government 
appreciates what we are dealing with in criminal matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Boujam Aai Inthavong, an individual in my riding, helped murder a 
young man in my community who was 17 years old.  He beat him with 
a bat in front of witnesses.  The guy with Inthavong shot him in 
front of approximately 100 people.  Inthavong ended up in prison 
for three years.  While in prison he applied for refugee status 
and got it inside of 50 minutes.  It took me and people in my 
community a year and half to try to get it overturned.  We had to 
get a ministerial permit.  We had to get the minister to declare 
him a danger to the public.  We forced that on him.  We went 
through appeal after appeal after appeal, fight after fight after 
fight.

had ever deported somebody from this country to Laos.  After all 
that was done, almost two years later he was finally deported. 
The costs involved in that were through legal aid paid for by 
taxpayers.  At one point he had two lawyers fighting me, not a 
lawyer but just an average citizen, all at public cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the unmitigated gall to issue press releases 
like this one stating that it wants to prevent our country from 
becoming a safe haven for fugitives.  I have news for the 
government.  This country is a safe haven for fugitives and it is 
this government's fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little point in trying to impress people by mediocre 
changes in legislation and then hitting the streets with news 
releases.  It does not wash where the problems are, which is in 
the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jose Mendoza, a young man from El Salvador, came to my 
community.  This is not an extradition case but I am trying to 
explain that extradition and deportation are really quite similar 
and the problems are the same.  Jose could have been extradited 
because in one of his hearings he said he was wanted in El 
Salvador.  He used that excuse.  He had 12 criminal convictions 
as a young man between the ages of 17 and 22, including what they 
call today sexual assault but I call rape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, after all of that, he was back out on the streets at age 
22 and raped Tasha, a girl in my community.  The battle started 
for Jose.  I wanted him out of the country.  They agreed and Jose 
Mendoza agreed.  His legal aid lawyer said “If you stay the 
charges Jose will accept deportation”.  Everything is a-okay. 
Tasha said that at least we were rid of him and he would not 
remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shipped him out escorted to El Salvador where he hitch-hiked 
through Guatemala, Mexico, the United States and showed up at the 
Douglas border crossing where he said that he was a refugee. They 
agreed that he was a refugee according to the rules, that he was 
entitled to make a claim as a refugee, and he was in.  After all 
that he was in, so we started the fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very close to beating the refugee claim, with no help 
whatsoever from the government.  We can imagine how Tasha felt. 
The reason we found out that he was back in Canada was that Tasha 
met him at a gas station about eight months later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask sane people listening to these kinds of stories if 
they really think the government is dealing with these kinds of 
issues.  Do they really think that half-baked legislation on 
extradition is working?  Do they really think that appeal after 
appeal after appeal under legal aid is helping our system?  Do 
they really think our deportation rules are helping us? I do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got involved in the refugee claim with Jose Mendoza and tried 
to table his 12 prior convictions including one rape but not 
including Tasha's. 
The refugee board says that it does not consider that.  What it 
considers is the effect the deportation will have on this 
individual if he goes back to El Salvador a second time.  I 
really do not give two hoots about that.

ineffectual.  When it gets down to dealing with these issues in

citizens say “Who is running that nuthouse in Ottawa anyway”.

hearing of somebody who should not be out on the streets, a 
section 745 hearing, the faint hope clause, for a multiple 
murderer who should not be out on the streets.  Do it on a DNA

dangerous offenders, which is such a small minority of those in

a friend of mine in my riding not too long ago.  She had been 
sexually assaulted and her store had been robbed by James 
Armbruster.  Before that he had been in Sumas centre. I call it 
daycare for prisoners; it is called a community correctional 
centre.  There is no DNA attached to this guy.  He was in Sumas 
centre with 63 prior convictions, count them all, 63 prior 
convictions.  He got out and added two more, sexual assault and

by Armbruster who had 63 prior convictions.  It makes one sick to

go through this House with the Liberal majority government.  Then

form will do nothing at all to have a catch-up?  There are 
approximately 18,000 refugees in Canada.  This deportation bill 
will have no effect at all unless there is some screening for 
people coming into this country the same way there has been in 
the past.  We will be no better off with this bill in place in 
getting rid of the large number of people claiming refugee status 
than we were before the passage of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a point of 
clarification.  This bill is about extradition which is removing 
people with criminal records from the country. It is not mutually 
exclusive with deportation. 
One of the things criminals often do is they claim refugee status 
to avoid extradition and deportation.

had a backlog of these cases, the government said “We have such 
a backlog, we cannot deal with it so maybe we should put them all 
on a fast track and bring them in”.  Out go the citizenship 
papers and guess what we are left with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to think that all the speeches from my colleagues 
are going to amount to a lot of difference.  But in this country 
where there is a majority government and the Liberals now have 
their buddies in the Senate, these bills go through. Canadians 
deserve a lot better than this.  They deserve some consideration 
for laws that work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved with a lot of victims rights groups in my

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
in my riding of Peace River, immigration is one of the main areas 
I have to work with as an MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people want to come into this country.  Canada has been 
built on immigration and I think will continue to be built on 
immigration. There are a lot of potential candidates for 
immigration who would make excellent Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side, we saw the Minister for Citizenship and 
Immigration last year let in about 4,500 people on special 
ministerial permits, fast tracking that whole process. Of those 
4,500, something like 1,000 to 1,100 had criminal records 
including charges of murder and rape in their own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that such a terrific amount of people want to come 
and make Canada their home and would make good citizens, what 
does my colleague think of the process of having those special 
ministerial permits?  They essentially bypass the process where 
we should be extraditing those criminals back to their own 
countries to face charges rather than giving them Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I don't think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  One of the Liberals said “I don't think 
so”.  That has been the problem.  They don't think, so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague is right.  So many good people want to come to 
Canada, so why are we slipping in those who in effect are risks 
to our society?  I do not have an answer for that. They have 
criminal records and I think the hon. member opposite would admit 
that.  We know that to be true.  It escapes me, quite frankly. 
Why that attitude? Why can we not select better?  Why can we not 
bring in other people rather than the criminals?  Why can we not 
look at a tougher criteria? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many good people out there whom we want in this 
country and many come in.  But the minority few, the 
approximately 1,100 we talked about here, leave a trail of crime 
behind them. This is serious. Then once they come in under a 
visa, they say “Now I am a refugee.  If you want to get rid of 
me, it is really tough to get me out”, which it is.  I cannot 
understand for the life of me why we go through all the expense 
and time and pain to individuals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I could not resist the temptation to make a comment 
about what has been said regarding the permit system.  I have 
been a member of the House of Commons for about 10 years now and 
I think the immigration system would be in great difficulty, and 
I hope the members opposite would recognize it, if there were not 
a permit system available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is virtually impossible to design an immigration system that 
will cover every single facet of family relationships, business 
relationships and international relationships. There are times 
when the immigration rules simply do not work and look stupid. 
That is not because they were designed to be stupid, it is 
because those rules cannot cover every situation.  That is why 
the permit system is there.  It deals with the very rough edges. 
Every member of parliament in this House has had to deal with 
stupid rules within the system, not designed to be stupid but 
they are stupid because of a real life situation that does not 
fit within the paradigm designed. That is why the permit system 
is there.  That is why it deals with difficult systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to be a member of parliament if there were not 
a permit system that offered a band-aid or a fix to a very 
difficult human situation. Members opposite think that is stupid. 
They think it looks dumb. It would look even dumber if the 
permit system were not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, with all due respect to 
the member, I think he is a little confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the permit system that is the crux of the problem 
here.  Once one comes into this country I would expect there are 
two relatively basic principles: one obeys the laws and 
contributes to the welfare of the country.  If the laws are not 
obeyed in this country one of the greatest difficulties is the 
removal. The removal is part of the problem; appeal after appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an abuse of the legal aid system.  I think the hon. 
member is a lawyer.  I do not know if he has ever been involved 
in this but I have.  I see abuse of that system every single day 
I am involved in it with victims. Lawyers abuse it and the 
individual who should be thrown out of the country abuses it. The 
member should not shake his head.  There is an answer to it. Fix 
the damn system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill 
C-40, an act respecting extradition to amend the Criminal 
Evidence Act, the Criminal Code, the Immigration Act and the 
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act.  It will also 
amend other consequential pieces of legislation and the 
amendments may have some ripple effect throughout the country in 
our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly an honour and somewhat shocking to be speaking on 
two substantial justice bills on two consecutive days.  This is 
probably the first time since I have been elected to parliament 
that we have been debating two justice bills in such close 
proximity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very hopeful and optimistic that this perhaps signals a 
change in priorities from this government.  I am hoping this is a 
sign of good things to come.  Hope burns eternal in that regard. 
I also hope that the justice minister is not going to find 
herself on a flight home this weekend with a Liberal seatmate and 
chat about justice matters in such an open way as her colleague, 
the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In more simple and less partisan terms this legislation 
essentially merges our 100 year old Extradition Act and our 
Fugitive Act into a new and modern Extradition Act.  This is 
following the lead of other countries and the sensible calls from 
many in our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the belief of the parliamentary secretary that the 
objectives of this bill are positive and even noble. Several 
events justify the revision and update of our Extradition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is it 100 years old but it does not deal with modern 
criminality.  Modern criminality involves such things as 
telemarketing fraud and the use of Internet to commit an offence 
in another jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly we have seen a great rise in this type of criminal 
activity in Canada of late.  These technological realities draw 
attention to just how outdated this legislation has become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present act is not flexible enough to accommodate changes 
arising from within the globalization of criminal activity such 
as drug trade, organized and transborder crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime has reached crisis levels in this country.  This 
under a Liberal government comes according to a very reliable 
source, mainly the police and security officers who are daily 
forced to deal with this type of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hope is that this type of legislation will certainly be a 
step in the right direction and will certainly help stem this 
rising tide of criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Extradition Act was last amended in 1991 by the former 
Progressive Conservative government.  Bill C-31 considerably 
reduced delays in extradition cases and at that time groups 
within the law enforcement community and security intelligence 
agencies were already requesting a large overhaul of the entire 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Conservative government also passed the Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Matters Act which also becomes the subject 
of this debate today.  The Conservative government's legislation, 
however, enabled Canada to co-operate more effectively with other 
countries in the investigation and prosecution of transnational 
and international crimes such as acts of terrorism, drug 
smuggling and money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, as I mention this the U.S. State Department's most recent 
“International Narcotics Control Strategy Report” listed Canada 
as one of the most attractive locations for laundering illegal 
cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has let our country fall into this 
category and it is mentioned in the same breath as Brazil and the 
Cayman Islands.  This is not a glowing reference that comes from 
our international best trading partner, the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 does propose changes to merge the Extradition Act and 
the Fugitive Offenders Act and this new act would allow Canada to 
meet its international obligations since it would allow 
extradition to international criminal courts and tribunals, 
including war crimes tribunals. A person would therefore be 
extradited if the act committed is considered a crime in Canada 
and in that state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Requirements for some form of evidence would then become more 
flexible and this would bring Canada's extradition procedures and 
practices closer or more in line with those of other countries. 
It raises the level of co-operation and of course we always have 
expected a high level of co-operation from our trading partner 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government hopes it would prevent fugitives from considering 
Canada as a safe haven and avoiding having to come to grips or to 
face justice within their own country or within Canada depending 
on where the crime had been committed. This new act also retains 
the Progressive Conservative amendment to Bill C-31 to maintain 
an effective extradition process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have continually expressed concerns about our 
extradition laws and they want to prevent their country from 
becoming this so-called safe haven for fugitives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years several high profile cases such as 
Ng, Kindler, Maersk <I>Dubai</I>, which occurred on the high seas 
and resulted in arrests in the Port of Halifax, and the Narita 
airport bombing have caused a raised consciousness of some of the 
shortcomings of the current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there have been numerous concerns expressed by our 
extradition partners at the international level and this again 
demonstrates the need for reform and modernization of this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed I was pleased to add my name to the many Canadians who 
objected this summer to the scheduled deportation of those 
involved in the Maersk <I>Dubai</I> as witnesses and crew members. 
New Brunswick Conservative Senator Erminie Cohen played a key 
role in soliciting support for those brave men who had the 
courage to come forward and report to authorities the atrocities 
that occurred on the high seas. 
I publicly commend her for her efforts in that regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other major concerns with this current legislation is 
that Canada requires countries requesting extradition of a 
fugitive to submit their request according to a fairly narrow 
approach to what is acceptable evidence.  This creates real 
difficulty especially for countries working within a civil law 
system. They are forced to rely on facts and accept a wider 
variety in terms of the type of evidence that will be admissible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other concerns include that difficulty for Canada to meet its 
international obligations to the international criminal courts or 
tribunals as Canada cannot extradite a fugitive to such a body 
under the present regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When extradition legislation was adopted in Canada over 100 
years ago many forms of telecommunication we now know did not 
exist, nor did airplanes.  The current legislation is silent on 
some of these newer types of crimes such as telemarketing fraud, 
theft of information by computer, use of the Internet to commit 
an offence in another jurisdiction. It is inflexible in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increasing mobility of individuals is a reality that did not 
exist. This again makes it difficult for effective extradition 
relations with our international partners and again highlights 
the critical need for changes in this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a comprehensive review and consultation with many of 
our partners, the Extradition Act and the Fugitive Offenders Act 
required many major changes to reflect these modern procedures 
and practices. This bill tabled by the Liberal government would 
provide a single act that exemplifies the extradition process in 
Canada for our partners who wish to extradite a fugitive from 
Canada to their country or reciprocally for Canada to bring 
fugitives back to this country to face justice here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time this will would also provide enhanced 
protection and safeguards for persons who are the subject of an 
extradition request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well known maxim that we do not take our charter rights 
outside of Canada.  But this does set up certain guidelines that 
will ensure that Canadian rights are protected both within and 
outside our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposed legislation would bring the extradition process 
into the 20th century and certainly make it more accessible to 
foreign states, bringing our extradition procedures and practices 
closer to those of other countries and, more important, prevent 
Canada from becoming a safe have for fugitives who want to avoid 
facing the full brunt of the law in countries where they commit 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of the legislation that is neglectful and where there 
is a common theme is that of financing. The government passes law 
apparently without any appreciation of the cost.  Most recently 
we have seen pronouncements from the solicitor general with 
respect to organized crime.  His tough talk on organized crime is 
resonated throughout the policing community.  Yet at the same 
time we learn from the auditor general that $74 million has been 
cut from the RCMP organized crime budget for this fiscal year, a 
very apparent and shocking contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government passed Bill C-68 and will no longer deny 
that the implementation cost is now in the range of $350 million 
when the former justice minister told us at the time that the 
cost would be $85 million.  Some estimates place the eventual 
cost at somewhere in the range of $.5 billion to $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we are now discussing two bills sponsored by the Minister of 
Justice.  Yet there remains a shortfall of over $200 million in 
the national policing services.  Since 1993 CSIS has lost more 
than 20% of its employees and its operating budget again is in 
decline.  No matter how well intentioned this legislation, how 
does the government expect its law enforcement agencies to 
enforce this type of law without adequate resources for front 
line policing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the police soldier on.  I have had the pleasure of working 
with many police in our country, officers like Kevin Scott—

favour of an elected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a quote:  “The Liberal government in two years will 
make the Senate elected.  As Prime Minister I can make that 
happen. ” That was the person who is now the Prime Minister 
making a speech in Alberta in October 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another quotation from this influential voice:  “To 
meet the hopes and dreams of those who live in the west and the 
Atlantic, a reformed Senate is essential.  It must be a Senate 
that is elected, effective and equitable”.  I am quoting the 
Prime Minister of the country who said those words right here in 
the House of Commons on September 24, 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister now argue against an elected Senate? 
If his words in the past meant anything, he should now be working 
hard to achieve these reforms.  He is powerful and influential. 
Albertans are getting sick and tired of his continual excuse 
making.  Let him get on with the job and do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
week the solicitor general publicly discussed a business 
relationship between Elmer MacKay and Karlheinz Schreiber of 
Airbus fame, something no one in the country knew about.  Not 
even Mr. MacKay's son.  Not even Mr. Schreiber's lawyer in 
Edmonton.  There is only one way that the solicitor general could 
have known about this relationship, and that is because of an 
ongoing RCMP investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is in.  The solicitor general publicly compromised an 
ongoing RCMP investigation.  Will the government do the right 
thing?  Will the government ask for his resignation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the operational activities of the RCMP are clearly under 
the purview of the RCMP.  I do not involve myself in those 
operations.  I would not know about those operations.  I would 
not discuss those operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegations that were made earlier this week, I responded to 
those.  My response has been supported.  The rest of that 
conversation was a private conversation between myself and 
another Canadian citizen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is a very serious and new charge against the solicitor 
general.  There is no spin. There is no interpretation.  There is 
no excuse for what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general publicly commented upon and has now 
jeopardized an ongoing RCMP investigation.  The only reason the 
solicitor general had this information was because he was trusted 
with this information by the RCMP, and he has broken that trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government do the right thing and ask for the solicitor 
general's immediate resignation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question is 
unwarranted, as explained by the solicitor general.  Therefore 
the direct answer to the hon. member's question is no. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is hard to believe.  I do not know what it takes for the 
government to see wrong when it is staring it in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general knew of a business relationship between 
Karlheinz Schreiber and Elmer MacKay.  Now the only way he knew 
that information was because he was trusted with that information 
by the RCMP.  Then the solicitor general spoke publicly about 
confidential information given to him in trust by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it take?  He has to go.  Demand his resignation.  What 
does it take? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I said categorically, and I will say it again, 
information that is acquired in an operational exercise by the 
RCMP or any agency is not information that I am privy to.  It is 
not information that I am involved with.  I would not know it. If 
I did know it I would not talk about it.

this was not a private conversation, now, was it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general's loose lips let a closely guarded secret 
slip, basically a business relationship uncovered in the ongoing 
Airbus investigation that no one else in the country knew about. 
No one else, with the exception of the RCMP.

resignation, just what is?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

remains that the internal operations of the RCMP are the purview 
of the RCMP.  I would not involve myself.  I would not know about 
it.

question is for the Solicitor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the member for Palliser swore under oath in the House 
that he was telling the truth about the Solicitor General's 
remarks he heard on the airplane.  He even challenged the 
Solicitor General to prove otherwise, but the minister ducked 
the issue once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Solicitor General refusing to rise in the House and 
swear under oath that he is telling the truth, the whole truth 
and nothing but the truth?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Palliser did not swear a formal oath in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like members to take a look at yesterday's Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> in which reporters replicated the situation that is 
the matter of controversy.  They said:

each other and spoke sporadically, “but much of their discourse

leading to this controversy in the House.  I suggest hon. members

something very serious has just happened in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Solicitor General is rising in his place and refusing to 
swear an oath.  He is taking cover behind a completely 
insignificant alibi.  He would therefore be unable to swear an 
oath outside the House if called upon to do so, as the member 
for Palliser has promised to do if asked.

I too have a question for the Solicitor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's entire defence is based on the letter from his 
Liberal friend, Frederick D. Toole.  We know that this 
individual has contributed to the Liberal Party coffers, as has 
his law firm, which has received several government contracts. 
The very least that can be said is that, when he signed his 
letter to the minister, Mr. Toole found himself in an extremely 
awkward situation.

for to resign?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the credibility of the person sitting beside me was the fact that 
he was sitting beside me and not an aisle and a half away.

<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on the one hand, we have a valueless letter, which does not say 
what the minister would like it to and, on the other, we have 
the honour of a member who rises in his place and swears he told 
the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister agree that, if his only defence is that the 
letter proves him right, then he does not have a leg to stand on 
and should resign? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Quite the contrary, Mr. Speaker.  The questions all week have 
been based on the notes that were taken by an eavesdropper in a 
noisy aircraft a seat and a half away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a tactic unfamiliar to Canadians and one that 
Canadians will reject. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the revelation about the relationship between Karlheinz Schreiber 
and Elmer MacKay is something that could not have been known by 
anybody else and was not known by anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It not only points out the impropriety of the solicitor 
general's actions but the fact that the notes taken by the member 
for Palliser are accurate.  No one has accused him of being 
psychic.  He could not have pulled this out of thin air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this points to the fact that the solicitor 
general was talking in the way that the member for Palliser said 
he was.  He committed another indiscretion and he should resign. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I have said, I would not be involved in an 
operational activity in the RCMP.  I would not be aware of that 
information.  I was not aware of that information as it relates 
to any particular investigation.  That is the fact. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  Does he 
not see that this latest revelation points to the complete 
veracity of what the member for Palliser has said and that this 
is cause for the government to ask for the resignation of the 
solicitor general? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he is at it, will he tell us why the Prime Minister is 
unteachable and keeps making jokes about Canadian students 
getting pepper sprayed when he should know better?  He should not 
have done that in the first place the first time, never mind the 
second time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

opposition keep making allegations that in effect amount to 
prejudging the outcome of the inquiry?  Why do they not answer 
that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last night on CBC radio the executive director of 
the New Brunswick Liberal Party said that the solicitor general 
told him that PM referred to in the RCMP officer's notes was the 
Prime Minister and that PMO referred to the Prime Minister's 
Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is further proof that the solicitor general discussed a 
sensitive matter with political pals.  His reference to Hughie 
can be no other person but Hughie Stewart, the APEC fall guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  When will the 
government show some respect for this institution and demand the 
solicitor general's resignation?  The verdict is in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

prejudging the whole matter.  He says that the verdict is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the fairness?  Where is the justice?  Where is the 
equity?  He is completely lacking in those qualities and he 
should recognize it.  On that the verdict is in.

Mr. Speaker, that is quite a statement from a man so intricately 
involved in the Airbus investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another day, another detail is confirmed from the notes of the 
member for Palliser.  The member for Palliser has pledged to 
swear an oath on his version of events on Thursday's Air Canada 
flight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I moved a motion in the justice committee to summons 
the member for Palliser, the solicitor general and Fred Toole to 
testify under oath on what was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the solicitor general show the same courage and integrity 
as the member for Palliser and testify under oath at the justice 
committee?  Or, will he submit to a lie detector test? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would like the hon. member to withdraw the 
last statement about a lie detector test.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what a difference a few years makes.  Let me quote a 
former Prime Minister who was Leader of the Opposition at the 
time.  Turner said “The government's vigorous defence of the 
embattled minister made a mockery of public ethics.  A minister 
has a duty and a burden of proof to show that what he is doing is 
beyond reproach”.  The Liberal leader also said “This is a 
question of ethics, a question of honesty and is a question of 
deportment in public affairs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the Deputy Prime Minister, has his government changed 
its standards from when it was in opposition?  Why have the 
Liberals changed their standards?  Why will—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why has the hon. member changed his standards from when 
he was a Conservative member?  At that time he supported strongly 
the public complaints commission.  Now he is raising questions 
about its use, veracity and value.  Why has he changed his 
standards?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this has nothing to do with the former Conservative

deals with the ethics of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the member for Hamilton West when he was in 
opposition and told a news conference that Charest should resign 
regardless of whether he intended to interfere with the court 
process.  It is a matter of public ethics.  It is a matter of 
parliamentary ethics. The minister has damaged the parliamentary 
system.  He should resign until this case is settled.  The Deputy 
Prime Minister knows this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know why the government is still defending 
him.  Will he phone the Prime Minister in Winnipeg, get him away

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

One thing is sure: the Solicitor General is an unrepentant 
chatterbox and his chattering is incompatible with his duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The little credibility left to the RCMP commission of inquiry is 
lost because of the actions of the Solicitor General.  If he 
wants the commission to regain its credibility, why does he not 
resign?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
erroneous allegations of the member and the other members of the

if in fact it is being undermined.  I think they are totally 
wrong to ask such questions.  Are they trying to undermine the 
commission's credibility?  I hope not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Deputy 
Prime Minister has to answer for the Solicitor General because 
he knows that the Solicitor General's credibility is undermined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Solicitor General is also responsible for the RCMP.  Now, 
because of his chattiness, the relationship of trust between the 
Solicitor General and the RCMP is broken.  In any case, since

not resign?

after the Thanksgiving break we will be back on this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question today is for the agriculture minister.  There is a 
growing farm crisis in western Canada. In 1997 farm incomes have 
dropped by over an average of 50%. The net income stabilization 
account would help some farmers but it will not help most of the 
farmers.

just suggested.  Commodity prices are reaching lows something 
like the ones 30 years ago.  At the same time the European Union

have a very solid safety net plan in the industry at the present 
time.  We are working with the industry to improve that as time 
goes on.  I look forward to that co-operation in the industry,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers are probably the only farmers in the world who 
have a net income stabilization account in which they can 
participate.  I encourage those who have not already participated 
in it to do so. It is a management tool that is contributed to 
not only by the individual producer, but by the provincial and 
the federal governments in order to assist and to take out some 
of the difficulty in the unfortunate times we are in right now of 
low commodity prices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of near record low prices, this government continues 
to increase farmers' costs through agencies such as the Canadian 
Grain Commission and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians benefit from the services of those agencies.  Will

</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 26, 435 employees of Air Atlantic in St. John's and

the minister states in his waiver that whereas the minister is

Speaker, I move that the second report of the Standing Committee

April 2, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interim report on the west coast of Canada concerning 
fisheries management issues which was tabled in the House on 
April 2, 1998. The government's response was tabled in the House 
on September 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 
is letting down the west coast big time.  Earlier this week I 
spoke about how the issue of foreign fishing on the east coast 
has totally compromised the ability of fisheries managers to 
properly look after Canadian interests and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west coast the introduction of the aboriginal fisheries 
strategy pilot sales program in 1992 has compromised the ability 
of DFO to manage the fisheries resource in order to optimize 
social and economic benefits of the resource and to balance 
necessary conservation measures.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk more on this subject later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first five recommendations of the interim report deal with 
transition programs for displaced fishermen, salmon licences and 
gear buyback.  Since the tabling of this document in April we 
have seen a $400 million promise announced on June 19 by the 
minister with regard to those types of programs. None of this 
money has shown up to date.  The minister claims that $20 million 
has been expended.  But if so, where? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The salmon fishing community had a terrible season.  Many people 
are in desperate straits and still they wait.  Successful 
programs such as the North Island fisheries initiative are 
waiting for funding.  Human Resources Development Canada program 
managers are concerned because anticipated funds from the $400 
million program have not arrived and still they wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has already announced the details of the east coast 
buyback program while no announcement has been made on the west 
coast.  Still they wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fisheries committee travelled to 11 coastal communities in 
British Columbia.  The committee held hearings and tabled a set 
of practical recommendations.  The minister accepted two.  He 
maintains staffing at British Columbia light stations that had 
not already been destaffed three days before the Port 
Moody-Coquitlam byelection, knowing the committee recommendation 
was the people's choice and knowing the byelection race was 
close. The other they bought into was the implementation of a 
voluntary salmon licence holiday for 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In virtually every other aspect of the report the bureaucratic 
response to the report essentially maintains the status quo or 
pays lip service to the recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New fishery opportunities are stonewalled by DFO.  The west 
coast is loosing new fisheries jobs because of the lack of 
biological and advocacy staff at DFO and a prevailing attitude 
that it is much easier to say no than to say yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO is costing British Columbia thousands of jobs by choking the 
acquaculture industry in red tape and inertia.  Although it is the 
lead agency, DFO has allowed competing jurisdictions and 
bureaucracies in the Department of the Environment and the Canada 
Food Inspection Agency with its policies to inhibit existing 
growers and it has stymied significant new investment through red 
tape and lack of advocacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a big budget acquaculture commission in Ottawa is 
not the answer.  What is needed is a clear progressive mandate 
and a budget for more biologists to vet project proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from private investors who either had 
already or were prepared to invest their money in labour 
intensive aquaculture only to see their hopes and dreams dashed 
on the bureaucratic rocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read into the record a portion of a letter I 
received from one of the people who appeared before the committee 
as an aquaculture proponent: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view you could raise up Jesus Christ himself and put Him 
in charge of making abalone farming a reality in Canada, and He 
wouldn't get any further than us mortals.  The civil service runs 
this country to a much greater extent than they should; even the 
courts have more to say about the direction things will head than 
our elected representatives in the capital. Don't waste any time 
on this issue, John.  It's a non-starter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how great the cynicism has gone.  This is from someone 
who has spent years trying to deal with the bureaucracy and 
invested a lot of time and a lot of money.  The jury is still out 
on whether DFO is serious about some of the other recommendations 
such as the crushingly expensive and excessive at sea observer 
requirement for the groundfish trawl industry on the west coast. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no movement at all on the beam trawl monitoring 
program which is also crushing that industry.  In the hake 
fishery the department failed the community of Ucluelet which 
invested $7 million to upgrade its water system.  This tiny 
community of 1,800 people was able to attract private investment 
for onshore hake processing only to be excluded from meaningful 
consultation when DFO changed the rules to reduce the portion of 
the catch which would be directed to the community at great cost 
and with lost jobs. The government makes no apologies, pays lip 
service and carries on as before.  The callousness is insidious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same can be said regarding recommendation 12 of the report. 
It deals with maintenance of drainage ditches in agricultural 
lands in the Fraser Valley and other B.C. jurisdictions.  Once 
again the department initiated major changes in 1997 without 
consultation.  That added red tape and bureaucracy.  It ignored 
successful protocols that had been developed over decades between 
farmers, municipalities, the provincial government and DFO.  It 
added immensely to costs and derailed normal ditch maintenance. 
It imposed burdens on private lands, the equivalent of 
expropriation without compensation, and it totally frustrated 
municipal and provincial jurisdictions. The government's response 
ignored our recommendation to revert to pre-1997 protocol and to 
develop a dispute resolution mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While DFO is expending huge resources on this counterproductive 
program, it can find no new resources to fill the shortfall in 
field supervision of major projects affecting fish habitat in a 
major way.  I will give the example of the Vancouver Island 
highway project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this all mean?  I will go back to the aboriginal 
fisheries strategy, the AFS.  DFO, the minister and the 
government continue to defend AFS pilot sales program despite 
continued and growing opposition.  It is no surprise that the 
latest initiative opposed to the AFS comes from band members 
themselves. Natives from Campbell River, Port Alberni and Alert 
Bay gathered in Victoria a few weeks ago to protest what they 
called damaging pilot sales under this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commercial fishermen both native and non-native are against this 
program.  They want the minister to stop reallocating their 
livelihood.  They claim that illegal sales of salmon resulting 
from unmanageable pilot sales are completely out of control. But 
the minister does not want to hear this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of viewers I should explain that there are two 
aboriginal fisheries.  There is a fishery for food, ceremonial 
and social purposes which no one objects to.  This is based on 
aboriginal rights.  It is constitutionally protected and no one 
has a problem with it.  It is basically designed in most cases as 
a food fishery.  The department has set up a racially segregated, 
separate commercial fishery based on racial lines under the AFS 
pilot sales program.  That is where we have the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about a case in point.  At the start of the season 
DFO indicated that it would allow a catch of 300 sockeye salmon 
in the Sto:lo area on the Fraser River. 
These are fish to be used by the Sto:lo people for food, social 
and ceremonial purposes.  What actually occurred, according to 
DFO statistics, is that the actual Sto:lo harvest up to September 
18 of this year equalled 324,000 fish. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a Sto:lo population of 6,000, this equals 341 pounds of 
salmon for every man, woman and child.  This is far in excess of 
legitimate requirements for food, social and ceremonial purposes 
and is an encouragement, an enticement, for illegal sales, in 
particular when we think that half of the Sto:lo population does 
not live anywhere near the Sto:lo communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO also states that it is concerned about any illegal activity, 
meaning the selling of fish not being used for food or ceremonial 
purposes.  However it proposes to merely consult about this 
activity and so far consultation means “do nothing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO also states that it cannot assume that food levels have been 
achieved as a result of the action of some individuals.  This 
means that in spite of allowing more than 300,000 food fish to be 
caught, DFO is not confident that there are enough of these fish 
being used for food.  In other words, DFO is assuming that most 
of these fish are going to be sold illegally by a few people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of control by DFO over the AFS pilot sales program is 
appalling.  The all-Canadian commercial sector, which consists of 
native and non-native fishermen, has since implementation of the 
AFS pilot sales program in 1992 seen its share of the catch 
shrink.  It has gone from what averaged more than 90% of the 
Fraser sockeye harvest to as low as 50%.  More boats are on the 
river and DFO conservation goals have become impossible to manage 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This racially segregated fishery is beginning to be exposed for 
what it is.  What did native commercial fisher Gerald Roberts 
from the Campbell River Band say in Victoria last month? “We 
cannot survive with pilot sales programs continuing to destroy 
our lives.  This aspect of the AFS is wrong, divisive and 
destructive.  Minister Anderson must take a serious look at the 
industrial solution”.  I could not have said it better myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say:  “Not only do the pilot sales programs 
threaten the management of the salmon resource, they are also 
crippling the businesses and families who cannot access available 
harvest”.  That says it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must end the illegal and divisive aboriginal-only 
commercial fishery on the west coast to bring order out of chaos. 
If the minister wants to encourage aboriginal fishing, DFO can 
increase the 30% current aboriginal participation rate in the 
all-Canadian commercial fishing industry by providing grants and 
loans to aboriginal people to buy existing commercial fishing 
boats and licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee opposes allowing the minister to have 
discretionary powers such as those proposed in the new fisheries 
act which died before passage in the last parliament, which, by 
the way, would enable the minister to do what he wanted on this 
aboriginal file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should not be given wide discretionary power on 
grants to the fisheries.  The principle of public right of access 
to the fishery must be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have finished on that subject.  I am now going to talk about 
the Canadian coast guard on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is presiding over a disaster. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four major coast guard radio stations on the west 
coast to monitor and control large traffic, to respond to 
distress calls and to provide weather information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comox station is currently two staff members short of the 
minimum required, Tofino is four or five short, Prince Rupert is 
four short and Vancouver is ten short.  It is a disgrace.  There 
does not appear to be any commitment to replace workers as they 
leave.  Since there is a high attrition level, the situation will 
only get worse until something is done to remedy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has the largest coastline of Canada, the most 
shipping and it is operational year-round.  While the federal 
government has designated the workers at the communication 
stations as essential workers, DFO has been unwilling to maintain 
staffing at essential levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budgetary shortfalls are compromising the safety of marine 
traffic.  Operational minimum standards are not being met.  When 
serious conditions have been brought to the attention of DFO, 
some band-aid money is found for temporary solutions.  However, 
there are no long term, systemic changes being implemented and 
they are required for marine safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to the minister written just two weeks ago the 
chairman of the Campbell River Local Marine Advisory Council 
advised that the reduction or elimination of the 24-hour weather 
service which is being proposed “could pose a serious safety 
hazard to all mariners on the B.C. coast”.  This advisory 
council has worked for the past three years to assist the coast 
guard.  The chairman says “To my knowledge, none of these 
suggestions has been acted upon”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very board was encouraged and set up by the coast guard in 
order to make it more responsive to community needs.  Three years 
later the proof is in the pudding and cynicism grows.  DFO pays 
lip service to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that will change the current situation is 
political leadership.  That is what we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amalgamation of the coast guard with DFO has been, on the 
west coast, a major hardship to the coast guard.  Coast guard 
interests have been submerged by DFO interests.  The west coast 
is much worse off now.  The Reform solution is to put the coast 
guard and the Department of National Defence together.  This 
concept is gaining much currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to be a member of the standing committee that 
produced this report.  I believe that the committee filled a very 
important role among fishermen since DFO is extremely poor at 
dispute resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low level disagreements get elevated to a political level almost 
immediately because no simple protocol exists.  This leads to 
simmering and unresolved disputes.  DFO must implement systemic 
change in its organization.  It must have an organization capable 
of delegating authority so that it does not become a political 
exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely disappointing that the government is not paying 
more credence to the committee report.  DFO needs all the help it 
can get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fisheries are forever, while ministers and even bureaucrats are 
temporary.  The department needs a minister who has vision and is 
not captive of the bureaucracy.  The current minister may have 
some vision, but he is completely captured by his bureaucracy on 
most of the major issues and it is getting very late in the day 
to break this mould. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not achieve the changes we need until we move most of 
the entrenched senior bureaucracy out of Ottawa, end the command 
and control management style and create accountability for 
results within the bureaucracy.

member of parliament for Cariboo—Chilcotin to come to understand 
what a large part this part of the province plays in the fishing 
industry and in the replenishment of fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first concerns I had was when fisheries decided to 
close down a fish hatchery at a little place called Likely, a 
fish hatchery on the Quesnel River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some dozen years or more ago this hatchery was built, at 
considerable expense, to enhance the chinook stocks.  These are 
large salmon that come up the Fraser and Quesnel rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of this is that fisheries decided this was no longer 
an economically feasible project and so, after diminishing the 
results of this, cutting back the two million fish that were 
supposed to come out to 200,000 or less, they decided to close 
the hatchery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the community of Likely are today sustaining that 
200,000 a year level of fish spawning and entry into the river at 
their own expense.  They capture the fish, they strip the eggs, 
they nourish and feed the young salmon as they are growing and 
they open the gates and let them go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the federal government contributing to this?  Absolutely 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about another fishing system in the 
Horsefly River.  Last year fisheries failed to even open the 
spawning channels for the sockeye salmon.  The people wrote to 
the minister of fisheries about this and the response was that 
they did not need those fish stocks.  In the face of the decline 
that we hear about this year, they were told they did not need 
the fish.  Those salmon were practically crawling up the banks 
looking for a place to lay their eggs.  It was so bad that the 
spawning grounds were being destroyed by the fish that needed 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Cariboo—Chilcotin the fisheries department has badly 
mismanaged its project of enhancing fish stocks and keeping them 
at a sustainable level.  One of the frequent complaints I get 
from my constituents concerns the destruction of fisheries and 
the lack of attention that is needed to sustain the stocks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the member for Vancouver Island North and the Reform 
member indicated, there is serious trouble happening within DFO 
and its management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they are aware, we have had 16 ministers in the last seven 
years and most of them have used that portfolio as a revolving 
door to move somewhere else.  They do all the damage they can do 
and then they try to destroy another department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given what is going on now with the fisheries crisis on all 
three coasts and in our inland waters, does he not think it is a 
good idea that the current Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
resign? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have not had a lot of 
co-operation from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
He certainly has shown no credibility in his administration of 
the department in the part of the country where I live.  It goes 
beyond the lack of caring for fish stocks to the way that other 
people using the rivers are being troubled.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-40, an 
act respecting extradition, to amend the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Criminal Code, the Immigration Act and the Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and to amend and repeal other 
acts in consequence, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has nine minutes remaining in his 
allotted time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to conclude my remarks 
with respect to Bill C-40 which, as I mentioned at the outset, 
the Progressive Conservative Party is supporting in principle.  I 
was at a point in my remarks where I was generally referring to 
the lack of resources that the Liberal government has committed 
to frontline police services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to get into a rant on that particular subject, obviously 
there is a bit of contradiction when we see legislation brought 
forward that is aimed at improving the criminal justice system 
without a doubt.  I do not in anyway castigate the government for 
its intent behind the legislation, but we have seen contradictory 
statements with respect to its true commitment to the issue of 
justice, in particular to the issue of resources for frontline 
police officers who are inevitably tasked with the extremely 
important role of protecting Canadians in an effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those brave men and women are constantly faced with high public 
expectations, the need to fight an ever increasing and 
complicated criminal element that exists and is growing out 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time they are loosing confidence that those who are 
responsible, we in the House and particularly the government who 
give them the necessary tools to carry out that important task, 
are not behind them.  It is demonstrable when they see 
significant cuts to their budget like, as I previously mentioned, 
the $74 million slashing of the RCMP crime budget.  These figures 
are not imaginary by any stretch of the imagination.  They come 
from the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is Canada's top accountant and the person 
charged with the crucial task of bringing forward the figures. 
One would hope, in light of the recent track record of the 
government, that we will not see the auditor general fired for 
being truthful in his statement and recitation of facts when it 
comes to the numbers and the budgets of particular departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a very brief moment in my remarks to pay special 
tribute to the law enforcement agencies, the fire services, the 
emergency response teams, those involved in the clean up and the 
initial rescue attempts at the crash site of Swissair Flight 111 
near Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia.  This week those individuals were 
given a very sad and in many ways gruesome task of cleaning up 
the wreckage on that site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals from my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
have been engaged in that exercise.  They have been in the hangar 
going over material and remnants of the crash.  They are engaged 
in this very heart-wrenching exercise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the quality of mercy has not been strained for all of 
those who have given up their time and their effort to take part 
in the aftermath of this very tragic event.  Individuals such as 
Constable Kevin Scott and Reverend Matheson of the town of New 
Glasgow and many others who, like the law enforcement agents 
themselves, are doing their very best at times with limited 
support and resources.  They are doing their very best with their 
hearts, hands and minds.  I certainly want to recognize that 
effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to giving my support to Bill C-40 and partaking 
in the scrutiny that will take place at the justice committee.  I 
reiterate the hope I expressed earlier in my remarks.  The 
government indicates a greater willingness to allow opposition 
amendments to improve legislation.  That was articulated by the 
parliamentary secretary in her remarks on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the PC Party I express support for the particular 
piece of legislation.  It is a positive initiative, but there are 
certainly more questions that will have to be addressed at the 
justice committee.  I hope a spirit of non-partisanship is now 
permeating the government benches when it comes to fundamental 
issues of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other private member's bills are coming forward by government 
members and opposition members alike, important legislative 
initiatives and changes such as changes to the consecutive 
sentencing provisions that currently exist in the Criminal Code. 
I again look forward to and anxiously anticipate the opportunity 
to partake in that debate both at the justice committee and in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks with well wishes to you, Mr. Speaker, 
and to all for a happy Thanksgiving weekend. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak to the bill which deals with profound issues of justice 
and jurisdiction.  We would all like to see Canada not used as a 
haven for criminal acts and we oppose other countries or other 
places being used as havens for criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous times we have talked in the House—not only myself, not 
only the opposition, but the government across the way—about the 
need for a fair process.  The member for Edmonton West has stated 
that “Canada needs modern legislation to succeed”.  She went on 
to add “laws over 100 years old no longer allow us to deal 
with” and then went on to describe the problems with the status 
quo.  We need some change with regard to the issues of justice 
and jurisdiction, and I think it is good that she recognized 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calgarians and Albertans know this issue only too well.  I think 
back to the issue of Charles Ng where there were serious concerns 
with regard to justice and jurisdiction.  I could list off 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the meat of my debate I would like to have 
consent of the House to table 7,000 petitions that I have with me 
which deal with the issues of justice and jurisdiction so that 
all members can look through them to see what real Canadians feel 
about the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have unanimous 
consent of the House to table these petitions?  Are these 
uncertified petitions or is the member asking for leave to revert 
to petitions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It appears there is no consent in any 
event, but the hon. member may wish to clarify that point.  If 
they have been certified he can table them the next time we are 
dealing with petitions on our first sitting day back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately a lot of them 
are in the form of letters, e-mails and faxes and as a result are 
not in formal petition form.  Therefore it would be much easier 
to submit them this way with unanimous consent of the House than 
go through the process through the Clerk.  Can the question be 
now put? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have unanimous 
consent of the House to table these petitions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid there is no consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is unfortunate.  I had 
hoped these people from Alberta would have had the chance to have 
their views heard in the House.  The people of Alberta would like 
the opportunity to submit the petitions, to have them recognized 
and to have their voices heard.  That is only fair. 
They took the time to write down their names, to send in faxes 
and to compose e-mails.  They took the time to make the phone 
calls and do everything.  To have them denied the ability to 
have the rest of the members of the House take a look at these 
petitions and peruse through them is a real denial of the 
fundamental justice.  Is this what we have to put up with while 
we are in Ottawa?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about how we obtained these petitions. 
They were given to us by Dave Rutherford on behalf of the people 
of Alberta.  Many of the responses are from clip-outs that ran in 
the Calgary and <I>Sun</I> newspapers.  There are many different 
forms of the petition but I would like to read briefly what a few 
of them have to say.  They are addressed to the Prime Minister. 
They say on behalf of these people who have written in that they 
demand that the Prime Minister and his government respect the 
will of Albertans for choosing their own senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty simple, straightforward request and it speaks 
to the issue of jurisdiction and justice because we have 
jurisdictions across the country.  We have 10 different provinces 
and two territories and they believe they should have fundamental 
justice and have the ability to choose for themselves who 
represents them in the other place.  They are being denied that 
today because these petitions are not allowed to be presented. 
We were denied unanimous consent to present them on behalf of the 
people of Alberta who have taken the time to fill these in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the extradition that we should have 
performed.  Today we are talking about extradition, about justice 
and about the whole idea of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago there was a character I will call extradition 
Andy.  He was not in Canada.  He was in another place which we 
will call Mexico.  In the criminal sentence the maximum he would 
have to sit was 65 days a year. He gave himself his own parole. 
He gave himself his own walking papers.  Instead of serving the 
65 days he should have he served only two.  He served one in the 
spring and one in the fall.  What penalty did Andy get for all 
this?  He got a salary, $64,000 a year. That is what he got in 
return for only showing up once every spring and once every fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that it was not just a salary.  He had a tax free 
allowance of $10,000.  He also had a budget with regard to his 
parliamentary staff on the Hill.  All these things were the 
sentence that Andy had to serve while he was in the other place. 
But that was too much to ask of Andy, 65 days a year for a salary 
of $64,000 and a $10,000 tax free allowance.  It was too much and 
Andy figured that he only had to serve two days of that sentence. 
As a result he spent the rest of his time in a safe haven down 
in Mexico, his hacienda that cost him about $300,000.  Most 
Canadians cannot afford that but he certainly had that luxury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are speaking of the idea of international crime of 
people outside the jurisdiction of Canada, people we want to be 
able to bring back to serve their time in this country. Andy did 
not serve his time.  Andy was not serving the people of Ontario. 
Andy was not serving the people of Canada and that is a real 
travesty.  There should have been extradition to bring back Andy 
from Mexico but that did not happen, did it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have stood up in this place time and again and criticized the 
slowness and the complexity of the extradition process.  This was 
one of those times when there should have been a much faster 
process, but year after year Andy was not extradited.  Andy was 
in Mexico serving a sentence to his own fitting at $64,000 a year 
and never a word from the government in terms of extraditing 
Andy.  Andy was never asked to come home during all those years. 
Year after year he spent his time down in Mexico in his hacienda 
and the government did not say a word, not a whisper about 
extradition for this type of crime that Andy was committing 
against the people of Canada and the people of Ontario, 
misrepresenting them. That is a shame.  That is something this 
government should hang its head in shame for.  It is not just 
that it was something that was right to do.

the people of this country that he was going to go ahead and 
reform the Senate so that we would not have to consider

from the rhetoric we have been hearing for the last 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to stick to what we have before the 
House, Bill C-40, a bill on extradition of criminals and 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The parliamentary secretary does have 
a point.  The hon. member for Calgary West is really stretching 
the point to try to get extradition for a non-attendance as some 
kind of means of enforcing attendance.  I think perhaps having 
made his point he will want to move on and discuss the content of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again it was up to this 
government to define and it has failed to do so with regard to a 
host of other justice issues.  But it should be a crime for 
somebody to take a salary in this land and only serve two days a 
year. That should be a crime. That speaks to the Criminal Code. 
Should the justice minister and the parliamentary secretary not 
be concerned about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Despite 
your admonishment the hon. member persists in straying from the 
topic of debate which is the Extradition Act.  He may think it is 
cute in his snide remarks straying from the topic but from the 
point of view of most of us here this Friday afternoon, I think 
it is a bit of rhetorical masturbation on his part— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member was I thought about 
to heed my admonition and proceed with remarks relevant to the 
bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those types of low comments 
across the way indicate to us the lack of respect that the people 
of Alberta get in this institution and around this place when 
proposing these types of fundamental changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about extradition in Bill C-40.  It is about 
extradition.  It is about international crime and international 
criminals and havens for crime. It is about slowness and the 
complexity of the extradition process and the judicial process in 
general.  Bill C-40 is about modernizing the law and bringing it 
up to speed with the current day.  It is about flaws in the 
actual mechanics of the law.  It is about political intrusion in 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Bill C-40 is about. That is what we are addressing 
today.  We have all those problems in spades with what is going 
on with regard to extradition in this country.  It is a crying 
shame in this House today that we have Liberals who have reneged 
on their promises which they made in 1990, Liberals who reneged 
on the promises they made in their red book because they said 
they wanted to see a transparent and open process.  We are not 
seeing that because I am not even allowed to present these 
petitions on behalf of the people of Alberta who would love to 
see somebody extradited who is spending their time down in Mexico 
and violating Canadians by not doing what they should be doing 
when they are receiving a salary on behalf of the people of 
Canada. 
I will have to find some other way to address these things, to 
bring them forward and to make sure that the Prime Minister is 
able to peruse through these petitions as the hon. members across 
the way should have the ability and should also have the duty and 
the responsibility to go through these petitions and consider 
what Albertans have to say about this issue of extraditing 
criminals who are serving outside of Canada in safe havens away 
from Canadian law and from the responsibilities here in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with amazement. I 
cannot believe the member who just spoke is not going to support 
this bill.  I believe the people of Alberta and the people across 
Canada would be appalled to know that he does not want to see 
criminals expedited in an expeditious fashion out of this 
country.  They want to know this bill is going to pass and that 
we will have the ability to rid Canada of those people who should 
not be here, and also that we send a message to those who would 
want to come to Canada as a safe haven.  They know this bill will 
be a deterrent to those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly about this because unfortunately Canada for 
too long has had the international reputation of being a place 
where people could come because our laws were not strong enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill fixes that problem.  I am proud to support it and I 
ask the member to stand in his place on behalf of his 
constituents to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have news for those across 
the way.  This bill is about extradition, not expedition.  The 
“x” in Federal Express and Fedex is not about extradition, it 
is about expedition.  So if the member wants to talk about 
Federal Express or UPS or Purolator or whatever, she is more than 
welcome to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support extradition and so do the constituents in Calgary 
West.  We want to see people extradited when they are violating 
Canadians, that they do not have a safe haven down in La Paz, 
Mexico.   What is wrong with this country, that somebody can go 
to Mexico and get away from their Canadian responsibilities and 
obligations to taxpayers here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the 
member trivializes a very important debate.  I would ask that he 
address himself to the issues of this important bill which will 
expedite extradition in this country and ensure that we send a 
message to all those around the world that Canada will not be a 
haven for criminals.  I ask him to stand and support the bill and 
stop this nonsense, which is trivializing a very important issue 
that Canadians care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. parliamentary secretary 
under the guise of a point of order really made a question or 
comment on the hon. member's speech to which he may reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, members bellyache across the 
way, but I remember in Calgary when we had Charles Ng, a repeat 
murderer and rapist in the city of Calgary, and this government 
lollygagged and did nothing to make sure that man went back to 
serve his time in California. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Albertans and Calgarians know too well the problems with 
extradition in this land, or expedition in this land, as the hon. 
member will have it.  But it is also wrong for somebody to go 
down to Mexico and have a safe haven just the same way that there 
was a safe haven for Charles Ng in my community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it quite appalling that the parliamentary 
secretary, who knows the rules very well in this place, would use 
a bogus point of order to endeavour to ask two questions in a row 
when other people were standing and wanted to pose questions and 
comments to my hon. colleague from Calgary West.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I enjoyed very much the member's comments and dissertation on 
extradition. He raised a very important issue and that is, 
exactly how bad does it have to get as far as senators hiding out 
in other lands before we will consider that to be a criminal 
offence in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I think the hon. member knows 
that is not relevant to the bill before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a prominent urologist in my riding.  He is a 
professional of very high standing.  He has the misfortune of 
being a Libyan national. For three years this very fine medical 
practitioner has been trying to get landed immigrant status in 
this country.  He has been declared clean by CSIS, he has been 
declared clean by the RCMP, but the people in immigration are 
still bracing their feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that if this physician were a known 
terrorist or perhaps a fugitive serial rapist that he would have 
a better chance of staying in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good question. The 
sad thing is that I think my hon. colleague is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That prominent urologist would probably have a better chance of 
staying in this country if he were a serial rapist or a serial 
killer.  The reason for that is sad:  it is politics, political 
intrusion.  That is exactly what has happened in situations a 
number of times.  If the government feels it is a hot potato, it 
does not want to touch it with a 10 foot pole. Even if it were a 
promise in the red book, a promise in the election and a promise 
in the leadership campaigns, the government avoids it like a 
10-foot pole. It is terrible.  The Liberals toss that hot potato 
around and never deal with it.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the question that was posed to me previously 
regarding how bad does it have to get.  There was a senator who 
was only serving 2.6% of the time.  That senator should have been 
extradited to Canada to serve his time here.  We have other 
senators who only serve 10% of their time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I am wondering if wild turkey 
is being served in the lobbies for lunch today.  It is Friday 
afternoon and the House is somewhat unruly.  I have urged hon. 
members to make their questions and comments relevant to the bill 
before the House and we seem to drift off the topic at every 
turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could now move on.  If there is a further question or 
comment that is relevant to the hon. member's speech and to the 
bill, I will be glad to entertain that.  Otherwise, we will 
resume debate. Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COMPETITION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK193">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 22, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-235, an act to amend the Competition Act (protection 
of those who purchase products from vertically integrated 
suppliers who compete with them at retail), be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-235 proposes 
substantive amendments to the Competition Act.  They are intended 
to address pricing practices in industries, particularly the 
petroleum industry which are characterized by vertical 
integration and dual distribution, that is, industries where 
firms carry on operations in wholesale and in retail markets and 
compete in retail markets with firms to whom they supply at the 
wholesale level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment initially to commend the hon. 
member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge and his colleagues for their 
work on the Liberal committee report on gasoline pricing in 
Canada. The committee report deals with wide ranging, significant 
issues in a professional and constructive manner. It provides all 
stakeholders with a solid foundation on which to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thrust of Bill C-235 as I understand it is to prevent the 
vertically integrated suppliers from squeezing the margins of 
their unintegrated customers' competitors in a manner which 
threatens the competitive viability of the unintegrated firms, 
generally referred to in the petroleum industry as independents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also congratulate the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for his work in preparing the bill as 
well as his laudable efforts to find solutions to the problems 
facing many of our independent petroleum firms today.  His 
efforts are very well intentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed means to resolve these issues quite unhappily will 
not bring about the results he seeks.  They will most certainly 
have serious adverse consequences on the Canadian economy in 
general and on a number of specific industries and consumers. I 
doubt very much that these negative effects which I will try to 
explain were intended by my colleague and others when the bill 
was drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 contains two proposed amendments to the Competition 
Act.  I will have to be very careful as I read this because it is 
complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it would create a new criminal offence which would 
prohibit a vertically integrated supplier who both manufactures a 
product and sells it at retail from selling to a retailer who 
competes with it at a price that is higher than the vertically 
integrated supplier's own retail price, less its marketing costs 
and a reasonable return. 
The objective of the amendment would be to preclude conduct which 
would have the effect of decreasing or eliminating the profit 
margin available to an unintegrated retailer. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill would insert an additional anti-competitive act 
into the Competition Act's abuse of dominant position provisions, 
prohibiting a vertically integrated supplier from coercing or 
attempting to coerce a customer who competes with the supplier at 
the retail level in the same market area into adhering to prices 
dictated by the supplier rather than allowing the customer to 
remain free to set his or her own retail price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing the means by which the bill proposes to 
achieve these commendable goals, I feel it should be brought to 
the attention of my colleagues that provisions addressing both of 
these potentially anti-competitive behaviours are already 
embodied in the Competition Act and are vigorously enforced by 
the Competition Bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Price maintenance cases, as they are known, brought before the 
courts involving charges of the specific coercive behaviour 
targeted by this bill have proven highly successful for the 
crown.  They have led to many hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
fines and have deterred the repetition of the conduct in 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, conduct by firms that have abused their dominant 
position in a market and which has been reviewed by the 
Competition Tribunal has led the tribunal to issue orders 
prohibiting them from repeating the anti-competitive acts, 
thereby restoring the level of competition in the market 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions already exist and are vigorously enforced.  I 
must ask why we are contemplating redundant legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ensure that vertically integrated suppliers are not 
squeezing competing retailers, the bill proposes that the 
government or the courts establish what acceptable marketing 
costs and a reasonable rate of return would be for all 
manufacturers in Canada.  Further, for every price change in a 
market, no matter how often the prices may change, a manufacturer 
would be obliged to ensure that a competing retailer's margin has 
not been affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prices in many markets in Canada change daily or even several 
times a day, depending on the level of competition and the nature 
of the product being sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind my colleagues that this bill as drafted is not 
restricted to the petroleum sector for which it is specifically 
designed, but proposes amendments to an act which affects the 
entire Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it will be found that many of our companies rather 
than cease to function under the burden of this kind of 
regulation will adopt a long term policy of constant prices with 
no opportunity for offering the various forms of discounts 
normally available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of price rigidity will negatively affect the ability 
of Canadian firms to compete against foreign competitors, will 
dissuade foreign investors from locating in Canada and will have 
a profound effect on the cost of any downstream users of the 
product, including of course consumers. I do not believe the 
proposed bill intended to lead to less rather than more 
competition and inhibit rather than encourage competitive 
pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments could also provide an umbrella for independents, 
shielding them from competition from integrated firms who are 
likely to refrain from retail price competition in order to 
escape criminal liability under the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the extreme, such amendments could create a whole new set of 
problems by inducing integrated firms not to supply independents 
as a means of preserving their ability to set their own prices 
and limit their exposure to criminal investigation and 
prosecution under the Competition Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In either case, competition is likely to be reduced, leading to 
higher prices for end users, including consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the words of the hon. member for Huron—Bruce who 
spoke in this House on May 27 of this year expressing the 
following concerns: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When independents are gone they will be gone forever. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then what we will have is an uncontrollable monopoly that has 
the ability to unilaterally dictate price and availability to one 
of the country's most essential commodities.  In short, there 
will be higher prices and fewer competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I close I must also say that in order to properly address 
this very complex issue we must realize that the matter of 
directing legislation toward a specific industry under our 
Constitution is the purview of the provinces.  Therefore it would 
behove all of us concerned about this issue to direct the effort 
to the provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to this bill today. 
The stated purpose of Bill C-235 is to establish fair pricing for 
products at the wholesale level.  It is also to prevent 
anti-competitive acts such as predatory pricing and price 
discounting in industries where suppliers compete with their own 
customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of the other speakers to this bill have commented, the 
existing Competition Act already deals directly with the subject 
matter of this bill.  If members read sections 78 and 50 of the 
Competition Act they will see that suppliers are already 
prevented from doing the things denounced by Bill C-235. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with this government is that wherever it 
perceives a problem it thinks that the solution is to pass more 
legislation to fix the problem.  Bill C-235 is a perfect example 
of this kind of behaviour.  It seems that there was a perceived 
problem with vertically integrated suppliers fixing the price of 
a commodity.  In other words, there is a feeling that big 
petroleum companies are driving small suppliers of gasoline out 
of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because predatory pricing, price fixing and anti-competitive 
practices are seen to be negative activities, and indeed they 
are, Bill C-235 was drafted to overcome these problems. 
Unfortunately, in attempting to expand on sections 78 and 50 of 
the existing Competition Act, Bill C-235 muddies the water and 
complicates the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Independent Retail Gasoline Marketers Association of Canada 
supports the bill, saying it will be the first step in 
re-establishing retail competition in the oil industry.  The 
Canadian Petroleum Products Institute does not support the bill. 
It says that the effect of this bill is to create a price premium 
for consumers to protect them from the benefits of open 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which of these positions is correct?  IRGMA also says that once 
competition is reduced through lack of public policy initiatives 
by any level of government the consumer will pay in the final 
analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform believes that competition is essential in the operation 
of a free market system.  However, we do not believe that 
competition should be artificially created and promoted.  It 
should merely be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPPI makes a good point when it asks:  Is the proposed 
legislation of benefit to consumers, and by what tests has this 
been determined?  It is not a good idea to draft, promote and 
pass legislation just because someone thinks it is a good idea. 
There must be facts and reality behind any attempt to govern what 
people do in business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that everyone, whether for or against the bill, is for 
fair competition.  What we have to determine is whether this bill 
stands in the way of fair competition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is considerable concern in the business community about 
the way this bill is worded.  Although we understand that the 
bill was drafted with vertically integrated petroleum companies 
in mind, it is not worded with those specifics.  The 
telecommunications industry has expressed concern that there have 
been no studies done on the economic impact of this bill on 
markets and industries in Canada.  Since we already have a 
similarly worded section existing in the Competition Act, why are 
we taking risks in fiddling with the wording of these sections 
and perhaps undermining the intent of that act, which is to 
promote proper competition in the marketplace? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill could possibly result in wholesalers and retailers 
communicating and agreeing on prices in order to comply with the 
provisions of the bill.  If this occurs, the bill could actually 
encourage illegal price maintenance between wholesalers and 
retailers, exactly the opposite of its intent.  It is also 
possible that if companies have to go to court to determine 
whether the provisions of this bill are being complied with, then 
the courts, and not competitive markets, would be used to 
determine fair prices.  Do we really want to see this happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another possible effect of this bill might be that efficiencies 
resulting from vertical integration could be ignored.  If 
efficiencies in business are ignored or discounted or 
discouraged, consumers fail to benefit from the savings that 
those companies might experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A summary of the bill says that it would provide for the 
enforcement of fair pricing.  We have to look long and hard 
whenever a government gets involved in enforcing fairness.  Who 
decides what is fair?  How do they do this?  Invariably this 
becomes government rewarding friends and being subject to all 
kinds of things, such as favouritism and influence peddling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is true competition?  How many businesses does it take to 
make true competition?  If the point of competition is to provide 
price benefits to consumers, how do we determine when this has 
occurred?  Under current provisions of the Competition Act 
suppliers are already prevented from price fixing, abuse of 
dominant position and unfair market practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petroleum industry has been investigated several times by 
the Competition Bureau.  Currently the cost to the consumer and 
the retailer's profits are affected by the high level of tax that 
exists as part of the gas price.  The consumer would be much 
happier to see the price of gasoline drop.  We all would. 
Naturally, the retailer would be happier to see an increase in 
profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Realistically, these things will only happen if taxes on 
gasoline are reduced.  The resulting positive effect on industry, 
business and the consumer would be a more competitive 
marketplace.

right direction and we compliment him on that.

happens to be in my riding of Sackville—Eastern Shore.  These

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 aims to amend the Competition Act so that all market 
participants treat Retailers in a fair and equitable way, and 
ensures that wholesalers of fuel (both Refiners and Marketers who 
wholesale) market their fuel in a non-discriminatory fashion. 
Furthermore, Bill C-235 will go a long way towards breaking the 
oligopolistic practices of the major oil companies, and their 
efforts at market control through the widespread use of “Zone 
Pricing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of “Zone Pricing” is frequently used to target 
Independent Marketers by offering certain outlets who are in 
close contact to Independents preferential pricing.  The impact 
of this preferential pricing technique is to discipline smaller 
players into price conformance.  This is why prices in Canada are 
routinely uniform through a region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that this is not the case in the United 
States.  The reason for that is simple—the U.S. has many rules, 
which serve to encourage competition, and hence through the 
practice of increased competition—a wider choice and lower 
prices benefit customers. Manju Sekhri will be forwarding copies 
of the U.S. legislation, which applies to gasoline Marketing in 
the U.S., and as a comparison what we have in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will all be startled by the disparity which exists between 
ourselves and our free trade partners.  This important element 
between our two countries was left out of the free trade 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to get a little closer to my own riding and deal with the 
Ultramar plant.  In 1990 Ultramar took over the Texaco plant, in 
the home of Eastern Passage—Cow Bay, with the assistance of 
provincial and government financing of $50 million.  The object 
of that $50 million was to protect jobs and create competition in 
the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the deal was for seven years.  Ultramar decided 
in 1994 to leave town halfway through its commitment to that 
loan.  One hundred and sixty extremely well paying jobs were 
devastated and gone.  There was less competition within the area 
and not once did the provincial or the current government ask 
Ultramar for any of that money back.  It was gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To throw salt into the injury, the Economic Development 
Corporation, which this government tends to lean on quite 
heavily, insulted workers and families in Nova Scotia. 
an oil company in the United Arab Emirates came with cap in hand 
to Canada saying they would like to pick off the finer parts of 
the refinery and shift it over to their country to create their 
own employment.  That is an extremely wealthy nation.  They 
could have reached into their pockets and paid for it themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we do?  We gave them $25 million of our tax dollars to 
dismantle the plant as well as two other refineries in British 
Columbia to create employment in that country.  We continuously 
destroy jobs in this country.  I am ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the 1990 takeover of Texaco by Ultramar, Ultramar 
undertook the competition directorate to continue operating an 
oil refinery in Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia for seven years.  In 
1993 Ultramar further agreed that if it ceased operations it 
would give the director evidence of efforts to publicly sell the 
refinery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 Ultramar gave notice of its intention to close the 
refinery. They did not even look for a competent buyer to buy the 
plant, even though we have record after record showing that there 
were enough buyers out there to buy the entire plant, the wharves 
and the docks.  Ultramar refused with provincial and federal 
capitulation.  It is absolutely scandalous that this continues. 
I should also say on behalf of my colleague from 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre that if Bill C-235 does not fulfil 
all the aspirations of what we are looking for and what consumers 
are looking for, my hon. colleague also has a bill on the order 
paper, Bill C-384, an act respecting the energy price commission.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would establish a commission to regulate the wholesale 
and retail price of gasoline, taking into account both the public 
interest in having reasonable and consistent prices and the need 
for manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers to have 
reasonable costs covered. The commission could also conduct 
hearings on competition in the oil industry referred to it by the 
competition tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we accept that some prices of goods and services which 
are central to the economy and often controlled by monopolies or 
near monopolies ought to be regulated in the public interest. 
That is true for telephone rates, cable TV and other prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly cannot let something like competition go without 
mentioning the bank mergers.  I am hoping that if we cannot get 
it through on the opposition side a member of the government side 
will bring in a private member's bill to stop and halt the bank 
mergers because that also would destroy competition in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Independent gas retailers are small business people who promote 
competition and keep prices down.  But they are vulnerable to the 
pricing practices of major oil companies.  It is absolutely 
scandalous that this would continue.

good.

Union of Nova Scotia, and his 160 workers who have worked so

to the member presenting this bill he has the full co-operation 
of this union and he has the full co-operation of our party in 
putting this bill forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for 
bringing forward Bill C-235.  This bill would amend the 
Competition Act and reverse a devastating trend against small 
business, entrepreneurs and the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge has pursued this issue 
for years because he sees a long established Canadian industry, 
our independent gasoline retailers, being pushed out of existence 
by unfair and predatory wholesale practices.  He also sees 
consumers with less and less real choice and an overwhelming 
sense of powerlessness at the hands of the large integrated 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways Bill C-235 is about protecting the fundamental 
elements of Canadian entrepreneurship.  Throughout this country 
in every business sector there are Canadians who have mortgaged 
all they own to establish their own enterprise, their own 
business, their own job.  They are determined to compete by 
working harder, by working longer hours, by being more 
innovative, by taking smaller margins and, most important, by 
serving the customer better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is these entrepreneurs who have built Canada's thriving 
retail sector.  They have provided consumers with choice, with 
service, with better value.  In return these retailers eke out a 
living for their families, are a main source of first jobs for 
young people and contribute to the local community through their 
taxes and community work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These independent entrepreneurs are able to offer the consumer 
competitive choice only when there is genuine competition among 
their suppliers, only when they can get an acceptable margin 
because suppliers want business and are willing to provide 
product at legitimate market rates.  Regrettably, this is not the 
case today in several sectors, most particularly in the gas 
industry. 
It is now proven beyond serious debate that integrated suppliers 
of gasoline have sought to forward integrate into the consumer 
market, not by buying successful retailers or establishing more 
efficient retailers but by exterminating independent competition 
through manipulation of wholesale prices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the stories of gas retailer being forced out of the 
market have been publicized because of the threat posed to all 
small resellers by the same practices.  In one report documented 
in the <I>Financial Post</I> illustrative of the overall situation 
a retailer in Georgetown near Mississauga received a notice from 
his supplier Shell Canada informing him that after more than 65 
years as a retailer of Shell products he would be cut off from 
any supply at all.  It was not enough that his margin had been 
squeezed as Shell raised wholesale prices and independent look 
alike outlets emerged in his markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly Shell was not satisfied with the retail market share it 
was winning by normal business practices and had to use its power 
as a producer to weaken retail competition.  It is my view that 
we cannot allow Canadian consumers to be at the mercy of a few 
large integrated providers of gasoline or any other commodities. 
We cannot allow Canadian resellers and small entrepreneurs to be 
driven out of the market by predatory pricing by less efficient 
integrated competitors.  Canada will be most productive if we 
reward and protect efficiency at every stage of service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada's oil companies want to win 100% of the retail market 
they should have to win it by fair competition.  They have enough 
natural advantages, brand names, access to capital, ability to 
build service centres and restaurants to fuel sales.  They must 
not be able to win the market by squeezing out the competition by 
raising wholesale prices close to or above retail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need Bill C-235 most because the current Competition Act is 
failing to protect Canadians against pricing that is clearly 
intended to reduce their choices and ultimately increase prices 
where no independent competition remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week again motorists in southern Ontario awoke to another 
holiday weekend price gouge.  Yet there is nothing they can do 
because there are so few independents left they have no choice 
but to buy from one of the big integrated producers.  So let us 
not pretend we have an acceptable level of competition even 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of the House to cast a vote for Canada's small 
independent business people and protect consumers at the same 
time by supporting Bill C-235.  If we want to preserve a country 
where independent, hardworking entrepreneurs can thrive we need 
more legislation like Bill C-235.  We need more legislation to 
guarantee competition, more legislation against producers and 
brokers constricting and manipulating supply to destroy the small 
retailer, and more legislation to protect consumers from being at 
the mercy of those industries where genuine independent 
competition has already gone extinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to send a message that this House will always put 
consumers first and will act decisively whenever confronted by an 
industry that abuses its position in the market to deprive 
Canadians of the competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by commending once again the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for his unbending resolve on this issue 
in the face of an intense lobby.  Consumers need this kind of 
initiative to put the spine back into competition laws in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to speak to Bill C-235, a bill that if 
passed would have a profound effect on the way companies do 
business in Canada.  The bill is sponsored by the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, the chair of the Liberal caucus 
committee on gasoline pricing.  Since its inception last 
September, the committee has conducted a number of meetings 
across Canada to receive comments on gasoline prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is similar to the bill introduced by the same member 
in the 35th parliament.  It was then known as Bill C-381. In 
reality the member's intent to adjust the Competition Act with 
this bill is born from the fact that in several complaints to the 
competition tribunal, independent retailers have been unable to 
prove either of the following infractions took place, predatory 
pricing or abuse of dominant position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of accepting that there is a competitive unregulated 
market, Bill C-235 seeks to skew the playing field in favour of 
the independents.  Occasionally it is warranted for the 
Parliament of Canada to intervene in the marketplace.  However, 
in this situation we have to ask if Bill C-235 as it stands is 
such a reasonable intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to judge the merits of the bill we need to look at the 
potential impact of the bill.  My colleague, the member for 
Markham, addressed the point that the infractions the bill seeks 
to address are already covered by the present Competition Act. 
Section 50(1)(c) of the act already deals effectively with 
potential predatory pricing. Section 61 deals with price 
maintenance. Section 78(a) addresses price squeezing by 
vertically integrated companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have established that the act as it stands already 
addresses the member's concerns, let us discuss what 
ramifications could result from Bill C-235.  The fundamental 
problem with this bill as seen by the Progressive Conservative 
Party is its blatant manipulation of basic free market 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the bill would create a regime whereby gasoline 
pricing would be set based on a formula that would include a 
combination of market forces and a provision for a minimum profit 
margin.  Clause 50.1(2)(a)(ii) would allow the courts to 
interfere in what constitutes a reasonable profit. This situation 
is worsened by the fact that the bill would entrench certain 
conditions between vertically integrated suppliers and their 
customers. Whether or not governments should be interfering in 
that relationship at all is certainly a point for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the issue that most disturbs me is that this bill 
completely disregards any efficiencies that arise from vertically 
integrated companies.  For example, Imperial Oil would fall under 
the definition of a vertically integrated supplier. It operates 
refineries, it has its own retail outlets and it sells to 
independents that are its competitors.  Under the terms of Bill 
C-235 it would not be permitted to pass on savings realized by 
its economy of scale to its customers without doing two things. 
First, it would have to ensure that its price reduction was in 
compliance with Bill C-235, a decision that would have to be 
adjudicated by the competition bureau.  Second, it would have to 
make a corresponding reduction to any competitors that buy from 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advocates of this bill have come to the conclusion that this is 
fair and proper. However, I respectfully submit they are living 
in a fantasy world.  A more reasonable expectation would be that 
Imperial Oil would make a smaller price reduction if any were 
made at all. That way it could remain compliant, the independents 
would receive a small benefit and the consumers would lose.  This 
point needs to be stressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Different spokespeople for Bill C-235 have tried to sell it as a 
bill that would protect independent retailers as well as 
consumers.  The harsh reality is that consumers would only be 
victims under this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go a step further with my analogy. Another possible 
outcome of the situation facing our analogous company, Imperial 
Oil, could be a decision on its part to discontinue supplying 
independents altogether.  If it is no longer a vertically 
integrated company, it would not have to deal with the 
Competition Bureau every time it wanted to lower its prices, 
offer coupons or give away a two litre bottle of pop.  This is 
not an unreasonable outcome to predict, and it would be the exact 
opposite effect of what the bill's sponsor is trying to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party has spoken to many stakeholders on this issue and 
through those interviews we have come to learn a great deal about 
the whole industry.  Several years ago Canada and its provinces 
began moving from a regulated to an unregulated gasoline 
industry.  Instead, we have preferred to maintain general rules 
of competition, as embodied in the Competition Act. This 
situation does not exist in the United States and as a result 
rules change from state to state.  I am sure my hon. colleague 
can understand what kind of inefficient marketplace this creates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt that the result of Bill C-235 will be to 
increase gasoline prices across this nation by creating an 
artificial profit margin.  This quite frankly is legislated 
protection of inefficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to this point my comments have focused on the oil industry 
and I have done so for a reason.  This bill has been developed to 
specifically target that industry.  Unfortunately, just as 
indiscriminate tuna nets catch dolphins, this bill will impact 
many other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect that should disturb us all is that if passed we would 
enter a new retail environment, one where wholesalers and 
retailers would be encouraged to communicate and agree on retail 
prices in order to comply with provisions of the bill.  The 
result would be an increase in the likelihood of illegal price 
maintenance clauses.  That is not my opinion but instead the 
reasoned opinion of the president and CEO of the Stentor Company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter also goes on to concur with what my colleague, the 
member for Markham, said in this House previously.  Bill C-235 
will create another level of bureaucracy with inefficient, 
burdensome compliance regulations.  The following point bears 
repeating. The courts will be used to determine prices and 
margins and not market forces. This would have to be the case 
because no definition exists for the bill's provision of what 
constitutes a reasonable profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want to make is that we have in existence right 
now a comprehensive world class Competition Act which was enacted 
as such by the previous Conservative government in 1986. I take 
this opportunity to assure my hon. colleague that the foresight 
of that government saw to it that necessary protection for all 
sizes of companies was implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act covers perdition, pricing with the express purpose of 
destroying a competitor.  It covers below cost selling.  It 
covers abuse of dominant position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, there is nothing in Bill C-235 that is not already 
effectively and fairly addressed by the act.  Legislation that 
benefits only special interests and not the whole marketplace 
cannot be supported.  Therefore we will be voting against Bill 
C-235 in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
beg the indulgence of the House.  I forgot to wish my mom and dad

Speaker, I have heard a lot from all sides of the House.  I know 
there are members who feel very passionately about this.  Those 
happen to be the very members who have actually taken the time to 
study this, who have not allowed CPPI or an oil company or the 
Competition Bureau to help them write their speech or to find out 
some kind of mythical idea about what this industry is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Tobique—Mactaquac and his colleague from Markham 
are good examples of people who simply do not want to engage in a 
real cerebral discussion of what this bill is all about. 
That is exactly why they do not want it to go to committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member who comes from New Brunswick made a statement about 
the fact that everything is hunky-dory in this industry.  He 
should look at the New Brunswick select committee all-party 
resolution of that province last year which indicated that we 
needed effective laws dealing with predatory pricing that 
currently do not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get into the Stentor question because Stentor has 
written a letter expressing surprise that it was possible for the 
Competition Bureau to go around looking for people to find 
opposition to the bill.  It is kind of ironic that it is this 
bill which is in fact giving them the tools to resolve the 
problem that exists.  Stentor may have a huge problem with 
respect to the power of the vertically integrated suppliers that 
relate to the Internet service provider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is correct that the bill was about the oil 
industry, but it seems to me there are a lot of other industries 
and small businesses, which the people on the other side wish to 
advocate, that are being decimated day in and day out.  That is 
not hypothetical; that is reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the retail industry, we are asking in Canada to 
do what the parent companies cannot do in the United States.  The 
legislation is designed very specifically to bring the 
Competition Act up to speed with the rest of the world before we 
recognize that in Ontario, where gas prices have increased by 
eight cents a litre, it is not a function of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what it takes for members of parliament to try to 
understand this issue.  There were 20,000 retailers a few years 
ago.  There are less than 10,000 now.  There will probably be 
fewer in days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers across the country know that when gas prices move up 
uniformly or fall uniformly it is a function of the wholesalers 
that have absolute control over the retail price.  They are not 
separate.  They are not segregated.  The bill simply tries to 
address a safeguard which, in summation, was the recommendation 
of the Competition Bureau in 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to put aside the biases, the willingness to play 
politics, to stand up for small business and to stand up for the 
truth.  At the end of the day that would ensure what we do not 
have today in the oil industry in Canada, a truly competitive 
Canadian market.
