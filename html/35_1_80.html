	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House strongly affirm and support the desire of Canadians to remain 
federally united as one people, committed to strengthening our economy, 
balancing the budgets of our governments, sustaining our social services, 
conserving our environment, preserving our cultural heritage and diversity, 
protecting our lives and property, further democratizing our institutions and 
decision making processes, affirming the equality and uniqueness of all our 
citizens and provinces, and building peaceful and productive relations with 
other peoples of the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to this motion 
which addresses the issue of Canadian unity from a positive and 
federalist perspective.
<P>
	The motion has two parts: an affirmation and a description. 
The first part simply calls for the House to strongly affirm and 
support the desire of Canadians to remain federally united as 
one people. Surely this is a proposition which every federalist in 
the House can and should support.
<P>
	The second portion of the motion is a brief, shorthand 
description of what Reformers believe should be some of the 
distinguishing characteristics of that federal union as we move 
into the 21st century. It is a shorthand description of a new 
Canada which our members will expand on in the course of the 
debate.
<P>
	Please note that there is nothing negative in the motion. The 
motion does not criticize the government so that government 
members cannot and should not regard it as a confidence 
motion. Nor does the motion contain any implicit threat to 
Quebecers who for whatever reason may have given up on 
federalism.
<P>
	The motion is simply a positive affirmation of the desire of 
the vast majority of Canadians to remain federally united and a 
shorthand description of some of the characteristics which can 
and should distinguish such a union in the future. The motion is 
worded generously enough and is of such positive intent that a 
majority of the members of the House can and should support it.
<P>
	Why do we present the motion to the House? It is because we 
perceive a growing vacuum on the national unity issue, a 
leadership vacuum. If it is not filled with a positive vision of 
federalism and a reasoned response to the separatist challenge, 
the danger is that it will be filled with constitutional delusions 
and incomplete or inflammatory responses to the separatist 
challenge. That will harm Canada and every province and 
territory of Canada.
<P>
	The past month has provided ample evidence of the existence 
of this vacuum and some of the delusions and inflammations 
which it encourages. It is said that nature abhors a vacuum and 
so should Parliament. Reformers offer this motion and a list of 
questions which we will be forwarding to the Prime Minister 
later this week as our contribution toward filling this vacuum 
with something more constructive and forward looking.
<P>
	The Reform Party was originally created and is presently 
supported by discontented federalists.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are discontented federalists.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We got our start in the west and have gradually increased our 
support across the country by appealing, for example, to people 
who are appalled at how the federal government spends money 
and accumulates debt. Our supporters are for the most part 
people who reject constitutional models or public policies based 
on alleged partnerships between racial and linguistic groups and 
who long for constitutional arrangements based on the equality 
of all citizens and provinces.
<P>
	Our supporters are for the most part people who deplore the 
lack of effective, regional representation in Ottawa and the 
unwillingness of the traditional federal parties even to consider, 
let alone embrace, such democratic reforms as genuine free 
votes, citizens' referendums and initiatives or recall.
<P>
	This is just a partial list of the dissatisfactions of Reform 
supporters and hundreds of thousands of Canadians with status 
quo federalism. We can therefore identify with other Canadians, 
including Quebecers, who have also become dissatisfied or 
disillusioned with that status quo federalism.
<P>
	This brings me to the major point of difference between 
ourselves and the Bloc. Rather than reject federalism or the 
concept of a federal union of all Canadians, we are committed to 
reforming federalism and overcoming the systemic problems, 
chronic overspending, inequitable constitutional arrangements,  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4909"> 4909 </A></B>
<P>
top down decision making and policy making, the things that 
have brought status quo federalism into disrepute.
<P>
	We have weighed both status quo federalism and separatism 
in the balance and have found both wanting. This has driven us 
to seek for a vision of a new and better federal union of 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we have evaluated separatism and the existing 
federal system and we believe that both of these formulas are 
imperfect. This examination has prompted us to seek a new and 
improved federal union for Canadian citizens.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are two ways to bring into being a new and better vision 
of a new Canada as a federal state. One is to assemble the first 
ministers in federal-provincial conferences attended and 
advised by various academic and interest group elites to focus 
exclusively on amending the Constitution. This was the 
approach taken in creating the 1982 Constitution, the Meech 
Lake accord and the Charlottetown accord. It failed to produce a 
vision or a form of federalism capable of inspiring a deeper 
commitment on the part of Canadians to the federal union.
<P>
	The other approach is to go to hundreds of meetings, big ones, 
small ones, quiet ones, noisy ones, with the rank and file citizens 
of the country and to ask these simple questions: ``What kind of 
country do you want to live in as we approach the 21st century? 
What kind of country do you want your children to live in? What 
do you want the distinguishing characteristics of that new and 
better Canada to be?''
<P>
	Reformers have done this over the last five years, mainly in 
the west and parts of Ontario. We intend to continue to do this in 
the west, throughout Ontario, in Quebec, the north and Atlantic 
Canada. We have found that if we ask these questions and listen 
carefully to the responses Canadians will share their fears, their 
dreams and their aspirations with us. If we ask them they will 
answer.
<P>
	In the dreams and aspirations of individual Canadians and 
groups of Canadians we will find the substance, the raw material 
from which to create a composite picture of a new and better 
Canada of the 21st century.
<P>
	We have developed shorthand phrases to refer to the 
distinguishing characteristics of this new Canada, some of 
which are summarized in our motion. For example, there is the 
simple phrase ``strengthening the economy''. In the context of 
the 21st century this means establishing a truly internationally 
competitive economy, knowledge based, service oriented, 
environmentally sustainable, capable of providing good jobs 
and good incomes for all our citizens.
<P>
	To get to that destination the new economy of the 21st century 
requires the implementation of certain public  policies: fiscal 
policies to lower the cost of government, tax policies to pass on 
the benefits of this reduced cost to taxpayers and encourage job 
creation, trade policies to eliminate barriers to trade including 
internal barriers to trade, educational and training policies to 
produce an internationally competitive workforce.
<P>
	To get to that destination the new economy of the 21st century 
may also require constitutional changing: a constitutional 
requirement to balance government budgets, a strengthening of 
the federal commerce power and a new division of 
responsibilities on education and training.
<P>
	Defining and getting to that new economy of the new Canada 
is far more than a constitutional exercise but it may have 
constitutional aspects which cannot be ignored. In this 
resolution we have used simple phrases like ``strenghthening 
our economy '' as a heading. The words of the heading may seem 
trite and familiar but if one understands each of these shorthand 
phrases to be the tip of an iceberg beneath which lie all the 
public policies, private initiatives and constitutional changes 
required to actually bring into being a 21st century economy, 
then each phrase can be made to stand for something substantive 
and to fully describe a distinguishing characteristic of a new 
Canada.
<P>
	Some will ask what this approach to defining a new Canada 
offers to Quebecers. The short answer to the question is that it 
offers Quebecers the same benefits it offers every other 
Canadian, including the freedom to develop and preserve 
cultural distinctiveness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In short, the answer to that question is that this approach 
offers Quebecers the same advantages as all other Canadian 
citizens, including the freedom to promote and protect their 
cultural distinctiveness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This approach offers to Quebecers as well as to all other 
Canadians the new jobs of the new economy, jobs which are 
more likely to be created and maintained if our bargaining agent 
in the new free trade world represents a market of 28 million 
people rather than 8 million.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	This approach offers to Quebecers as well as to other 
Canadians tax relief, not the additional tax bills that will come 
from establishing a sovereignist government with national 
obligations, obligations to Canada, and new international 
obligations as well.
<P>
	This approach offers to Quebecers as well as to all other 
Canadians financially sustainable social services. Properly 
designed social insurance plans which spread the risks over a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4910"> 4910 </A></B>
<P>
larger population and a larger financial base are more secure 
than those resting on smaller populations or economic bases.
<P>
	The Reform approach to a new Canada also recognizes that 
Quebecers as well as other Canadians want to be treated equally 
under the law and to be free to preserve their cultural and 
linguistic heritage. When we ask Canadians they say they want 
both equality and freedom to preserve cultural diversity.
<P>
	The problem in the country is not getting support for these 
objectives. The challenge is to reconcile them and to provide for 
the attainment of both within a single state. The approach 
recommended by Reformers is a two-pronged approach. First, 
in Canada's basic constitutional arrangements we should 
explicitly recognize the principle of the equality of the 
provinces and all citizens.
<P>
	Federalists should be encouraged in this regard that the year 
end Decima-Maclean's poll taken immediately after the defeat 
of the Charlottetown accord showed for the first time that an 
absolute majority of Canadians in every province, including 
Quebec, support the equal provinces constitutional model over 
the founding racial groups model.
<P>
	Second, in Canada's constitutional division of powers and in 
public policies flowing from that division of powers, we should 
make the preservation of cultural and linguistic distinctiveness 
a personal, private and provincial responsibility. The role of the 
federal government in such matters should be confined to the 
prevention of discrimination on the basis of cultural or 
linguistic grounds.
<P>
	I have only scratched the surface of developing a fresh 
vigorous vision of a new and better Canada. My colleagues will 
expand on this vision. We look forward to the contributions of 
other members. My main purpose is to illustrate the process 
whereby Canada, the whole great sea to sea to sea federal union, 
can renew itself. We start by asking the people where they would 
like to go. We listen carefully. We construct public policies to 
move the nation in that direction. We offer more than the status 
quo. If our policies require constitutional changes, we seek 
those as well but only at the end of the process and not at the 
beginning.
<P>
	This is what Reformers have endeavoured to do over the last 
five years on a limited scale as an extraparliamentary party. 
Now as a party with strong parliamentary representation and 
greater resources we are in a position to do more to pursue this 
vision of a new Canada and to establish a rallying point for those 
Canadians who wish Canada to remain federally united.
<P>
	We shall do three more things to advance the cause of 
federalism in the months ahead. First, we are striking a new 
Canada task force within our party to further refine and flesh out 
this vision of a new Canada. This task force will include 
members of our caucus. It will seek additional input from people 
in parts of the country where we are not well represented. It will 
initiate a major teledemocracy effort on this subject in the early 
fall.
<P>
	Second, we are establishing a contingency planning group to 
prepare a reasoned, principled, federalist response to all those 
troubling questions and issues which the threat of Quebec 
secession raises for Canada. A list of the questions which this 
group will address will be released this week and the terms of 
reference of this contingency planning group will be established 
before the end of June.
<P>
	Third, we will bring together the results of this work, a fuller 
and more complete vision statement of a new Canada and a 
reasoned, principled federalist response to the issues raised by 
separatism for presentation to the country at our national 
assembly here in Ottawa on October 14 to October 16.
<P>
	This is what Reformers are doing to fill the national unity 
vacuum with a positive vision of the future and a reasoned, 
principled federalist response to the threat of separation. Our 
question to the government is: What is it going to do more than 
defending the status quo to fill the national unity vacuum over 
the next three months?
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	During the last few days our Prime Minister has been visiting 
Normandy as we and other nations remember and honour D-Day 
in Europe. That event still speaks to us and to people around the 
world. It declares that there are certain ideals and concerns for 
which men and women are prepared to die. If leaders and 
legislators can discern and articulate those ideals and concerns 
for their generation, they can give that generation a vision worth 
living for and worth striving for.
<P>
	The wartime leaders of the western democracies in the 20th 
century, Borden, King, Churchill, Wilson and Roosevelt, all 
understood this. One of them put this into words to this effect. 
He said: ``Mothers who had lost their sons in France have come 
to me and have taken my hand and have said `God bless you'. I 
advised the course of action which led to the deaths of their sons. 
Why then, my fellow citizens, should they pray God to bless me? 
Because they believed'', and listen to the words, ``for something 
that vastly transcended any of the immediate or palpable objects 
of the war''.
<P>
	There are certain things such as freedom, security, equality, 
heritage, unity, democracy and home which vastly transcend the 
immediate and palpable objects of public policy and our daily 
routines. These are the things that people are in the final analysis 
prepared to die for and should therefore be prepared to live for 
and to strive for.
<P>
	The Canadians who landed in Normandy were not fighting for 
the preservation of the status quo or for a hyphenated 
Canadianism or for the right to secede. They were fighting for 
ideals which vastly transcend and yet were rooted in their 
personal beliefs and hopes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4911"> 4911 </A></B>
<P>
	If our Prime Minister could return home with a fresh vision of 
those ideals that vastly transcend for contemporary Canadians 
and if Parliament could help him link that vision to the practical 
hopes and dreams of Canadians in every corner of the land then 
the House would have done its part to provide a rallying point 
for federalism which is the spirit and the substance of this 
resolution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to the leader of the Reform 
Party that we welcome this debate today so that the Liberal 
Party, the Government of Canada, can reaffirm its commitment 
to Canada's integrity and to the vision we have for the country.
<P>
	I begin with a question related to that portion of your speech 
that has to do with global trading.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Because of the nature of the speech, the 
Chair today will be even more vigilant. Would all hon. members 
please direct their remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. My question to the leader of the Reform Party has to do 
with global trading which the member touched upon in his 
speech.
<P>
	American business experts have complained that one of the 
handicaps of the United States in international trade is the lack 
of Americans with foreign language skills. For the last 25 years 
we as Liberals have promoted a policy of multiculturalism 
where we have encouraged people to preserve and promote their 
language and culture of origin.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	We believe the policy Pierre Trudeau enunciated in 1971 
today represents one of the greatest advantages that we have as a 
trading nation because we have people in our country who can 
go home and trade on behalf of Canada because they preserve 
that language of origin.
<P>
	In your new vision of Canada, through you, Mr. Speaker, to 
the leader of the Reform Party, that you are proposing would you 
continue to support-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. With all respect, would the hon. member 
please direct his questions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. This is a very emotional debate today. Would the leader 
of the Reform Party support a multiculturalism policy that 
would link multiculturalism to trade policy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	As our motion suggests, we support the objective of 
preserving our cultural heritage and diversity which leaves all 
kinds of room for supporting the concept of preserving Canada's 
multicultural heritage. Regarding the member's suggestion that 
it has an economic dimension, we would have no disagreement 
with that. Where we will come to a difference is on how to get 
there.
<P>
	Our view is that we preserve this multicultural heritage by 
making that the responsibility of individuals, maybe 
economically motivated individuals, private associations and 
the lower levels of government.
<P>
	We get the federal government out of that business and 
confine its role to strictly the prevention of discrimination on 
the basis of culture, language or other distinction. The 
difference is not with the goal, it is how to get there.
<P>
	The international trade dimensions of this most effective new 
Canada that it has to be a trading nation competing in the free 
trade world give an additional argument for having a federal 
government that did not exist even 10 years ago, and that is we 
need a bigger federal government as our bargaining agent in 
these big international trade agreements. Our point is that a 
bargaining agent representing 28 million people is going to get 
further in a free trade world than a government representing 8 
million people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member's remarks and toward the end 
when he was talking about D-Day he got to the matter of 
heritage and national pride. I think he and the members of his 
party know that in the end the successful nations of the world, 
however we define successful, have not been built on 
technicalities, on formulae, on a technocratic approach to 
nationhood but in fact have been based on emotion and feeling, 
common heritage.
<P>
	Quite often the successful nations have developed technical 
ways of channelling the energies which have come forward as a 
result of this national pride.
<P>
	The speaker looked forward into the 21st century but the way 
we look forward into the 21st century is by looking honestly and 
clearly at the nation as it exists now.
<P>
	The key features of the nation which we have now, this 
wonderful nation of Canada, this remarkable confederal system, 
have to do with the makeup of the population. We have for 
example hundreds of First Nations, aboriginal peoples who 
speak several families of languages and many scores of actual 
languages.
<P>
	We also have, whether the member likes it or not, in the 
modern nation two founding nations, two groups of people, that 
feel a special responsibility, have a special place in the modern 
nation of Canada; the people who use the French language and 
people who, as their maternal language, use English.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4912"> 4912 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, and I am looking now in the mirror at Canada, we 
have over 200 first generation Canadians. Those people likely 
speak between them perhaps 300 of the world's 6,000 languages. 
Those people, including the newest of them, have accepted, I 
believe, or are trying to accept a common heritage.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Would the member comment on his vision of the place of the 
aboriginal peoples and their languages in more detail, the 
historic place of the so-called founding nations, and where the 
200 first generation nationalities that make up such an important 
part of the country sit in his vision of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his questions and observations.
<P>
	We see this as the tip of an iceberg and the member is really 
asking for what is beneath that. This phrase that new Canada 
should be characterized by a commitment to preserving our 
cultural heritage and diversity has all the room necessary to 
recognize the factors of Canadian diversity that the member 
mentions.
<P>
	There is the role of aboriginal peoples, the role of new 
Canadians from many lands, the role of the original French and 
English populations. This provides scope for that in our vision 
of a new Canada. Our vision of a new Canada with respect to 
aboriginal peoples has to include the doing away with the 
paternalistic Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and the transferring of its responsibilities, 
functions and funding to local aboriginal governments. We have 
said that on many occasions and again the argument is how to do 
it and not whether it is the objective.
<P>
	We recognize from a historical and sociological standpoint 
the French and the English as playing founding roles in the 
development of Canada. Our point, however, is that if we are 
developing constitutional arrangements we ought not to tie 
constitutional entitlements to factors like race, culture or 
language because we end up dividing rather than uniting.
<P>
	I suggest again that in terms of the broad objective of 
preserving our cultural heritage and diversity, however broadly 
that is defined, we are not in disagreement. The constitutional 
arrangements that get us there, that is where there will be 
diversity of opinion in the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question will be 
very short. I listened with incredulity to the speech made by the 
leader of the Reform Party. I also listened last week to what a 
Reform member said in this House about Atlantic Canadians 
who, according to him, are charity cases for the federal 
government.
<P>
	Given what the leader of the Reform Party said today, I have 
several questions: Do the remarks made last week by his Reform 
colleague reflect his new vision of Canada and does he agree 
with them? In his opinion, will  Atlantic Canada stay in a 
Confederation that will foster its linguistic, economic and social 
growth, just like at the beginning of this Confederation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the short answer to the member's 
question is certainly our vision of a new Canada includes 
Atlantic Canada. It includes a reinvigorated Atlantic Canada 
economy.
<P>
	What the other member was referring to, and he meant no 
offence, was that for the last 30 years the way we have tried to 
stimulate economic development in Atlantic Canada has been 
through regional development grants. The Canadian approach to 
regional development is now quoted by economists the world 
over as the way not to do it. We have invested billions of dollars 
and the unemployment rates and the economic growth rates in 
those provinces are no better than they were when we started.
<P>
	The alternative is embraced in this vision. Regional 
development programs of the future will be exploiting the 
north-south dimensions of free trade. Part of the country that 
has the strongest regional economy today is British Columbia 
which is doing exactly that. The premier of the province of New 
Brunswick is working on a strategy to that effect which we 
believe is the regional development wave of the future.

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is for me a real 
pleasure and an honour to participate today in the debate 
launched by the Reform Party. It will be an opportunity for me 
and for each of us to reflect on a fundamental and crucial issue 
and to reaffirm, I repeat reaffirm, our desire to live together in a 
united country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am speaking today as a Canadian, as a New Brunswicker and 
as an Acadian. I want the members of the House to clearly 
understand this. While I have a distinctive history and roots as 
an Acadian and as a son of New Brunswick, I am also fiercely 
proud of being a Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since our ancestors arrived here, often at the cost of bitter 
struggles, this part of America became a sturdy cradle for our 
language and culture. Our country is not only a territory but a 
crucible for the historic union of two languages and cultures.
<P>
	Today's debate reminds me of the 1992 debate when this 
House approved the constitutional amendment proposed by New 
Brunswick to enshrine in the Canadian Constitution the main 
provisions of the law recognizing the equality of New 
Brunswick's two official language communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4913"> 4913 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important to remind Reformers, who were not here at the 
time, of the significance, the real and symbolic value of this 
constitutional amendment. First of all, this measure validates in 
an almost irreversible fashion the progress that the two 
linguistic communities have made together over the years and 
the common future they want to build in a spirit of co-operation 
and partnership.
<P>
	This measure also demonstrates the social maturity of two 
linguistic groups who want to live together and pass on to future 
generations of New Brunswickers the will to continue the social 
and economic experiment they started. New Brunswick is thus 
in several respects a mirror of our federal reality.
<P>
	By working hard, by making concessions, of course, and 
especially by respecting other people's reality, we in New 
Brunswick have managed to create a climate of harmony 
favourable to successful and satisfactory linguistic 
accommodations.
<P>
	New Brunswick has always been a place of refuge for our two 
language communities. First, many Acadians went there after 
they had been deported in 1755. Also, Loyalists who fled the 
United States after the Treaty of Paris settled there.
<P>
	Today, this welcoming tradition is still very much alive in our 
province. From all over the world come new citizens who want 
to build a happy future with us, for themselves and of course for 
their descendants. I strongly hope that this example of respect 
for differences, tolerance of cultural diversity and openness to 
others will spread to all of Canada.
<P>
	Despite the problems we sometimes have in expressing our 
national identity, we nevertheless have more in common to 
celebrate than differences to divide us.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians have shown the generosity of spirit which has 
made ours one of the most open societies in the world. It is 
clearly reflected by the composition of the House. 
Unfortunately, I am sad to say that while Canadians are generous 
and tolerant, this does not seem to be the case for the two 
regional opposition parties. They want to divide Canada. They 
want to divide our country into French versus English, into 
region versus region, until finally it will be so divided there will 
not be a country any more and we will not be able to recognize 
Canada. That is sad.
<P>
	I have heard the Reform Party bring forward motions in the 
House against the official languages policy, a policy which is a 
fair and practical approach to recognizing the linguistic facts of 
life in Canada, a policy which imposes linguistic obligations on 
the federal government alone and which gives linguistic choices 
to Canadians. When I hear this policy opposed by the Reform 
Party I hear a party which understands neither  the official 
languages policy nor the values of fairness and pragmatism on 
which it is based.
<P>
	When I hear the Reform Party attempting to come to grips 
with multiculturalism I do not hear tolerance. Nor do I hear a 
party in touch with the reality of western Canada, a place where 
Ukrainians, Chinese, Germans, Swedes and dozens of other 
peoples have come to make a better life for themselves and their 
children, a life free from persecution and free from intolerance. 
It is a place where they are free to adopt a new home and still 
proudly claim their heritage.
<P>
	Recognition and respect for cultural diversity are part of the 
Canadian identity. When we walk down the streets of our cities 
or visit our small towns and farms we see that multiculturalism 
is not just a policy, it is a reality. I am not sure the Reform Party 
fully understands that.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister was in Normandy 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-Day and the brave 
Canadians who fought and died there. The Prime Minister noted 
that those people had many backgrounds, many colours and 
many cultures but they fought side by side as one. Allow me to 
quote from the Prime Minister's remarks. Of the soldiers he 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They had one thing very much in common: They were all part of a young 
nation, a new kind of nation, where the ancient hatred of the past was no match 
for the promise of the future, where people believed they should speak different 
languages, worship in different ways and live in peace. They did not die as 
anglophones or francophones, as easterners or westerners, as Christians or Jews, 
as immigrants or natives. They died as Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately, some politicians deal only with the negative. 
Negativism and a gloomy way of seeing our great country are a 
way of life for them. Yes, of course we have our difficulties and 
much work remains to be done, but what country does not have 
problems? Throughout the world, Canada is envied because our 
living conditions are so good.
<P>
	You surely know that this year again, a United Nations report 
put us in first place among nations. This report says that, 
considering all factors that contribute to a people's happiness, 
Canada is the best country in the world in which to live. The 
constant threat to Canada's unity is doing us great harm. The 
confidence of other countries in our economy and our future is 
shaken.
<P>
	The different levels of government spend more time fighting 
over powers than trying together to solve the problems which 
concern us. The trade barriers which we keep in place in our 
country hinder our economy, while everywhere else in the world 
the trend is to eliminate them. Federal and provincial powers 
overlap and programs are duplicated. That is why we as a 
government prefer to set aside constitutional questions and 
concentrate instead on co-operation and practical, realistic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4914"> 4914 </A></B>
<P>
solutions to our problems, unlike the Bloc  Quebecois which 
wants to separate and destroy the country.
<P>
	We were elected a little less than eight months ago. After 
listening to the people, we have set ourselves some very clear 
objectives. Our first objective was, of course, and still is, job 
creation; the second one is fiscal consolidation; the third one is 
the reform of social security system, while the fourth one is 
restoring integrity in public affairs.
<P>
	We have spent all our energy promoting economic growth and 
job creation because, in our opinion, this is the number one 
priority. We must give back to those who, unfortunately, must 
rely on unemployment insurance or social assistance, the 
dignity that comes with having a job. I think this is the main 
concern of every Canadian and public official in the country, and 
we must pursue that fundamental objective.
<P>
	If, during all those years, we had devoted as much energy to 
promoting economic growth and job creation as we did talking 
about the Constitution, we would be much farther ahead, and 
Canadians know that. Let me give you a few concrete examples 
of our efforts to find practical solutions.
<P>
	Today, the Minister of Industry is meeting his provincial 
counterparts to discuss the domestic free trade issue. As I just 
mentioned, we noticed that trade barriers between provinces 
were impeding domestic trade. Consequently, we took action. 
We co-operate with the provinces and impressive progress has 
been made.
<P>
	I just referred to the overlapping and duplication between the 
federal government and the provinces. This is another issue 
which we are looking at closely. The President of the Privy 
Council and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is actively 
reviewing this issue. He is looking at each case of overlapping 
and duplication, in co-operation with every province and 
federal department. This exercise is conducted to reach 
administrative agreements which will enable us to serve 
Canadians better and more efficiently.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	We have set up a national infrastructure program. This 
program is an example of what can be done for the well-being of 
the country as a whole, when the three levels of government 
co-operate. (English follows)
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are the types of specific actions the voters of Canada 
told us to engage in when they elected us last October. They 
voted for an end to the constitutional wrangling that 
preoccupied the previous government for almost a decade. 
Canadians voted overwhelmingly for job creation. They voted 
for a message of hope. They voted for honesty and integrity in 
government. They voted for a party that has stood for and 
defined federalism since the inception of Canada.
<P>
	The government and the citizens of the country know what is 
right about Canada and we want to work to make it even better. 
That is the meaning of good government and that is what the 
people of the country want. They have a right to expect it and we 
intend to deliver.
<P>
	We all know that words can hurt, that words have hurt people 
in the country and indeed the country itself. For years now 
Canadians have heard themselves and their country scrutinized, 
criticized and put down by the very people who should be 
offering leadership and a sense of confidence for the future. 
Words can do harm because it is with words that the opposition 
party leaders are trying to deceive Canadians about the reality 
they see around them every day.
<P>
	Reality is out there with people living and working for a 
peaceful and productive future, not in endless debate over 
abstract definitions on a piece of paper. We are unwilling to tie 
ourselves into a straitjacket of words.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition says ``Ah''. Well, two weeks 
ago in Shediac, the Acadian community rejected the opposition 
leader's comments aimed at promoting the separation of the 
country. People simply told him ``thanks, but no thanks''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our political debate should be focused on how to create jobs, 
build our economy, protect our social safety net, how to protect 
the environment and how to make government work better at a 
lower cost to our citizens. Our political debate has for too long 
been infected by a virus of self-doubt and anxiety. It is sad that 
the leader of the Reform Party has come down with this virus.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to quote Michel Doucet, an Acadian activist of long 
standing who, recently, when referring to the Canadian vision of 
our country's future, described the vision which I just 
mentioned and said: ``For Canadian francophones in general and 
for Acadians in particular, salvation is conditional upon 
maintaining a federal system; a federal system in which Quebec 
and the francophone and Acadian communities of Canada would 
find the means to ensure their cultural security, since it is 
essential that Canada remember that French culture is the one 
which is threatened in America''.
<P>
	One of the thrusts which resulted in our Confederation is the 
firm belief that we could do great things by working together 
rather than in isolation, and that the citizens of each of the 
provinces would have a better future if they were all part of the 
same country.

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, since you are telling me that my time is almost 
up, I would like to take this opportunity to move the following 
amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the words after ``Canadians to'' and 
replacing them with the following: ``Continue to live together in a federation''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
closely to the Leader of the Reform Party and to the Secretary of 
State for Parliamentary Affairs. One insists that we must reopen 
the debate, while the other says we should let the matter rest. 
The Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs says we should 
not talk about this subject any more and I agree with him 
because we have debated this matter long and hard since 1989. I 
have served in this Parliament since 1984 and we have been 
talking about this for a very long time.
<P>
	You will undoubtedly recall, Mr. Speaker, that debates have 
taken place and two or three parliamentary commissions have 
been struck. There have been a whole series of seemingly 
endless debates, the end result of which was Meech. And Meech, 
as you know, did not work, in spite of the fact that it represented 
Quebec's minimum demands.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes, but not those of the regions, for 
example.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Yes, for the other regions as well. 
It could have worked, but Meech was rejected.
<P>
	Another debate followed after that. All kinds of debates took 
place with respect to the Charlottetown accord and committees 
held hearings. As you know, Charlottetown failed as well. 
Therefore, it is too late for us to reopen the debate on this subject 
because for us, the debate is closed.
<P>
	Quebec conducted the most serious exercise in its history. The 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission received 600 briefs and heard 
testimony from 200 witnesses while at the same time, a special 
committee of experts held meetings. Once again, Quebec's 
leading experts concluded that if Quebec was to grow to its full 
potential and fight its way out of this economic crisis in which it 
was fast sinking along with the rest of Canada, it needed to gain 
control of approximately twenty areas. These are not my 
recommendations, but those of leading Quebec experts. 
Charlottetown also proved to be a rejection of this position.
<P>
	Therefore, when the hon. member says we must continue to 
debate this issue, I say to him that as far as we are concerned, the 
subject is closed. We have now proceeded to the next phase, 
which is to achieve sovereignty for Quebec, not at the expense of 
the rest of Canada, but for the benefit of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	And so I agree with the Secretary of State for Parliamentary 
Affairs when he says that we must stop talking about this 
subject. He is right. As far as we are concerned, the time for talk 
is long over. We have moved on to the next phase.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what was 
said by the hon. member, and I must say that every time the 
parties opposite refer to Meech and Charlottetown without 
mentioning the Charest report, I begin to wonder. After all, it 
was a solution. Some people even resigned because of certain 
developments.
<P>
	When they talk about Charlottetown, on which a referendum 
was held, I get the impression that the whole Bloc machine did 
not want the accord to make it, for the simple reason that it 
would have been good for Quebec and would have completely 
eclipsed the separation option.
<P>
	It hardly makes sense for you to invoke Charlottetown. At 
least to me it does not. You mentioned the recession, but you 
have now reached the point where you want to-
<P>
	I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but members opposite are talking 
about a recession, and through you, Mr. Speaker, I want to 
respond to their concerns. The hon. member told us he did not 
want separation to be at the expense of the rest of Canada. For 
heaven's sake, how are you going to do that? The way you talk 
about separation today is already sending waves of uncertainty 
on the markets. This country is no longer seen as a good place to 
live and do business, now that its citizens are starting to worry 
about the future of the country. And yet this is the country, this is 
the Canadian federation that has been instrumental in bringing 
us all, including Francophones in the province of Quebec, 
Acadians and all other groups in the country, where we are 
today. And now you tell us you do not want separation to come 
at-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, order, please. I would appreciate it if 
hon. members would always address their remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I simply wanted to 
say that they tell us they want to separate without harming the 
rest of Canada, and I find that hard to take! I think Canadians 
know better than to be convinced by such arguments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, there was at 
least one contradiction in what was said by the Secretary of 
State.
<P>
	He started his speech by commending the Parliament of 
Canada for enshrining institutional bilingualism in New 
Brunswick in the Canadian Constitution, as if that were 
something extraordinary. He went on to say that it was no longer 
important to talk about the Constitution, that it was just a piece 
of paper and that we now had to talk about job creation. I wish 
the Secretary of State would make up his mind. If the 
Constitution is not important, then please explain why it is so 
important to  have what happens in New Brunswick in the 
Constitution.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4916"> 4916 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	We all know that the Constitution is important as the basic law 
that determines who can do what in this country, and the many 
problems we have, including this constant overlapping of two 
levels of government, because the federal government always 
thinks it can do a better job than the other governments and 
encroaches on all jurisdictions of the provinces, can be traced 
back to this basic law.
<P>
	But let me at least point out this contradiction: If you 
commend the Parliament of Canada for adopting a 
constitutional amendment, how can you say the Constitution is 
just a piece of paper?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say the Constitution 
was just a piece of paper. I acknowledged the importance of the 
constitutional amendment on official languages in New 
Brunswick. What I meant and what I actually said was that 
Canadians would prefer to see us discuss the reality they face 
every day, which is about jobs and the dignity of work.
<P>
	During the last election, Canadians realized there had been 
enough talks about the Constitution and that we should focus all 
our attention on the problems facing them every day: finding a 
job and having the dignity of working at that job to earn a living.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before the member got on to his more negative comments about 
the Reform Party, he did share a bit of his vision of Canada with 
us. I think he made reference to the historic union of two 
linguistic and cultural groups modelled by New Brunswick and 
suggested that was the model for the country.
<P>
	Is there not a need to expand that vision because that vision is 
not sufficient for the entire country? Would the member not 
acknowledge if we tell people in downtown Victoria that this is a 
historic union of two linguistic and cultural groups that they do 
not relate to that? If we tell people in most of our aboriginal 
communities that this is a historic union of two linguistic and 
cultural groups, that does not describe Canada for them.
<P>
	Is there not a need to expand beyond the concept of Canada as 
being simply a partnership of the English and French groups?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said that I hoped the example 
of New Brunswick would be followed across the country, and 
you say that perhaps we should go further.
<P>
	Of course, adjustments are always necessary, but I am 
concerned, and I do not see any positive contributions coming 
from the Reform Party when we hear proposals in this House 
that are aimed at changing or eliminating the official languages 
program.
<P>
	In the case of communities in New Brunswick and many 
communities across the country, this legislation has played an 
important role, and I fail to understand why the Reform Party 
says it wants the well-being of the entire community and at the 
same time tries to eliminate the programs that helped us survive 
and in fact develop our potential to a very considerable degree. I 
am surprised at these statements from the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the Leader of the Reform Party for 
the opportunity to participate in this debate. I was under the 
impression that he would not give us the chance, since he had 
said that he would not interfere in what he dubbed a family 
squabble.
<P>
	I think he now realizes that this is much more than a family 
squabble and that we are grappling with a fundamental problem, 
one that existed before all of our economic problems and deficit 
woes. I think he realizes, and I thank him for that, that until the 
issue is resolved, we must confront it head on. At least that is 
what the Bloc Quebecois has decided to do.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday, all of the western countries who joined the vast 
anti-Nazi coalition after 1939 held ceremonies to commemorate 
the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy. The 
thousands of young soldiers who died and all of their comrades 
in arms were in reality, to quote the cover page of <I>Time</I> 
magazine, the soldiers of the last great crusade. Upon the 
cessation of hostilities, two antagonistic blocs emerged, each 
wanting to bring about lasting peace in the western world.
<P>
	The western world has known peace for nearly 50 years. 
Troubles and differences of opinions are of course not 
uncommon, but today, no country in the western world would 
consider taking up arms to resolve in its favour a political or 
economic conflict with another country. Yesterday's adversaries 
such as Germany and France, once centuries-old enemies, have 
become the staunchest of allies.
<P>
	Peace in the western world is based on two major interwoven 
principles, namely democracy and national sovereignty. The 
exercise of democracy guarantees the exercise of national 
sovereignty. These principles provide the answers to two 
fundamental questions about how societies organize themselves 
politically, namely how is power achieved and who governs 
whom.
<P>
	The western model provides clear answers to these two 
questions. Nations prefer to govern themselves and within each 
nation, citizens want to democratically choose their govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4917"> 4917 </A></B>
<P>
ment. In short, the democratic nation-state is the norm in our 
western civilization.
<P>
	What better opportunity than this solemn celebration of the 
ideals that brought together 50 years ago as many peoples and 
combatants under the same banner, to remind all Canadians and 
all Quebecers of our deep commitment to the fundamental 
values of peace and democracy!
<P>
	Giving the national feeling the framework it needs to grow 
normally is a guarantee of peace. And what an example of 
constructive co-operation the nations of Western Europe have 
been giving the whole world for more than 40 years without 
infringing on national sovereignty on basic issues! This should 
serve as an example for Canada, a country that is young but, 
strangely enough, incapable of showing the flexibility it needs 
to deal with inescapable sociological and economic realities.
<P>
	Democracy certainly seems the most demanding system for 
the leaders and for the whole state machinery in terms of 
restraint, transparency and respect for human rights. During the 
difficult times that every country experiences in the course of its 
history, there is a strong temptation to play fast and loose with 
democracy. Canada is no exception to this rule, as demonstrated 
by the 1970 War Measures Act.
<P>
	These difficult times put the democratic fibre of a society to 
the test but we are not afraid of the immediate future from that 
perspective. Canada will certainly not backtrack at a time when 
democracy is gaining ground throughout the world, particularly 
in Latin America, notwithstanding the unfortunate situation in 
Haiti, and in Central Europe.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us be clear that it is perfectly normal for the federal 
government to plan a campaign of persuasion to convince 
Quebecers of the merits of the status quo, but it is also perfectly 
normal for us to promote the only alternative to the status quo 
which is political sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party talks about a new federalism 
but the last 30 years offer abundant proof that this so-called new 
approach is nothing but a cul de sac. There are two options on the 
table. There will be a political debate and the people of Quebec 
will decide. All of us will have to abide by the results. This is 
democracy.
<P>
	This does not mean that anything goes, that blows beneath the 
belt should be tolerated or that reaching for the gutter should not 
be singled out for what it is. Are these words too strong? We 
hope at the outset of this important campaign decency will 
prevail. One can hold strong views on the issues of the day 
without demonizing the adversary. This has been and will be our 
line of conduct.
<P>
	When all the peripheral noise has been removed one should be 
able to focus on the central issue. If Canada is performing so 
poorly it is mainly because there is in its bosom a sharp conflict 
of vision. In the minds of the people of English speaking Canada 
there is one national government in Ottawa and 10 equal 
provinces; in other words, one senior government and 10 junior 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	For Quebecers their national government is in Quebec and the 
doctrine of provincial equality represents a denial of their 
history and of their aspirations for the future.
<P>
	Being the senior government, Ottawa can intervene in almost 
all of the provincial domains mainly by using its spending 
power. What happens when Quebec and Ottawa have different 
sets of priorities? Not only do their bureaucracies overlap but 
they are at cross purposes. If English speaking Canada prefers to 
transfer some provincial powers to the federal government it can 
do so not only administratively but also legally so that Quebec 
cannot prevent the erosion of its powers
<P>
	All this boils down to a simple reality. Canadian federalism 
means that the Government of Quebec is subordinate to the 
central government both in large and lesser matters. Quebec 
does not have today all the powers it needs to be the key player in 
setting its priorities, be they economic, social or cultural. In 
other words, English speaking Canada has a veto on the future 
development of Quebec within the federation.
<P>
	Nobody ever relinquishes power joyfully, but one can at least 
expect English speaking Canada to clearly see the impasse to 
which the present regime has brought us both. The budget crisis 
is but the most visible symptom of this impasse. Another one is 
the sheer impossibility of significant political movement in one 
direction or another. The federal government will never let go of 
its extensive powers, not only on grounds of ideology but also 
because many provinces do not have the resources to assume 
even a few of its powers. In fact the necessity of a stronger 
central government for English speaking Canada, in the 
education sector for example, is not in doubt. The more 
important provinces, seeing the fierce resistance of Quebec to 
any transfer whatsoever to Ottawa, will hesitate to climb aboard 
the federal bandwagon.
<P>
	Thus gridlock and confrontation are built into the system. It is 
easy to predict, for example, that the eventual blueprint of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development to overhaul social 
security will not meet its objectives. Unreasonable deficits will 
just go on piling up, speeding in the process the relative decline 
of the Canadian economy.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Quebec people reject the status quo that will never satisfy 
them. They spoke loud and clear on this in the last federal 
election. They understood what the Quebecers sitting on the 
government benches in this House have not understood yet, 
namely that there are times in history when governing well 
means making drastic changes to the system. We are 
approaching one of these times.
<P>
	Some prefer to wait until they are confronted with newspaper 
headlines before admitting that something is happening. It is 
their right, although it shows a particular kind of historic 
long-sightedness. In fact, we see with every passing month that 
the federal government is unable to get Canada and Quebec out 
of the increasingly devastating economic and budget crisis.
<P>
	In the February 22 budget debate, we drew the attention of this 
House to several questionable aspects of the budget and I would 
like to remind you of two of the points we made at that time. 
First, the Minister of Finance deliberately inflated his 1993-94 
deficit estimate to make his performance for the current year 
look better. Debt servicing for this year, in particular, was 
overestimated. A few weeks ago, the Department of Finance 
proved us right by stating that it now expected the deficit to be 
under $44 billion instead of the $45.7 billion announced on 
February 22.
<P>
	Second, we said that the interest rate projections in the budget 
were too optimistic. Today no one finds them credible. The 
interest rates on short- and long-term securities now exceed by 
almost two percentage points the average level forecast in the 
budget despite the last few days' decline.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In view of the federal government's poor financial situation, 
it is impossible for interest rates to decline significantly in 
Canada without a similar drop in the United States. The 
American economy is approaching the threshold of capacity 
utilization which will lead to larger inflationary pressures. Just 
look at our southern neighbours' unemployment rate: it was 
down to 6 per cent in May, while ours is still 11 per cent.
<P>
	Under these conditions, U.S. monetary policy will remain 
more restrictive and U.S. interest rates could rise further. Add to 
this an overly optimistic revenue projection and you will 
understand that the government, like its predecessor, is 
underestimating the deficits from the outset.
<P>
	Since the economic hypotheses on which the 1995-96 deficit 
forecast is based are even more optimistic than those for the 
current fiscal year, the extent of the underestimate will 
necessarily be larger next year. Why be surprised then when the 
financial community does not believe the finance minister's 
promise to reduce the federal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in 
1996-97? The C.D. Howe Institute has just warned the 
government in a very recent study that its spending should be cut 
by $7.2  billion if it wants to keep the promise of 3 per cent. In a 
few months, the federal government's inability to correct its 
financial situation except by passing the crisis on to the 
provinces will be obvious to all. That is what the next federal 
budget has in store for us.
<P>
	We must admit right away that the Minister of Finance has 
already shown his colours. With questions pouring in from all 
over about the precarious state of the federal government's 
finances, he promised a month and a half ago to make massive 
cuts in transfers to the provinces starting in 1996-97. He went 
even further, since this is his chief method for eliminating the 
federal deficit by the year 2000.
<P>
	On the one hand, the federal government pretends to decide 
everything; it is even eyeing education. On the other, it is 
prepared to pass on to the provinces the bill for its fiscal 
irresponsibility. Fiscal federalism is thus more and more 
disadvantageous for Quebec. The trend of recent years will 
accelerate markedly. It will become more obvious than ever that 
Quebec must take back all its resources if it really wants to break 
the vicious circle of a decaying system which every day is a 
greater fundamental impediment to its freedom of action.
<P>
	Thus we know that the political and economic dynamics of the 
present system are working at a deep level and not only 
superficially for the sovereignty of Quebec. The coming years 
will confirm that our historical destiny is leading us to this 
sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I heard the leader of the Reform Party explain his view of 
what Canada should do to get out of the present crisis. I heard 
that he proposes something like a new round of negotiations but 
prior to that many members and ministers of the House should 
be travelling around, along with civil servants, with city hall 
meetings all over the country.
<P>
	When I listened to him I had a sense of déjà vu and I thought it 
looked so much like the Keith Spicer approach. Do we 
remember the Keith Spicer train that went all across the country 
listening to people? It heard all kinds of things, disparate things, 
and at the end we had nothing. Out of the mountain came a 
mouse, as we say in French. I am quite discouraged to see that 
we will begin again if we listen to the Reform Party.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party does not know a lot of Quebec 
history. I am 55 and I spent most of my last 30 adult years 
involved directly or indirectly in the sterility of 
federal-provincial discussions, constitutional quagmire. I have 
a feeling that we in Quebec, and probably people in the rest of 
Canada have the same feeling, lost the last 30 years wasting our 
energy, our money, our political stamina that we needed to build 
something 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4919"> 4919 </A></B>
<P>
real in all parts of this huge country, devoted to the sterile 
discussions of the Constitution.
<P>
	Here we are with a new proposal to resume this terrible circus.  
People have forgotten that we went through the referendum in 
1980 in Quebec, that there has been the unilateral patriation of 
the Constitution in 1982 where Quebec had imposed on it a 
Constitution which is our current Constitution. We never signed 
it and every attempt to bring Quebec to the table to sign the 
Constitution has failed because the people of Canada and of 
Quebec have said no.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I was in the House when the political establishment of the 
country, the House of Commons, decided that there should be a 
deal based on the Charlottetown accord. I was here when we 
voted-I would exempt the Bloc because we voted against 
it-and all the federalist parties voted for the Charlottetown 
accord. We saw the people of Quebec and the rest of Canada 
reject it.
<P>
	The right reason and the great reason why the government will 
not get involved in the debate with a new proposal is that it 
knows it is not possible. It knows that everything has been done: 
good faith, bad faith, imaginative strategy, all kinds of things. 
Everything has been attempted. I would say it is a disease of the 
country that we cannot move. The country has no power when it 
comes to changing anything, to adapting the Constitution to 
reality because the country does not accept reality.
<P>
	There are two realities as long as no one accepts that outside 
Quebec there is no possibility for anything. We have two 
realities: we have Quebec and we have the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The Quebec people do not think they are better than any other 
part of the country, but they think they are different. They have 
done nothing to destroy anything. We do not intend to destroy 
Canada. We intend to adapt the political structures to the 
realities.
<P>
	I have a different vision of the country from what people on 
the other side of the House have of their country. I respect their 
vision. I have the ultimate, utmost respect for their vision.
<P>
	I respect the people who died in the last war. When I laid a 
wreath yesterday I did it out of sincerity, out of respect. We have 
people in our families who died in Europe and who fought for 
democracy, for whatever. We should respect those people and 
not put words in their mouths because silence is now their 
privilege. Silence is now their prerogative. We should not 
resurrect them. We should accept the fact that they died for a 
great cause, that we have inherited a legacy of their courage. We 
should respect it and silence about what they thought when they 
died, what they had in their hearts when they died on those 
beaches far away from their families, should be respected. It is 
for them for eternity because they have kept it in their graves.
<P>
	When I laid the wreath yesterday I asked the member for 
Quebec to do it. She had never told us before. Perhaps she was 
absolutely taken by the atmosphere, the tragic and grandiose 
atmosphere yesterday, when she said: ``You know my father was 
there and he spent the war in Europe''. I said: ``You should lay 
the wreath yourself'', and she did.
<P>
	I was so upset this morning, so sad, when I read the comments 
made by the Deputy Prime Minister about the significance of 
our gesture yesterday.
<P>
	I will close my speech. I know it is a very emotional, very 
difficult debate. I pledge to stay forever a democrat and to 
respect the opinions of other people. And I would ask people to 
do the same for us.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to 
respond with a comment on what I have just heard. I have to 
make it clear to the Leader of the Official Opposition, the leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois, that he does not respect my vision of 
Canada.
<P>
	My vision of Canada includes Quebec. My vision of Canada 
includes Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain who went up 
this river only feet from where we sit today. It includes the 
voyageur and the coureurs des bois who opened up the west and 
the north of this great country. This is my Canada. I say that I 
will fight in any way I can if you try to destroy that.
<P>
	My Canada includes Quebec City. It includes the north of 
Quebec. For me, my Canada includes the ability of Quebecers to 
feel that the Rocky Mountains belong to them, that the Pacific 
coast belongs to them, that Halifax belongs to them and that the 
rocky shores of Newfoundland belong to them.
<P>
	My Canada is not two Canadas. That is your Canada. My 
Canada is one Canada. There is not an English speaking Canada 
and a French speaking Canada. There is a Canada where people 
who live outside Quebec and are francophone, a whole million 
of them, can express themselves, live and be served by their 
government in their own language just as francophones in 
Quebec can, and just as anglophones in Quebec can.
<P>
	I realize we have a serious difference of opinion about the 
country. However I have an opinion, not about its parts, not 
about those things that divide us. For my children I want the 
history and the contribution of those great men and women who 
came from France, who were the original settlers of my Canada, 
to be part of their tradition and their future.
<P>
We are stronger together. We are a more vibrant nation together 
than we would be as 10, 11 or 20 or even 2 pieces. I do not 
believe we can end up as two pieces. I believe that the heart is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4920"> 4920 </A></B>
<P>
ripped out of the country if Quebec leaves and I believe the rest 
of the country will fall apart. I will not let you do that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again, I know that we are getting not close to 
the heart, we are in the heart, but I insist that all hon. members 
please address the Chair. It is very important. The hon. member 
for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. Please excuse me, I did not know 
you had a commentary. The hon. Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Just a short one, Mr. Speaker, to thank you for 
your wise words.
<P>
	I would like to say to the member who just addressed the 
House that I completely respect what she said. I feel genuine 
sympathy for her emotion because this debate is very much 
about deep and fundamental emotions.
<P>
	At the same time I would like to say, if I may, that to respect 
the vision of someone is also to make sure that one does not 
impose one's vision on another. This is about democracy. It is 
not for me as an individual to impose anything on other people. 
It is not for me to make any decision for collectivity, but it is for 
the Quebec people to make a decision. Those things are not easy 
and they have been said before.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	I remember very well the last debate about Meech. We had a 
very limited debate about Meech. I heard a few moments ago the 
secretary for parliamentary affairs say that the Bloc was very 
happy to see Meech fumbled but it was not true. I fought hard 
and for a long time for Meech.
<P>
	I was not the champion of Meech. Prime Minister Mulroney 
was. I remember that during those debates at some point Prime 
Minister Mulroney implied that if Meech was rejected the future 
of Canada might be compromised. He said something like that. I 
noticed then there was a very strong negative reaction all over 
Canada that the Prime Minister was too emotional, that he was 
not realistic, but here we are.
<P>
	We tried to get Meech through. We almost begged the rest of 
Canada. We are proud people but we begged anyway. We asked 
the rest of Canada to subscribe to five minimal conditions that 
Quebec proposed, to go to the table and sign this Constitution on 
the dotted line where there is no signature, Quebec's signature.
<P>
	I spent two years of my life doing that. I even accepted the 
bold risk to do that. I left my sovereignist family in 1984 to work 
for that because I thought, like Prime Minister Mulroney and 
many people in Quebec, a majority of Quebecers, it was 
worthwhile to try to reconcile the country. The minimal 
requirement we could set up to save the honour; accept that 
something very important in Quebec politics be enshrined in the 
Constitution, not in the powers but in the preliminaries of the 
Constitution; that Quebec should be recognized as a distinct 
society, which is to recognize us as a people. This is the 
fundamental thing, people in Quebec feel like a people. We 
cannot change that. It is a fact of public life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. Under Standing Order 43(2) and on behalf of 
the Reform whip I would like to inform the House that our 
caucus members will be dividing their time when they speak.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is so noted and I return to the hon. member 
for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member from the Bloc should not in any way, 
shape or form be surprised at the fact that this party would 
include them in this discussion.
<P>
	Unlike some parties, we stand for including all Canadians in 
our decisions. This is not a family feud. What we have is an 
effort by a group of individuals in the House to fracture the 
country and I, like the member across the way, will not stand for 
it.
<P>
	This is in part accomplished by misleading the people of 
Quebec as to what is really going on in the country. I would ask 
at some time what Canada has done against the people of 
Quebec. I will tell members in part.
<P>
	The Government of Canada gives to the people of Quebec in 
transfer payments more money than what the people of Quebec 
give out to the federal government. I would also say that the 
federal governments in past years have pandered to the province 
of Quebec in an effort to keep it within the fold. This is special 
status. This is special treatment and it only causes division. It is 
divisive within the country.
<P>
	In this world, we have tribalism: one group or tribe against 
another. It is perhaps the singular, most divisive problem that we 
have in this world. Francophones, anglophones, men, women, 
black, white, it is all the same thing. All we can hope for in the 
world is that we are treated equally under the law, that we are 
free of prejudice. What we make of our lives as individuals is up 
to ourselves.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member from the Bloc. What is 
so wrong with a country where we are all treated equally, where 
we all have the same rights under our laws, where culture and 
language is the responsibility of each province whether it is 
Quebec, New Brunswick or British Columbia? What is so wrong 
with a vision of Canada that includes all Canadians? I would like 
to ask the hon. member what is so wrong with that.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me say two things to the hon. 
member.
<P>
	First, Quebec has already been excluded from the 
constitutional family by the rest of Canada. Something we 
should remember is that in 1982 the federal government ganged 
up with the English speaking provinces to impose the 
Constitution on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4921"> 4921 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec. That is a fact and cannot be denied. We have been 
thrown away and here we are trying now to set a political basis 
out of that.
<P>
	The second thing I would like to say to the Reform Party is 
that I hear the leader of the Reform Party proposing a new 
federalism. I have absolutely no doubt it would be a worse 
federalism, if it can be, when he begins his proposal by 
establishing that everything will be based on the equality of the 
provinces which is what Quebec has fought against for the last 
30 years.
<P>
	All Quebec premiers, starting with Jean Lesage, one of the 
greatest political leaders of Quebec, always fought against the 
equality principle. The Reform Party is now proposing a new 
federalism where a new principle will be enshrined in the 
Constitution: equality of the provinces. Let me say that even if I 
were still a federalist I would never accept the fact that this new 
federalism would exclude official bilingualism.
<P>
	Any reform proposed by the Reform Party on this basis will 
not fly. There is no reform possible. There is no possible reform 
in the country. The decision by Quebecers will have to be made 
either to accept the status quo, which is stagnation and 
everything we have tried to get away from for the last 30 years, 
or a new noble project to build a real country in Quebec so as to 
allow people in the rest of Canada to have their own country, a 
country belonging to their minds and hearts.
<P>
	I do not believe for one minute that there is not a strong 
national cement binding all English speaking Canadians outside 
Quebec. In the House I can hear the emotion and I can see that 
those people have a genuine passion for their country, as I have 
for mine.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is noted that the Reform Party will now be 
splitting its time so the speakers will have 10 minutes and 5 
minutes for questions and answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I rise to 
give my most important speech to date of this 35th Parliament. It 
reflects my personal point of view, not as a representative of any 
race or of any province, but as a proud immigrant Canadian 
citizen. It is not directed to the politicians in the House but 
rather to the people of Canada from sea to sea to sea, the voters 
who entrust us to work in their best interests.
<P>
	I will endeavour to treat today's motion in the following way. 
First I will make my position on Quebec separation quite clear 
and unequivocal. Second, I will discuss some of the 
consequences of Quebec separation and then re-emphasize a 
new vision of Canada as an alternative to separation as earlier 
presented by our leader, the member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	I humbly realize my opinions and comments on this very 
important topic may not make a difference in the larger picture. 
Nevertheless I believe all politicians and Canadians who want 
Quebecers to remain in Canada need to reinforce their 
convictions, attack the myths, present the reality and the real 
face of this great country.
<P>
	I want Quebec in as I want Alberta in: as part of the great 
Canadian federation that has served us all so well. It does not 
make any sense whatsoever to break up after 127 years, 
especially in a period of high deficits and debt. Together all 
parts of Canada are stronger. The proof of that is our enviable 
record of war participation, political stability, prosperity and 
freedom. If it is worth dying for, it is worth debating for.
<P>
	To be unable to work together as Canadians to reach an 
accommodation quite frankly is unthinkable to me. To continue 
this uncertainty is already straining our economic, social and 
cultural diversity and the world is watching.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I respect the convention that federal politicians should stay 
out of provincial elections. I respect the rights of Quebecers to 
send the Bloc Quebecois to Ottawa. I respect their right to a 
referendum on separation, but because this affects me directly I 
feel I have the right to speak out on this issue.
<P>
	I respect the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and the many 
members I have worked with on committees and recently on the 
basketball court, but I truly regret the course they have chosen. 
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois is intelligent, charismatic and 
experienced in trying to get the best deal for Quebec that he can. 
However I fundamentally disagree and stand against the method 
he has chosen: separatism over a new federalism.
<P>
	The reality of the consequences of Quebec's separation would 
in many ways be very costly for all Canadians. I have evaluated 
this as a businessman with 25 years of experience. To assume 
entitlement to all existing benefits of the federation by 
separating is not only dangerous but very naive.
<P>
	We have no buy-sell agreement in place to handle separation, 
no terms of reference that were agreed to while we were friendly 
partners to facilitate the secession of a province. Neither the 
British North America Act nor the Constitution Act, 1982, 
defines an orderly breakup of our great country.
<P>
	In the face of this fact the reality is that all the many views put 
forth by the separatist forces in the absence of precedent are in 
many cases inaccurate projections about the way things will be 
in a sovereign and separate Quebec. All Canadians should make 
an honest assessment of the pending separation issue and ask 
themselves if the risk of separation leads to a more predictable 
future as compared to working together to create a new and 
better federalism.
<P>
	Let me raise a few of the questions about separation that are 
on the minds of Canadians. Who will negotiate this separation? 
Will we need a federal election to decide? While we fight over 
the right to break up the country our fragile economy will suffer. 
Is this what we really want? Our deficit and debt are so high, 
how can a new nation start off with such a high debt load and 
what share will it take? What about the value of the dollar and  
Canadian interest rates? Will Quebec pay? Will creditors 
refinance two separate entities so deeply indebted? I, for one, 
fret over making this assumption. The currency issue places 
Que-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4922"> 4922 </A></B>
<P>
becers in an inferior colonial status at the mercy of Canadian 
monetary policy. Is this acceptable to the Quebecois?
<P>
	Have Quebecers evaluated the impact of separation on 
subsidized sectors of their economy, like textiles, furniture and 
the protected status of the dairy industry? Will the aerospace 
industry continue to grow without support from the rest of 
Canada?
<P>
	If negotiations become emotional and hostile, what 
favourable and satisfactory settlement can be achieved in areas 
like defence, dual citizenship, the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, the free trade agreement, control over the St. 
Lawrence River and the boundary in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 
all of which require consent of Canada?
<P>
	What about territory and territorial rights for aboriginals? 
Can they remain with Canada, or will the majority in Quebec 
have the right to decide the future for aboriginal peoples?
<P>
	I believe Canada will accept separatism if it is the result of a 
clearly worded referendum on the issue and reflects the will of 
the majority of Quebecers, but who ever said outside Quebec 
that sovereignty association was a negotiable option? If the 
referendum question is sovereignty and the vote is yes, how do 
we negotiate with the other party that says that option was never 
on the table, only separation and not sovereignty?
<P>
	In the light of these questions are we not better off working 
together in kickstarting our economy, by resolving the unity 
issue once and for all? For those Canadians who may not think 
that is possible, let me quote one of the Fathers of 
Confederation, the Hon. Thomas D'Arcy McGee, who faced the 
same crisis in the 1860s and like me wanted to make Canada the 
happiest of homes.
<P>
	He said: ``The policy of linking together all our people in one 
solid mass and making up for the comparative paucity of our 
numbers by the repeating and detonating moral influence of our 
unity, the policy of linking order to order, of smoothing down 
the sharp and wounding edges of hostile prejudices, the policy 
of making all feel an interest in this country and each man in the 
character of each section of the community and in each other, 
each for all and all for each-this policy will never grow old, 
never will lose its lustre''.
<P>
	Bloc Quebecois members claim that federalism has not, 
cannot and will not work. They point to the failures of the 
Constitution Act, Meech Lake and the Charlottetown accord as 
sufficient proof. While I agree these constitutional efforts 
represent failure, they failed everyone and not just Quebecers 
because the wrong people were negotiating the right things the 
wrong way: top down.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	This 35th Parliament has the right people in the right place to 
negotiate the right way with the new vision of federalism as 
presented by the leader of the Reform Party together with the 
Prime Minister and his party who also believe in keeping this 
great country together.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois has a tremendous 
opportunity to apply his great skills in resolving the weaknesses 
of the current dying federalism, protecting the interests of 
Quebecers and making all Canada a stronger and richer nation. 
Madam Speaker, through you to the people of Quebec, demand 
this of him.
<P>
	By putting Canada first, a Canada which includes Quebec, we 
all benefit from a bilingual nation applying the original 
recommendations of the Laurendeau-Dunton bilingualism and 
biculturalism report, not the current expensive second language 
mess created by the technocrats which the majority of all 
Canadians in and outside Quebec say is not working.
<P>
	By revisiting and applying the spirit of the British North 
America Act, restoring to provinces the complete power they 
should have over resources, education, language and culture, by 
acting as a true Canadian official opposition party, the Bloc 
Quebecois together with the Reform Party can more effectively 
force this indignant, stubborn and weak government to address 
the real problems of this great country. Together we could force 
the federal government out of areas of provincial jurisdiction 
where it has no business being involved.
<P>
	Together we could convince the government that Canada has a 
spending problem, not a revenue problem, and that the culprit is 
the deficit and the debt, not Quebec separation. Let us resolve 
the deficit and debt problem which is keeping us in this 
recession, causing high unemployment and threatening our 
social programs. Let us attack the enormous debt load together 
with constructive, creative reductions in spending which will 
restore real confidence in the financial community.
<P>
	Let us not add to the uncertainty of our quality of life by 
separating. We need a new balanced democratic federation of 
provinces with a healthy economic development program 
sensitive to the environment and a Constitution that recognizes 
the equality and uniqueness of all its citizens and provinces and 
that includes Quebec.
<P>
	In conclusion I will once again use the words of the Hon. 
Thomas D'Arcy McGee speaking in 1860, a believer in Canada 
who described the reality that still holds true today and reflects 
my personal philosophy: ``I look to the future of my adopted 
country with hope, though not without anxiety. I see it quartered 
into many communities, each disposing of its internal affairs, 
but all bound together by free institutions, free dialogue and free 
commerce. I see a generation of-''

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to congratulate the Reform Party member for his 
excellent presentation. I simply would like to point out a few 
facts.
<P>
	The hon. member, with whom I have often had the opportunity 
to work in committee and who does an excellent job, said at the 
beginning of his speech that we must stop telling Quebecers that 
their only alternative now is either status quo or sovereignty, 
and that we should instead talk of a renewed federalism. I am 
still very young, but ever since I was very little I have been 
hearing about renewed federalism.
<P>
	Remember the meeting which took place in Quebec City, in 
1964, between the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson, for whom I 
have a great deal of respect since he is one of the greatest, if not 
the greatest Canadian politician, and Jean Lesage, the Quebec 
Premier of the time. Remember also all the constitutional 
conferences and meetings held between the Canadian provinces, 
or between Quebec and the federal government. Remember the 
1971 conference in Victoria, with Robert Bourassa.
<P>
	Remember also the whole constitutional debate of 1980, when 
the future of Quebec and Canada was discussed. Remember 
1981, after the No victory, when Mr. Trudeau, who was then 
Prime Minister, said to Quebecers: Say no to sovereignty and 
you will get in-depth reform and renewed federalism, as you 
have been hoping for since 1867, when you were told that you 
could have a place as a nation in this new confederation, which 
was never a real confederation.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Remember also the forced patriation of 1982, when the 
federal government put Quebec in its place, instead of making 
room for it, by imposing a unilateral patriation of the 
Constitution as well as a Charter, a measure which was almost 
unanimously opposed by the members of Quebec's National 
Assembly.
<P>
	In 1984, Mr. Lévesque, a true statesman, was in charge in 
Quebec and extended a hand to federalists by saying that Quebec 
was prepared to take a bold risk. Then, there was Meech with 
Mr. Mulroney and all the subsequent failures.
<P>
	Ever since I was a little boy, even a baby, I have been hearing 
about renewed federalism. Recently, the whole debate 
intensified with the failure of Meech, the Beaudoin-Dobbie 
Commission, Beaudoin-Edwards, the July 7 agreement which 
became the Charlottetown accord, and which also ended up 
being rejected.
<P>
	This is not the failure of your country; your country is yours. 
You love it, you love this Parliament, but you should let us build 
our own. We do not want Canada's destruction, but we are well 
aware, after 30 years and particularly in later years, that this 
renewed federalism is a smoke screen. Right now, there are two 
options: status quo, which is unacceptable for Quebec, or 
Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member, who is a friend, is aware of this 
saga in which a lot of time was wasted. Every time Quebec tried 
to find its niche in this regime, and every time promises were 
made and federal politicians talked about a new place for 
Quebec within Confederation, every time that happened, our 
province was put back in its place. (English follows)
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, first I would thank the hon. 
member for his compliment. I know he was sincere in that. I too 
have respect for him and the work we have done together.
<P>
	Being inexperienced, it is difficult to express yourself in such 
a way that you do not offend. You lay out what you believe in. I 
think it is time we did that. We have to lay out here what we 
believe in.
<P>
	I go back to Thomas D'Arcy McGee. I see in this life a 
generation of industrious, contented, moral men and women 
free in name, men and women capable of maintaining in peace 
and in war a Constitution worthy of such a country. That is the 
important thing.
<P>
	What we have built for 127 years is important to preserve. We 
in Alberta may have differences of opinion with the federal 
government, as we do. You have a difference with the federal 
government in Quebec, as you do. We should fight together to 
make the sum total stronger than any one of the individual parts. 
That is the message we are trying to share.
<P>
	All the examples that the hon. member gave us about what did 
not work and the reports and commissions that did not work 
were all examples of a top down approach to democracy, a top 
down approach of trying to deliver goods and services to what 
the people want. We in the Reform Party, as do the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois, recognize that it does not work.
<P>
	Why not pool our resources in opposition, fight for Quebec 
and fight for our areas we represent against the government to 
show that a bottom up approach-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, your time 
has expired. I have gone over.
<P>
	The Reform Party has advised the Chair that it wishes to split 
its time. I do not see any other Reform members prepared for 
debate. Questions and comments are finished. They are splitting 
their time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4924"> 4924 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, if we have a half hour allotted to 
us and I split my time and my colleague for whatever reason is 
unattainable, is that time still allowed to me so I can finish off a 
proper answer and continue comments and questions? Would 
there be unanimous consent to continue comments and 
questions until our time is up?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> If we have unanimous 
consent the hon. member for Calgary North may use the 14 
minutes allotted to him. Do we have unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Returning to debate, the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to basically finish the 
remarks I made earlier to the hon. member of the Bloc 
Quebecois. What is important about today and what is important 
about the future of Canada is that we have to get out into the 
open the essence of what is at stake.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The consequences of separation are uncertain. It is the 
uncertainty that we must approach. It is the uncertainty that we 
have to deal with. All the questions I raised in my speech were 
general questions. The specifics of them and the other side of 
them will come about if, as and when Quebec decides its future. 
We will be ready for those. As our leader pointed out, we will 
have a lot more work done on them and a lot more solutions 
through the task forces that we are presenting.
<P>
	On a point of order, Madam Speaker, may I relinquish the 
remainder of my time to my hon. colleague who is now present 
to give her 10-minute speech with no comments and questions 
to allow for the last 10 minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Do we have unanimous 
consent to return to the original scheduling of the debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I give consent on a 
condition. The member already used a few minutes so the next 
member may have the remaining time and not necessarily the 10 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Do we have unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
motion before us today reaffirms the desire of Canadians to 
remain federally united as one people and asks the House to 
support them in that desire.
<P>
	Surely nothing could be a higher priority for those of us who 
have accepted positions of trust and responsibility in the 
Parliament of Canada than to preserve and protect the unity and 
character of the country we have been elected to serve.
<P>
	Unity is more than an abstract concept, more than some ideal 
detached from practical realities. There are things that unify 
people in the structure and operations of a federation. Citizens 
must realize concrete benefits from their association in the 
confederation.
<P>
	In Canada our social support systems have for decades been 
an important element in making us the envy of the world. 
Unfortunately our current economic situation has eroded those 
traditional support systems. In light of this our citizens want to 
be assured that leaders of the new Canada of the 21st century 
will act and act decisively to ensure they continue to benefit 
from affordable and sustainable social services.
<P>
	A fresh approach to the delivery of social programs is 
imperative for one simple reason. Our country's financial 
resources are being increasingly drained away by Canada's huge 
debt. Over one-quarter of our total spending is paid out in 
interest every year, a whopping $41 billion this year alone on the 
more than $500 billion which was borrowed by past 
Conservative and Liberal governments.
<P>
	Incredibly this present government intends to borrow a 
further $100 billion which will diminish our cash resources by 
an additional $4 billion to $6 billion each year in higher interest 
charges. These are billions of dollars that will be lost when we 
need to fund health care, pensions and education for Canadian 
citizens.
<P>
	For more than two decades those we have elected to manage 
the affairs of this great nation have seen fit to violate the most 
basic rule of sound fiscal management, living within one's 
means.
<P>
	In order to buy the goodwill of every interest group in society 
and to fund extravagant and wasteful government, Conservative 
and Liberal decision makers have placed a mortgage on our 
country which as of today stands at nearly $518 billion. That is 
more than $18,000 for every man, woman and child in Canada. 
We owe almost $1,500 more every single second than we did the 
second before. In fact, in the time it takes me to complete my 
remarks in today's debate, our country's debt will have shot up 
by nearly a million dollars.
<P>
	This incredible mismanagement and the resulting debt has 
severely reduced our ability to pay the cost of the social 
programs that we have enjoyed in the past.
<P>
	With this evidence before them of instability and 
unsustainability of current social programs, it is no wonder 
many Canadians are losing faith in our federal system.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	It is no wonder they believe a united Canada offers little long 
term personal benefit in return for the huge long term liabilities 
it has amassed.
<P>
	As services are reduced so is the incentive to stay together as a 
country. Raising taxes with decreased benefit to the citizens 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4925"> 4925 </A></B>
<P>
being taxed has throughout history  been a sure fire recipe for 
social and civil unrest, instability and eventually even revolt.
<P>
	If Canadians willingly continue to turn over a large amount of 
their earnings to the federal government, they will expect value 
for their money. Canadians have in the past been proud and 
thankful for the fact that they can rely on programs to ensure that 
their basic needs will be met when they are most vulnerable, 
when they are young, old, sick or destitute.
<P>
	It worries many of us when services and benefits are wasted 
on those who do not truly need them. For too long our political 
leaders seem to have lacked the will to make the hard choices, 
the courage to do the right thing, to put social programs on a 
sound financial footing for the long term.
<P>
	Reformers believe that Canadians want to preserve federal 
funding in support of health care, advanced education, the child 
benefit, the guaranteed income supplement for seniors, 
veterans' pensions and old age security for households below 
the national average household income.
<P>
	They believe their contributions to the Canada pension plan 
should be managed in such a way as to ensure that benefits will 
be available to them in their retirement years. This means that 
there will be less money available for OAS for seniors with a 
household income above the national average, for federal 
support for UIC and to some extent for welfare and equalization 
payments.
<P>
	Canadians are committed to caring for those who cannot care 
for themselves, the most vulnerable members of society, but 
they know we cannot possibly sustain our present social 
program spending without some intelligent priorization and 
reorganization.
<P>
	Unfortunately in spite of the current roles with our shaky 
social safety net, our federal government continues to refuse to 
take the bold steps necessary to save it. When others like the 
Reform Party offer specific and concrete proposals designed to 
preserve and protect essential services, they are derided and met 
with fearmongering.
<P>
	One particular blatant example of this attitude is our present 
health minister labelling those who want changes designed to 
preserve health care funding as advocating a two-tier health 
care system. She knows full well there are at least 10 tiers of 
health care in this country, her own privileged access to DND 
medical services being one of them.
<P>
	The ministers of the government should fear the 
consequences of not acting to bring about the change. 
Threatening provinces will accomplish very little. What are 
Canadians to think when the cost of services goes up? The level 
of services goes down but they are told that constructive 
proposals for better management are harsh and unfair.
<P>
	An explicit element of the Reform Party motion being debated 
today is recognition of and support for the desire of Canadians to 
remain federally united as one people, committed to sustaining 
social services. We believe present and future Canadians could 
count on receiving the services they most need and want if we 
took the following steps.
<P>
	First, reorganize contributory social programs like UIC and 
the Canada pension plan so that they pay for themselves. Our 
unfunded CPP is a political and fiscal time bomb. The Reform 
Party believes that Canadians need the financial security which 
would be provided if CPP were fully funded. If this does not 
happen, the CPP premiums of working Canadians will be hiked, 
something that is already happening. CPP premiums started out 
at 3.6 per cent of income and today they are 5.2 per cent. By 
2016, premiums are expected to be 10 per cent of income.
<P>
	Second, focus the benefits of non-contributory social 
programs like old age security on households whose incomes are 
below the national average Canadian family income. With good 
management, we can continue to assist seniors who need help 
from society. We cannot do this if we give away money to 
citizens who are not in need.
<P>
	Third, give students and job trainees a greater say in how 
education dollars are allocated by the use of education vouchers. 
Let user needs and demand drive the provision of education 
services rather than automatically awarding institutions scarce 
funds without reference to provision of effective training.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Fourth, amend the Canada Health Act to allow provinces more 
flexibility in the funding of health services to better rationalize 
diminishing resources and ensure that essential services can be 
maintained.
<P>
	No one should be denied adequate health care in Canada 
because of inability to pay. It is clear that if we want to count on 
this we can no longer afford to pay 100 per cent of the cost of 100 
per cent of the services for 100 per cent of the people regardless 
of need.
<P>
	It fools no one to pretend that nothing has to change in the 
provision of health care services. Rather, we ought to honestly 
face the new realities and work to ensure that Canadians can 
have confidence that certain core services will be maintained 
and indeed be sustainable in the long term.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians want to live in a country whose social 
spending is organized fairly so that we pay our own way. We 
expected individuals, groups, governments and our country as a 
whole to operate under that principle. We know that if we do we 
have ample wealth to preserve and sustain essential social 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4926"> 4926 </A></B>
<P>
program spending and fulfil the obligation of any civilized 
society to care for those who cannot care for themselves.
<P>
	I challenge members of the House, the leaders and elected 
representatives of the people of Canada, to work together to 
build a new Canada to meet the challenges of the 21st century, 
including managed essential social programs secured for this 
and future generations of citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Madam Speaker, 
before I begin my speech, I want to inform the House that 
government members will be dividing their allotted time into 
10-minute speeches and 5-minute periods for questions and 
comments, except ministers who will take up all of the allotted 
time pursuant to the Standing Orders.
<P>
	I have had the honour of representing the people of 
Saint-Léonard since 1984. During that time, I have never 
forgotten for one minute that, since the birth of Canada, 
generation after generation of members have sat in this House to 
express their pride and their confidence in Canada.
<P>
	These men and women, of different ages and different 
backgrounds, also come from the various regions that make up 
one of the largest countries in the world. Too few of them 
represented in the past or represent today the people who lived 
here hundreds of years before the first European even set foot on 
this continent.
<P>
	All of these people, whose memories are still with us here, 
today, belonged to different political parties which took part in 
some pretty vicious sparring matches. As you know, Madam 
Speaker, unanimity is not the rule in this House. It is more the 
exception. However, members who sat in this House until 
recently all shared the same desire to serve their constituents 
and to contribute to the growth and unity of Canada.
<P>
	In time of peace as in time of war, in time of prosperity as in 
time of economic crisis, every generation of members has 
strived to make Canada one of the most prosperous, peaceful 
and admired countries in the world.
<P>
	Our sovereignty as a nation and our maturity as a society have 
gradually, patiently and relentlessly been built by those who 
believed in the rule of law, the invincibility of justice and 
respect for our differences, those who know the value of 
experience, efforts, destiny and solidarity. It is now our turn to 
add to this magnificent institution designed by our predecessors 
who also laid out the foundations.
<P>
	Whether we were born in Senneterre or in Siculiana, in 
Saskatchewan or in Sicily, whether we speak English with a 
Bonaventure accent or French with a Berlitz accent, in our own 
way, we all say the same thing.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Like thousands of other hon. members before us and like 
millions of Canadians, we say that, today and yesterday, this is 
the country that we love, this is the great and magnificent 
country that we want to protect.
<P>
	Since the last election, there is in this House a group of 
members whose numbers are large enough to form the Official 
Opposition and whose ambition is to put an end to the Canadian 
experiment. I respect unreservedly and unhesitatingly the 
decision of many Quebec constituents to send separatist 
members here, in Ottawa.
<P>
	All Bloc Quebecois members were elected here as were the 
members of the Liberal Party, of the Reform Party and of other 
political groupings. These federal separatist members speak, 
sometimes with emotion, of the need to protect bilingualism in 
the Canadian Armed Forces and to take care of our Canadian 
publishers. But nobody in this House nor elsewhere in Canada 
has any illusion about the real objectives of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The Bloc Quebecois does not say this in so many words, but 
what they want is to destroy Canada, since Canada without 
Quebec will not be Canada any more.
<P>
	The Bloc members claim to be good surgeons. They want us to 
believe that, with the help of the PQ, their big brother, they 
would be able to painlessly sever one of the parts of the 
Canadian Federation. The operation could be a success; the only 
problem is that the patient, that is Canada, will die.
<P>
	Now, these few members of the Bloc are protesting their 
temporary patriotism, even boasting about it. This is the first 
stage of the surgical operation they want to do. This is what I call 
the anaesthetic.
<P>
	But I can assure you that nobody will be beguiled by this. 
Quebecers, the sons and daughters of explorers, of discoverers, 
of inventors will never turn their backs on the country which 
gave them the freedom, the wealth and the dignity to grow up 
and develop.
<P>
	I think that the presence among us, in this Parliament, of 
members who claim to be able to represent Her Majesty's loyal 
opposition while working towards the break-up of Canada could 
have a beneficial effect on all Canadians, particularly on 
Quebecers. By reminding us every day of what we could lose as 
Quebecers if Canada broke up, members of the Bloc, who are 
allies of the <I>Parti québécois</I>, help us to better appreciate the 
value of our Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	And because of the presence here of separatist members, all 
Canadians are finally becoming aware that Canada's unity and 
the preservation of our cultural heritage and of our economic 
security are not a problem unique to Quebec.
<P>
	In the 1980 referendum, a majority of Quebecers reiterated 
their attachment to Canada before the whole world. Of course, 
we have important problems to solve, and a lot of these stem 
directly from the relationship between Quebec and the rest of 
Canada, but the Bloc is  not a remedy for Quebec's problems. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4927"> 4927 </A></B>
<P>
is partly a symptom of the frustration that many Quebecers feel 
because of our failure to break the constitutional deadlock. Yet, 
the Bloc has done nothing to help solve these problems.
<P>
	Similarly, the Reform Party is not a remedy for Canada's 
problems. It is largely a symptom of the impatience that many 
Canadians feel because of economic and political problems for 
which the Reform Party offers no solution.
<P>
	You cannot cure a disease simply by monitoring the 
symptoms. We need to have the courage to solve the problems 
that hinder our progress as a federation and the wisdom to 
preserve that which made Canada one of the greatest success 
stories in the history of mankind.
<P>
	I speak French and I am proud of it; my wife and my children 
speak French and are also proud of it. We are Quebecers as well 
as Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	For me and for all my family, the knowledge of the French 
language and the bonds of friendship it enabled us to form have 
become deep roots. The French language has been for us the 
passport to contributing to a generous and dynamic society, the 
only French society in America, that welcomed us with open 
arms.
<P>
	My deepest wish and my strongest resolve as a member of 
Parliament and as a Canadian citizen will always be to have the 
privilege to be able to contribute to the security of Quebec and to 
the unity of Canada. Earlier I heard my colleague from the Bloc 
list all the constitutional conferences that came close to giving 
Canada a new constitution. He forgot that during these 30 years, 
during which we were regrettably unable to solve our 
constitutional problems, some things helped Quebec develop 
itself. The Quebec Pension Plan and the agreement on 
immigration, for example, are two of them. At present, there is 
also the three-level infrastructure program that is working well.
<P>
	During that time, Quebec developed. What programs, what 
things prevent Quebec from developing and being a dynamic 
society within a Canadian federation? I am proud to be a 
Quebecer, but I am also proud to be a Canadian. I will always 
work very democratically. I have always felt much respect for 
those who, even in this House, are using all the tools they have to 
defend their cause; but democratically, like the Bloc Quebecois, 
I will fight to keep this country united and to ensure that Quebec 
is strong, but within the Canadian federation.
<P>
	That was the dream of the founding fathers of this country; 
that is the dream that we too, as members of Parliament, must 
pursue every day and at every opportunity, for the preservation 
of this country. We must recognize that, in spite of all our 
problems, millions of people would give up everything they 
have to come and live here in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
pretty clear that the hon. member for Saint-Léonard is not very 
knowledgeable about surgical procedures. We found out not 
long ago that he is a chartered accountant, and I think he should 
have stuck to his speciality. If he looked at what is happening in 
Canada and Quebec from the accountant's point of view, he 
would realize that Canada has the largest foreign debt of any 
country today.
<P>
	Current interest rates are not going down, because 45 per cent 
of Canada's debt is covered by foreign loans and lenders are 
starting to have a substantial part of their portfolio invested in 
Canadian loans. According to the last budget, the government 
will have a deficit for many years and it will be extremely 
difficult to control government spending when in addition to 
being unable to manage areas that are a federal responsibility, 
the federal government regularly decides to encroach on 
jurisdictions belonging to the provinces, in the belief it can do 
better.
<P>
	This week in <I>Le Devoir</I>, Lise Bissonnette gave the following 
analysis. The federal government has decided to intervene in 
literacy programs. Quebec already spends $63 million, and now 
the federal government is going to add $2.5 million! Two and a 
half million, with probably one million spent on advertising, 
with a lengthy press release from the Department of Foreign 
Affairs-does the federal government already consider Quebec 
to be a foreign country?-plus the whole federal-provincial 
bureaucracy, because in the final instance, after a lot of 
discussion, the federal government acknowledged this came 
under Quebec's jurisdiction and that it was necessary to 
co-ordinate approaches and agree on certain criteria. A host of 
officials met for months to try and agree on these criteria.
<P>
	And after all that, about $25,000 per school board in Quebec 
may be spent on literacy training!
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	My goodness, $25,000! This is less than the annual salary of a 
teacher, but the federal government will probably spend more 
than $2.5 million on advertising to give $25,000 per school 
board. How can someone who is a professional accountant 
lecture us on surgical procedures? Give us a break! I hope that in 
his next speech, the hon. member for Saint-Léonard will stick to 
dollars and cents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments on my accounting expertise even if I have been out of 
practice for the last ten years. The member says it shows. 
Perhaps.
<P>
	When it suits them, the Bloc Quebecois often uses the same 
argument as the Reform Party on the national debt. They bring 
that argument forward in order to make their point. But the 
member knows very well that I am aware he has a sound 
economic background and is very familiar with the national debt 
system. We are not dealing only with the federal debt. Quebec, 
which is developing in all its splendour, also has a debt as do all  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4928"> 4928 </A></B>
<P>
other provinces and even every country in the world. This is part 
of our system.
<P>
	We might also show that the problem of the debt has played a 
role in the development of Canada and Quebec. We enjoy a high 
quality of life. For the second consecutive year, the United 
Nations have declared Canada the country enjoying the best 
quality of life in the world. Talking about our financial 
problems, I hope the member will also acknowledge the fact that 
we have the best system and the highest quality of life in the 
world. Those things must be said. The Canadian experience has 
not been all negative. It has been good to us. The hon. member 
talks about interest rates. He wants me to talk about economy 
and finance.
<P>
	When I arrived to Canada in 1958-my time has expired but I 
would like to have two more seconds-Montreal was the 
metropolis of Canada. All the large companies had their 
corporate offices in Montreal. The people across have been 
trying to separate Quebec from Canada for the last 30 years and 
during that time, Montreal has lost its title of metropolis. It has 
become the metropolis of poverty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Madam 
Speaker, a German federal minister was telling me the other day 
that after the war, when the allies decided to give Germany a new 
system of government, they opted for a federal system because it 
would give more flexibility to the various parts, provide a better 
balance between stronger regions and weaker ones, and also 
because it had worked particularly well in several countries, 
namely Switzerland, the United States and Canada.
<P>
	Among all these countries, Canada is certainly the most 
decentralized. Having a very complex Constitution dating back 
to colonial times, it is a difficult country to govern. Certainly, 
Descartes would have concluded that the Canadian system of 
government is unpractical and that Canada, as is it, is impossible 
to govern.
<P>
	The Canadian system defies the rationalism of constitutional 
and governmental concepts. The miracle is that-despite some 
frustrations and a scattered population over an immense 
territory, despite regional disparities that resist all our efforts, 
despite the formidable obstacles we are faced with every 
day-Canada has not only survived, but progressed in a unique 
way among world nations.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The descendants of the two founding peoples, who had fought 
each other in the past, have chosen against all odds to build a 
new country based on peace, fraternity and sharing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The miracle of Canada is that it was born in peace. It has 
endured in peace inspired by a spirit of freedom, of justice and 
of tolerance. Indeed, viewed from afar, from the point of view of 
a stranger, our so-called quarrels, our so-called bickerings and 
debates, our verbal battles every day seem so picayune, so futile, 
so small.
<P>
	Having had the chance over the years of listening to a number 
of citizens from various countries of the world, I know how 
surprised, indeed astounded, they are at our endless family 
debates. I see it in their eyes. I see it in their expressions. They 
view us as spoiled children who cannot appreciate the measure 
of our countless blessings and advantages.
<P>
	We enjoy the special blessings of wide open spaces, the 
immensity and ever changing beauty of our landscapes and 
seascapes. We enjoy the quality of life only a rich and privileged 
country can offer. Above all, we share the valuable wealth of 
enduring values which have stood the test of time and common 
sacrifices: values of humility as a people, values of generosity 
within our community and toward others, a continuing ideal of 
social justice in spite of the inevitable hurdles of colour, of creed 
and of economic constraints.
<P>
	The fabric of our values is enduring. It is firm. It is steady. 
The fibre of Canadian unity runs very deep. It may be quiet and 
understated but it is extremely strong.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Those who seek to destabilize Canada and to reject this 
common heritage bear an immense responsibility towards our 
fellow citizens. Sadly, I listen day after day to the laments of 
Bloc members who attack Canada and the federal system. All 
the ills that plague Quebec, so we heard earlier today, can be 
attributed to the federal system.
<P>
	Independence will solve everything. This will be heaven on 
earth. Soon, it will be perfect bliss. The new independent 
Quebec will build the nirvana. Whoever sounds a warning, even 
an institution like the Bank of Montreal the other day, is reviled 
and there is a general outcry. Immediately, separatist forces call 
for a boycott by the people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Those who would destroy the country, its heritage of values, 
its system of shared wealth, its balance of equity and fairness, 
hold a very deep responsibility to not only their fellow citizens 
in their own province but to all citizens of Canada. Inevitably 
separation and the risks of it, the recklessness of it, will not only 
bring economic hardship but will tear people apart within our 
communities, within Quebec; not only there, but province 
against province, destabilization of a wonderful country, the 
separation of the maritimes from Ontario, the geographical 
tearing apart of a country which has shared a wonderful destiny 
for nearly 13 decades.

<P>
	Those of us who have been given the privilege of preserving 
this country, of preserving values we have shared for 127 years, 
must be prepared to defend these ideals fiercely, passionately. 
Madam Speaker, fraternity is a lot more productive, a lot 
healthier than internal squabbles! A lot more productive, a lot 
healthier than division! A lot more productive, a lot healthier 
than destruction! It is a lot more productive, a lot healthier to 
build bridges than to dig trenches to separate us!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is it not better to do than to undo, to rise beyond and above 
instead of bickering and bemoaning, to work toward the 
common will instead of for sectarian objectives and interests, to 
build bridges that will unite us and cross the differences between 
us rather than walls which will separate a few of us from the 
others and tear us apart?
<P>
	I believe passionately in Canada because Canada is a kind 
country, a generous country. It has been very generous to me and 
to my family. Quebec has also been generous to me and I cannot 
conceive of Canada without Quebec. Quebec is wise. It is 
vibrant. It is dynamic. It brings a difference to Canada that 
makes it unique.
<P>
	Those of us who believe in our country have to fight 
passionately for the ideal of preserving a country that is blessed 
among all. I share the profound wish that Canada live long and 
that Quebec always be a vibrant part of it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am please to respond to my Liberal colleague. As long as we 
have known him, either as a member of the National Assembly 
or as a member of this Parliament, we have grown accustomed to 
his lyrical speeches which bear no meaningful relationship to 
the political realities and debate now taking place in Quebec and 
in Canada.
<P>
	A while ago, he called us prophets of doom and individuals 
who have taken a hard-line approach with financial institutions. 
I would remind him that each time financial institutions take it 
upon themselves to get involved in political debates that 
concern Quebecers and their democratic right to choose 
sovereignty, it will be our duty to single them out and to 
denounce their activities, since they should normally be 
confining themselves to economic and financial analysis.
<P>
	Let us look at the financial institutions which have over the 
past two years harshly criticized in their reports the sovereignty 
option. The list includes the Royal Bank, the Bank of Montreal, 
the CIBC and Scotiabank. When we look at the list of major 
contributors to the Liberal Party of Canada, we will find the 
names of the Royal Bank, the Bank of Montreal, the CIBC and 
Scotiabank. These are financial institutions which supposedly 
conduct objective analyses.
<P>
	Considering that these financial institutions make substantial 
contributions to Liberal Party coffers-and I am not talking here 
about small donations of $2,000 or $3,000 dollars, but about 
$35,000 to $47,000 per year-I would not be surprised to learn 
that the Prime Minister and these financial institutions hold 
regular, open discussions on the national unity issue.
<P>
	Therefore, enough about the freedom of financial institutions 
to wade into a political debate. They do not have the right to get 
involved and we doubt their credibility. Personally, I intend, 
along with all my sovereigntist colleagues, to openly denounce 
in the coming months any political involvement not clearly 
based on a serious analysis, whether financial or economic, of 
the situation.
<P>
	Earlier, the Liberal Party whip spoke about the fact that we 
were all one big family. Let me just say in conclusion that the 
lyrical speech about Canada which the hon. member has just 
given us is without foundation. It has no basis in fact.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	We should look at the real problems facing this country. If you 
are true Canadians and if you want to build a new Canada 
without Quebec, look at the problems now facing Canada, 
economic problems keeping the unemployment rate at 11 per 
cent, one of the highest rates in the Western world.
<P>
	Look at the debt rate. Canada is the second most indebted 
nation in the world and the finance minister's budget will not 
solve the problem. A week or so ago, the C.D. Howe Institute 
strongly reminded us that the finance minister's budget will not 
do anything to bring public finances under control, does not 
contain any measure except for undermining the rights of the 
unemployed and cutting their benefits by $5.5 billion over the 
next three years. As a whole, the budget is so lacking in 
credibility that the extra interest charges alone will just about 
cancel out the savings achieved on the backs of the unemployed.
<P>
	Look at how much Canada invests in worker training and 
compare its record with that of the other industrialized countries 
that take control of their own destinies and manage to meet the 
challenges of internationalization. Look at Canada's child 
poverty rate. When the UN told them Canada had one of the 
highest child poverty rates, the Tories were so ashamed-and 
you too, I think, because you perpetuated the situation-that 
they changed the formula used to determine the poverty rate. 
That is Canada's reality.

<P>
	If you continue with your lyrical speeches-since I have 
known you, all your speeches have been lyrical-nothing 
concrete has ever been put on the table and I am not surprised by 
your arguments-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I remind the hon. 
member that comments must be addressed to the Chair and not 
directly to the member. I was not indicating that your time was 
up, but I also wanted to tell you that your comments must deal 
with the speech made by the previous speaker.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has the floor, very briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, that is not very fair. The Bloc 
member took up all my time. Am I not entitled to two minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There must be 
unanimous consent of the House to extend your speaking time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Do we have unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, we would also like to be 
able to ask a short question following the hon. member's answer.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, I am afraid 
we cannot extend the debate indefinitely. The parliamentary 
secretary has about 30 or 45 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> It just shows the arrogance of the Bloc 
Quebecois. He accuses me of being a lyrical speaker, a speaker 
lyrique.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would rather be a lyrical speaker than a bitter one. I would 
rather be lyrical than always try to pick quarrels with all those 
who do not agree with me. The financial institutions which 
denounce the Parti Quebecois do not have the right to make 
political statements. We must remember that. According to the 
hon. member, they do not have the right to make political 
statements. The Bank of Montreal does not count as they are 
anglos. The same goes for the Royal Bank.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> I did not interrupt the hon. member. He should 
at least have the courtesy of listening to others. It just shows 
their arrogance; they never want to listen to others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
wonder if I might have the consent of the House, as I asked 
earlier, to ask a short question. The other hon. member took so 
much time and made a statement rather than asking a question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am afraid it is 
impossible to extend the hon. member's time. If you ask a 
question there must be a response.
<P>
	Do we have unanimous consent to extend the time for a 
question and response?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Thank you, Madam Chairman. I will be brief.
<P>
	The hon. member in his statement mentioned that the Bloc is 
not correct in suggesting that if Quebec separated from Canada 
everything would be heaven. I agree with his statement.
<P>
	However there are a lot of Canadians both in Quebec and 
outside Quebec who are concerned because our economy may be 
going to the other place. I am not talking about the Senate when I 
say ``the other place''.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	I wonder what the hon. member might offer in the way of 
some economic hope that would make all of us want to stay in 
Canada and have none of us worry about going to that other 
place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, very briefly I refer the hon. 
member to a headline today in <I>Quorum</I>: ``Economy outpaces 
Martin's budget forecast''. Canada will have growth of 3.9 per 
cent estimated in the coming year. We have taken over a country 
with a very bad economic forecast. We have committed 
ourselves to reduce the budget to 3 per cent of GNP within three 
years. We are going to do this. Things are going to get better 
under the Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to rise to speak to the motion by the hon. member for 
Calgary Southwest that we affirm our desire for unity as a 
federal state. Specifically I would like to address the clause of 
the motion that we affirm the equality and uniqueness of all our 
citizens and provinces.
<P>
	The equality of citizens is at the heart of a fundamental 
principle of democracy and one that I put to members we have 
drifted from in recent years, at least some would say the elite 
have drifted from as a country toward a concept called group 
rights.
<P>
	In the Charlottetown accord we had this concept becoming 
more and more a proposal to entrench that kind of concept in our 
Constitution, where rights of citizens are determined not 
regardless of race, language, culture or gender but because of 
them. This commentary, this observation is not simply my own. 
The former leader of the Liberal Party, Mr. Trudeau, noticed this 
during that period when he talked about the hierarchy of rights 
embedded in the accord.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4931"> 4931 </A></B>
<P>
	What this trend toward group rights has done, in our view, is 
not just detract from the fundamental principle of the individual 
and the individual's rights within the collectivity but has also 
had the effect, in our view, of a loss of our greater sense of 
collective identity as a nation.
<P>
	I would reflect on Andrew Coyne's editorial yesterday in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> where he noted that group rights and its linkage 
to comprehensive philosophy of political victimology had led us 
to see ourselves increasingly as a nation of victim groups and 
ultimately as a victim nation, one without identity or power.
<P>
	As Reformers we propose that we get back to the roots of 
liberal democracy, that we reaffirm the principles of democracy 
in a modern age and manifest political equality through 
institutional reform. Specifically we advocate free votes for the 
people's representatives in the Parliament of Canada, direct 
democracy among the population at large, introducing in the 
modern age with our educated populations mechanisms of 
referendum, initiative and recall, and even in the area of 
constitutional change, mechanisms like constitutional 
conventions and popular ratification.
<P>
	The equality of citizens does not preclude the uniqueness of 
citizens. We hear objections whenever we raise this point. We 
recognize there are all kinds of communal and individual 
identities within the country. We are suggesting the Government 
of Canada should concentrate its efforts on the responsibility for 
the promotion of our collective identity as a nation rather than 
the focus it has had in the past generation on things like official 
multiculturalism or the promotion of Canada as a federation of 
two founding peoples: the English and the French.
<P>
	In our view we should be going toward more race, culture, 
language neutral concepts of our nationhood. Defining a country 
as a union of founding peoples, English and French, in this day 
and age is to Reformers as ridiculous as it would be to define it 
as a nation of two founding religions: the Protestants and the 
Catholics.
<P>
	I would also like to speak about the equality of provinces, the 
second portion of that clause. This refers, in our view, to what is 
a fundamental principle of a federation. The fact that we are a 
federation of provinces was clearly recognized in the 1867 
Confederation constitution and quite properly so since it 
superseded the disastrous binational unitary state of 1841 to 
1867. In Canada we have not always lived up to the concept of 
equality of provinces. My province of Alberta and the prairie 
provinces generally were deliberately created as inferior 
political units after Confederation, an error that was not 
corrected for decades.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	At all times, because of the way our parliamentary system 
unfolded, small provinces have found themselves at the federal 
level subjected to the domination of the central provinces of 
Ontario and Quebec through the systematic skew of power in the 
House of Commons and  the decline of the Senate as an effective 
political institution.
<P>
	Later all provinces, even the large provinces, have found 
problems in the federation as an increasingly unbalanced federal 
spending power has been able to override clear areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. This breakdown of division of powers 
has occurred for both the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	We propose as Reformers to reaffirm our commitment to 
provincial equality through institutional reform and also 
through re-establishing a balanced division of powers in the 
federation. I have spoken many times in the House of our hope to 
reform the Senate based on the triple-E model, to restore the 
Senate as an effective second Chamber through electing 
senators and providing equal representation to the provinces. In 
other words, we want a Senate that is the kind of effective 
regional Chamber that the Fathers of Confederation had 
intended so that in the Parliament of Canada federal 
law-making is more than a simple domination of small 
provinces by large provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This concern for regional representation is not only a matter 
for small provinces; it is also a concern for small regions in large 
provinces like British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec as well. 
Indeed, we hope to have a provision in a reformed Senate for 
regional representation within large provinces, for example, for 
the Gaspé and the North Shore in Quebec or for northern 
Ontario.
<P>
	Of course, when we speak of the equality of provinces in this 
motion, we also speak of their uniqueness. Our critics will say, 
``Of course you just want to see Quebec as a province like the 
others.'' Of course not. Equality does not mean identity. The 
federal principle does not mean that the provinces are identical; 
it means that they share certain values and policies, for example, 
the economic criteria mentioned in the motion, but the federal 
principle also means that provinces have their distinct character 
and uniqueness through the division of powers in a federal state. 
Canada's uniqueness includes, for example, such things as the 
cultural realities in the province of Quebec, language, of course, 
and certain geographical realities such as natural resources in 
the western provinces. In a federal state, these things should be 
in provincial jurisdiction and the division of power should be 
respected in a developed federal state.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I have spoken in the context both of equality 
and uniqueness of provinces, of many things that are in Canada 
today and also things we would like to see changed. Some of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4932"> 4932 </A></B>
<P>
changes I have mentioned are mere policy matters. Others 
would be more serious constitutional changes at some point.
<P>
	I remind all members, in conclusion, that all serious 
constitutional change, all constitutional change, anything that 
would significantly change in our federation the status of any 
citizen or any province requires respect for democracy, for the 
Constitution and for the rule of law.  It is not compatible with 
unilateral or illegal actions. I expect that as we debate our future 
in the next few months that the expectation of all Canadians will 
be that we continue to function in the context of a constitutional 
democracy and we will all respect the rule of law.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, I just have to 
say how baffled I am by the fact that this motion is being 
presented on the floor of the House today.
<P>
	My goodness, over the course of the election campaign that 
we just fought the only thing I agreed with the Reform 
opposition was the fact that the Canadian people are tired of 
discussions about unity and the Constitution. Yet here in the 
House the Reform Party presents the motion to us.
<P>
	More and more I am aware of confusion. I hear the Reform 
Party saying: ``We are against the process, the top down 
approach that this government is taking''. Yet as we take the 
approach of reviewing our social safety net that is inclusive of 
Canadian people, that encourages them to come and debate with 
us, they say: ``That is not good enough. We want strong and firm 
action. The government must take action in this regard''. I do 
not understand the difference.
<P>
	In his speech the hon. member talked about the difficulties we 
face with approaching group dynamics and looking at people as 
groups. Yet in their motion, the Reform members talk about 
diversity. To me diversity means understanding individual 
differences, talking about those differences and knowing that by 
encouraging parts and bringing them together as a sum we get 
far greater results in the whole.
<P>
	I am very confused by the motion. The hon. leader of the third 
party talks about a new Canada. My God, what is wrong with the 
Canada that has grown and developed over the last 127 years, a 
Canada of compassion and generosity?
<P>
	The member talks about debt and deficit. I thought the 
member had seen the light, had seen that there are important 
additions to governing a country, not only the importance of 
debt and deficit management but the importance of issues that 
face individual Canadians as human beings. I thought he had 
seen that light. Yet we go back to that same old conversation. I 
am confused, totally confused.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I would agree 
strongly with the hon. member that she is confused. In fact she is 
so confused that I was barely able to understand the last half of 
that intervention.
<P>
	However I will comment on the initial point which I think was 
important, and that is the issue of constitutional change and 
when and how we should pursue it.
<P>
	Our party did say during the election campaign, as did the 
government, that Canadians were not interested in discussions 
of comprehensive constitutional change at this time. I would 
certainly agree with that. I think our priorities should be 
elsewhere.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have to face the reality we have here. We 
have a party in the House which day after day is talking about the 
most dramatic and wide-ranging constitutional changes 
possible and that is the disintegration, separation, division, 
redivision of the federal state into two completely separate 
states, one which would presumably be a unitary state in Quebec 
and the other which as yet is undefined.
<P>
	We hear this daily. We are heading into an election in Quebec 
where this will be an issue. Of course the separatists do not want 
to describe this as constitutional change because they realize it 
would immediately raise in the minds of the population of 
Quebec all the complexities and difficulties that are involved in 
that. The fact is that Quebecers are going to be asked very 
shortly to discuss constitutional change once again and to 
discuss it in the context of all the problems that exist with 
federalism.
<P>
	We recognize those problems are there. We advocate some 
solutions to them. I am merely pointing out in my statement that 
we do have some constitutional perspectives here. We also have 
some things we would like to change about the country that can 
be pursued outside the constitutional framework.
<P>
	The whole purpose of the motion while obviously not entering 
into constitutional negotiations is to raise the fact that there are 
alternative constitutional perspectives, including reforming 
ones, that do not require the kind of upheaval that separatism 
would entail.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
Canada, indeed around the world, the common element that 
joins all human beings is that of our environment. We cannot 
avoid consuming air and water as we sustain our lives. All 
elements of our environment impact positively or negatively on 
these two essential ingredients of life.
<P>
	As I travel throughout my constituency, the people who are 
most interested in the issue of the environment are young 
people. Going from school to school I can count on the fact that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4933"> 4933 </A></B>
<P>
they will be bringing up the issue, not just with academic 
interest but with serious concern.
<P>
	I say time and time again in the House and in public speeches 
that the future of Canada is our young people. Their future is 
surely on my mind as I am delivering this speech today. We owe 
it to the young people of our great nation Canada to be deadly 
serious about protecting their future.
<P>
	I have been involved with both the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development and the Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources, especially on forestry issues, 
since the commencement of this Parliament. In that time I have 
become very aware of our environment which impacts the flow 
of air and water. It does not have anything to do with man-made 
political boundaries. These lines that have been arbitrarily 
drawn on a map do more to fragment or impair our ability to 
control our elements within our environment than any other 
force.
<P>
	In Canada competing provincial jurisdictions create an 
imbalance for industry and influence investment decisions 
being made by business. By way of example, as an alternate 
member on the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage I 
have looked at national park boundaries. Unique ecological 
realities are frequently dissected by those national park 
boundaries.
<P>
	Environmental events inside a park reflect what is happening 
outside a park simply because they are part of the same unique 
local ecology. Insects and disease that destroy our forests while 
developing within the national park boundaries can spread 
across that man-made line and destroy commercial forests. Of 
course the opposite may also be true. For example, river 
pollution from industry on the upstream side of a park can have 
severe consequences for wildlife and ecological balance within 
a national park.
<P>
	I cite these examples to underline current Canadian examples 
of the potential negative environmental results in fragmenting 
Canada by creating a sovereign state of Quebec. The arbitrary 
man-made boundaries, lines drawn on a map to carve the 
province of Quebec out of our great nation, cannot possibly give 
us any comfort from an environmental perspective. Political 
activists in Quebec want to develop control over their own 
geographic jurisdiction, including generation of their own 
environmental protection regulations.
<P>
	The point of my speech today is to talk about the 
environmental concerns facing our nation and show how a 
separate Quebec jurisdiction could have a harmful effect on that 
province and the remainder of Canada.
<P>
	I am not raising this point on the environment to tell tall tales 
of dark horses and earth shattering catastrophes but simply to 
outline all of the consequences a separate Quebec will have on 
our nation and that province.
<P>
	Here is a small sample of what has happened since the 
beginning of this parliamentary session. I say with the greatest 
respect to the Bloc Quebecois members on both the Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources and the Standing Committee 
on Environment and Sustainable Development that I have 
viewed their intercessions as being somewhat narrow and 
oriented only to Quebec.
<P>
	For example, our natural resources committee is studying 
responsible forestry management especially where so-called 
clear cut logging is used to answer the question: Is clear cut a 
legitimate tool that can be used by responsible professional 
foresters?
<P>
	We are trying to assist the Canadian forest service and the 
ministry of natural resources as they bring forward a 
Canada-wide position on sustainable forest practices in 
international meetings. Those meetings will be attempting to 
establish international standards for sustainable forest 
management. The standards will lead to ecological labelling for 
forest products world-wide.
<P>
	Placing a new international boundary between Canada and a 
new state of Quebec would simply complicate an already 
complex problem and divide our collective voice on the world 
stage. Will the province of Quebec, for example, as an 
independent state be prepared to utilize identical standards in 
international discussions on eco-labelling or would it be a 
competing voice to Canada?
<P>
	Healthy forests generate oxygen. It is the air we breathe. 
Creating a new political jurisdiction will do nothing to make me 
breathe any easier.
<P>
	The Liberals in their red book wanted to work toward the 
position of an environmental auditor general for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Following exhaustive hearings, the Standing Committee on 
the Environment and Sustainable Development produced a 
detailed report on the position of a commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development. The Liberal election 
promise called for an environmental auditor general. The 
decision to proceed with the position of the commissioner 
instead of an auditor general was a consensus decision that came 
from serious discussion following exhaustive hearings.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois committee members offered a dissenting 
opinion. While this dissenting opinion is a legitimate part of our 
national Canadian process, I know that if the Bloc Quebecois 
were representing an independent Quebec today we would not 
be proceeding with this very important function.
<P>
	My party supports one window environmental review for all 
provinces and our country as a whole. Could the Bloc possibly 
argue that the concept it represents is not myopic and unique to 
Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4934"> 4934 </A></B>
<P>
	It states in its conclusion: ``We feel, however, that the 
committee is paving the way for an organization that will only 
add to the jumble and confusion now prevalent in environmental 
matters''.
<P>
	The Bloc is concerned about a national Canadian government 
representing the second largest land mass on our globe having 
precedence over its smaller provincial jurisdiction. The danger 
is that smaller jurisdictions invariably lead to narrower 
approaches, never ending discussions and negotiations. This 
would ultimately lead to a compromise of independent nations 
that would do nothing but magnify the confusion which 
currently exists between the individual provinces and the 
Government of Canada on environmental issues.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the principle of sustainable 
environment which balances the need for a healthy environment 
with the continued progress and growth of Canada's economy. 
The Reform Party believes that environmental considerations 
must carry equal weight with the economic, social and technical 
considerations of any projects.
<P>
	In the same report I have been referring to on the 
commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, 
page 25, Reform committee members expressed the concern that 
Canadian industry might in the short term be put at a 
competitive disadvantage if Canada adopts the principles of 
green accounting ahead of other countries.
<P>
	When I refer to greening and green accounting, I am referring 
to new imaginative accounting practices and business practices 
that give specific dollar values to previously undefined 
environmental costs. These real costs appear on a business or a 
country's formal balance sheet. Premature independent 
greening of the Canadian system of national accounts could alter 
our gross national product and have the effect of discouraging 
domestic and foreign investors.
<P>
	In order for Canadian business to remain internationally 
competitive, the Reform Party believes it would be advisable 
that Canada not get too far ahead of its major trading partners in 
issues like greening of national accounts or imposition of green 
or carbon taxes.
<P>
	In the context of this speech today, this example relates to the 
potential fracturing of Canada with the separation of the 
province of Quebec. Obviously the separatist leader had the 
autonomy and control of Quebec as an objective. A separate 
political and economic jurisdiction that would be competing for 
international trade with what was left of Canada would open the 
very real possibility of competition at the lowest common 
denominator of environmental standards. Progressive concepts 
like green accounting would most likely be set aside due to the 
new competitive pressures.
<P>
	If the Bloc Quebecois cannot even agree with other 
environment committee members to arrive at a consensus on an 
environmental report as benign as the establishment of the 
office of commissioner of environment and sustainable 
development, what does that tell us of the potential for 
co-operation between a sovereign country of Quebec and the 
rest of Canada?
<P>
	The common element that joins all human beings is our 
environment. Fracturing the nation of Canada with man-made 
lines on a map can only serve to weaken our will, even our 
ability, to protect our ecologically balanced resources.
<P>
	As a leading middle power in the world, we can lead the way. 
We have within the nation of Canada a large critical mass that 
can bring responsible environmental practices to a new high 
standard. The fragmentation of Canada will dilute our ability to 
impact the world. Our globe is desperate for leadership in the 
development and establishment of responsible environmental 
practices that ignore political boundaries.
<P>
	We must not build political walls. We must break them down 
for our environment, for our children, for our future.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I compliment the member on his 
very fine speech. The hon. member spoke not only to the issue of 
saving the planet, but he also talked about this whole notion of 
creating national standards. I believe that is how national will is 
created and from that national will we develop a sense of 
patriotism and a feeling for our country.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about national standards on the 
environment and I support that totally. Can the member not see 
it is also important in other areas? For example, is it not better to 
have a national standard and a national program on 
multiculturalism rather than 10 different provincial ones? This 
whole notion of creating national programs and national 
standards should not just be on the environment but on other 
issues as well. Then those in the disadvantaged regions could 
come up to the advantaged regions, for example in health care, 
education and training. Would the hon. member not agree that 
would be a much better way to go to build a nation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
the hon. member.
<P>
	When we are dealing with issues like water and air, we are 
dealing with absolutes. When we are dealing with issues relating 
to multiculturalism, biculturalism and those other issues, we are 
talking about interaction among human beings. While I respect 
the fact he has made that linkage, I suggest they are slightly 
different. When we are dealing with the absolutes of water and 
air, water and air proceed over political boundaries and that is 
the absolute place where we must have national standards.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, the Reform 
Party member talked a lot about the environment. I can tell him 
one thing about the environment. Quebec's environmental law 
and Ottawa's, which was passed after Quebec's, are so different 
and so unlike that two environmental studies are required for 
every major project.
<P>
	Even the president of Hydro-Québec says that he cannot bring 
federal and Quebec officials together to go over an 
environmental review. Personally, I sincerely believe that the 
federal government is again trying to meddle in environmental 
management just so that it can control and centralize more in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	I will give you an example. Our particular natural resource in 
Quebec is hydro-electricity. Sometimes hydro-electric projects 
are blocked, perhaps to benefit uranium development in Ontario 
or oil in western Canada; if we had responsibility for our 
environment, we could do the proper studies and at the same 
time develop economically according to our own priorities.
<P>
	Again, the federal government is responsible for the 
atmospheric environment and probably some world body should 
be involved. As far as the environment and economic 
development projects are concerned, where we can very well do 
our environmental studies in Quebec, we do not need the federal 
government to meddle in our industrial development, often to 
the benefit of other fields of activity outside Canada.
<P>
	It is in this regard that we absolutely want real power over the 
environment and in many other fields as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I can see quite clearly that the 
hon. member and I have different opinions on this issue. I 
simply restate what I said in my speech.
<P>
	In an ideal world it seems to me we would not have any 
political boundaries with respect to questions relating to 
environmental issues. In an ideal world we would not have the 
environment being used economically as a ploy or as a pressure 
tactic. I am suggesting the erection of additional formal 
boundaries is not working in the best interests or the best 
direction of protecting our environment.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canada along with other 
western nations remembered the sacrifices young men and 
women made on behalf of world peace and freedom. Their 
courage enabled Canada to emerge as a world leader. We 
pumped our chests with pride yesterday as we listened to our 
Prime Minister. We watched our Governor General and the men 
and women who went over to Europe. They remembered fallen 
comrades and spoke so well on our behalf. They reached out to 
the general assembled gathering and took the congratulations 
that were offered.
<P>
	Many Canadians felt that sense of pride. Many Canadians felt 
that they wanted the country we call Canada maintained, this 
place which is our home, which many of us who came after the 
post-war era chose as home.
<P>
	Canada has created jobs and opportunities. I stand here as 
someone who selected this country, who came with a sense of 
pride and was received and welcomed by Canadians. I was told 
that with my talents and skills there were opportunities to 
develop, to grow and to be very much part of the building of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	In our large urban areas, a large percentage of the residents 
were not born in this country. Like myself, they came and have 
created a dynamic community, a community which is a model 
for the rest of the world, a cosmopolitan world. We are now a 
diverse, multicultural, multiracial, multilingual, multiethnic 
and multireligious society. We are the envy of the world. Canada 
is rated as the best country in the world in which to live. Changes 
have occurred but the Leader of the Opposition would have us 
believe that Canada still remains as two solitudes. Canadians are 
growing frustrated by the constant belittlement of the country.
<P>
	I would like to share with members a fax which I have 
received. It is one of many, but is especially appropriate for 
today. It comes from Christa Jacobs in my riding. She wanted to 
make sure some things were put on the record. She says: ``In 
1962 I became a citizen of Canada of my own free will. I was 
elated and proud to be a member of a democratic country 
consisting of 10 provinces and two territories''.
<P>
	She goes on to say a whole series of things, but I will point out 
a few. Again I will quote from her letter because she also 
believes Canadians are growing frustrated by the opposition's 
constant belittlement of this great nation: ``Mr. Bouchard's 
plans would actually destroy the contract I made with Canada in 
1962, since the Canada that would remain should Quebec 
separate would no longer be the country of which I became a 
citizen and tax paying member. I wonder how others who 
became Canadians in the way that I did stand on this issue''.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	She goes on to talk about the two official languages: ``Do not 
make two official ethnicities. I can speak several different 
languages. I can speak German, Russian and Italian. I certainly 
do not feel that speaking a language makes me anything. It is my 
national affiliation that counts''.
<P>
	I underscore the point that Canadians who watch this House 
daily are growing frustrated by the constant belittlement of the 
country. She says: ``Mr. Bouchard is acting like the Robespierre 
of Canadian politics and together with his group of new age 
Jacobins would purify Canada in some sort of ethnic historical 
way. Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose''. She goes on to 
speak about her real frustration and the frustration of  Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4936"> 4936 </A></B>
<P>
with the Leader of the Opposition's constant belittlement of the 
country.
<P>
	We have evolved into a society which cares, a land which is 
just and free, peaceful and prosperous. Canadians who care 
deeply for the country are growing impatient. Many believe they 
are not respected, not understood and not wanted. We hear these 
sentiments daily and that sense of frustration grows.
<P>
	Canada is a model for the rest of the world. Those who created 
Canada shared the fundamental commitment to freedom, 
representative democracy and the rule of law. Canadians want 
the federal government to maintain its powers, to remain strong 
and to enable the continued efficient functioning of the 
economic union and national social programs.
<P>
	There are very few places and very few countries to which I 
have not travelled. While in South Africa I heard 11 official 
languages and saw people of different ethnic and cultural groups 
attempting to work together and talking about unifying, building 
and establishing the kind of country they model on our country, 
Canada. I was constantly asked about our democracy and about 
someone like myself who was not born in this country. Speaking 
with a Caribbean accent, a person of colour, a black woman, I 
said to the South Africans: ``I am a member of the Canadian 
legislature'', and I felt the sense of pride that in Canada this is 
possible.
<P>
	Canadians know we benefit from a number of social programs 
that reflect our understanding of community. These programs 
are implemented in a way that permits governments to take into 
account changing times and changing needs. I am presently 
working on the modernizing and restructuring of our social 
security programs. I can say that the constant discussion which 
takes place with members of the party across the way is not 
nation building.
<P>
	In other nations people risk their lives and sacrifice their 
material security for the very freedoms previous generations 
have already guaranteed for us. Our sense of freedom is 
modified by a sense of justice, caring and compassion for all. 
We must remain committed to ensuring that our country 
operates and that each and every individual is a part of the 
national image.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Madam Speaker, I really 
appreciated the speech just given by the member opposite. As a 
youngster born in a family of immigrants that pioneered in 
western Canada I feel that same love for the country in its 
entirety.
<P>
	The question here today really is not, for most of us at least in 
the House, whether this is the best country in the world. It is not 
a question of whether we want to maintain the programs and the 
things we are famous for. The question is really how we are to do 
it.
<P>
	Would the member respond in any way specifically to any of 
the questions that we are asking in the motion? What vision does 
she have for actually strengthening our economy? What vision 
does she have for balancing the budgets? How about sustaining 
social services and so arranging our affairs that we can continue 
to deliver the things all of us would love to promise?
<P>
	I could go on and on. Our cultural heritage, I share that. I am a 
Canadian whose first language was neither English nor French. 
We are, as the hon. member said so emphatically, a multiracial, 
multiethnic, multilanguage country.
<P>
	If we want to preserve that I believe there should be a real 
vision for how we can bring all Canadians, including those 25 
per cent whose first language is not English or French, into a real 
sense of belonging.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond 
because the question is who we are as Canadians, the fact that we 
support a federal state, the fact that we all need to work together. 
What happens in the House is really not Canadians on all sides 
of the issue working together to bring about economic strength, 
to work for that sense of equity, to work for all those things that 
become part of the nation and the nation building activities that 
should be occurring.
<P>
	We spend a lot of time on discussion about who we are and 
examining it instead of taking about who we are and starting 
from there. We throw in all the issues about what are provincial 
and federal rights, the Constitution, and many of the issues that 
get rolled around, instead of focusing on who we are as 
Canadians, what we want of our nation and how together we can 
work to ensure that we have a nation and respond to the 
community and to the faces of Canada. I think that is the 
important question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister talk about 
how frustrated the Bloc members are. On several occasions, she 
mentioned this frustration. I have to remind her that we were 
given a clear mandate, following several events. First, there was 
Meech which failed. Then, there was the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission which studied in detail the needs of Quebec, and 
Quebecers clearly expressed their views on that matter. And 
then, English Canada rejected once again the demands made by 
Quebec. So, it was a total failure.
<P>
	Afterwards, Quebecers sent 54 members from the Bloc 
Quebecois to Ottawa. So, it seems to me that our mandate is very 
clear. It is not a mandate made for frustrated people. We are here 
because Quebecers want us here to protect their interests. 
Maybe this is something the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Prime Minister should understand. If she does not know what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4937"> 4937 </A></B>
<P>
happened during the last five or six years, how can she can 
understand what is going on now in Canada?
<P>
	I would like people to stick to the facts, and the fact is that we 
were elected to this House and given a clear mandate. We have 
no qualms about being here. Since Quebecers pay 25 to 30 per 
cent of all federal taxes, we have the right to have a say in the 
direction this country wants to take until Quebec becomes 
sovereign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Madam Speaker, I spoke about the 
frustration of Canadians on a daily basis as they listen to, as the 
member said, the only mandate of the Bloc, which is to separate.
<P>
	We are here to build a nation. We are here to respond to the 
economic needs before us. We are here to ensure that our 
societies and communities function. We are here to provide for 
all people the kind of society in which our children will find jobs 
and opportunities to grow and develop.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The constant back and forth of members across the way 
talking about separation, because that is their mandate, is what I 
am talking about in terms of frustration. We are frustrated with 
this. Canadians are frustrated with this discussion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate 
in order to express my deep commitment to the preservation of 
Canada.
<P>
	I must also express my disappointment in the fashion in which 
the debate has found its way into the House. I have yet to be 
convinced that the leader of the Reform Party is not simply 
using a critical juncture in our country's history to score fleeting 
political points.
<P>
	In his motion the Reform leader refers to the need for a 
defining vision for Canada. He then outlines a series of policy 
options to indicate his own sense of vision and that of his party.
<P>
	My sense of vision for a nation does not rest with the policy 
options we choose. It rests with the values we pursue; in our case 
values of generosity, mutual respect and generational and 
international responsibility, to name a few. Policies should then 
be chosen to reflect the values contained in that vision.
<P>
	To build a country purely around good management and social 
order has been the mistake made by many in history and it is not 
one we need make here in Canada. Having said that, I recognize 
the democratic process and as such am accorded the opportunity 
to place my own views on the record.
<P>
	In some ways I guess I am relieved. Most of us here as well as 
most other Canadians welcome the chance to reaffirm a 
commitment, a commitment to remain the best place in the 
world to live, just as the UN has recently decreed, because 
neither a Canada without Quebec nor a Quebec without Canada 
would be able to claim that same international standing.
<P>
	Apart from our obvious abundance of resources and relative 
affluence, the real bounty we possess lies in our unique history, 
our ability to compromise and understand the position and 
perspective of others, to subjugate our own narrow 
self-interests in the interest of the larger whole. This is the way 
we have evolved.
<P>
	Canadians either consciously or unconsciously have an 
abiding understanding that none of us individually, regionally, 
even collectively lives alone in the country. Nor can we or 
should we wish to claim some kind of moral or cultural 
superiority. This is what makes our country great; not our 
wealth, not our beauty, not our vast expanse and limitless 
developmental potential, but our people and the course we have 
charted for ourselves.
<P>
	We need only look to see what is happening elsewhere to 
realize that the struggle among elements of our own 
Confederation mirrors a larger debate taking place in every 
continent.
<P>
	In many countries cultural conflict has been the source of 
bloodshed and has caused the loss of generations; such a tragedy 
and all because the solitudes are resolute. We watch aghast as 
others, not us, fail to find the will to co-exist and even thrive.
<P>
	In Canada our competing values have been a source of 
enlightenment. Differences have taught us compassion, mutual 
respect, a desire to know and embrace the intricacies of other 
cultures, other worlds and other points of view.
<P>
	We embrace these and champion our multicultural fabric as 
the asset that distinguishes us from other countries. For too long 
our leadership has been timid, assuming that ordinary 
Canadians might not share the same spirit of compromise, the 
same generosity, the same noble purpose of which I speak.
<P>
	I feel otherwise. Canadians, because of our relative youth, 
because of our unique history and perhaps even because of an 
unnatural preoccupation with our Constitution, have spent more 
time discussing, debating and defining our country than we have 
a right to. However we have done it and we are a more thoughtful 
place for it. We need only look a little south to our American 
neighbours to recognize the truth in this. The United States 
approach to nationhood demands conformity by its citizens to a 
narrowly defined set of habits, traditions and principles.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4938"> 4938 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the argument can be made that this was at one time 
appropriate but that time has clearly passed. Both the present 
and the future belong to those able to cope with the enormity and 
diversity of our world and even our country.
<P>
	While considering whether to offer as a candidate in the last 
election, I recall watching the American Democratic convention 
in Atlantic City. One of the key speakers of that convention was 
Senator Bill Bradley. I watched amazed while the senator from 
New Jersey suggested that the U.S. had occupied its superior 
position in the world because of its natural resources, but that 
now the value of physical abundance was diminishing the 
American's position would be maintained because as the global 
community became smaller the fact that so many cultures called 
the U.S. home would once again give it some kind of advantage 
on the global stage.
<P>
	While I agree in part with the senator's analysis, I take great 
exception to his conclusion. It is Canada that is the place where 
members of all nations can feel at home. Canada is the place 
where people can truly celebrate their cultures to the greatest 
extent possible with government support and encouragement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I was privileged to grow up in the only 
officially bilingual province of a bilingual country. Most of my 
friends and I myself support this opening up of opportunities 
and the protection of minority rights, and to us, the 
opportunities of diversity are a way of life. Granted, my 
generation of Anglophones in New Brunswick is mostly 
unilingual, but only due to circumstances. My children and 
other members of their generation are for the most part 
bilingual. To them, the struggles and debate that marked our past 
no longer make sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Earlier this century our former Prime Minister and the father 
of the modern Liberal Party boasted that the 20th century would 
belong to Canada. Many whose values tend toward materialism 
dismiss Laurier's pronouncement as wishful thinking.
<P>
	As we enter the 21st century and as countries and people 
around the world struggle with questions of ethnic strife and 
ideological absolutism, we face a choice. Isolationism and 
scapegoating and finger pointing that go with it are not the 
answer. I believe in the need for pluralism and bilingualism in 
our case and the generosity of nationhood will be held up as the 
primary lesson learned from the 20th century. Whether we serve 
as a model of accommodation and compromise or become just 
another example of unfortunate shortsightedness depends 
entirely on us.
<P>
	Canada is not without its challenges. Nor can we claim a past 
without blemish. We must confront with resolve our failure to 
include in a way of their choosing Canada's aboriginal 
communities in our abundance and comfort. We must attend to 
the inequities that continue to diminish us all, inequities 
between the genders, inequities between those of us who have 
been here for generations and those of us newly arrived.
<P>
	We must be vigilant to ensure that programs and policies be in 
place to protect and promote both our official languages from 
assimilation regardless of where we choose to live.
<P>
	Further, we must do a better job of promoting the values of 
which I speak. Racism exists in Canada but I believe in most 
cases it is born of fear and confusion rather than deep-seated 
hatred or profound incompatibility.
<P>
	We should never underestimate the work and sometimes 
expense involved in nurturing a model of nationhood that 
requires patience, understanding and generosity of spirit. In 
short, it draws from all Canadians the very best in each of us.
<P>
	To illustrate, in the spring of each year many go through the 
annual ritual of deciding which plants to grow. We travel to local 
markets and nurseries. Some of us, less optimistic, purchase 
hardy annuals with the knowledge that little effort is required 
for these plants to flourish. Braver souls recommit each year to 
buying and growing roses and other such delicates. We similarly 
possess the knowledge that more work is required and that the 
challenge of success is more daunting. At the end of the day 
those who chose the roses and finer flowers will have done 
something special. Quite simply, as a country, whether it be 
from good luck or vision, we have chosen to grow roses. It is 
harder; it does require more work, more patience and more 
creativity. Even the sting from a thorny debate is not enough to 
thwart us in our overall pursuit. In the end we have done 
something special and it is through the maintenance of that the 
majority of Canadians remain resolute.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to 
the hon. member talking about flowers and dreams, but in my 
opinion, Canada, the great Canadian dream, has lost much of its 
lustre.
<P>
	Last week, when I was in western Canada, there was a lot of 
talk about the Canadian dream, but people tend to ignore the 
debt and the annual deficit the government is unable to control. 
We are on the brink of bankruptcy, and these people still think 
this is the richest country in the world. They refer to a statement 
by the UN that says we rank first in standard of living, but it is a 
standard of living obtained on credit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4939"> 4939 </A></B>
<P>
	I said this many times before and I will say it again for the 
benefit of people who still want to dream. Sure, you can have 
your dreams, but let us be realistic, when the mortgage is sky 
high. Before, we did not have a mortgage, but now we are 
mortgaged to the hilt, and the car as well. We still have the same 
standard of living, but we got it on credit. And now we are right 
on the brink, we keep on dreaming.
<P>
	People still think a very strong central government will be 
able to run everything, but in fact, we need thorough 
decentralization, with Canada's regions in a broad 
confederation and a central government with perhaps a few 
members who will make recommendations. I do not know what 
the exact parameters will be, but we do need thorough 
decentralization to ensure that the regions can develop their 
potential. Because the federal government insists on 
centralizing everything here in Ottawa, Canada is going straight 
into bankruptcy. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	We have to stop dreaming. We have to face the facts. And the 
facts are that we need a sovereign Quebec and a sovereign 
Canada. And we will work very well together, as we do now at 
the economic level, but we will both perform better. That is what 
we have to offer. We offer a way to better results. So take 
advantage of that offer.
<P>
	When we tell you our performance will improve, this is not 
our opinion, it was the opinion of the experts in Quebec who sat 
on the Bélanger-Campeau Commission. They concluded, but 
they did more than conclude, they analysed the issues and 
interviewed everyone, the business community, the unions, and 
all socio-economic sectors. They said that to develop its 
potential, Quebec needed 22 or 23 real powers. That request was 
turned down. So let us stop dreaming. Let us face the facts. Let 
us build a strong and prosperous English Canada and a strong 
and prosperous Quebec, and let us work in unity. We do not want 
to divide anything. We do not want to hurt anyone. We want to 
develop our potential, as is our right. Why prevent us from doing 
so? We want you to develop your potential as we develop ours. 
Let us stop dreaming and talking about flowers and let us talk a 
little about dollars and cents and prospects for the future.

	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.
<P>
	My immediate reaction to the proposition that somehow the 
country would be better if the member has his way prompts me 
to think of the province I come from, New Brunswick, and the 
250,000 Acadians who probably would challenge that 
proposition.
<P>
	I would also defer to the judgment of the United Nations as to 
whether Canada is living the dream. I would also defer to the 
many hundreds of thousands of people who would dearly love 
the opportunity to live in the country as it is.
<P>
	As for the question having to do with the deficit, I can only 
acknowledge the need to deal responsibly with our finances, 
which I believe we are. I would also challenge members who 
constantly stand up and speak to this question to think about the 
programs that are financed and have been financed. As an 
Atlantic Canadian I know there are those in the Reform Party 
who are not as sensitive to the nature of the country relative to 
the spirit of generosity I referred to. I cannot imagine that in any 
way the country could be better off being more divided.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to say how pleased I am for the opportunity to speak 
in the debate today.
<P>
	In reference to the hon. member's remarks preceding mine, 
speaking of the spirit of generosity let us not forget where the 
bulk of that money from taxpayers is coming from. Much of it 
comes from western Canadians in a spirit of generosity to the 
rest of Canada. Let us be absolutely clear about that.
<P>
	I will mention again how pleased I am to speak in this debate 
today. I will be addressing the phrase in our motion which talks 
about further democratizing our institutions and decision 
making processes. As we spend month after month in this place 
we are all well aware of the situation we are all in and dear 
knows we do need to have some democratic reform in our 
institutions and in our decision making processes here.
<P>
	It is also very clear that many people outside of this Chamber 
but outside and inside Quebec as well are demanding some 
things as they demanded of us in the last election. These are I 
believe from people inside and outside Quebec. It is every bit as 
important to them. Inside Quebec and out they are seeking 
dynamic and constructive change in their political institutions. 
They are asking for governments that listen to them, consult 
with them and are accountable to them. Canadians and 
Quebecers want to improve the quality of representative 
government in the country.
<P>
	We know these things well. Madam Speaker, you and I were 
here in the last Parliament. We know through the national debate 
surrounding Meech Lake, the Charlottetown accord and more 
recently through our door knocking at the federal election last 
fall, through town hall meetings and other communication with 
our constituents, that there was almost a cry from people saying 
something needs to be done to democratize the institutions and 
Parliament itself.
<P>
	This desire for reform of our political institutions is 
something that all of us in this 35th Parliament can do something 
about. Many of my colleagues and I have offered a number of 
proposals that would lead to democratic reform in the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4940"> 4940 </A></B>
<P>
	As was mentioned before and was mentioned just a few 
moments ago by my colleague from Calgary West, we need in 
the House, regardless of what provinces or areas of the country 
we are from, more free votes in Parliament. If members are to 
exert influence over policy making in committees, as we have 
heard so much about, or in the House they must be able to 
demonstrate independence of thought.
<P>
	Again we read articles of some members from the government 
side who are brave enough to stand in committee and say: ``I do 
not think this is right. Perhaps I will vote against it''. They are 
absolutely taken aside and told they must go along with it. They 
cannot give other reports. My friends on the other side are well 
aware of that.
<P>
	We want to make sure that more free votes are allowed in 
Parliament. We also need a change in attitude to the confidence 
convention. As my friends from the government and I sat on the 
opposition benches in the last Parliament we heard time and 
time again that every piece of legislation does not need to be 
treated as a confidence convention. How things change, how 
things become so different with the stroll of about 12 or 14 feet 
across the aisle here.
<P>
	We need a change on the part of government and party leaders 
that would allow members to vote as their constituents wish 
without bringing down the government. I certainly have 
assurance that I can offer on behalf of my party leader that he 
would be willing to give unanimous consent to the other leaders 
to provide that.
<P>
	We also need provisions to recall MPs who have lost or 
betrayed the trust of their constituents. As members would know 
I have spoken at great length on this in the House. It seems to 
rattle some even now. Recall will ensure that members consult 
with and serve their constituents and not merely serve their 
party. That if anything is one thing we can do to change the 
attitude that Canadians have about this place.
<P>
	Also we believe in holding elections every four years at 
predetermined dates so there would not just be something that 
would be helpful or productive for the government. We saw that 
again in the last election where it was thought that because it had 
that benefit it was able to call the election at what it thought was 
the most opportune time. Unfortunately history will show that 
perhaps it was a mistake.
<P>
	However, if we had elections at predetermined times every 
four years it would eliminate all that hassle and trying to think 
about it and manipulating dates.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	Also we are in favour of a binding referendum on national and 
important constitutional and moral issues or matters that would 
alter the basic social fabric of the country. We have seen a 
referendum in the country. Naturally I was pleased with the 
results of it because I was the only federal political party here 
that was on the no side on the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with that, just because people in the 
House and the parties which they represented lost the 
Charlottetown accord. A great deal of good came out of that. 
People in my constituency, and I am sure in every other one in 
the country, felt that somehow they had been given real power. 
They were able to exercise on a ballot their view, that it was 
binding and that it carried the weight of the day.
<P>
	Also citizens' initiatives are so important. People can put 
questions on a referendum ballot which will be dealt with at 
election time. What a marvellous sense of power. That would 
free up this place so that people know they have access to the 
House of Commons and not just somebody who will stand in a 
public place regularly, as I have heard, and say: ``My opinion is 
important. My constituent's opinion is important but when it 
comes to the vote I will decide''. Nothing could be more 
arrogant or any further from the truth. If we are going to 
democratize this place that is something that is absolutely 
essential.
<P>
	All Reformers have advocated Senate reform. We are talking 
about a triple-E Senate, elected by the people, equal provincial 
representation, thereby making it effective in representing 
regional interests. There may be people from Quebec and 
Ontario, the two big provinces, who say they have more senators 
and so they have absolute power of majority in the Senate. It is 
important that each province realize it is one of ten equal 
children in Confederation.
<P>
	There seems to be no reason in my mind to justify the fact that 
my province of Alberta has 6 senators and that Quebec and 
Ontario would have 24. There is something wrong with the 
mathematics in that. We believe Quebec is important in 
Confederation. Let us turn the other place around.
<P>
	I have heard many of my colleagues talk about the fact that we 
need to abolish the other place. We have seen very recently that 
the Senate is important, that it is essential. Its decision to reject 
Bill C-18, the suspending of the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act, is a good example of the Senate's 
sober second look at bad legislation. Bad it was, and we would 
hear from members of the government side perhaps that it was 
bad, such interventions were rare, granted, and usually not 
welcome because of the unelected nature of the Senate.
<P>
	I proved my point. Because Canada is a federation of equal 
provinces this reality should be reflected in that other place 
because it does provide a function. We think that if it were that 
much more legitimate it would provide a bigger and better 
function on behalf of poor legislation and as a counterweight to 
some of the things that come out of the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4941"> 4941 </A></B>
<P>
	We believe as Reformers that the adoption of these political 
and democratic reforms would lead to more active participation 
in the legislative process by ordinary Canadians. It would 
improve the quality of debate, enhance legislation coming from 
Parliament and build an even better democracy than we have in 
Canada today.
<P>
	What a marvellous country this is has been mentioned over 
and over today. We agree. I think everyone in the House agrees 
that Canada is wonderful. My colleagues to my right are wanting 
to leave that. Of course my question as a western Canadian as 
well as a fellow member of this family is: What does Quebec 
want?
<P>
	I have a researcher from the University of Michigan, an 
intern, trying to look at that question for me. What is it Quebec 
wants in Canada, if it is to remain in Canada?
<P>
	It is one thing to say that these people are here to represent all 
of Quebec. That is not true any more than my party is here to 
represent all of the west or that there are members from the 
government side representing all Canadians because they form 
the government. There are people who supported the Bloc and 
we give respect for that certainly. Earlier we talked about the 
enormous amount of people in Quebec as well as outside who 
said Canada is the best place. We need to build on the successes 
that we have had.
<P>
	We often forget the long and difficult way that we have come 
together in Confederation. We seldom remember our great 
achievements together. What we need to do at the very end of 
this debate, and I am so glad we have been able to have it, is to 
ask a question. If we in the House of Commons are willing to get 
together and democratize these institutions, if we on all sides of 
the House are willing to get together and say yes, this place is 
wonderful or yes, we will move to be able to say Canada is a 
worthwhile place, is Quebec interested in staying? If we all get 
together and build it I believe they will come. That is the offer 
we extend to them, to say this country is bigger and better with 
all of us fighting on behalf of it rather than somebody who wants 
to leave and thinks, just completely hypothetically, that things 
would be better.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	My time is just about up. We have a minute left until oral 
statements. I will be answering questions and comments right 
after that. However, let me assure my friends here that we are 
trying to build this new Canada. We make the offer to them and 
to their constituents that if they will work with us, if we build it, 
we give them the offer to come.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course there will be a question period when 
we take up debate after the question period. We will now 
proceed to Statements by Members.
<P>

<P>
	These students of Ridgemont High School are participants in 
the work experience program called ``Partners in Change''. This 
program had its start back in 1986 due in large part to the hard 
work of one of my constituents, Ms. Patricia Mainwaring.
<P>
	Ms. Mainwaring is a teacher at Ridgemont High School who 
specializes in helping students with intellectual and

to contribute in a whole variety of ways to our work here in the

learning how to do all sorts of things and also learning a new

attended a short ceremony at the birthplace of Billy Bishop in 
Owen Sound. The Bishop home is now a museum dedicated to 
the memory of Canada's most highly decorated serviceman, the 
winner of Canada's first air Victoria Cross.
<P>
	At the ceremony a representative of Canada Post, Mr. Tom 
Creech, announced that a postage stamp in Bishop's honour will 
be unveiled in Owen Sound on August 12 of this year.
<P>
	It is entirely fitting that the man who at the end of the first

British pilot be recognized with a stamp issue.
<P>
	Bishop's remains are interred in the Owen Sound Greenwood 
Cemetery, along with the remains of two other Victoria Cross 
winners, Private Thomas Holmes and Lieutenant-Colonel 
David Currie, who I understand for a time was the 
Sergeant-at-Arms in the House.

The first was the D-Day services honouring our Canadians who

<P>
	The second event was the sound and light show here on 
Parliament Hill which brilliantly reflected Canada's history, 
heritage and culture. I was overwhelmed by this magical display 
radiating over Parliament Hill, our national symbol of 
democracy and patriotism. I believe that feeling of being 
Canadian radiates all across Canada, out to each and every little 
corner of the country. We are all united in our hearts. It is a 
deeply held feeling to be Canadian.

Transportation Week. Privileged to be the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Transport, it is my pleasure to acknowledge the 
excellence of the hundreds of thousands of men and women who 
see the transportation industry in our country moving ever

<P>
	The challenges of change on a global scale are continuing to 
influence our transportation industry. To deal with these 
challenges, government and industry must look to the future and 
harmonize efforts to contribute to competitiveness and 
economic renewal.
<P>
	It may please the House to know that last Friday in Thunder 
Bay the industry recognized excellence in transportation.
<P>
	If time would permit, I would recognize all those who were 
honoured with awards of excellence and achievement, but 
among them I want particularly to mention those who received 
the awards of valour: Mr. Mervyn Peever of Prince George, 
B.C., a rail brakeman who risked his life to rescue a three-year 
old girl from the path of an oncoming freight train, and Mr. 
André Fréchette, a truck driver from Tracy, Quebec who rescued 
two people from a burning bus.
<P>

all those who keep Canada's transportation system running as it 
should be, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after cancelling last April's scheduled 
federal-provincial conference of income security ministers, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has also postponed 
the tabling of his action plan on social program reform which 
was originally scheduled for late April. With the House slated to 
rise for the summer in about 15 days, the government has dug in 
its heels in the fact of the provinces' opposition and has yet to 
unveil its plans for social program reform.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister indicate to us whether the 
government intends to make its action plan on social program 
reform public before the adjournment of the House, or whether 
it is preparing instead to release it after the House rises, so as to 
avoid debating the matter here in the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the work of the human 
resources minister is proceeding very, very well. This week in 
fact, he met in Europe with representatives of other countries 
that are reviewing their social systems and we expect that he will 
be releasing his report and action plan shortly.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is quite a revelation! The minister has not even 
succeeded in getting together with his provincial counterparts in 
Canada, and now we learn that he is meeting with European 
ministers. Quite a revelation indeed!
<P>
	Are we to understand that because of the provinces's 
opposition to the federal project, no new date has been set for the 
federal-provincial ministers' conference on social program 
reform originally scheduled for last April?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Leader of the 
Opposition is not trying to make the House believe that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development should not speak 
with his OECD counterparts.
<P>
	I realize that the Leader of the Opposition has other plans in 
mind for his country. I also know that the minister received a 
much warmer welcome in Europe that did the Leader of the 
Opposition several weeks ago.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all Canadians and all taxpayers will, I am sure, be 
delighted to hear that the minister is in Europe to meet with his 
European counterparts. However, it is not in Europe that the plan 
will be drawn up and it is not in Europe that the minister will 
convince Canada's provincial premiers that the plan is 
acceptable. That work must be done here.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, will the Deputy Prime Minister admit that 
Ottawa and the provinces have reached an impasse on the 
question of social program reform, given that in such fields as 
health, the provinces refuse to bear the burden for the federal 
government's financial decision to off-load its deficit onto their 
shoulders, while at the same time, the federal government wants 
to force the provinces to comply with national standards?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is another unfortunate 
example of the Leader of the Opposition's policy of always 
operating according to a double standard. He sees nothing 
illogical in the fact that two weeks ago, he went to Paris to 
discuss Quebec's separation. It is completely logical, on the 
other hand, that the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is in Europe to discuss social reform. Furthermore, we have 
already stated that the action plan will be released to the 
Canadian public shortly.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, we learned 
from a report on French CBC TV that two children had 
life-threatening reactions to an experimental drug, ALG, that 
was approved by Health Canada and administered to them at 
Sainte-Justine Hospital. However, this experimental drug was 
never approved or authorized for export by the U.S. authorities. 
This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4946"> 4946 </A></B>
<P>
drug is the subject of a criminal investigation after two people 
died from it in the United States.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Health justify her department's 
decision to authorize the use of ALG when this high-risk 
experimental drug was never approved and authorized for 
export by the United States since it was developed in the early 
1970s?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, of 
course, I will have to find out about the case in question. I was 
not given details. If you want, I am prepared to give you all the 
necessary information which I might obtain. If you have 
information to give me, please let me have it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before giving the floor to the hon. member for 
Roberval, I would ask hon. members to always address the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, gladly, as I 
usually do anyway.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, through you, let me suggest that the minister 
listen to the CBC news where this case was reported today. At 
the same time, I would like to ask her if she could investigate the 
circumstances surrounding her department's decision to 
authorize the use of this dangerous drug in eleven Canadian 
hospitals. Does she admit that the present system for authorizing 
medication is very seriously deficient since Health Canada 
exercises no control over or follow-up on the effects of 
experimental drugs after authorizing them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like the opportunity to look into the particular case since I 
have no information at this point.
<P>
	Let me advise this House that the scientists and people in 
Health Canada are extremely concerned with any new 
experimental drug. I am sure they will do everything in their 
power to ensure the safety of any product that is distributed here 
in Canada.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRADE">TRADE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	As the minister knows Canada's trade ministers have been 
meeting to discuss ways and means of securing freer trade 
within Canada. Various trade associations have suggested there 
are over 500 barriers to trade, they cost us $6 billion and, of 
course, they kill jobs.
<P>
	Is the federal government considering more proactive 
measures, federal initiatives, to dismantle interprovincial trade 
barriers if the provincial ministers fail to do more than just 
scratch the surface?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the comprehensive 
approach that has been taken by the minister responsible for 
industry who has been leading the federal discussion on these 
issues is indeed far more than scratching the surface. He is 
getting an excellent response from his provincial counterparts in 
areas ranging from environmental protection to breaking down a 
number of the other 500-plus barriers that prevent 
interprovincial free trade.
<P>
	We have every expectation that at the end of June, the 
deadline that the minister has imposed for himself and his 
provincial colleagues, we will have another success story to 
speak of for the Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the track record of these discussions is that the trade ministers 
come up with a list of exemptions as long as your arm.
<P>
	The Constitution empowers the federal government to 
regulate trade and commerce and provide some capacity for the 
federal government itself to act on internal barriers to trade. 
Section 121 of the Constitution states: ``All articles of the 
growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the provinces 
shall, from and after the union, be admitted free into each of the 
other provinces''.
<P>
	My question for the Deputy Prime Minister is this: What is the 
federal government doing to exercise its current constitutional 
powers, including the application of section 121, to facilitate 
freer trade in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member's question is a 
good example of why he had better go back to the constitutional 
drawing board.
<P>
	This morning we heard the same member stand in the House 
and complain that the federal government was too directive in a 
number of areas. He wanted us to divest our responsibility to the 
provinces. This afternoon he is telling us that we are not doing 
enough.
<P>
	In fact the Minister of Industry has a negotiated approach. He 
has brought all the parties to the table. He expects to have a full 
and comprehensive free trade agreement reached by the end of 
June.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have one further supplementary question.
<P>
	Internal barriers to trade are created by provincial 
governments and inflict injury on businesses and consumers. 
The federal government's approach to dealing with these 
barriers has been to get the provinces, the creators of the 
problem, together and ask them to solve it.
<P>
	Has the government considered bringing together businesses 
and consumers that are injured by internal barriers to trade and 
giving them the tools to fight these barriers, for example 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4947"> 4947 </A></B>
<P>
providing a domestic trade dispute settling mechanism in 
Canada like we have in the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the negotiations are 
ongoing as we speak. Indeed one of the primary aims of the 
Minister of Industry is to have a speedy dispute resolution 
mechanism.
<P>
	I guess the difference between the approach that the leader of 
the Reform Party seems to be advocating and the approach that 
we are seeking is that we would like to get consensus to work 
with the provinces, not against them.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the CRTC made a decision regarding the 
French-language all-news channel. This new service was 
awarded to Radio-Canada. However, the access of francophones 
outside Quebec to this new service will be left to the discretion 
of cable operators.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Does he 
not consider quite inequitable the CRTC's decision, which does 
not give Canada's francophone and Acadian communities 
guaranteed access to the French-language all-news channel, 
when they have been financially supporting the 
English-language equivalent, Newsworld, for several years 
through their subscriptions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I took note of the CRTC's decisions and I understand 
the disappointment felt by the francophone and Acadian 
communities. I should point out, however, that there is an appeal 
procedure and that this procedure involves the Government of 
Canada since the appeal is filed with the government.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	I myself will be involved in the appeal and I cannot be both a 
judge and a party at the same time. That is why I should not make 
any more comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would still like to get a very clear answer from the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Does this mean that the Minister of Canadian Heritage intends 
to personally ask the Cabinet to review the CRTC's decision? Is 
this what his somewhat diplomatic language means?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for referring to my former life.
<P>
	I simply tried to explain the procedure that must be followed. 
The initiative to appeal must come from the communities 
concerned and not the government. As I explained, since the 
government rules on the appeal, it cannot be both judge and 
party at the outset.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	On Sunday, Burnaby RCMP officers found themselves in the 
middle of a shootout with David Barlow. Fortunately no one was 
killed in this incident. However, David Barlow is responsible for 
the killing of two other persons.
<P>
	In 1972 he was convicted for murdering a Florida police 
officer and sentenced to death, which was later commuted to 
life. In 1980, Barlow was returned to Canada where he was 
convicted of manslaughter for a killing in New Brunswick in 
1967.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the people of Canada how an 
individual like Barlow can be considered a low risk and put back 
on our streets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find this a troubling situation. I have asked for a full review and 
a full report on how this case was handled. When I get the report 
on this troubling situation, I will be happy to share the 
information with my hon. friend.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at the current rate of holding national inquiries into 
problems with the justice system, the minister will have more 
success in putting Canadians to work than the infrastructure 
program.
<P>
	Nevertheless, in response to the Barlow shooting incident 
British Columbia Premier Mike Harcourt has stated that 
Canada's justice system must have a zero tolerance for 
dangerous offenders.
<P>
	Is the minister equally prepared to call for zero tolerance of 
dangerous offenders like Barlow?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is currently a federal-provincial task force on high risk 
offenders which is expected to report to ministers in July. It is 
working on measures to deal with high risk offenders. We are 
anxiously awaiting the report so that we can take further action 
to deal with this type of difficult situation.
<P>
	In the meantime, it is open to the premier of British Columbia 
to ask his crown attorneys to take more concrete action at the 
beginning to ask people to be declared dangerous offenders at 
the time they are first convicted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of the Environment kept insisting that, 
last year, Canada had passed legislation on double hulling. She 
referred to the Maritime Shipping Act, which simply does not 
exist. She probably meant the Canada Shipping Act, which was 
amended last year by Bill C-121, in which the government 
merely announced its intention of legislating double hulled 
ships.
<P>
	How can the Minister of the Environment justify her answer, 
when the legal services of the Department of Transport, her own 
department and the Canadian Coast Guard maintain that there is 
currently no legislation on double hulling?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, the so-called facts 
mentioned today by the hon. member are just as valid as those of 
yesterday, since my department does not even have jurisdiction 
over the Coast Guard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is because she does not know!
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Canada Shipping Act, which was passed on December 31, 1993, 
deals with the issue of double hulling for ships carrying oil, that 
is the tankers.
<P>
	I also said yesterday, and I repeat it today, that if the hon. 
member is suggesting that all ships be double hulled in order to 
ply Canadian waters in any part of the country, the ports of 
Quebec City and Montreal will have to shut down. Somehow, I

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Since the release of repeat sexual offender Larry Fisher, the 
RCMP has issued an internal memo stating that he will probably 
strike again. Over the weekend Fisher was reported sighted in 
my riding in the city of Dawson Creek. Local residents are 
deeply concerned about the sudden appearance of Fisher in their 
community.
<P>
	Which laws need to be changed so that dangerous offenders 
like Larry Fisher are never turned loose again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not going to comment 
on the case of Mr. Fisher, but I will respond as best I can to the 
question in general terms.
<P>
	The place to start is with enforcing the laws that are already on 
the books. Part 24 of the Criminal Code already provides in 
express terms that at the time an offender is sentenced the crown 
attorney in the appropriate circumstances can bring an 
application to have the court declare that person a dangerous 
offender. If that occurs that person can be detained indefinitely 
and not released until they die.
<P>
	Therefore the first thing is, as my hon. colleague the Solicitor 
General has pointed out, that our counterparts in the provinces 
must be alert to the application of that section in appropriate 
cases. They should ask the court to designate persons dangerous 
when the facts justify the application.
<P>
	There can be cases which fall short of dangerousness as 
defined in part 24 but still require continued detention in the 
public interest. As the Solicitor General has said we are awaiting 
the results of a report being prepared at the federal and 
provincial levels to deal with those kinds of cases. It involves 
the conjunction of the criminal system which is federal and the 
health system which is provincial. It is our intention in 
collaboration with the provinces to develop a system to deal 
with those cases for the safety of the public in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for his answer. I notice that once again we are 
hearing about reports and studies. The last thing Canadians want 
right now is another study into the causes of crime. This issue 
has been studied to death. People are demanding action from 
this minister.
<P>
	With predators like Larry Fisher on the loose, how long does 
the minister plan to examine the alternatives he referred to in 
this House last week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is easy to mock the process 
of study. If I may say so, I think the last thing Canadians want is 
ill-informed action by which government would rush to a 
solution which may not be effective.
<P>
	My colleagues and I know that this issue is important and 
these cases must be provided for. We also respect the complexity 
of the issue and we are going to go about it in the proper way. 
The study will be thorough and our action will be effective. We 
will have results to show after we work it through with our 
provincial counterparts.

the hon. member is wrong. I never refused to admit that 
large-scale arms smuggling existed. I said, as did the Prime 
Minister a few months ago, that one of the reasons for our 
national program against smuggling was the fact that arms 
smuggling was also a problem. That is why we set up the 
anti-smuggling program, which includes the smuggling of 
firearms, and we will continue our efforts with the Sûreté du

question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	I have received many representations from concerned 
constituents in my riding about the case of Alexandre Makar. 
Mr. Makar is presently teaching in Edmonton. His employment 
authorization expires on June 30, at which time he is expected to 
return to Ukraine on the  grounds that he is medically 
inadmissible due to a rare kidney condition.
<P>
	Could the minister of immigration please update the House on 
this case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question and for the concern he and other colleagues have shown 
in the case.
<P>
	First, as was mentioned, the individual in question is on a 
work authorization. He has applied from within the country for 
permanent status. As a result of the medical test he has been 
found inadmissible.
<P>
	It is the classic difficult case of the compassion which has 
been shown to this individual by the Edmonton community and 
the whole question of medical admissibility which is one of the 
tests on which Canadians expect all applicants to be assessed. It 
is not something we treat lightly. Last year of the over 325,000 
cases assessed medically, some 2,000 were denied.
<P>
	Second, while our health system is second to none in the 
world, its resources are limited and involve the provinces. 
Consequently I have opened a channel of official 
communication with the premier of Alberta to ascertain the 
position of Alberta vis-à-vis the health care and health 
consequences of this individual, should he stay. Also, since the 
premier of Saskatchewan has gone on the public record eliciting 
support, I have also been in contact with his office to see if there

<P>
	As I mentioned in the House last week, parolee Wayne Perkin 
was recently found guilty of murdering Angela Richards in my

the decision to release Mr. Perkin in January 1990, I was 
informed that information is classified since it happened before 
the new law was passed for hearings taking place after 
November 1992.

will change the legislation to allow access to parole board

will take note of my hon. friend's suggestion. It is very much 
worth going into. I will work on it in connection with the 
updating and tightening up of the parole and correctional system 
that I am currently working on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Solicitor General for that response.
<P>
	The parole board's decision in this case ultimately led to the 
untimely death of 24-year old Angela Richards. I find that there 
are other circumstances and that charges are being laid on Mr. 
Perkin. Again the parole board should have known.
<P>
	Will the Solicitor General initiate legislation to ensure that in 
future members of the board are informed of ongoing 
investigations so that convicts eligible for parole can be 
detained until all such reasonable investigations are complete?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Transport. 
The government plans to massively privatize services offered by 
Transport Canada. By doing so, the government will be released 
from its commitment to support Canada's transportation 
system.
<P>
	Before he embarks on a substantial privatization of Transport 
Canada's activities, does the minister have any guarantees as to 
the impact privatization would have on economic development 
and inflation, as a result of increased transportation costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I am sure the hon. member is aware that the speech 
we made in Thunder Bay on Friday night was not really about 
privatization. That is not the route the Department of Transport 
intends to go.
<P>
	We talked mainly about commercialization, which is an 
entirely different approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, whatever the term, does the minister realize that a 
substantial withdrawal of government financing from the 
transportation sector would seriously affect all ports on the St. 
Lawrence as a result of the commercialization of the Coast 
Guard, and would affect all consumers through increases in the 
price of goods, and all remote regions, which stand to suffer 
most as a result of price increases?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member asks a question that has a lot of people in the 
country concerned.
<P>
	Obviously it is true everywhere in Canada that local 
authorities are looking for more input into decisions that 
directly affect their communities and their regions. I am quite 
surprised that a member from Quebec would not be interested in 
looking at a process that would provide for very significant local 
input.
<P>
	I might add to the hon. member that most user groups and 
client groups in the country are absolutely convinced, in terms 
that they have made very clear to me, that they believe that with 
more input from those user and client groups we can have a 
system that is far more efficient, far more effective, far more 
affordable and I would think that is what the hon. member would 
have in mind as well.

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	On May 4, I asked the minister when he was going to make 
appointments to the Canada Council of which 13 of the 21 seats 
were vacant at that time. The minister responded that he was 
committed to not making any appointments until the federal 
agency review was completed, and that is expected some time 
this fall.
<P>
	Could the minister explain his inconsistency, his reversal yet 
again of an earlier decision as he went ahead anyway and made

<P>

<P>
	This is what we have done. We have made the appointments 
and now we know the number of members on the board of 
directors. We shall make appointments in the future in a more 
routine manner.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thought we knew how many seats were vacant and how many 
were needed. I certainly do not question at all the talent and the 
capacity of the individual who has been so appointed.
<P>

federal agency review process. I would like the minister to tell 
the House what relevance that federal review process now has.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Last month's Liberal Party convention passed a resolution 
from a Regina constituency association calling for the 
privatization of CN Exploration and that the sale be to a 
Saskatchewan company. There have been rumblings that this 
sale may be conducted to benefit Liberal friends. Doug 
Richardson, a former Liberal candidate and chief of staff under 
Mr. Turner, has been lobbying for the sale of CN Exploration on 
behalf of a Regina company whose board of directors reads like 
a who's who of Liberals in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Could the minister assure the House that any privatization of 
this crown corporation will be open and that the selling price 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4952"> 4952 </A></B>
<P>
will be the true market value estimated at at least $70 million, 
perhaps as high as $150 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously with the condition that we find railroads in Canada in, 
with all the discussions and all the uncertainty that is out there 
with respect to rail activity in Canada, any divestment by CN of 
any of its assets would be reviewed meticulously and would 
have to be proven beyond any shadow of a doubt to be in the best 
interest of Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the minister for that assurance. It is 
invigorating to hear of Liberals moving to privatize crown 
corporations.
<P>
	Could the minister further assure the House by telling us what 
steps, if any, are being taken to prevent the new Saskatchewan 
owner if it is sold from flipping CN Exploration to new owners 
outside of Saskatchewan to make a fast buck at the expense of 
the taxpayer? Also, are the proceeds of a sale intended to go to 
the federal treasury or to CN?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is nothing more amusing than to watch Reform acrobatics. 
It is unfortunate that the question the hon. member just put was 
written before he listened to the original question's answer.
<P>
	What I said, and what I want to repeat, is that any deal that 
would be made by CN with respect to the divestment of any of its 
assets would be scrutinized. It would have to be in the best 
interest of Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	To suggest that any transaction would be capable of being 
reviewed to determine whether anyone in the future might make 
a profit from it would be beyond even the scope of what

<P>

question.
<P>
	As the member knows, when we brought forth the budget we 
did so on the basis of prudent assumptions, knowing that some 
of the variables would be up and others would be down. 
Fortunately in this case our economic growth is substantially 
better than what had been projected. Unfortunately, as the 
member knows, interest rates are also worse and therefore there 
is to a certain degree a levelling effect.
<P>
	This, nonetheless, is very good news. It is very good news for 
employment. It is very good news for the country. It is the result

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	I had occasion also to read the minister's speech in Thunder 
Bay. I was concerned about a portion of the speech where the 
minister talked about direct subsidies to the transportation 
system. Almost all of the examples he uses of direct subsidies 
are on the rail side.
<P>
	It seems this perpetuates the myth that it is the rail sector of 
this country which is subsidized while other sectors like air and 
highways are not subsidized by the taxpayer, although it is 
perhaps less direct and less explicit.
<P>
	Will the minister assure the House that in whatever he intends 
to do to our transportation system he will take into account the 
fact that highways and airports and sectors other than rail are 
heavily subsidized as well, only not explicitly? Will he keep that 
in mind when he analyses the rail sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for his question. There is no doubt that 
in the major changes that will have to take place in the 
transportation system, if it is going to be affordable in Canada 
we will have to maintain the notion of equity and fairness.
<P>
	There is no question that the subsidies we refer to mainly deal 
with rail but of course the freight subsidies in Atlantic Canada 
that deal with a lot of truck transportation will have to be 
reviewed.
<P>
	As we go through this process the objective will be to have an 
integrated affordable transportation system where all modes can 
compete on an equal footing.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is a question for the hon. member for 
Beaver River.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few remarks to the hon. member for Beaver River, who 
particularly mentioned the great generosity of Westerners to 
Easterners.
<P>
	I would like to remind her that no more than six or seven years 
ago, some financial institutions in western Canada were in great 
difficulty. Since her memory is so short, I would point out to her 
that it cost the Canadian government almost $3 billion to save 
the financial institutions in western Canada six or seven years 
ago.
<P>
	So, when it comes to her great generosity, I think that she 
should remember some things and realize that Canada has 
helped Westerners perhaps more than it is helping Easterners.
<P>
	The other thing that I would also like to tell the hon. member 
for Beaver River is that when we had problems with our credit 
unions, small financial institutions in Quebec, the federal 
government never helped them out. So you see that the principle 
of equity is not necessarily always applied in this country. I want 
to put things in their proper perspective and point out that 
Canada has been very generous as well, with taxes from Quebec, 
to boot.
<P>
	So I would like the hon. member to retract and say that she 
probably got more than she gave in the past.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, after 
my great efforts to hear the hon. member's comments, I would 
respond briefly to him.
<P>
	When we talk about generosity or balancing funds across the 
country, let us remember the amount of money which each 
province puts into Confederation. It has been made very clear to 
the hon. member through various publications, and I refer 
specifically to Robert Mansell, an economist from the 
University of Calgary, that Alberta has been a net contributor to 
Confederation. Quebec and some of the eastern Atlantic 
provinces have been economic beneficiaries of national dollars.
<P>
	Let us step wider and more broadly at this point to look at 
some of the things which some hon. members may have 
complaints about.
<P>
	If we are going to try to balance out every dollar or every cent 
that we gave or every cup of coffee that somebody bought for us, 
we have to look at this more widely and ask what is this 
Confederation that we are talking about.
<P>
	It is important for all of us to note that this is something like 
the family of which I spoke in my remarks and which many 
others in the House have spoken of as well. In a family you 
cannot balance dollars and cents. Some children require more 
spending than others. We understand that. We appreciate that.
<P>
	When talking about this whole situation let us not gripe about 
money or one thing or another. Let us look at it as a unit, as a 
family of 10 equal provinces in Confederation. I believe we are 
stronger. I believe we are more likely to be able to work in the 
international community as trading partners. As my leader 
mentioned earlier the BQ and Quebec would be far better off 
financially as part of a trading unit with Canada, a group of 
people 28 million strong, in dealing and trading internationally 
than trying to hunker off by itself as a market of eight million 
people.
<P>
	My friend is bright. I know that he understands the whole idea 
of trading blocs and how we have seen blocs become much 
larger.
<P>
	If Quebec tries to go it on its own, it will be a much smaller 
trading bloc. If the member thinks that his comments affect the 
financial situation in the country, let him beware. I really do not 
think going it on its own would be a viable situation. It would be 
much better for it to accept the invitation of the rest of Canada 
and say it will be part of this larger trading bloc than what it is 
attempting to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, 
what you will be hearing in the next 10 minutes as I speak are the 
visions and the aspirations of the people I represent. I speak for 
them today as Canadians who are genuinely interested in Canada 
as a whole nation.
<P>
	Many Canadians wonder why their elected representatives are 
spending so much time discussing national unity. In many cases 
it is generally considered that politicians are the real problem, 
not the good people of any province. Yes, there are differences 
throughout this country but you cannot solve the problems 
within a country by opting out of a country.
<P>
	Because we have had many frustrating years in this country of 
patronage and financial mismanagement does not mean our 
nation is facing an unsolvable dilemma. The people of Atlantic 
Canada have a special identifiable culture. So do Quebecers as 
do people in Ontario and the west. That does not mean we do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4954"> 4954 </A></B>
<P>
have an identifiable Canadian culture. We do. We have a lot of 
things that bind us together.
<P>
	In the years to come Canadians will demand even more 
equality, more of an identity and more accountability from the 
federal government. I suspect we will do it together with the 
same national hockey teams, the same national anthem, and the 
same pride in our flag as we have today.
<P>
	I firmly believe however we need a new vision, a new political 
approach. The old line parties drove us to the crossroads we are 
at today. We do need a change, do we not?
<P>
	There is a significant frustration that exists in this 35th 
Parliament, patronage, poor answers given to the opposition 
parties' questions posed on behalf of their constituents, 
ineffective legislation and disregard of the poor financial 
conditions they got us into in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	When that old approach is eliminated then Canada, that is all 
provinces and territories together, will move ahead and lead the 
world. What is it that will tie us all together? How can we share 
Canada and yet respect the cultural differences of all of its parts?
<P>
	We must return to the days of financial stability, of balanced 
budgets and of optimism in a proud future and not a shadow of 
doubt about interest payments going to foreign countries and 
those kinds of issues.
<P>
	It has been said that the only thing necessary for the success of 
a separatist idea to prevail is for the people of this good nation to 
do nothing. We must take it upon ourselves to balance this 
budget with a firm, realistic approach. For instance, we cannot 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product of 
some $730 billion and neglect to tell the people that the 
government will raise Canada's debt by $100 billion over the 
next three years in doing so. That is called hocus-pocus politics. 
We have seen it for 10 years. We saw it for five years before that 
and we are seeing it again today.
<P>
	The long range solution to the continual co-operative 
coexistence of all Canadians is to increase the incentive for 
ordinary Canadians to save, invest, work and employ others. 
Today we make it costly to employ people and we subsidize 
people to stay home. We have a system that increasingly taxes 
work and subsidizes non-work.
<P>
	If all provinces capture the vision of a country that lives 
within its means, a country that saves for the future generations 
and a country that spends on necessities, we will coexist with 
respect for one another. Let me outline for members some of the 
specific attributes that a united Canada will exhibit when we 
finally remove the greatest impediment, the last of the 
traditional party philosophies.
<P>
	First, governments have no money on their own. It is not their 
money. It is necessary to legislate a way by which the people can 
control government spending.
<P>
	Second, budgets must be balanced every three years both 
provincially and federally.
<P>
	Third, any borrowing by any government must be approved by 
a national referendum, that is our national government, and a 
provincial referendum for provincial governments.
<P>
	Fourth, a vibrant private industry with little or no government 
subsidization is an attribute that would lead Canada in the right 
direction for the year 2000 and beyond. Finally, patronage 
should be non-existent. Of course we need to have a real talk 
with the folks across the way because we have seen more than 
that already.
<P>
	Let us for a moment review some recommendations relative 
to the financial stability of our great country. If undertaken by 
all Canadians, it would be motivation for all of us to work 
together and to stay together.
<P>
	First, all provinces should have as one of their highest 
priorities the pursuit of national interests above the pursuit of 
provincial interests.
<P>
	Second, the system of transfer payments to the have not 
provinces should be changed because it has made them less 
economically viable. The provinces that receive transfers 
vigorously debate why they should have more and the 
transferring provinces ask why they are contributing the 
amounts they do.
<P>
	Third, the federal government has had access to tax revenues 
well beyond those needed to discharge strictly federal 
responsibilities. The patronage and the waste that is seen by the 
taxpayer in all provinces must be seen to have stopped. It has not 
stopped. It is continuing. Until this government gets it through 
its thick regulation book that that has to stop, we are going to 
have difficulties in all provinces.
<P>
	If we can convince this government that strong fiscal 
management and a commitment to balance the books should be a 
priority, all provinces will be strongly motivated to continue 
with the federation of Canada.
<P>
	To ensure the financial independence of the provinces and to 
place Confederation on a more firm financial footing, it is 
proposed that the principle of a balanced budget be enshrined in 
the Constitution. Put it there. Live by it. Live within one's 
means and then watch all of the provinces feel like they are a 
part of something that they can contribute to. This would require 
that all government spending be financed from the current tax 
revenue and that any shortfall be made up by a reduction in 
expenditures.

	Balancing the books also means balancing the common 
market trade between provinces. We must give up this ``what's 
in it for me'' attitude which is prominent among politicians. We 
are at a crossroads here, a decision about the equality of 
members, not who can get the most from a country that has 
served us so well.
<P>
	The old line political parties have a fossilized vision of 
Canada. Fiscal mismanagement has led to a significant regional 
difference between all provinces, not just one. It is time for a 
new theme. It is time we moved out of Jurassic Park and into the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Not clichés.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Yes, it is a cliché but if you 
ever saw Jurassic Park, Madam Speaker, it is sitting across from 
me.
<P>
	I appeal to the people of Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, 
Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Manitoba, 
Ontario, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Yukon and the 
Northwest Territories to set aside regional differences and work 
toward a strong, financially secure nation.
<P>
	Once again, a concern. Our generation of politicians are 
excluding the millions of young people under the voting age in 
this discussion. The future of these young Canadians is being 
decided upon and they will be the ones responsible for this 
decision and the mess we create. Does it sound familiar? That 
very kind of philosophy was embedded in Liberalism when they 
started increasing debt and borrowing year after year, as did the 
Conservative Party as well. If our young could vote they would 
not separate, they would build a stronger Canada.
<P>
	We cannot make a strong nation by emphasizing the 
differences through multicultural policies, differences through 
bilingual policies, differences through special aboriginal 
policies, patronage and other political toys. We are a federation 
of 10 equal provinces. We are the true north strong and free. We 
are our home and native land and we will always be a united 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to say that as surprising as it is coming from the 
Reform Party, I am glad to hear this debate on national unity. For 
20 years I have been trying to keep Canada together, doing what 
I could from the other side of the country, from British 
Columbia.
<P>
	I would also like to remind my colleagues that we are a 
democratic party. Our party is a democratic party so we vote by 
consensus and majority rule.
<P>
	During the Charlottetown hearings, and I attended several of 
these hearings, there were several answers that came out. We 
heard what Canadians wanted. The referendum was an 
expensive one. Referenda are all expensive. I believe that an 
election is the time for us to vote on whether the work that the 
government has done is good or not.
<P>
	I would also like to add that in all these discussions, and I have 
been listening all morning, I never heard where the Reform 
Party stands on inherent rights to aboriginal self-government. 
In fact, during the Charlottetown accord hearings one of the 
questions that came up constantly and one of the things that 
people seemed to be agreeing more on was in fact the inherent 
rights to self-government for the aboriginal people.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague where the Reform Party 
stands on the inherent right of aboriginal self-government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
just two comments. It is ironic that one hears in the House, as 
surprising as it is, the Reformers discussing national unity. I 
would suggest that Reformers are as nationalist as the 
government. The difference is how you run that government, 
how you run a country and how you deal with it. I certainly do 
not subscribe to its approach.
<P>
	The inherent right of our aboriginal peoples has always been 
of concern to Reformers. We believe in their inherent right. The 
difference is that the government has yet to define what inherent 
right is, what kind of management style it is, how much is it 
going to cost, will the department of Indian affairs still exist and 
so on.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We believe in the inherent right of aboriginals to govern 
themselves, but there are a lot of questions that have to be 
answered before we would sign on the dotted line and that is 
understandable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
heard many motions on opposition days and I can say that this 
one is flim-flam. It is phoney. It is political opportunism.
<P>
	We have a six to seven-part motion. There is absolutely no 
way I would support the leader of the Reform Party when he 
spoke this morning of their vision of what a new Canada is. 
There is absolutely no way.
<P>
	I am going to refer to what the leader of the Reform Party said 
on January 20. There are all sorts of other quotes in <I>Hansard</I> that 
we can go to. This is the leader of the Reform Party speaking:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that he does not want to reopen 
constitutional issues at this time and that the priority of his government is jobs 
and economic growth. Yet yesterday he and other members were repeatedly 
drawn into heated exchanges with Bloc members on the constitutional future of 
Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are millions of Canadians, including Quebecers, who want Parliament 
to focus on deficit reduction, jobs and preserving social services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4956"> 4956 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is the Prime Minister abandoning his commitment to stay out of the 
constitutional swamp or is it still his resolve to stick to economic, fiscal and 
social priorities?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is exactly what the Liberal Party is doing. We are trying 
to get the economy going and get the country back on track.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I can say to you, as a comment, that I have 
found their position on this issue to be divisive for the country 
and helpful to the Bloc. The only comparison I will make is that 
the Bloc is at least honest and forthright about it. I cannot say the 
same thing about the Reform Party in terms of what it is doing.
<P>
	What it wants to do is divide the country and it is doing it for 
crass political purposes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, it is just 
unbelievable the amount of emotion that gets into this process.
<P>
	The government has moved an amendment today that wants to 
eliminate such words as ``a country that is committed to 
strengthening our economy''. We know that is a problem over 
there, so it is taking that out. It wants to take out of the 
amendment ``balancing the budgets of our government''. It also 
wants to take out ``sustaining our social services, conserving our 
environment, preserving our cultural heritage and diversity''. 
What is wrong with a good debate on that? It is about time the 
government started talking in the House about it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Madam Speaker, the member who just 
spoke was absolutely right when he said that this is a debate that 
gets Canadians' emotions going. In that sense it is 
uncharacteristic of how we usually approach political issues.
<P>
	The government does not take one day of the year to debate 
national unity. We make sure that every day of the year, every 
act of government is about nation building, not tearing the 
nation down.
<P>
	The member spoke about how we have to cut the country into 
little pieces. I heard him say a few moments ago, if we take the 
power of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., British 
Columbia and all the other provinces and divide it up into little 
packets, that all of a sudden this is the new formula for the new 
federalism.
<P>
	The Government of Canada believes that we should be tested 
and measured on our commitment to nation building in every 
decision that we make. We cannot take a motion which by and 
large is a series of platitudes. It is a series of motherhood 
statements, but it is a thinly disguised attempt to once again 
begin the counterproductive squabbling over the Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I shook my head when I heard the leader of the Reform Party, 
who only a few weeks ago stood in his place in the House and 
pointed his finger at the Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who 
for 30 years has  epitomized balance, fairness, rightness and 
nation building, and accused him of being involved in a family 
feud because he was in his place defending the position of the 
Government of Canada on a number of very important issues.
<P>
	I will accede to the point that maybe the Reform Party does 
not really know what its strategy is, because the approach taken 
by leader of the Reform Party and his party today actually fuel 
the cause of breaking up the nation. They fuel the cause of 
separation. They reinforce, for anyone who cares to hear, the 
fact that the nation is not being built, the nation is being cut into 
little pieces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With today's motion, the leader of the Reform Party tried to 
do worse than simply launching futile debates. He tried to 
position the Reform Party on both sides of the fence on basic 
issues. He tried to play with his party's policies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On this issue the leader of the Reform Party is trying to sit on 
both sides of the fence, and that can be a very painful position.
<P>
	What exactly does the leader of the Reform Party mean when 
he talks about sustaining social programs? Does it mean that the 
party has reversed its position against universal medicare? Does 
that mean that its members now agree with the government that 
we should vigorously oppose extra billing? Even more 
confusing is the motion's reference to ``preserving our cultural 
heritage and diversity''. What does that mean, from a party that 
ran on a platform of abolishing multiculturalism? What does 
that mean, from a party which introduced another motion to 
oppose official bilingualism?
<P>
	The Reform Party has a curiously confused policy. It wants to 
preserve our cultural heritage and diversity in theory but it 
wants to oppose it in practice. It is impossible to know what to 
make of the wording of the Reform Party's motion.
<P>
	When Reform Party members talk about diversity, are we now 
to take it that they favour aboriginal self-government? When 
they talk about equality, do they now favour employment 
equity? Do they now favour access to decent child care for 
working parents? When they talk about productive relations 
with the peoples of the world, are they now in favour of 
abolishing the cuts that they proposed to foreign aid? When they 
talk about protecting our lives, are they now favouring the gun 
control that they so vigorously opposed?
<P>
	I am certain the answer to these questions is no. The Reform 
Party hopes that it can get away with some fuzzy language to 
mean whatever it wants it to mean.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4957"> 4957 </A></B>
<P>
	This is the message that I want to leave with the House. What 
is most disturbing is that once again the Reform Party is playing 
right into the hands of the separatist Bloc Quebecois. We do not 
believe that the leader of the Reform Party is naive. We know 
that his action is giving a platform to the Bloc to bash 
federalism. As Liberals, as federalists, as Canadians, we deeply 
regret that initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This morning, Bloc members rose in the House to complain 
about comments I made yesterday about their leader's presence 
at the Citadel on the 50th anniversary of D-Day. What is 
important, what I said yesterday and what I continue to say is 
indeed very emotional. When a political party leader comes to 
Canada's Parliament to try to break it up, it is indeed an 
emotional issue, but I still defend with all my heart his right to 
speak because what motivated the soldiers 50 years ago is the 
absolute and total democracy we see with the presence of the 
opposition spokespersons. What is worse, Madam Speaker, and 
perhaps less generous is that the opposition leader sees nothing 
wrong with travelling around the world to brag about a separate 
country. He boasts about the fact that in Paris he was welcomed 
like the leader of a new state but he denies the Canadian 
government the same opportunity to travel to other countries to 
find the economic solutions we are looking for here.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The separatists, these so-called defenders of freedom, now 
want to muzzle any financial or economic institution that does 
not agree with them. We heard the comments made yesterday by 
Mr. Parizeau. Today, it is the Bank of Montreal's turn. 
Tomorrow it could be Wood Gundy. Tomorrow will it be 
ordinary Quebecers who are denied the right to speak in a debate 
so critical to our country's future?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc thinks he should be free to travel the 
world promoting his view of separation in Canada and abroad, 
but by God, should a minister of the crown dare to go to an 
OECD meeting to exchange ideas on the economy? Deux poids, 
deux mesures.
<P>
	Conspiracy theories, Quebec bashing and Canada bashing 
make for a few good political points, but they do nothing to 
solve the country's basic economic problems.
<P>
	Liberals want to take part in this debate today because we 
want to concentrate on the fundamental reason we were elected 
to this Parliament. That is to put Canadians back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last week, Shawinigan's police chief was in Hamilton, 
Shawinigan's twin city. We spent the whole day together. You 
know, Madam Speaker, what struck me and continues to strike 
me is that, if you ask young people in Shawinigan, Chicoutimi, 
the Lac-Saint-Jean region,  Hamilton or Toronto what they are 
looking for, they will tell you they share the same goals.
<P>
	I am the godmother of a two-year-old girl in Montreal who 
speaks French at home even though her father is an anglophone. 
It may surprise some separatists who do not know how 
Quebecers live but there are such people. Twenty-five 
French-speaking Liberal members worked here in this House 
and elsewhere in the country to defend minority rights across 
this beautiful country of ours. Do you think that, on the day that 
Canada ceases to exist, minorities will still have rights? Do you 
think that the millions of francophones now living in Timmins, 
Sudbury, Haileybury, New Brunswick, or Saint-Albert, will 
have a say in the new political reality?
<P>
	Madam Speaker, why not work here together on issues 
affecting all our young people, work hard to try to renew our 
social assets, our human resources, because one thing is 
obvious: If you are about to get training in Montreal, Toronto or 
Vancouver, the current system does not work. But instead of 
letting both sides of the House work together, all the Bloc does is 
put up roadblocks and whine; they refuse to accept anything 
good just because it comes from the federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The saddest thing is that if you scrape away all the politics, if 
you scrape away the regional infighting, if you talk to a young 
person in Lethbridge, Red Deer or Dawson Creek, they share the 
same dreams. They share the same needs as the young people in 
Chicoutimi or Chibougamau.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The unfortunate tone and nature of this debate is that the 
Reform Party and the Bloc seem to believe that by carving up the 
country into linguistic pieces or geographic pieces, somehow we 
will make the nation better. What they do not understand is that 
any nation that wants to build for the future has to understand its 
past. Look at the reality of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why? Why are we recognized throughout the world as a 
generous nation? It is because we decided, at the very beginning 
of our history, in our Constitution, to create a country with the 
two founding nations, and this is a fundamental element of who 
we are today.
<P>
	Why do we have laws on firearms which differ greatly from 
those of our American neighbour? It is because we believed, at 
the beginning of our history, that both the individual and the 
community, not the individual alone, must define the priorities 
for our society.
<P>
	And the role of the community was enshrined in the 
Constitution itself, in 1867. Yes, there were problems. We lived 
and we continue to live difficult periods. But this is like a 
marriage: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4958"> 4958 </A></B>
<P>
either you communicate and achieve something great, or else 
you shut the door.
<P>
	Unfortunately, what is happening is that the hon. members 
opposite are closing the door. They have no interest in helping 
the Canadian economy. They have no interest in putting the 
young unemployed from Roberval to work because if young 
jobless in Roberval find work it will reflect favourably on the 
economy and the Government of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the Reform Party really wanted to advance the cause of 
federalism and unity it would focus on the important task of 
rebuilding the economy and meeting the real challenges of the 
21st century.
<P>
	Canadians voted last October for a message of hope. They 
voted for honesty and integrity in government. We have made 
mistakes and we will continue to make mistakes, but by and 
large the hallmark of this government is honesty and integrity. 
They voted for an end to jurisdictional wrangling and indeed the 
Prime Minister is proud that he has promised to focus on a jobs 
agenda and to stay off the eternal treadmill of constitutional 
dissension. Ask ourselves the best question: Where else in the 
world would we rather want to live?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Is it true or not that Canada, in spite of all the problems and 
challenges, is the best place in the world to raise children?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the best place in the world to grow up. It is the best place 
in the world to be sick. It is the best place in the world to build a 
future.
<P>
	We are moving to tear down those interprovincial barriers. 
My colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry, is working very hard on accomplishing real tasks to get 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
	A Reform Party member laughed earlier about what we were 
doing with the infrastructure program. I can say that in the 
Labourers' International Union hall in my riding when they get 
called to go out to a job they are not laughing. They are thanking 
God that a Liberal government had the good sense to put in place 
a very specific and direct job action to get Canadians back to 
work. That is a case of functional federalism: a country that puts 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
	In the space of five months the minister responsible for 
infrastructure signed agreements with every single province to 
deliver on specific programs, no mean task.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	According to the OECD, this year our economy will grow by 
3.9 per cent. That is almost 4 per cent. And next year, the 
economic growth is expected to reach 4.5 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Canadians were right when they elected our government. 
They understood its message. Economic recovery is what will 
make our country work. The best way to ensure Canadian unity 
is to strengthen the things which unite us, not the things which 
separate us.
<P>
	If you had the opportunity to spend half an hour with my 
seven-year old daughter, you would see that she shares the 
dreams and hopes of every Canadian child. Sure, we can put the 
emphasis on what does not work. Even if this was not Canada, 
there would still be some bickering between the various levels 
of government. If the federal government is not involved, then it 
is a municipality against the province or the region. It is part of 
human nature to think that things are not going well. It is an 
obvious thing to do, it is normal and it is even desirable.
<P>
	But to go so far as to say that the federal system is no longer 
working, is finished, is not only to show a lack of logic but-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
It is a denial. It is a denial of the real wishes of every single 
citizen of this country to be given the opportunity to achieve to 
the best of their ability.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They do not want us to come here to whine, to bicker and to 
fiddle. They want us to come here to put our country back to 
work.
<P>
	You can always find excuses to make it not work, as 
demonstrated by the motion tabled today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our objective is not to be dragged into the constitutional 
morass but rather to work with Canadians as we have worked. 
Last week we signed the first ever Atlantic environmental 
accord which put Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 
and Prince Edward Island together to work with the federal 
government for positive environmental change. That is about 
government that works.
<P>
	We do not need constitutional amendments and we do not 
need the kind of negative rhetoric of the Reform Party. What we 
need is a plan to put Canadians back to work to build a better 
country.
<P>
	We do not want one language group to succeed over another. 
English only is not the solution. If one language group succeeds 
at the expense of another, Canada is not working. When Canada 
is working every language group has the right and the privilege 
to be everything they want to be. That is what the Liberal vision 
of Canada is all about. When I can stand in the House of 
Commons with a Chinese immigrant who came to this country 
and is now Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific and is proud to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4959"> 4959 </A></B>
<P>
speak more than one language, that is about making Canada 
work and using the talent of every citizen.
<P>
	Our agenda is an economic agenda. Our agenda is a social 
agenda. Our agenda is a healing agenda. If we stay on the 
straight and narrow, the road the Prime Minister has set for us-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-if we put the emphasis on job creation and economic growth, 
it is obvious that Canadians and Canada will work, which is our 
goal in this whole debate on Canadian unity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Madam Speaker, 
several things which the hon. member for Hamilton East alluded 
to talked about our playing into the hands of the BQ, that we 
were bashing federalism, that we were engaging in negative 
rhetoric and that we were on a constitutional treadmill.
<P>
	Let me make it painfully clear so that every member in this 
House understands. We are not talking about the Constitution as 
such. We are talking about federalism and this is what needs to 
be discussed in this House. Surely there is a difference between 
wrangling about the Constitution and about federalism. There is 
not one person in this House, I hope, who would talk about how 
dreadful Canada is. That is simply not true.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	We heard those comments coming across. We believe this 
country is worth fighting so hard for that we are here out of other 
careers, not people who have made their living off politics for 
years and years. We are asking for an open and frank discussion 
about this, not getting into the tirades that we have heard about. 
This is not right.
<P>
	When we talk about such things as our position on 
bilingualism let me remind the member again because of any 
one else on the government side she probably has poured over 
our blue sheet more than anyone else. The member well knows 
the position of this party on official bilingualism. It is not what 
she referred to as English only.
<P>
	Let me give the hon. member a chance to say that there is 
something positive about a debate on this. Perhaps it is 
unfortunate that someone else came up with the idea before they 
did.
<P>
	I heard the member for Brant talking about how confused she 
is about the election and how people did not talk about the 
Constitution. Much has changed. I would like the hon. member 
to comment on this. We did not talk about it at great lengths 
because Charlottetown was so new and Meech Lake was so new 
and painful. However, we discussed this in the election last fall.
<P>
	May I ask the member to comment on the fact that things are 
much different now. There were eight BQ in the House last time 
around and there are now 54.
<P>
	Quite frankly the Liberals got smoked in Quebec during the 
election and she knows that. The provincial situation there is 
much different now than it was last fall as an election is 
imminent.
<P>
	May she discuss with us very briefly why there is such an 
obsession on the other side to defend status quo federalism, as 
her comrade from Brant talked about earlier. Why is there is 
such a partisan difficulty with a tirade in this? Why can we not 
just discuss this so that we are building a new country together 
and the BQ and others in Quebec would want to come to it?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Madam Speaker, I guess I get excited about the 
issue because I care about the future of my country. I believe that 
the motives of the member certainly are moving in the same 
direction. She cares about the country. She wants to see the 
country stay together. I appeal to her and to her colleagues that 
the direction of their policies would have the unfortunate and 
unexpected opposite effect.
<P>
	When they introduced a motion, as they did only a few weeks 
ago to basically carve up the country into linguistic categories 
where there would be English in all the provinces except Quebec 
and then French except on the west island of Montreal, they 
were reinforcing the idea that somehow what is going to keep 
this country together is a kind of linguistic ghettoization.
<P>
	I believe the unexpected results of their policies are to feed 
into the same kind of message that the Bloc is using to encourage 
people in Quebec to follow the road of separation.
<P>
	The simple message of the Bloc is that Quebec works without 
Canada. The unfortunate message of the linguistic policies of 
the Reform Party is that Canada would work better without 
Quebec. That is the message that comes out. The distinction of 
the policies of the Liberal Party and the policies of the 
Government of Canada is that a fundamental tenant of our 
party's belief is that this nation historically was built and in the 
future will be built on the principle of two founding nations and 
the importance of every other person who came to this country.
<P>
	My great grandparents came from Ireland. Technically they 
were neither anglophones nor francophones. They were on the 
republican side of the Irish.
<P>
	The reality is other individuals and groups have come 
together to form an incredible strength, a real asset to this 
country. In recognizing the fundamental rights of two founding 
peoples we underline the importance of providing opportunities 
and equality for every citizen of this country. I think it is 
important to compare that with the route taken by the United 
States that did not have a two founding nations principle. It 
basically said to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4960"> 4960 </A></B>
<P>
their minorities: ``Jump in with us, meld with us and we are 
going to make it''.
<P>
	The reality is that the framing of the Canadian Constitution 
originally set the stage for a partage, a co-operative approach 
that said every part of this country can speak different languages 
and make the system work.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	I think that is the fundamental difference between the one 
language policy of their party and the two people policy of the 
Liberal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the minister spoke with a lot of emotion, but I say we have to 
find a balance in passion and reason. Where were the minister's 
emotions on Meech Lake and Charlottetown? I will look at this 
in a reasonable way.
<P>
	We have reached the point where, although we are all part of 
the same country, we do not really live in the same house. We are 
part of that country but we have to go in through the back door. 
We simply want to be a people, to have our own house and leave 
the other house to those who want to live in it. They say Canada 
is wonderful. They are absolutely right. But Quebec is 
wonderful too, and afterwards, we will be able to say that 
Canadians and Quebecers are still the best of friends. We can 
live as good neighbours, we can be happy and we can work 
together.
<P>
	Earlier, I heard Reform Party members say they wanted 
another Canada. We have wanted another Canada for 15, 20 or 
even 50 years, but it never happened. When I say that we want to 
become sovereign, you say no, no, no. When an eighteen-year 
old wants to leave home, will his father give him cookies and 
candy to get him to stay? Why do they want to keep us from 
leaving? That is my question.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not hand out cookies or 
candy, and I think it is insulting for Quebecers to be told they can 
have candy if they stay in Canada.
<P>
	There are certain things that have to be discussed. First of all, 
the hon. member talked about good friends, and of course we 
have good friends across this beautiful country. When a husband 
and wife who get along well, and are very good friends but 
decide to separate and finally to divorce, I do not know whether 
you saw the movie <I>The War of the Roses</I>, but you can have the 
most logical people in the world, but when emotions surface, 
that is the struggle between passion and reason.
<P>
	Second, when the Leader of the Opposition went to 
Washington, he mentioned the fact that we had the best social 
security system in the world. He told Americans that he wanted a 
U.S. passport for his son. He said his wife wanted a U.S. 
passport for her son so he would have dual citizenship, because 
she is a republican and proud of it. This was in an interview he 
gave in Washington. He also confirmed the fact that despite 
everything that was said about Quebecers in the past-the Prime 
Minister and Leader of the Opposition are both Quebecers-  
everything that was said in the course of Canadian history and 
during the period before the quiet revolution, today, as 
Quebecers within a united Canada, you are in a position to face 
the real challenges of the twenty-first century, and you have a 
level of entrepreneurship that is unique in this country. Use it. 
You are also talented-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the minister. Resuming debate. The hon. member for Roberval.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, without 
a doubt, the presentation we have just heard paints a picture of 
Canada that is nothing more than an illusion. The Deputy Prime 
Minister is a master illusionist, skilled at relating facts in a very 
interesting, entirely believable way, while concealing certain 
realities that must be brought to light today. And we intend to do 
just that.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that as recently as yesterday, in her Canada, 
the Deputy Prime Minister questioned the right of the Leader of 
the Official Opposition in this House, and of a member whose 
father fought in Europe, to lay a wreath in honour of the 
Quebecers who died because they shared the same ideals as 
soldiers from other nations.
<P>
	In the Deputy Prime Minister's Canada, francophones outside 
Quebec, in particular those living in Kingston, have to fight to 
get adequate French-language schools with running water and 
washrooms.
<P>
	In 1994, in the Deputy Prime Minister's Canada, 
francophones outside Quebec must fight to obtain which has 
long been viewed as necessary in all civilized countries. In her 
Canada, each citizen inherits a debt of $18,000 when he or she 
comes into this world. This is reality, not an illusion.
<P>
	In the Deputy Prime Minister's Canada, the job prospects of 
citizens are the bleakest of all industrialized countries. The rate 
of unemployment hovers anywhere between 12 per cent and 14 
per cent, depending on the circumstances, and stands as high as 
20 per cent in a region such as the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean to 
which she referred several times in her speech.
<P>
	Yes, we intend to talk about the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region, about young people who want to work in this country and 
about the Deputy Prime Minister's idealistic vision of Canada.
<P>
	The Canada of which she spoke with such apparent sincerity a 
while ago is the Canada which patriated the Constitution in 1982 
without the consent of the country's only predominantly 
francophone province. This is the country which imposed on an 
extremely important minority which accounts for nearly the 
entire population of a province, an unwanted Constitution 
hatched behind Quebec's back. This Canada is the end result of 
the odious work of numerous representatives of this  govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4961"> 4961 </A></B>
<P>
ment over the years. Exactly what kind of work are we talking 
about?
<P>
	Since you want to hear about it, let us set aside the traditional 
legitimate demands of the French-speaking majority in Quebec; 
let us set aside all these demands to take a closer look at the 
sorry, obscure role that the leading lights in this government 
played in our recent history. When did relations become most 
embittered in Canada?
<P>
	Remember the reign of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Remember that 
period of very great centralization when the Prime Minister, 
obviously, decided that his conception of Canada, which was 
supported by his colleagues, was a country where power had to 
be centralized and the provinces were only secondary.
<P>
	Do you want to know one of the major problems which 
explains our presence here in this House today debating a 
motion in which it is clear that the Deputy Prime Minister's 
great beautiful Canada is breaking up? One of the main reasons 
is the odious centralizing attitude that ignores the French fact 
which Prime Minister Trudeau had in a recent past.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I will remind you that in other circumstances 
it was possible to think that in this would-be ideal Canada there 
would be room for Quebec, a proper decent place for Quebec. 
But I tell you it always happened when the voters had gotten rid 
of a Liberal government. Whenever Canada was governed by the 
Liberal Party in our recent history, there has been no political 
peace. The people who are crying today, trying to tell us what a 
shame it is that the separatists are in this House-who were 
democratically elected, we must say-what a pity it is that these 
people offer a different political position from their own.
<P>
	You must be blind not to see the frightful role played by 
successive Liberal governments in this Parliament which denied 
the very existence of the French fact in Quebec. These 
governments always strove for centralization, which is no 
longer acceptable in Quebec. Is that clear? Quebec no longer 
accepts the centralizing attitude that those people believe in.
<P>
	You remember the Meech Lake Accord; everyone does. This 
was an extremely important political moment for Quebec. Yes, 
Quebecers gave Canada a last chance for a face-lift. Yes, 
Quebecers successfully negotiated minimum conditions with 
the other provinces, the other regions of Canada and the federal 
government. It cannot be denied that all Quebecers made a 
tremendous effort to accept the five conditions behind the 
Meech Lake Accord. Even the premiers, may I remind you, 
undertook to convince their respective provinces that these 
demands were acceptable.
<P>
	What are these demands? Recognition of Quebec as a distinct 
society and of Quebec's National Assembly's role in promoting 
this distinctiveness. Was it surprising, outrageous, odious to ask 
that Quebec francophones, who form a people, be recognized as 
a distinct society? I think it is a basic requirement.
<P>
	Recognition of the federal government's spending power but 
with the right to opt out and full compensation for the provinces 
because the central government's unfortunate tendency to 
invade areas of provincial jurisdiction had to be contained to 
prevent this society from expressing itself as it saw fit in the 
future.
<P>
	Quebec's participation in the appointment of three civil-law 
judges to the Supreme Court; entrenchment of the 
Cullen-Couture Agreement in the Constitution, that is, 
Quebec's power to control its immigration and to protect the 
very nature of the Quebec people; the provinces' unanimous 
agreement to reform some federal institutions. Everyone in 
Quebec as well as many people in English Canada thought these 
demands were quite acceptable. They were very minimal but 
they at least made a dialogue possible.
<P>
	Do you know what made the premiers go back on their word? 
Let us look at those mainly responsible for the failure of the last 
great historic opportunity to achieve this wonderful Canada 
described by the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Do you remember someone called Clyde Wells? He does not 
belong to the Bloc, the Parti Quebecois or the Reform Party. 
Clyde Wells is a Liberal, Madam Speaker, just like the Liberals 
opposite.
<P>
	Do you know Mr. McKenna? McKenna is neither a Bloquiste 
nor a Reformer but a Liberal.
<P>
	Do you remember Sharon Carstairs? She was not a member of 
the government but what role did she play in making the Meech 
Lake Accord impossible to accept? Ms. Carstairs was not a Tory, 
a Bloquiste, a Pequiste or a Reformer; she was another Liberal.
<P>
	Finally, Madam Speaker, we all remember the extraordinary 
role played by the hon. member for Churchill, also a Liberal, 
who resorted to technicalities to ensure that the Meech Lake 
Accord would not be accepted in his province.
<P>
	Those are the people who played a major role in the failure of 
the Meech Lake Accord. Those are Liberals who, on the evening 
of the Meech failure, the evening of the Liberal convention, 
hugged the current leader of the party and Prime Minister. Those 
are the ones to blame. Those people, who prevented the 
ratification of the five conditions deemed acceptable by all the 
parties involved for Canada to continue to be a viable option, are 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4962"> 4962 </A></B>
<P>
true responsibles for that failure and the situation in which we 
find ourselves today.
<P>
	Yet, these same people come here and try to teach a lesson to 
Reform Party members, to Bloc Quebecois members, and to 
everyone else, with their vision of Canada. These people are 
fooling Canadians. I want to be clear. You are fooling 
Canadians. Stop burying your head in the sand. Face reality as it 
exists in Canada.
<P>
	Surely, not everybody on the other side is disconnected from 
reality. There must be people who are sensitive to the needs of 
Francophones. There must be people who are still able to 
understand that democracy has rendered its verdict in Quebec 
and that the Bloc Quebecois is here for a very specific reason.
<P>
	We campaigned by promoting sovereignty for Quebec, and I 
have something to say to the Liberals opposite. Whether you 
like it or not, we will promote Quebec sovereignty in every 
possible way. We will use every argument to explain, not only to 
Quebecers, but also to other nations, to people abroad, and to 
others in Canada, how this eminently democratic project will be 
based on a serious, responsible, democratic and proper process 
which will be respectful of people and realities.
<P>
	This process will be similar to our interventions here in this 
House. It will reflect the spirit of co-operation which we have 
always displayed to ensure that this Parliament operates the way 
it should.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that we have no lessons in 
democracy to receive from the other side. If there is a place in 
Canada where a minority is treated with respect and is an 
integral part of the community, it is the English-speaking 
minority in Quebec.
<P>
	Which other region of the country provides its minority with a 
complete network of school boards, schools, hospitals, health 
care facilities? These institutions are not only at the service of 
the minority: They are also controlled by anglophones in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Yes, we respect Quebec's anglophones. Yes, we intend to keep 
building bridges with a community that is an integral part of 
Quebec as it is today.
<P>
	I suggest members opposite to do the same in their part of the 
country. We do not need any advice on how to be democratic and 
respect the rights of others. We are doing a very good job, thank 
you very much, as far as democracy is concerned, and we intend 
to finish what we have set out to do. I admit there were other 
alternatives in the past, but we intend to go ahead with our plan 
because across the way are the real perpetrators of the 
constitutional mess Canada has been in since the eighties.
<P>
	Two Liberal Prime Ministers in succession have created a 
situation that has become intolerable in this country. They are 
the real culprits, and they keep denying it. They even got 
themselves an ineffable Prime Minister who, with 54 
sovereigntist members elected to Parliament, went around 
saying: ``There will be no debate on the Constitution during my 
mandate. There are no constitutional problems in Canada''. That 
takes some doing, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	As long as we have people on that side of the House who will 
not face the facts. As long as, day after day, we see 
ever-increasing attempts at centralization, as has been the case 
since we were elected to this House a few months ago. As long as 
we see these shocking attempts at patriating powers to the 
central government. As long as we see federal-provincial 
conferences being postponed because not only Quebec but most 
provincial governments can no longer tolerate federal intrusions 
into their jurisdictions. As long as we have a political situation 
in which people in Ottawa do not make the effort to understand 
the different realities of Canada's regions, not just the 
circumstances in Quebec but those in the other regions as well. 
As long as we are governed by people who show so little interest 
in what happens in Canada's regions, we will continue to see 
centralist offensives and provinces, premiers and citizens who 
protest, and they will have to deal with these problems in their 
own Canada, because Quebec, I am positive, will have decided, 
in a democratic way, to make its own choices.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the Deputy Prime Minister had said that she was hurt to see the 
Leader of the Opposition lay a wreath, but she defended his right 
to do so because she believes in a democratic country. I shared 
her hurt and pain when I went over to the war memorial on 
Monday and the first group of MPs I saw were the Bloc, the 
separatists.
<P>
	Yes, separatists lost family during the war, but it was a war in 
which Canada fought as one united nation to preserve one united 
nation. While I have defended the right for the Bloc to be the 
party of the opposition in my riding, it hurt me to see the people 
who would destroy this country.
<P>
	I would also like to suggest that the leader of the Reform Party 
must feel very pleased with what he has wrought today. I wonder 
what goes on in the lobby of the opposition side, the collusion, 
the strategy, the working together, the flip side of the coin, the 
Quebec without Canada, the Canada without Quebec. Madam 
Speaker, I would suggest that when you watch the news tonight 
you will see the member from the other side as he raises his 
voice and his face turns red and he yells and screams ``more 
rights, more rights for Quebec,'' and I tell you how difficult it 
will be to defend his right to sit in this House in my riding.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4963"> 4963 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	We can thank the leader of the Reform for being irresponsible 
in heating up the rhetoric in this debate. If the member on the 
other side is respectful of people's rights then my question to 
you is why do you ignore and why do you choose not to respect 
the rights of the native people in Quebec in their path toward 
sovereignty and self-government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, what is there to 
say! The hon. member is attempting to give us a lesson in 
democracy and while I am convinced that she is not acting in bad 
faith, I feel she has neglected to consider the important role I 
alluded to earlier that was played by these leaders, by the first 
ministers and ministers.
<P>
	The hon. member tells me that she was hurt to see the Leader 
of the Opposition pay tribute to the soldiers who died. First of 
all, the Canada which these soldiers defended was not the same 
country that later was coerced, manipulated, despoiled, altered 
and tormented without Quebec's consent. That is something the 
hon. member should first understand. The Canada bequeathed to 
us by Mr. Trudeau, her former leader and the former Prime 
Minister, the Canada in which Quebecers no longer feel at home, 
is not the same Canada that we knew back then. We must not lose 
sight of this fact.	
<P>
	Regardless of our political option, are we to be denied the 
right to pay homage to those who came before us and who fought 
to preserve our democratic values? Are we to be denied this 
right? Is this a country in which people will become indignant 
because we are allowed to pay tribute to our own sons who 
fought for democracy?
<P>
	More than anyone, we hope that respect for democratic values 
is deeply rooted in this Parliament because this principle will 
one day help us to achieve the objective we hold so dear.
<P>
	With respect to native rights, without delving into this subject 
too deeply because of time constraints, I would just like to say to 
the hon. member that if she was truly up on native issues, she 
would realize that native people in Quebec far and away enjoy 
the best standard of living of all native peoples. Far and away. 
She would also realize that it was in Quebec that natives first 
obtained some recognition from the government, something 
which natives living elsewhere cannot even hope to secure.
<P>
	She forgets that in Quebec, negotiations and discussion 
involving more than two thirds of the territory have taken place. 
An agreement was reached with the Cree of James Bay and with 
the Inuit, an agreement signed by all parties. This was nothing 
like the unilateral agreements of the past, but a genuine, 
all-party agreement which resolved a slew of problems that 
have yet to be settled anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Of all the provinces in Canada, Quebec more than anyone else 
has engaged in the broadest, liveliest, most open and most 
consensual dialogue with native peoples.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to speak to the Minister of Indian 
Affairs, to discuss this issue with him and to call upon the other 
provinces to do for their native communities what Quebec has 
done. This would be a major step forward.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
this member from the Bloc can huff and puff and shout and make 
a lot of noise and it really will not matter-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, I am going to 
interrupt. I would ask hon. members to recognize when the Chair 
recognizes someone. I do not have to be told what side they are 
on. I see them standing and I see who stands first. Continue 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, I think I will start over again.
<P>
	This member from the Bloc can huff and puff and fume and 
point his finger and get as red faced as he wants. However 
Canadians will see him for what he is. He is a political 
grandstander and there is not a shred of credibility in anything 
he says.
<P>
	Unfortunately the leader of the Reform Party has to take 
major responsibility for the spectacle in the House this 
afternoon. The leader of the Reform Party has built this trap, a 
trap that only the Bloc Quebecois could build.
<P>
	What does the Bloc want? The Bloc wants us squabbling over 
the Constitution. The Bloc wants us squabbling over federalism. 
The Bloc wants us squabbling over Canada and that is exactly 
what we have had all afternoon. We have had this wrangle over 
our country, the greatest country in the world. The leader of the 
Reform Party has to take full responsibility for this spectacle.
<P>
	I want to say this about the Bloc. It takes advantage of 
Canada's democracy. It takes advantage of our generosity. 
Where else in the world would we allow the Leader of the 
Opposition to go around the country spreading separatism and 
doing his level best to destroy the country?
<P>
	I tell the member of the Bloc who just spoke that if he were a 
citizen of another country he would be behind bars. He would be 
in jail. However this is the kind of country that we have because 
we allow through his democratic rights to spread this vile 
separatism.
<P>
	Do you know what, Madam Speaker, I will support his right to 
say these things, but by golly we will fight him wherever we find 
him. We are going to beat him at his own game because 
ultimately this democracy is going to succeed. We are going to 
defeat separatism. We are going to beat the Bloc. We are going 
to beat all of them, all 54 of them because this is a great country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4964"> 4964 </A></B>
<P>
and all Canadians  realize that, as do Quebecers. So they can go 
all they want. We are going to win this battle.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Point of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to make 
something clear. The time allowed is 20 minutes plus 10 minutes 
for questions or comments. There are questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>There are two minutes left.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu): </B>There are not two 
minutes left. I am sorry, but I kept track of the time very 
carefully. The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie on a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, I would ask the House 
whether there is unanimous consent, as we did this morning 
when we agreed to let a member of the Liberal Party respond. 
We did it this morning with great generosity.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I imagine we in the House are feeling very generous, as the 
hon. member opposite just said, and will give the last speaker 30 
or 45 seconds, as you did this morning, I think, to respond to the 
comments. I therefore ask for unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House heard the 
motion. Does the hon. member for Roberval have the unanimous 
consent of the House to respond?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Madam 
Speaker, after the fire and brimstone of recent minutes, which 
reminded me of a Wagnerian opera performed by a travelling 
company in a provincial town, I would like to return to the 
subject of the debate, which is the motion moved by the leader of 
the Reform Party and the amendment moved by the leader of the 
government in the House. That concerns the issue of 
constitution making in our times and this issue of federalism.
<P>
	I will come back to a point raised by the Reform Party which 
is a criticism of the government for a failure to define what the 
leader of the Reform Party has said, a constitutional program for 
the Quebec referendum.
<P>
	There is a time when it is ripe for constitution making in any 
society but in the majority of times, it is just not simply right. 
The only successful ventures in constitution making occur in a 
period of national euphoria, a national consensus usually 
following on a great military victory or a great revolution. We 
have not had those in Canada and therefore changes have had to 
be made on a basis of pragmatic incremental adjustment on a 
step by step basis. It has worked rather well.
<P>
	A problem that is basic to the Reform Party leader's program 
is that there are, as President Franklin Roosevelt used to say: 
``Too many ifs there'': if a certain party should win a certain 
election in a province, if it should then go on to a referendum, if 
it should then win a referendum, if it should then decide the 
majority is enough to ask for negotiations and if, finally, the 
other party should itself decide the numbers are sufficient to 
give credibility to the vote and to warrant negotiations in return.
<P>
	It is a counsel of folly to suggest defining constitutional 
conditions for an iffy situation of this sort. A Constitution is as 
Mr. Justice Owen Roberts of the United States Supreme Court 
once said: ``A constitution is not a railway excursion ticket good 
for one particular journey at one particular time and one 
particular place''. The ideas you put forward have to have a long 
range currency.
<P>
	One has the feeling that constitution making is being put 
forward as it was in the Mulroney era as a substitute for serious 
substantive thinking on economic matters. We want no more of 
the travelling circuses of Meech and Charlottetown. They were a 
failure and not the answer to the problems of the time.
<P>
	If I may venture the critique of the Reform Party 
constitutional agenda, it is that there is an absence of a coherent 
overall vision. It seems to be a collection of ad hoc responses to 
a particular problem in which the deemed political advantage 
seems to be very high.
<P>
	I noted and agreed with some of the criticisms made by the 
Reform Party on Bill C-18 but I deplore the total absence of 
substantive ideas on electoral reform which go to the core of the 
constituent process and are more important than the 
constitutional processes themselves.
<P>
	I also wonder if the emphasis on the constitutionally acute 
proposals; referendum, initiative and recall do not disguise the 
absence of more fundamental thinking and depth on more 
fundamental issues such as the relationship between executive 
and legislative power and the need for a strong countervailing 
power, whether legislative or judicial, to the imperial executive 
that one is tended to have in Westminster derived constitutional 
systems today.
<P>
	Finally on native Indian self-government I find enormous 
ambiguity that needs resolution and perhaps disguises political 
divisions within a party.
<P>
	Let us return to the issue. What is the approach of the Liberal 
government on the Quebec issue? At this stage we can say there 
are some limiting parameters and these need to be said. The 
federal government has a totality of constitutional power to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4965"> 4965 </A></B>
<P>
control and determine the holding of a referendum by a 
provincial government on a subject such as leaving the federal 
system.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	For political reasons which were no doubt right and proper in 
1980 the decision was made not to exercise those. The 
controlling parameters today would certainly include the ability 
to scrutinize a question and make sure that it is clear and 
unambiguous and not like the deliberately cloudy formula put 
forward in October 1980.
<P>
	Second, there is a necessary control of the timing and I think it 
is clear that this will be the last referendum allowed. We cannot 
have the country on roller skates going from one referendum to 
another year after year; once more, no more after.
<P>
	Third, there are to be no special deals, constitutional deals 
made in preparation for referendum for any one province within 
the country. Canada is not a supermarket offering a special one 
day deal for one occasion at any time.
<P>
	To come back to the approach of the Liberal government, is 
there a Chrétien doctrine? The leader of the Reform Party has 
suggested that there is not. I think the difference and the subtlety 
of the approach are well rooted in common law 
constitutionalism and common law constitution making. The 
Chrétien doctrine is closer today to the pluralistic federalism of 
the Pearson era, sometimes called co-operative federalism, than 
it is to the neo-Keynesian imperatives of the Mulroney 
government and to some extent perhaps the Trudeau government 
at certain periods.
<P>
	The approach is not the Sermon on the Mount, a set of abstract 
a priori rules conceived in an ivory tower in the political vacuum 
away from concrete problems. It is essentially a pragmatic, 
empirical, problem oriented, step by step approach. I think this 
is the only one proper and possible effectively in an era of 
fundamental change such as we have in Canada and in the world 
community as a whole.
<P>
	Among the considerations, to examine that sovereignty is a 
19th century concept is simply out of date in a era when 
supernational legal engagements like the free trade agreement, 
like NAFTA and NATO are entered into and, as we saw in our 
debate on cruise missiles, are regarded as binding even if 
governments may think in particular cases that they were wrong, 
as I think our government felt in relation to the Mulroney 
decision on cruise missiles. We accepted it as part of our 
supernational obligations.
<P>
	There is the passing of sovereignty even in a period of which 
you notice the contradictions, the survival of the contradictions, 
and the revival of ethnic particularism in a pathological sense as 
we have had in Bosnia-Hercegovina and other areas of the 
world.
<P>
	What we really need is an operational philosophy of 
federalism rigorously empirical and problem oriented. Among 
the areas in which I think action has already been taken I will 
commend the emergence of this operational pragmatism in the 
approach to the infrastructure program which is designed to 
produce the economic  recovery. It involves continuing and 
close co-operation with the provinces and with municipalities 
in which abstract a priori structures of government that divide 
power between federal and provincial governments are sensibly 
modified by the parties. It also involves the removal of 
interprovincial trade barriers and that rests on negotiation and 
discussion.
<P>
	In my own constituency my assistants are now arguing before 
the electoral boundaries commissions, presenting a case. It 
involves a commitment to plural ethnic constituencies and not 
the mono-ethnic constituencies of yesteryear which are very 
close to 19th century approaches to multiculturalism or 
multinational societies.
<P>
	In the area of native Indians I commend the House to Bill 
C-33 and Bill C-34 whose debate was rudely stopped a week 
ago just as it was beginning.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	There you do have a species of consensual pragmatism 
between the main parties, the native Indian leaders in the Yukon 
and the government in which a highly pragmatic, step by step 
approach to self-government within Canadian federalism and 
subject to the bill of rights has been worked out. I think this is a 
model of intelligent constitution making for the 21st century. 
We have arrived at it well before the 21st century.
<P>
	The reform of Parliament is something to which the Prime 
Minister is personally committed. I think he realizes, because 
his approach is closer to the gentler pragmatism of Prime 
Minister Pearson, that Parliament has a function, that it is a 
necessary countervailing power to the executive. The changes 
that can be made here are wholly within federal power.
<P>
	At the end of the day you do have a continuing, coherent 
constitutional process yielding precise, empirically based 
principles. They are problem oriented and therefore likely to 
stand the test of challenge of changing events.
<P>
	The problem with the Sermon on the Mount is that it is an 
illusion created for people who want simple panaceas, divorce 
from concrete problem situations.
<P>
	There, as I see it, is the Chrétien doctrine. It is a constitutional 
philosophy. As was said in Molière's <I>Le bougeois gentilhomme</I>, 
you can speak prose all your life, even though you do not 
recognize it. The essence of operational pragmatism is at the 
heart of the received common law constitutionalism we have 
had in Canada and which has been enriched by civil law 
components as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my hon. colleague, who is a specialist on constitutional 
issues, made some remarks which I think should be pointed out. 
As to whether the question in Quebec will be clear, we told you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4966"> 4966 </A></B>
<P>
long ago what it would be: ``Do Quebecers want Quebec to 
become a sovereign country?'' I think that is very clear.
<P>
	I will say that when it comes to clear political positions and 
democracy, Quebec does not have much to learn. I think of the 
law on party financing; in Quebec, only voters can contribute to 
political parties, which is not the case here, where unions and 
big companies can finance parties, like the Liberal Party. So it 
will be done very democratically, as usual.
<P>
	Will there be more than one referendum? Look at history. 
Newfoundland joined Canada after more than one referendum. 
All Canadians were never asked to vote on whether they would 
welcome Newfoundland into the federation or not. They 
recognized Newfoundland's choice and Newfoundlanders made 
their own decision, just as Quebecers' right to do the same 
should be recognized.
<P>
	We are also told that sovereignty is a thing of the past, a 
nineteenth-century concept. Does that mean for my colleague 
and for the Liberal Party that Canada's sovereignty is a thing of 
the past? If having a large unit is important, why not join the 
United States? Either a line of reasoning is valid or it is not. 
Personally, I think that Canadian sovereignty is important and 
that Canada should exist as an independent country, a neighbour 
of the United States; similarly, if it is important for Canada, I do 
not see why it could not be so for Quebec, which also has the 
right to sovereignty, just as Canada has the right to sovereignty.
<P>
	I am coming to the issue of the right to self-determination. It 
was recognized by the NDP in the 1960s, by the Conservative 
Party in 1991 in Toronto and its leader, the Prime Minister, 
wrote in a book around 1985 that his participation in the 1980 
referendum was <I>de facto</I> recognition of Quebec's right to 
self-determination.
<P>
	I end with a question. The other day, my colleague and I heard 
Professor Jackson of Carleton tell a House committee that, the 
way he sees things, Quebec is a nation, even though he is for 
Canadian unity; he thinks that Diefenbaker was wrong to speak 
of ``one nation'' when he should have spoken of ``one country''.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	So, his colleague, who is also a constitutionalist, spoke of the 
existence of the Quebec nation. I want to ask the hon. member if, 
as a member of the Liberal Party, which recognizes the First 
Nations, he recognizes that, like the First Nations, Quebec is a 
nation too.
<P>
	This is a question which his colleague for Outremont did not 
deign answer the other day, for obvious reasons. However, 
knowing that the member is an honest constitutionalist, I want to 
know if he indeed considers that Quebec is a nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question on the referendum question. My comments only 
applied to the question worded in 1980. There was then a 
calculated ambiguity which, in my opinion, would not be 
acceptable today.
<P>
	On the issue of political party financing, I am in favour of a 
comprehensive reform of the system.
<P>
	As regards self-determination, there are many opportunities 
to exercise that right. Such a right can be exercised within a 
federal system, as the Yukon natives chose to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order and I 
ask for the unanimous consent of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I understand that you 
rise on a point of order, but we cannot go on and on after each 
speaker.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to allow the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra to conclude?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Regarding the last question on 
sovereignty-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> The nation. Quebec as a nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> According to the international law, the 
right to self-determination is limited to peoples, not to nations. 
Consequently, as regards peoples, international law does not 
require any answer for a separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>Is Quebec a nation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> A nation is a group of people, there is no 
doubt about that. However the term ``nation'' is not a word-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. 
Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, I would just 
like to reiterate that today we have been listening to 19th century 
nationalism almost continuously all day, and I apologize to 
some of our viewers. It is another round of constitutional 
negotiation which I am sure we could do without.
<P>
	I would also like to mention that we are now dealing with 
things like the information highway. It is not important whether 
we connect states, member states of a country together, but we 
are going to connect households throughout this nation together. 
French speakers in Quebec and French speakers in the maritimes 
will be talking to each other. What is the logic of a nation state?
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to rise in my place today to discuss 
the future of Canada. Like so many others here this is why I 
came to the capital, to try to shape the direction of our great 
country as we enter the 21st century.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4967"> 4967 </A></B>
<P>
	I have travelled in many parts of the world and I have taken 
the time not only to study these countries but also to observe my 
own country from their perspectives. I have recently returned 
from China where a party of parliamentarians went to support 
small and medium sized businesses there seeking new trading 
opportunities. In this rapidly evolving country over $250 
million of new business occurred.
<P>
	I note that the Reform Party which is sponsoring this motion 
elected not to send any representatives. I find this unfortunate 
because many western businesses could have benefited from its 
involvement. At any rate, this is part of the future for Canada, 
establishing new trading relationships and new friends 
throughout the world.
<P>
	I got into a rather interesting discussion when I was there with 
one of its economists in the agricultural department. I have not 
the time to discuss the whole process, but the bottom line was 
that this country, one of the last remaining communist countries 
in the world, in pursuit of new social safety nets with respect to 
demographic shifts in its agrarian population elected not to 
study those of Canada. Why? Because it thought we were too 
socialistic.
<P>
	I believe that Canada must enter into a new age of what I 
would like to call entrepreneurialism. This is not necessarily the 
pursuit of profit, but more the pursuit of measurable objectives 
for our society.
<P>
	We must also redefine government's role in society.  To quote 
the recent best selling book ``Reinventing Government'', I 
believe that it should be the purpose of government to steer and 
not to row. By this I mean that government should not have 
direct involvement in the economy, but rather state its 
objectives which are democratically arrived at and then create 
the economic climate in which these goals can be realized.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I believe that the public at large as well as government in 
specific need to rethink their general attitude. I do not have to 
mention all of the global challenges that we have witnessed in 
the short six months that this House has been in session. GATT, 
NAFTA, the information highway, to name only a few, all 
challenge Canada and Canadians to be better, to evolve a 
different spirit, to meet head on the challenges of the 21st 
century.
<P>
	We must give government back to the people. We must change 
our civil service so it regards the public as its customers rather 
than something simply to be tolerated. Public Service 2000 and 
total quality management are starts but they are taking way too 
long to get out into the real world, that is to say to make a 
difference to the people in the street.
<P>
	We must empower a new generation of civil servants who can 
take responsibility for making new changes, who are not 
governed by regulations and orders but rather who will be 
judged, remunerated and promoted based on their success in 
achieving goals rather than simply years of tenure.
<P>
	We are talking about different facets of government that will 
compete for the most efficient delivery systems, where the 
inefficient systems are uprooted and adapt or disappear.
<P>
	We are talking about a government that values investment 
where investment means education, training and skill 
development, increasing our grey matter if you will, but shuns 
income maintenance systems for other than those who are 
retired or have genuine need.
<P>
	While talking about changes in attitude we must put a stop to 
the petty parochial nature of many of our provincial legislators. 
We must end barriers to interprovincial trade in the new Canada. 
We must realize that there are strengths in both centralization 
and decentralization.
<P>
	The new Canada will allow that national education standards 
be established. At the same time local school boards will be 
freed to compete to see which can meet the objectives most 
effectively. Children and their parents should have the right to 
decide on their school which will add to the competitive nature 
of education.
<P>
	Business will take a constructive role in educating students 
while in school. They will recognize that this is their major 
competitive edge in dealing in the global economy.
<P>
	In the new Canada the medicare system will focus on 
preventive medicine rather than sickness. It will have 
physicians paid to keep people healthy rather than treating 
illness. At the same time it will be a society which recognizes 
the difference between need and want, where symptoms such as 
the common cold are not insurable coverage. Physicians will be 
paid not for the number of patients they see but rather 
remunerated based on the number of patients they do not see, 
that is to say on the wellness of the population.
<P>
	We are talking about a justice system that will focus on the 
causes of crime rather than on incarceration and the support of 
penal institutions, a system that realizes that crime prevention is 
far less costly to administer than long term incarceration.
<P>
	We are talking about a country that will realize that 
unemployment is a success of our system rather than a failure. It 
will reduce the hours of required employment, a shorter work 
week, a method of spreading unemployment equally throughout 
the country.
<P>
	It will empower our native communities to take control of 
their own economic future and restore the pride of their once 
great nations.
<P>
	It will realize that single mothers living in poverty is a 
disgrace of our system. It will create more day care to allow 
these people to re-educate and find employment in the new 
economy, empowering both themselves and their children. Even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4968"> 4968 </A></B>
<P>
day care centres will compete for the most efficient delivery of 
educational skills for our youth.
<P>
	In agriculture we will develop more competitive marketing 
systems. We will adjust to changes in international trade. We 
will become more efficient in areas in which Canada has an 
advantage.
<P>
	Mostly this will deal with the technology of feed additives, 
selective breeding and artificial insemination and the use of 
environmentally friendly farming practices. Most important, 
the new Canada will realize that to empower people is the 
ultimate tool, to allow people to control their own economy and 
destiny. This is the strength of a new entrepreneurial country.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	May I interject to note that this is not the narrow hierarchical 
nationalism espoused by those in the Bloc Quebecois, a 
nationalism that wants to take our fellow Canadians down the 
pathway to the 19th century, where we keep the rural population 
sequestered as a source of cheap labour and food due to their 
inability to reach out and participate in the world.
<P>
	I am not talking about the dominance of one society over 
another. Nothing could be further from the truth. I can remember 
when Toronto was a bastion of English elite. No more. The 
original English stock is a minority in the city and its society is 
better for it. There are signs in Greek, Italian and yes, French. 
These are some of the new pathways which Quebec and the rest 
of Canada must follow together. These are the pathways to a 
healthier standard of living and a content society.
<P>
	I am not talking about dollars and cents. I believe that this new 
spirit of entrepreneurial government will also recognize the new 
emerging family values and place greater importance on well 
adjusted children.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say that the current economic 
restructuring has forced us to rethink who we are and where we 
want to go, a new entrepreneurialism where everyone shares in 
the success and participation of a new society and a new Canada 
in the 21st century. This is our challenge to the way we do 
government and the way we deal with one another. This is the 
future for Canada and all Canadians from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House today to 
talk on this unity debate. The comments that I have heard from 
members across the floor do cause me some concern. They seem 
to feel that if we hide from the problem, if we do not recognize 
that this debate is taking place across the country, if we ignore it, 
it will go away. It will not go away. It is very important that this 
debate take place in this House so that we can be in step with 
Canadians across this land.
<P>
	I would like to focus my speech this afternoon on that in 
which all Canadians hold a great deal of pride. That is the law 
and order issue.
<P>
	Law and order has always been important to all Canadians. 
What other country has a national symbol that is a police force? 
An example of the importance of law and order can be 
demonstrated by the contrast between Canada and the United 
States and how these two countries developed and opened the 
western frontiers over 100 years ago.
<P>
	With a few notable exceptions the Canadian west grew up in a 
very orderly fashion due in large part to the Northwest Mounted 
Police arriving in the west before large scale European 
settlement.
<P>
	The success of the Mounties can best be illustrated by the 
story of the American cavalry escorting the Sioux back to 
Canada after the Battle of the Little Big Horn. A large, heavily 
armed U.S. cavalry escorted thousands of members of the Sioux 
tribes where they were met at the border by two Mounties. When 
the officer in charge of the cavalry force asked the Mounties 
where the rest of their force was, the answer was: ``He's behind 
the hill cooking our breakfast''.
<P>
	This little story is an example of how the two countries 
developed different attitudes toward law and order. With 
Canadians there has been an expectation of law and order, a 
respect for it. We frequently compare ourselves with the United 
States to show that we are not really a violent country. 
Unfortunately compared to other developed countries we seem 
to have become one.
<P>
	All Canadians are not happy about it. We are not satisfied that 
this is where we want to be. Citizens across this country have 
that same expectation of law and order that we had 100 years 
ago. We want respect for law and order to once again be an 
integral part of our society.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	We want the feeling of security in our homes and on our 
streets. We would like to be able to leave our doors unlocked 
without having to worry about being robbed. We would like to be 
able to stroll through parks of our communities in the evenings 
without the threat of being mugged.
<P>
	We would like to be able to offer assistance to strangers in 
need without the fear of being assaulted. We would like to be 
able to let our children play in neighbourhood parks alone 
without the fear of abduction. Students would like to be able to 
go to school without worrying about their fellow classmates 
carrying guns and knives.
<P>
	Canadians would like to be able to do all of these things, but 
we are afraid. For the past 20 years the country not only seems to 
have got more violent but it has. I could use a whole litany of 
statistics but I am only going to use one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4969"> 4969 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1971, 203.9 violent crimes were recorded per 100,000 
population. In 1991, 20 years later, 1,099 violent  crimes were 
recorded for every 100,000 population, an increase of 500 per 
cent. That is a 500 per cent increase in 20 years. Why this 
increase? There does not seem to be any definitive explanation 
for it.
<P>
	Some try to minimize this trend. Some try to suggest that the 
crime statistics show that there has not been an increase in 
crime. I would suggest that this figure shows that there has been 
an increase in crime and it is time that we recognized it.
<P>
	We can talk about some suggested root causes like poverty, 
the lack of education and all sorts of other things. These things 
do not explain why crime crosses all social economic 
boundaries. If we knew what the real root causes of crime were, 
we could go after them but since we do not know we have to deal 
with the symptoms.
<P>
	My party is here with a clear mandate from its constituents to 
do something about the crime problem, not to ignore it, not to 
rationalize it, but to do something to turn it around. As the 
Liberals heard from their chief pollster at their policy 
convention last month, in major urban centres crime is the 
number one issue.
<P>
	It is not the Reform Party that is leading the call for change. It 
is the people of Canada. There are very few issues where the 
people in this country are united but I would suggest to this 
House that the concern about safety in our communities and 
safety in our streets is a concern that is shared from sea to sea to 
sea without exception.
<P>
	In my last householder, I included a question about changing 
the age limit in the Young Offenders Act to 10 to 15-year olds. I 
received almost 3,500 responses. That is an 8 per cent return. 
Over 90 per cent agreed with this change. In addition, many of 
those who disagreed stated that the act should be abolished 
entirely.
<P>
	How can any politician ignore the will of such an 
overwhelming majority of the population? Those who will not 
listen, who refuse to accept the fact that we have a problem with 
crime in our streets do so at their own peril. If they really think 
that Canadians are going to wait a good deal longer for action, 
for a government to start showing some concern, they are dearly 
mistaken.
<P>
	Our job is very simple in this House of Commons. As a 
member of Parliament, I think we can start doing something and 
do it quickly. What we have to do in this Chamber is that in every 
aspect of criminal legislation we need to follow one principle. 
That principle is that the protection of society has a greater 
priority than the rights of the criminal. We have to send a strong 
message to all Canadians that violence against other Canadians 
is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.
<P>
	In my community, a husband murdered his wife. He pleaded 
guilty to manslaughter and got five years. That is five years for 
murdering a Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us remove the dangerous offenders from society until such 
time as society can be assured they are no longer dangerous. Let 
us get the Fishers and the Barlows off our streets so people can 
feel safer. Let us get the non-violent offenders out of our prisons 
and have them repay their debts to society in a more constructive 
manner, for example by restitution, community work service, or 
the like. Let us make sure our criminal justice system is swift, 
fair and consistent. Let us return the control of the streets in our 
communities back to the average citizens.
<P>
	Canadians across this great country are demanding change. 
We have the legislative tools to help accomplish this. It will be a 
great disservice to this country if we fail to fulfil this demand 
and to react and deliver back to Canadians their communities 
and their streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I think the hon. member would like us to believe that only 
Reform Party members are concerned about safety in this 
country, that only they are concerned about crime. That is not 
true. We on this side are just as concerned and sometimes just as 
befuddled by crime as they are.
<P>
	I am concerned about how in her remarks she glosses over the 
causes of crime. In fact she said that we do not know the causes 
of crime, which I do not think is true. If she were to ask herself 
that again she would have to answer that we know most of the 
causes. They relate to family dysfunction, substance abuse, 
poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of education, lack of hope, 
racism. Those are many of the sources of crime.
<P>
	If the member does not think those are the sources of crime, if 
she really thinks we should treat only the symptoms, I would ask 
her about the problems facing the aboriginal community. Why 
do so many aboriginals fill our jails? For example, why in my 
province is well over half of the jail and penitentiary population 
made up of aboriginals?
<P>
	It is self-evident. It is because aboriginals unfortunately 
share more family dysfunction than anyone else. They suffer 
more racism than anyone else. They suffer from poverty more 
than anyone else. They suffer from the lack of hope more than 
anyone else, and so it goes. That is the reason aboriginals fill our 
jails.
<P>
	It is nonsensical for the member to suggest we can ignore the 
sources of crime, that we can ignore the causes of crime and 
treat only the symptoms. We will never get to the solutions if we 
do not focus on the sources of crime. We can build all the jails in 
the world. We can have all the punishments and all the 
deterrents, but as long as the mills keep grinding and turning out 
young criminals, it will be an endless process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4970"> 4970 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, nobody is suggesting to 
ignore some of the causes of crime. However to suggest that all 
poor people are potential criminals, to suggest that all single 
parent families are creating criminals is totally unfair. These 
groups are getting very tired of taking the blame for producing 
the criminals.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my speech, crime crosses all 
socioeconomic boundaries. One man who killed his wife was an 
engineer. Many of the people in our jails have very well 
established professions and have crossed the bounds. Yes, drug 
and alcohol abuse is a cause of crime. We should be treating that 
not by locking people up in a prison but by treating the illness 
from which they suffer. Yes, poverty does put people in a 
vulnerable position but it is not the only cause of crime. To 
pretend that it is and to hide by saying: ``Let us attack the root 
causes of crime and ignore the symptoms'', is foolhardy. We 
need to do both and one cannot be done at the exclusion of the 
other. We can address the symptoms of crime now and we can 
deal with the more long term problem starting now. The results 
of crime prevention will not be seen in the next year or two. It 
will take five or ten years for the results of crime prevention to 
have any kind of impact.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Madam Speaker, 
unfortunately the way the Reform Party would handle the 
Constitution is the same way it would handle crime, rather 
simplistically.
<P>
	A point needs to be made to the Bloc which has been making a 
great day of this. The Meech Lake accord did not receive 
popular support, but it did receive the support of three Canadian 
Prime Ministers from the province of Quebec: Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, Brian Mulroney and certainly the present Prime 
Minister. That is important. The Charlottetown accord unified 
this country. It was unified in turning it down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, today I have the honour and privilege to speak 
in favour of the Reform motion which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House strongly affirm and support the desire of Canadians to remain 
federally united as one people, committed to strengthening our economy, 
balancing the budgets of our governments, sustaining our social services, 
conserving our environment, preserving our cultural heritage and diversity, 
protecting our lives and property, further democratizing our institutions and 
decision making processes, affirming the equality and uniqueness of all our 
citizens and provinces and building peaceful and productive relations with 
other peoples of the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What a wonderful vision of Canada. I am happy to join with 
my leader, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, and my 
colleagues who have shown leadership and vision in beginning 
to define a new federalism that can create a revitalized or a new 
Canada to which 10 or more provinces can look with pride and 
accomplishment.
<P>
	I am disappointed in the government's amendment. It calls for 
a cake with no recipe. It is a continuation of the irresponsible 
role played by this Liberal government where it insists on 
Canadian unity but has no blueprint to  achieve the goods. It has 
no way of accomplishing what it has set out to do and it is 
compromising federalism in the process.
<P>
	In January the leader of my party described the 35th 
Parliament as one without precedent and it surely is. A few years 
ago not very many prognosticators would have predicted a 
House of Commons where the Official Opposition, the Bloc 
Quebecois, would sit in this House happily accepting the title of 
Official Opposition, would swear allegiance to the Queen and 
would collect a salary from the federal treasury all the while on a 
mission to break up Canada by taking Quebec out of 
Confederation.
<P>
	Even fewer forecasters would have guessed that a federal 
Liberal government would sit idly by and pretend it was not so. 
Who could have guessed the Liberal government would sit on its 
hands and play politics as usual while separatists were chipping 
away at the very foundation of the country?
<P>
	This sad state of affairs explains the need for Reformers to 
bridge the gap and start pouring a new brand of unity concrete to 
provide some cement to which Canadians with a commitment to 
federalism might attach themselves, including those who live in 
Quebec, perhaps especially those who live in Quebec.
<P>
	I will take a few moments to speak to the motion and 
particularly the phrase ``preserving our cultural heritage and 
diversity''. There are many myths and misconceptions 
associated with culture and heritage. One tends to associate 
myths with the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Babylonians, but 
we have fostered a few in Canada too. Some of the myths most 
commonly perpetuated include:
<P>
	Myth No. 1: Canada is composed of two founding nations. 
Some have gone so far as to call the English and the French the 
founding races. While the myth may describe a contract between 
upper and lower Canada it is exposed when you consider the fact 
that aboriginal people have always been a factor in Canada and 
that for all of our 128 years as a nation, people have come from 
every corner of the globe to help build this country.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Myth No. 2: Canada will become more unified if we enact 
language legislation. The Official Languages Act has not made 
Canadians feel more unified. It has been a bone of contention in 
our land. It has put a black mark on bilingualism in Canada, 
rather than permitting it to be a prestigious step of 
accomplishment like knowledge of languages should be.
<P>
	Myth No. 3: Canada will only be able to sustain its 
multicultural heritage if the government bundles up tax dollars 
and earmarks them for song and dance across our land to 
preserve our diverse cultural heritage.
<P>
	Reformers have done an excellent job of debunking the myth 
that Canada can still be described as a nation of two founding 
cultures. Clearly we have moved far beyond this narrow view of 
our country. A few weeks ago  Reformers spoke at length about 
the failure of official bilingualism in this House and put forth a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4971"> 4971 </A></B>
<P>
realistic and constructive alternative which would prove much 
less divisive and less costly than the status quo.
<P>
	I will deal briefly with the third myth, that having an official 
multiculturalism secretariat that gives grants and makes lofty 
pronouncements is not the best means of preserving our 
multicultural heritage in a harmonious manner. Government 
should get out of the multicultural business. Let me explain 
what I mean by the multicultural business.
<P>
	The Secretary of State for Multiculturalism spent over $3.8 
billion in 1992-93. Much of this budget we would transfer to 
other more suitable departments and ministries. The $2.9 billion 
transferred to the provinces for post-secondary education is a 
good example of a program that would be protected from cuts 
under the Reform plan. The $500 million in student loan 
guarantees is another good example, as is all federal funding to 
fight racism and human rights protection.
<P>
	However, the funding to universities, private individuals and 
associations promoting cultural development, totalling over $26 
million, could be eliminated. Furthermore, $47 million in 
taxpayers' hard earned money could be saved by cutting funding 
to language-based special interest groups in all parts of the 
country.
<P>
	If, as we have argued, the federal government is not the 
appropriate body for funding and running multiculturalism, then 
who should be responsible for preserving, conserving, 
encouraging and paying for our cultural heritage? That is a fair 
question. The Reform Party supports the principle that 
individuals and groups are free to preserve their cultural 
heritage using their own resources and we shall uphold their 
right to do so.
<P>
	We would focus federal government activities on enhancing 
the citizenship of all Canadians, regardless of race, language or 
culture. We oppose the current concept of hyphenated 
Canadianism as pursued by this and previous governments.
<P>
	If you reject the idea that culture can be designed or 
engineered by the state, then it only stands to reason that the 
development, preservation and promotion of our multicultural 
heritage should be left to individuals, private associations, or in 
some cases lower levels of government.
<P>
	The focus of the federal government should be the prevention 
of discrimination on the basis of race, language or culture. How 
would this approach affect Quebec? I think this is the focus of 
what we are discussing in this House today. Reformers believe 
this approach to linguistic and cultural issues may hold the key 
to Quebecers' aspirations to feeling culturally and linguistically 
secure. It would allow Canadians in Quebec to promote and 
preserve their language and culture through their provincial 
government. Therefore, the federal government should transfer 
its efforts at  protecting and promoting language and culture to 
individuals and lower levels of government.
<P>
	In the case of Quebec, the provincial government would likely 
accept the challenge. Other provinces may not choose to do so, 
but we believe the prerogative should lie with the provinces as to 
whether they want to promote language and culture within their 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The federal government would maintain and even revitalize 
its role in preventing discrimination of minorities wherever in 
Canada they may be. We believe the federal government should 
provide the glue that helps hold us all together, no matter where 
we are from, no matter what our cultural heritage, no matter 
whether we are first generation Canadians or 10th generation 
Canadians.
<P>
	By allowing people the freedom to pursue their linguistic and 
cultural interests independent of federal government 
interference we would create a more unified country. It is far 
more productive to stress those things which all Canadian 
citizens share in common rather than to emphasize differences 
that threaten to tear us apart. If the government would work to 
bring Canadians together we would all be a lot happier.
<P>
	Therefore I strongly support our motion. I believe it is a 
blueprint to prepare Canada for another 128 successful years as 
a Confederation of 10 equal provinces, perhaps more if the 
northern territories are brought into Confederation. It is a 
country in which we can all feel secure, whether our heritage is 
Asian or European, whether it be French ancestry, English 
ancestry or whether it be First Nations, the aboriginal people of 
Canada. That is the kind of Canada in which I want to live in the 
future and that is the kind of country I believe most Canadians 
would be quite excited about, working for and preserving.

	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North)</B> moved that Bill C-233, 
an act to provide for the limitation of interest rates, of the 
application of interest and of fees in relation to credit card 
accounts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy to sponsor this bill entitled 
an act to provide for the limitation of interest rates, of the 
application of interest and of fees in relation to credit card 
accounts.
<P>
	Since their introduction in 1968 credit cards have been a 
major source of convenience for thousands of Canadians. Last 
year there were over 55 million credit cards in circulation which 
accounted for over 10 per cent of all consumer spending in 
Canada. They have become more than just another means of 
payment. Renting an automobile or reserving a hotel room for 
example can be impossible without a credit card.
<P>
	Hardly a day goes by when I do not use my cards as 
identification or for a purchase. However, sometimes 
convenience has its costs and in the case of banks and retail 
cards it can be very costly indeed.
<P>
	I decided to address the more contentious issues surrounding 
credit cards through legislation because I believe there is a great 
need to regulate what I and many people consider to be unfair 
practices for Canadian consumers.
<P>
	I am fully aware that important players in the financial 
markets cringe at the mere thought of any legislation affecting 
their sector. They will be quick on their feet claiming the market 
should be left alone and in the end everything will be fine.
<P>
	I will nonetheless try to demonstrate to the House that there is 
ample evidence to warrant regulation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is not the first time Parliament has considered the 
question of credit cards. During the past eight years, three 
parliamentary committees have examined the credit card 
industry in Canada. The Standing Committee on Finance 
published a report in 1987, and the Standing Committee on 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs did so in 1989 and 1992. Each 
study approached the issue from a somewhat different 
perspective.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	The concerns addressed included the size of the competition, 
obstacles encountered by consumers attempting to obtain 
information on rates, and the question of how interest is 
calculated, but the main contention was always the fact that 
interest rates were high and tended to remain so, despite the 
level of other types of rates.
<P>
	The banks repeatedly told the committees that their rates were 
reasonable, since they did not produce a very high yield. That is 
hard to believe, especially when we see banks making record 
profits. Every time committee members asked what their rate of 
profit was, the banks refused to give the information, arguing 
that it would make them vulnerable to the competition. Despite 
this lack of co-operation, committee members found that the 
banks were collecting interest fees from between 70 and 80 per 
cent of their customers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bankers also argued that because the financial institutions 
take a high risk on many card holders they need a higher return 
on the cards than any other kind of loans to cover losses. 
However the evidence before the Standing Committee on 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs showed that there were fewer 
defaults on credit card loans than on corporate loans and on 
other kinds of consumer loans.
<P>
	When the issue of capping rates was raised, the bankers 
threatened they would be forced to deny cards to lower income 
people. This did not sit well with the committee members since 
the banks' own figures suggested that lower income Canadians 
were more likely to pay off their monthly balance than their 
higher income counterparts.
<P>
	The 1987 finance committee report states that 83.3 per cent of 
those they considered low income people would discharge their 
monthly balances, whereas 41 per cent of the card holders with 
incomes of over $60,000 or more routinely did not pay off their 
monthly balances.
<P>
	Ann Finlayson and Sandra Martin, two investigative 
journalists, summed up these tactics very accurately in their 
book entitled <I>Card Tricks</I>. I quote: ``The bankers' insistence that 
they would have to cut off lower income card holders proved 
nothing more than that they would cut off lower income earners, 
a stance that was strikingly similar to their extremely hard line 
on small business loans at the time''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, as a result of this exercise in futility, members 
realized how difficult it was to obtain from the banks the 
information they needed to make intelligent recommendations. 
The banks did try to smooth ruffled feathers with a slight 
reduction in credit card rates. In 1989, the Standing Committee 
on Consumer and Corporate Affairs revealed that when the 
Standing Committee on Finance was revising the first draft of its 
report in 1987, the spread between the Bank of Canada rate and 
the interest on Visa cards was 11.46 percentage points, while 
shortly after the report was tabled, the spread dropped to 7.31 
points.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to explain what Bill C-233 would do if enacted. 
The bill has two purposes: it limits the amount of interest that 
financial institutions and retailers could charge, and it creates a 
standardized method of calculating interest charges and a 
mandatory grace period for partial payments on all types of 
credit cards.
<P>
	We are told that we should not regulate interest rates in our 
free market society. There is a federal law dealing with credit 
card interest rates, section 305.1 of the Criminal Code. 
However, its applicability to loans advanced under credit cards 
is remote, given that the definition of criminal interest rate is an 
effective annual rate of interest that exceeds 60 per cent of the 
credit advanced under an agreement or arrangement.
<P>
	Bill C-233 would regulate credit card interest rates in a 
realistic manner. The ceiling on rates would float with the 
average of the weekly Bank of Canada discount rate from the 
previous month. The spread between the card rate ceiling and 
the average bank rate would depend on the type of credit card. 
The finance committee's 1987 report concluded that among the 
different types of ceilings that could be used, a floating limit 
seems more sophisticated and more practical.
<P>
	Credit cards issued by financial institutions, which include 
credit unions, caisses populaires and other co-operative credit 
societies could not carry interest at a rate exceeding the Bank of 
Canada discount rate by 6.5 or 8.5 per cent, depending on 
whether the institution charges entry fees, renewal fees or user 
fees.
<P>
	Credit cards issued by petroleum companies could not carry 
interest at a rate exceeding the Bank of Canada discount rate by 
9.5 per cent. Those issued by retail stores could not carry 
interest at a rate exceeding the Bank of Canada discount rate by 
11.5 per cent on any unpaid monthly balance exceeding $400.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Retail cards would use a tiered system instead of a floating 
limit. The rationale for a tiered system in this instance is that 
retailers do not have the same leverage that financial institutions 
enjoy. This system would recognize that operation costs on 
credit cards is higher for retailers than it is for financial 
institutions.
<P>
	I must point out that the retailers have nonetheless abused 
their credit card practices. Their rates have remained virtually 
unchanged at 28.8 per cent throughout the 1990s when consumer 
interest rates were falling to record lows.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry has already written to the president 
of the Retail Council of Canada urging council members to cut 
their rates.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I suggest capping credit card rates, because many people have 
the impression that credit card issuers are making exorbitant 
profits.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the facts appear to confirm this impression. 
The capping concept is not new or radical. In fact, more than 35 
American States have introduced this measure. Once again, this 
is a precedent for the regulation of financial markets.
<P>
	In its 1989 report, the Standing Committee on Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs recommended that the spread between credit 
card rates and the bank rate should never exceed 8 per cent for 
bank cards and 16.5 per cent for retail cards.
<P>
	The 1992 minority report said that when the Bank of Montreal 
introduced a credit card with a floating ceiling of 5.5 per cent 
plus prime, it proved that banks have other ways of making 
money. It also confirmed that floating credit card rates did not 
fly in the face of the laws of finance and were not a financial 
disaster for the banks.
<P>
	The rates I used are based on information provided in the bill 
tabled during the last Parliament, which was reproduced in the 
1989 report of the Standing Committee on Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As already mentioned, the second component of Bill C-233 
would make interest calculation on all types of credit cards 
uniform and would enact a mandatory grace period for partial 
payments.
<P>
	This proposal has been long sought by various advocacy 
groups such as the Consumers Association of Canada. 
Furthermore, recommendations to this effect are contained in 
both the 1987 finance committee report and the 1989 consumer 
and corporate affairs report as well as a minority report struck in 
1992. Clearly there is a great deal of support for the changes Bill 
C-233 espouses.
<P>
	I will use an example to illustrate my case. Let us say that you 
make a single purchase of $1,000 on your credit card and this is 
the only item on your monthly statement. Once you receive your 
statement you usually have a 21-day grace period to pay the full 
amount interest free. However, if you make a partial payment of 
$700 you will be charged interest in two ways. First you will pay 
interest on the $1,000 from the date of purchase to the date of the 
$700 payment. Second, you will be charged interest on the 
remaining $300 from the partial payment date to the next 
statement date. In other words, issuers of financial institution 
credit cards are making their money off the backs of people who, 
for whatever reason, do not pay their full amount in order to 
compensate for the grace period they offer people who do pay 
the full amount.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4976"> 4976 </A></B>
<P>
	This is what I refer to as the reverse Robin Hood theory, 
robbing from the poor and giving to the rich. In effect, the grace 
period is a marketing device to get people to hold and use credit 
cards.
<P>
	Under Bill C-233 the simple distinction between the charge 
and credit functions of a card would be altered. Hence, the part 
of a purchase that is paid on the due date, the so-called partial 
payment, would be treated as a delayed cash payment while the 
remaining balance would be treated as a loan and would be the 
only part to bear interest.
<P>
	The card holder would in effect have a grace period from the 
date of purchase to the date of partial payment. For example, 
you make a $1,000 purchase on your credit card and after 
receiving your statement you pay $700.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Your next statement would show interest charges on the 
remaining $300 from the first statement date to the second 
statement date. You would not be charged interest on the $700 
payment as is currently done by financial institutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are talking about responsibility and fairness here. It is 
clear that people who accumulate debts on their credit card must 
take their responsibilities. However, we should not forget that it 
is not in the interest of credit-card companies that monthly bills 
be paid in full. They only take advantage of people who, for one 
reason or another, can make only partial payments.
<P>
	As we have seen in the case of banks' cards, partial payments 
do not reduce the amount on which interest is calculated and, in 
the case of retailers' cards, interest rates are outrageous.
<P>
	Organizations such as the Association coopérative 
d'économie familiale and the Service d'aide au consommateur 
in Shawinigan deal with hundreds of people who are heavily in 
debt. They find that it is too simple to obtain a card or to have the 
credit limit increased and that credit-card companies do not 
care about the social effects of credit that is too easily 
obtainable.
<P>
	In March, the Service d'aide au consommateur in Shawinigan 
released a study entitled: ``Credit cards-Problems for 
consumers, profits for credit-card companies'' which stated, 
and I quote: ``Credit-card companies, being mostly concerned 
about their profits, have often overlooked the serious effects 
that credit cards could have on the consumer's life''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some people feel that Parliament should not legislate the 
credit card industry if people freely choose to enter into this type 
of contract. The problem is that this is not a free contract where 
you can negotiate the terms of the agreement such as a regular 
bank loan. You either accept the terms offered by the credit card 
issuer or you do not get a card. For people who are well off, 
opting not to  play by the rules imposed by the credit card issuer 
is an option. Unfortunately there are many consumers who 
depend on short term credit to conduct their daily lives in an 
orderly and efficient way.
<P>
	The work force is changing and more and more people are 
becoming self-employed. They do not always have the 
advantage of receiving a pay cheque every two weeks. In this 
situation, a credit card becomes essential.
<P>
	I am always quickly reminded that Canadian banks are not 
public institutions even though they fulfil a public purpose. The 
fact remains that Canadian banks are in a very privileged and an 
enormously powerful situation in Canada. True competition in 
an oligopolistic market is questionable.
<P>
	The minority report in 1992 accurately described our peculiar 
free market arrangement: ``Evidence has amply proven that the 
credit card interest rates and bank service charges in Canada do 
not respond to the market system but to oligopolistic forces and 
that oligopolistic forces are by their very own nature, political 
and therefore only respond to public pressure''.
<P>
	Many people feel that Canadian banks do have a 
responsibility to be more responsive on issues such as credit 
card rates, farm loans and small business loans precisely 
because for the special status they hold in our marketplace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must realize that credit-card companies have absolutely 
not taken into account the many aspects that I have just 
mentioned. Therefore, I think that the time has come to put some 
order in the credit-card industry. Bill C-233 is undoubtedly a 
step in the right direction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have in my possession a legal opinion from the legislative 
counsel of the House of Commons stating that the Government 
of Canada has jurisdiction to enact the regulations sought in this 
bill.
<P>
	In conclusion I would like to thank the many organizations 
that have assisted me in this very complicated matter. A special 
thanks to my colleagues in the House and to my constituents 
who have supported this bill. I hope that our concerns will be 
addressed soon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
industry critic, I am pleased to address this bill. First, I would 
like to congratulate the hon. member for Simcoe North for 
introducing Bill C-233, an act to provide for the limitation of 
interest rates, of the application of interest and of fees in relation 
to credit card accounts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4977"> 4977 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The main purpose of this bill is to limit interest rates on credit 
cards. According to this bill, an oil company or a retail store 
could not charge annual interest rates exceeding by more than 
9.5 and 11.5 per cent respectively the Bank of Canada discount 
rate. A card issued by a financial institution could not bear 
interest rates exceeding by more than 6.5 or 8.5 per cent the 
Bank of Canada discount rate, depending on whether the 
institution charges a fee for getting, renewing or using one.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to commend, as the member for 
Simcoe North briefly did before me, the Service d'aide au 
consommateur in Shawinigan, which has been brilliantly 
managed for many years by Mrs. Madeleine Plamondon of the 
Saint-Maurice riding. That organisation has been defending 
consumers for many years. Last March, it published a document 
on credit cards and it just published another one on life 
insurance. For many years now, it has been quite successful in 
it's advocacy of consumers' interests.
<P>
	To give you an idea of the importance of this phenomenon, 
which is increasingly present in our lives and our economy, let 
me mention some statistical data which depict it very well.
<P>
	The number of credit cards in circulation in Canada is 
estimated at 55 million according to an Industry Canada study 
published in December 1993, so it is recent enough. This means 
2.7 cards for each adult aged 18 or more. Of this number, 25 
million are Visa or MasterCard, compared to only 12 million in 
1981. The number has therefore doubled in a little over 10 years. 
Then, there are 17 million cards issued by department stores and 
3.3 million by gas companies.
<P>
	Between 1992 and 1993, the number of Visa and MasterCard 
credit cards increased to 25 million from 24.4 million. This is 
600,000 cards more in circulation in a single year.
<P>
	Visa and MasterCard generated more than 695 million 
transactions in 1993. The volume of sales reached $47.9 billion 
compared to $43.1 billion in 1992.
<P>
	Finally, at the end of October 1993, the total outstanding 
balance on Visa and MasterCard accounts was $13.2 billion, a 
very large and very distressing amount. This is an increase 
compared to 1992, with $11.4 billion dollars. This outstanding 
balance is three times higher than in 1981.
<P>
	To have a better idea of the problem, you have to know that, 
according to the same document, in 1993, interest rates paid by 
consumers using a MasterCard or Visa credit card were around 
15 per cent. Those who had a credit card from a petroleum 
company, such as Petro Canada, Imperial Oil and Irving Oil, 
paid 24 per cent. Big department stores always want consumers, 
and we can understand why when we know they charged 28 per 
cent, again according to the Industry Canada document. I want 
to name each one, it is worth it: Canadian Tire,  Eaton, Home 
Card, The Bay, Sears, Simpsons and Zellers. These stores 
charged 28.8 per cent interest on outstanding balances. Now we 
can understand the whole problem.
<P>
	As for our evolution as a nation-again I want to thank the 
member for Simcoe North for giving us this opportunity-we 
should also note how consumer credit evolved over the last 
thirty years or so. In 1960, the consumer credit was at $3.5 
billion. In 1981, it was at $46.6 billion and in 1992, it was up to 
$99.5 billion.
<P>
	It is interesting to compare these figures to personal 
bankruptcy statistics. You do not have to be a genius to see the 
relationship between consumer credit, or indebtedness, and a 
potential personal bankruptcy. The number of personal 
bankruptcies in Canada went from 2,700 in 1970 to 23,000 in 
1981 to 61,882 in 1992.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Between 1986 to 1992, the ratio of debt to disposable personal 
income rose from 48.4 per cent to 66.2 per cent. What we must 
remember is that credit cards went from being a method of 
payment to facilitate transactions to a credit mechanism. That is 
how serious the situation has become.
<P>
	Credit equals debt. Credit cards enabled consumers to make 
major purchases easily and quickly-these are the key 
words-to travel, buy presents for themselves and others, cover 
unexpected expenditures and spread out payments over the rest 
of the year by paying a lot of money in interest.
<P>
	This overconsumption-because we live in a society of mass 
consumption-often became synonymous with debt. This 
excessive debt results in large part-when we look at the 
consumers' assistance service like the people in Shawinigan 
did-from the large number of credit cards on the market and the 
vast amount of credit extended to consumers. Each credit card 
has a credit limit but for multiple card holders, the credit limits 
add up. That is, as the studies show, where consumers get all 
tangled up and lose control of their personal finances.
<P>
	The situation is quite serious-as is pointed out-as only 50 
per cent of credit card holders pay the full amount by the due 
date. Analyses show that of the 50 per cent who, statistics tell us, 
pay by the due date, 20 per cent settle their bills by borrowing on 
their personal line of credit. That is when debts start piling up as 
consumers use different credit cards and borrow from their 
personal line of credit to pay off their credit card debts. They get 
deeper and deeper into debt and end up having to declare 
bankruptcy, which becomes a kind of vicious circle.
<P>
	According to the analyses, this phenomenon is due to three 
major causes. First, consumers' lack of information and 
education concerning methods of payment. People do not have 
enough information. Lenders make credit too easy and too 
accessible without exercising sufficient control or caution, 
which leads to excessive debt. There are also the factors on 
which people have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4978"> 4978 </A></B>
<P>
no control,  serious events in life such as job losses, separations, 
divorces, accidents and health problems.
<P>
	Certain stakeholders have a responsibility to correct the 
situation starting, of course, with the consumers themselves 
who are responsible for their own actions. Consumers' 
associations must pursue their commendable education efforts. 
It is, of course, very important that the institutions that issue 
credit cards be better monitored. Finally, governments must 
continue to encourage education and information efforts but 
they must also regulate, and one way to regulate is to limit 
interest rates, as proposed in the bill before us today, and that is 
why we support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I did not realize that the 
opposition party was not going to speak on this bill.
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the member for Simcoe North for his 
efforts in trying to ensure fair prices for his consumers. This is a 
very important issue because it is not only central to the care and 
concern that we must have for consumers, it is right in line with 
our government's policy to make sure that we look at ways 
access to capital for small and medium size business is also dealt 
with. This is very much in that same sort of philosophical 
direction.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	We are trying very hard to make sure that consumers begin 
getting a fair shake from the financial institutions in this 
country. I believe that the member for Simcoe North has 
identified an issue of concern to each and every Canadian.
<P>
	A great deal of parliamentary attention has been paid to this 
issue over the last seven years. Three parliamentary committee 
inquiries were held on this subject between 1987 and 1992. In 
the course of those inquiries a good deal of the evidence brought 
to light did not support the concept of regulating interest rates at 
that time.
<P>
	First, there was evidence suggesting that if rates had been 
capped between 1973 and 1991 the real savings for the average 
card holder would have been small. For example, a consumer 
carrying a balance of $1,000 would have saved only about 50 
cents per month. Also, it appeared likely that the caps would 
cause lenders to restrict access to credit for groups of people 
deemed to be higher credit risks. This could include people with 
low incomes and those with below average levels of education 
together with young adults and recent immigrants. Thus it is 
possible that the very people the bills were designed to help 
could be adversely affected by this bill.
<P>
	Moreover, it was suggested that if interest rate ceilings were 
legislated they would likely in practice become floor prices. To 
maintain their revenue levels lenders could simply vary other 
cost factors such as annual fees and grace periods.
<P>
	While sections of this bill dealing with service charge limits 
and interest calculations would address this last consideration I 
am concerned that the comprehensive controls proposed by the 
hon. member could act to diminish competition at a time when 
credit card markets offer more consumer choice than they have 
ever had in the past.
<P>
	I would once again like to congratulate the member for this 
initiative. I would like to ask for unanimous consent to move the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that''

	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I will pass, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with great 
delight that I stand to speak to this motion. I am one who has 
long felt that the banks are very important to our society, not 
only for financing business but also for financing short term 
interim money people need in order to keep our economy 
rolling.
<P>
	As has already been mentioned, many people pay their credit 
card balances off monthly and in most instances incur no costs at 
all. Then there are some who do not pay and that is where the 
problem comes in.
<P>
	We must first ask ourselves what the object is of having this 
type of legislation. Probably a very loose term would be that we 
want fairness. We want those people who use this bank service 
not to be unjustly charged, not to be charged exorbitant rates. At 
the same time the banks should have sufficient reason to stay in 
that business thereby providing the economy with the necessary 
little oiling to keep it going.
<P>
	Once the purpose is decided the next question is how to 
achieve it and this is where we would come to a parting of the 
ways. A lot of members on the other side are given to that first 
hypothesis that unless the government taxes it, subsidizes it, 
controls it, funds it, regulates it, unless all that is done, it will 
not happen. I humbly submit that is not true.
<P>
	The opening of this country was done quite magically before 
there was any substantial government involvement with respect 
to the operation of individual businesses and the financing of 
homeowners.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	I reject the idea that we need to regulate this. I really believe 
that the marketplace can determine a good balance. If we allow 
the free enterprise system and fair competition to take place, 
then the rates will be kept down. If there is a lot of money to be 
made there will be new organizations entering the field. They 
will compete and bring their service in at a little better rate. 
Consequently the other ones, those that are in there higher, 
would have to come down. However it would reach a lower level 
where it could not go any further because they would no longer 
be making any money.
<P>
	The best solution would be for us to not have legislation that 
would cap the rates, cap the fees, but rather that we would 
observe. We should have laws that simply monitor the fair 
disclosure of what the charges are.
<P>
	This is one of the greatest areas of error in this whole scene. 
There are irregular ways of reporting interest rates. There is not 
a good comparison. We must recognize, and I have this on good 
authority since I have been in the mathematics field for years, 
that approximately 85 per cent of our population does not feel 
comfortable with mathematical calculations. It is surprising 
how many people have trouble with simple things like 
conversion to metric. When we talk about interest rates and their 
implications most of them are lost.
<P>
	If financial institutions will not voluntarily adopt a method of 
uniform reporting of rates and charges, then there would be a 
role for legislation.
<P>
	I would like to briefly indicate three areas where we need to 
have truth in advertising. First we need some sort of uniformity 
in declaring the cost of fees. Fees for different cards range all the 
way from zero dollars per year to the highest one I saw at $30 per 
year. Depending on the balance that is carried this can either be a 
negligible portion of the interest or it can be a fairly high  
portion and it would be incumbent on the financial institutions 
to indicate the actual costs very clearly up front.
<P>
	Second is the use of nominal versus effective interest rates. 
This is an area a lot of consumers do not understand. We ought to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4980"> 4980 </A></B>
<P>
be requiring financial institutions to declare their interest rates 
as effective annual rates. The use of nominal rates is widely used 
and is very misleading.
<P>
	It does not make too great a difference at lower interest rates. I 
did not find any banks that charged these rates but there are some 
retailers' cards that charge, they say, 2.4 per cent per month. 
Then in brackets they say 28.8 per cent per annum. Of course 
that is simply not true. The interest calculations are always done 
monthly. Hence this is compounded monthly and the effective 
rate of 28.8 per cent per annum compounded monthly in fact 
turns out to be 32.9 per cent per annum.
<P>
	If they were required to actually express the rate as the 
effective rate, then they could not play these games with the 
consumers where there is a lack of understanding when it comes 
to effective versus nominal rates.
<P>
	The third area that I would like to address is a bit of a 
bombshell because I have never heard anybody talk about it. 
Several financial institutions that I am aware of which I have 
checked personally actually land up computing their interest on 
a time error as well as a rate error. Most of us know that interest 
equals principal times rate times time as a simple formula. I 
have talked about the rate and the way they fudge that and now 
they fudge on the time.
<P>
	They do something that is very intriguing. Whenever there is 
a transaction, whether it is the computation of the interest to 
date based on the statement date or whether there was a payment 
made, they compute the interest up to and including that day.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	If I borrowed from my credit card a thousand dollars in the 
morning and paid it in the afternoon I think there would be a case 
that said I should pay for one day's interest.
<P>
	However, if I borrow a thousand dollars at noon today and 
repay it tomorrow at noon I do not believe they are justified in 
charging me two days of interest and yet they do if you check 
this out. I think if this goes to the committee I would really like 
to see the committee address that question because that is a very 
costly one to Canadian consumers and as far as I know it is not 
widely known.
<P>
	I did an actual experiment on this and found that if I made a 
payment and my interest was calculated from the previous 
statement to the payment date including that date and then at the 
next statement it was made again including that date, in essence 
my financial agency got from me 24 extra days of interest in the 
year. I did not carry on the experiment that long. I did it long 
enough to ascertain that in fact that is what they were doing.
<P>
	Using 18 per cent per annum and with the $11 billion I used as 
the amount that these institutions have outstanding, this yields 
to them an additional $141 million per year which I think is a 
substantial amount of money to be taking from the consumers.
<P>
	I have other things to say but my time has expired and so I 
really congratulate the member on this bill. I look forward to 
seeing it go into committee for real study, including these issues 
I have raised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my hon. colleague for Simcoe North for bringing 
forward this bill which has now become a motion and giving me 
the opportunity to second it. It has been needed for much too 
long.
<P>
	In response to the previous speaker it is quite obvious to me 
that allowing the market out there to set interest rates just has 
not worked. The financial institutions have been shown for years 
to have been gouging the public in terms of interest rates on 
credit cards.
<P>
	I believe it is the responsibility of the government to ensure 
that the Canadian consumer is protected against unfair and at 
times out of control profiteering by large financial institutions. I 
know from business experience how heavy those interest costs 
can be and how great a burden they can be and how quickly they 
can get out of control and cause extreme financial difficulty.
<P>
	Of course there will be criticism from the affected financial 
institutions but the government should not be interfering with 
setting interest rates for the banks. That is to be expected. In 
fact, that makes for healthy debate.
<P>
	The facts and terms of this debate are on this side of the 
argument that interest rates should be restricted.
<P>
	We as members of Parliament do have a right and a 
responsibility to ensure that the people of Canada are protected 
from unfair banking practices, and excessive credit card interest 
rates are in fact unfair.
<P>
	This bill, or this motion now, should not be seen as an attack 
on the banks. I think it is an attempt to have fair play on the part 
of the relationship between the banks and the consumer. We 
know it is the government's responsibility to make sure there is 
stability in the financial market for the banking and lending 
institutions to flourish.
<P>
	We do this under the Canadian bank act and through the use of 
the Bank of Canada. The same financial institutions charging 
Canadians an exorbitant amount of interest as well as 
calculating interest charges in very creative ways have the 
ability to borrow money from the federal government's Bank of 
Canada's discount rate at very low rates for the banks when they 
are borrowing.
<P>
	Yet these same institutions do not pass on that advantage to 
the Canadian consumer. They instead use the difference between 
their borrowing rate and the rate they charged credit card users 
for huge profits.
<P>
	Those who carry this burden of excessive bank profits in the 
end are the Canadian consumers. They pay the  bills. It is they 
that we as a government hope through consumer spending will 
spur economic growth. That, my colleagues, is what the hon. 
member for Simcoe North is putting forward today. It is a bill to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4981"> 4981 </A></B>
<P>
help economic growth by creating greater spending at the 
consumer level through fair credit card interest rate practices.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	What this proposed legislation does is create fair and 
reasonable regulations for those lending and credit institutions 
to follow while at the same time making reasonable profits from 
those services.
<P>
	I should also point out the positive effects this legislation will 
have on our economy. It will create a more positive atmosphere 
for the general public who use credit for purchasing 
merchandise and services to increase spending since they wil 
not be allocating a large part of their cash flow to the bank's 
interest charges.
<P>
	No hon. member should argue against more capital being 
injected into our retail sector. It has been mentioned that the 
credit card institutions have shown stability in that they have not 
raised their rates with the fluctuation of the Bank of Canada rate 
over the past few months.
<P>
	No wonder. This country has been enjoying its lowest interest 
rates in 30 years and the financial institutions have not reacted 
to the massive drop at any point by lowering the interest rates 
charged to these clients in recent days. That is the reality in 
times of nationally high interest rates. Banks keep credit rates 
higher and in times of low interest rates they keep the same rates 
in order to reap from users even more cash.
<P>
	This is no small potato. In today's retail market credit cards 
account for some $50 billion in purchases in Canada. There is 
little wonder why banks and other financial institutions are so 
reluctant to control and lower their interest rates for the 
Canadian consumer.
<P>
	When the average interest rate is anywhere between 11.5 per 
cent and 19 per cent, there is a lot of profit to be gained from 
interest rates by the banks.
<P>
	I know some will argue: ``What's wrong with profits''. 
However, we must ask ourselves what is reasonable in terms of 
profit. If the credit card suppliers, the banks, are not carrying on 
their responsibilities in a reasonable way then Parliament has a 
responsibility to act in the people's interest. That is what I 
believe we are trying to do with this bill today.
<P>
	I have watched previous governments and previous 
administrations show concern over credit card interest rates, 
indeed at times even on lending rates themselves in the past, but 
when the pressure came to bear and push came to shove those 
previous administrations failed to act.
<P>
	This bill gives us as a government the opportunity to act. 
Action speaks louder than words. We were elected as a 
government of action. Let us show we are true to form  and act 
on the intent of this bill when it gets to the industry committee.
<P>
	That is why I am asking all my fellow members of Parliament 
to consider the intent of the member's bill, to put in place fair 
regulations to control banks and other financial institutions, to 
prevent massive profiteering at the expense of the average 
Canadian consumer. After all, it is the consumer that is very 
much affected by recessions which stats show is then passed on 
to the retail sector.
<P>
	The banking industry has not felt the same impact in hard 
times. It is time that legislation was passed to protect the 
average Canadian from the excessive interest rate charges by the 
big financial institutions.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, we do everything we can to ensure stability 
and security for the lending institutions under the Canadian 
Bank Act and special measures through the Bank of Canada in 
terms of borrowing rates for those lending institutions.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	We can do no less for Canadian consumers than ensure that 
there is fair play and a reasonable spread in interest rates. I 
encourage the industry committee to ensure that the intent of 
this bill is acted upon and that we as a government show that we 
mean action and we mean business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity this evening to add my comments to 
those made by my colleagues on Bill C-233.
<P>
	Since we already know this bill will be referred to committee, 
I will not dwell on its merits which would otherwise have been 
ample reason for me to warmly recommend this legislation. 
Nevertheless, I would like to add to the remarks of the previous 
speaker by providing some further emphasis, to be absolutely 
sure the committee realizes that this bill enjoys strong support in 
this House.
<P>
	I may recall that since the early eighties, three parliamentary 
committees have examined the credit card industry in Canada. 
In 1989, the Standing Committee on Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs focused on the importance of disclosure, while in 1992, 
the committee considered the possibility of restricting entry 
fees. In 1987, the Standing Committee on Finance looked at the 
size of the competition.
<P>
	Although the themes were different, the three studies all 
focused on the high rates of interest applied to credit cards and 
the fact that these levels were maintained while all other types of 
interest went down.
<P>
	In 1989, the committee recommended that the maximum rate 
for cards issued by financial institutions should be set at 8 
percentage points above the bank rate, while in 1992, the 
committee recommended against setting limits.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4982"> 4982 </A></B>
<P>
	During the last Parliament, three members, including two 
Conservative members, Don Blenkarn and Louise Feltham and 
one NDP member, John Rodriguez, tabled private members' 
bills on credit cards, which shows that the issue is not new to 
Parliament and that there has been a constant expression of 
concerns which today has finally found its way to committee 
through this motion.
<P>
	I would like to add that not long ago, on March 21, I myself 
tabled two bills on this subject. I am referring to Bill C-227 and 
C-228, which deal substantially with the same concerns, in 
more or less the same terms, as Bill C-233.
<P>
	I am therefore delighted to express my support this evening 
for what was said by the hon. member for Simcoe North. It must 
be recognized that the interest rates charged to consumers using 
a credit card do not at all reflect the actual cost of credit to these 
consumers. These consumers are simply being exploited.
<P>
	To some extent, Bill C-233 differs from the legislation which 
I tabled in this House, in first reading. For the benefit of the 
committee which will review this issue, I would like to point out 
a number of differences and explain why I am inclined to 
support the changes which I proposed.
<P>
	The French version of clause 9(1) of Bill C-233 says that 
interest is calculated on a monthly basis, whereas the English 
version makes no mention of that. In Bill C-227, which I tabled, 
clause 5.1(1) specifies that interest shall be calculated monthly.
<P>
	In Bill C-233, cash advances are excluded from clause 9, 
whereas Bill C-227 does not exclude such advances.
<P>
	Clause 10(1) in Bill C-233 excludes-although I do not know 
if this was intended-those who contravene clause 3. As you 
know, clause 3 refers to financial institutions which charge or 
stipulate entry fees, renewal fees, etc., in relation to the use of a 
credit card. So, those who contravene this provision are not 
included in the clause on fines. Bill C-228, which I tabled, 
imposes for fines to any offender, including those who charge or 
stipulate entry fees or renewal fees.
<P>
	In Bill C-233, clauses 10(1) (<I>a</I>) and (<I>b</I>) provide for maximum 
fines of $75,000 and $50,000 respectively. In Bill C-228, we 
propose the same fines; I guess we consulted with the same 
researchers. However, unlike Bill C-233, our bill also proposes 
minimum fines.
<P>
	The hon. members for Simcoe North and Trois-Rivières both 
referred to the study on credit cards conducted by the Service 
d'aide aux consommateurs, and more specifically by Mrs. 
Madeleine Plamondon, and Messrs. Henri-Paul Labonté and 
Marc Pépin. I should point out for the benefit of this House and 
the committee which will look at this issue, that the study was 
made possible through a grant from the Department of Industry. 
This not only gives it credibility, since it is already credible 
considering who conducted it, but also makes it very appropriate 
since it was financed by public funds.
<P>
	Already on page 2 of the study, the substance of the message is 
delivered. The authors say that their conclusions deal with the 
accountability of credit card issuers and the urgent need for the 
government to review this issue, which is obviously what we are 
doing here this evening. I will conclude by saying that there is 
real support among the public for such a measure. For example, 
the Borrowers Action Society wrote to me about my bills, but I 
want to share the benefit with the hon. member for Simcoe 
North. This organization wrote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``We are very pleased to see the initiative you and the BQ are 
taking in this area and I wish to offer my full support as well as 
the support of the Borrowers Action Society. We have 7,000 
identified supporters from all parts of Canada. If you think we 
can help in any way, please let us know''.
<P>

the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.56 p.m. and 
no member having risen to taken part in the proceedings on the
