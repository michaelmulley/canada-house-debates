	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in accordance with 
international law, recognize Quebec's inalienable right to choose its political 
destiny and consequently its right to self-determination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am sorely tempted to dedicate my speech 
to the member for Kingston and the Islands. You will understand 
how proud I am to make this speech, because constitutional 
dialogue requires a discussion, not of a distinct society but rather of 
what is as plain as the nose on our face, what is an accepted fact and 
a sociological reality: Quebec is a nation.
<P>
	As you know, when international law recognizes the right to 
self-determination, the holders of that right are individuals who 
together are characterized as a people and form a nation.
<P>
	First and foremost, let me state that on this side we are totally 
convinced that Quebec is indeed a nation, which is to say it has its 
own vernacular, controls its territory, has its own legal system, and 
possesses a proud history which is the focus for its collective 
feeling of belonging. Obviously, there is a fifth element in 
Quebec's right to self-determination, a collective desire for it.
<P>
	I feel that it would be important, to say the least, and one of the 
most positive indications for our future, if this House were to 
acknowledge this morning that Quebec is a nation and therefore 
entitled to self-determination. An examination of international law 
shows that the right to self-determination means specifically the 
right to freely choose a collective destiny. Most often, but not 
always, this takes the form of a referendum process.
<P>
	I trust that all of the hon. members speaking in this debate will 
acknowledge that Quebec is blessed with highly democratic and up 
to date legislation on public  consultation. No parliamentarian 
could object to the fact that Quebec held a referendum last October. 
Nothing could prevent Quebec from holding a referendum in 12 
months, 26 months, 3 years or even six weeks if it so desires, to 
determine freely its collective future.
<P>
	There is a paradox here, because to foreign observers, even those 
well up on the Canadian political scene, constitutional reform has 
been central to the political debate in this country for the past 30 
years. When we started talking about constitutional reform 30 
years ago, there were two tendencies. One said patriate the 
Constitution first and include a Canadian charter of human rights. 
Mr. Trudeau chose to take the same position during the eighties, 
but the fact remains this was already being discussed in the early 
sixties.
<P>
	There was a second tendency, mainly in Quebec, to say that the 
important thing was not necessarily patriating the Constitution 
which at the time, I may recall, had no official French version 
while half of its sections were already obsolete, so Quebec's 
political leaders said, and I am sure the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands will remember this, that the important thing was not 
necessarily-that was how Quebec's leaders felt at the time, in any 
case-to patriate the Constitution but to revise thoroughly the 
balance of Canadian federalism, which meant reviewing sections 
91 and 92.
<P>
	This would be the position held by all Quebec's leaders, 
whatever their political stripe, from Jean Lesage onward. Among 
those who succeeded Lesage, there would be this insistence that for 
Quebecers, the crucial point was not the Constitution as that last 
trace of colonialism but the fact that Quebec should have a certain 
number of powers which were sadly lacking. It was on this basis 
that constitutional reform was to begin.
<P>
	Of course the process, which would go on for 30 years, gave rise 
to a number of political doctrines. Some people became experts on 
the subject, including Richard Arès, who spent much of his life 
examining the national question. Of course there were many others, 
and we can say that during the past 30 years, constitutional reform 
has given rise to three major political anchors for Quebec.
<P>
	In the 1960s, the idea that Quebec should have a special status 
was picked up by Gérard Fillion, who, at the time, was editor in 
chief of <I>Le Devoir</I>. This marked the first attempt to amend the 
Constitution and to change the colour of the constitutional debate. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17468"> 17468 </A></B>
<P>
With <I>Le  Devoir</I>, Gérard Fillion and a number of other intellectuals, 
it was felt that all of Canada's institutions required reworking. 
There was even talk of the Senate. There was increasing discussion 
obviously of an official languages act as well. There was a feeling 
of special status. In other words, the fact that Quebec, in addition to 
being a province, was a nation and had a special responsibility 
towards all French speakers in this part of North America had to be 
recognized.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	With this idea of special status, it became clear that Quebec had 
to be seen to be a French society in a binational context expressed 
in all of Canada's major institutions.
<P>
	This idea was set aside to some extent and gave rise, a bit later, 
about five years later, to the idea of associated states. Those who 
remember the political and constitutional debate in Quebec will 
remember this idea. The idea of associated states or two nations, on 
an equal basis, involved the idea of full equality, an idea that 
reached a much fuller and much more concrete conclusion with the 
idea, proposed by the Parti Quebecois and its president and founder 
René Lévesque, of sovereignty association.
<P>
	The common denominator, however, in these three ideologies, 
these three constitutional doctrines, is that Quebec is a nation. Each 
time a Quebec premier went along to the constitutional table, it was 
in this context. There is a reason for our always making this claim 
as one of Quebec's constitutional demands, including in Victoria.
<P>
	I found that a little funny. As some veteran members of this 
House will recall, the Victoria formula was not only about regional 
vetoes but also about giving Quebec more power over language and 
social policies. According to then Premier Robert Bourassa, 
however, that did not go far enough.
<P>
	Will the House of Commons, which is supposed to be a fairly 
accurate reflection of Canada, have the courage to recognize that 
there are two nations in Canada and that one of them will therefore 
probably move toward full and true sovereignty? This, of course, 
will be achieved through a referendum to be held in coming 
months.
<P>
	Yet, it is difficult to understand how, 30 years after initiating the 
debate on constitutional renewal, we are now considering Bill 
C-110, which all but ignores the major constitutional demands 
traditionally made by Quebec. Even without going as far as 
recognizing Quebec's right to sovereignty in a bill, how can a 
Prime Minister such as the one now in office, who has been a key 
witness to the events of the past 30 years in Quebec, believe that he 
will satisfy a single Quebecer with a bill offering nothing but a 
hypothetical veto that is not even enshrined in the Constitution.
<P>
	What prevented the Prime Minister and his government from 
considering Quebec's major constitutional demands and ensuring 
that federal spending powers are defined in Bill C-110, for 
example? For the past 30 years, this has been part of a set of 
demands that have been renewed by every successive 
administration and government.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister had been serious, he would have included a 
minimum of demands in Bill C-110, namely to limit federal 
spending powers, resolve the issue of residual powers, give Quebec 
more power over language matters, and recognize that Quebec is 
the only authority on language.
<P>
	Even the Pepin-Robarts report, that Pierre Elliott Trudeau liked 
quoting from ad nauseam, recommended, besides a Confederation 
Chamber, the notion of recognizing Quebec as distinct, because, 
through its National Assembly, the Quebec government is the only 
real government ever to have been run by francophones in this part 
of the country. What would have kept the Prime Minister from 
recognizing that Quebec does have, regarding language, certain 
prerogatives?
<P>
	The key issue of manpower is also at the heart of Quebec's 
demands. But this issue does not basically mean that, within the 
context of national standards, the Government of Quebec will be 
allowed to manage a program. That certainly was not what all the 
people who, in the past 30 years, recognized the need for Quebec to 
manage what could be call globally labour market policies had in 
mind.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Now the situation emerges where Quebec is told: ``You will have 
the right to take back manpower programs, provided however that 
your program is compatible with our national standards''. That is 
the crux of the problem.
<P>
	How can they think that national standards could be established 
regarding something as changing and fluctuating as the labour 
market, when we know full well that, even within an economic 
space as small as the Quebec economy, labour market policies vary 
from region to region. The reality in the Gaspesian Peninsula is not 
the same as in Montreal. We find ourselves in a relatively 
disturbing situation, to the extent that those who launched the 
constitutional debate, those who worked to ensure that Quebec is 
treated more fairly and more in accordance with its status as a 
nation within Confederation, now find themselves with a 
constitutional proposal that is disappointing to say the least.
<P>
	We could have gone a lot farther. That is part of the list of 
demands. What keeps us from recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society? The term ``distinct society'' is absolutely meaningless. 
Just ask Library of Parliament researchers to go through the 
literature on international law. They will not find a legal basis to 
the effect that we  are a distinct society. That concept is absolutely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17469"> 17469 </A></B>
<P>
meaningless in terms of what Quebec truly is and in terms of its 
nationhood.
<P>
	The government, and in particular the Minister of Justice, who 
seems somewhat reluctant, will have to take notice of that. We 
understand that the Minister of Justice may not the best informed 
person regarding claims made by Quebec in recent years, but there 
are well informed people in cabinet, including the Minister of 
Labour, who has some experience on the Quebec political arena, 
and who may miss it at times. In any case, there are people in this 
government who know very well that Quebec is a nation, that it has 
a right to self-determination, like any other group forming a people 
and a nation, and that nothing will keep Quebec from holding 
another referendum when it chooses to do so. Quebec will hold a 
referendum when it has democratically decided to ask its citizens 
to make the inevitable choice.
<P>
	In a debate like this, we cannot help but think of someone like 
André Laurendeau. In some respects, André Laurendeau is like a 
spiritual father to the Bloc Quebecois because he too, in his days, 
believed it was important to have a sovereignist front right here in 
this Parliament, to protect Quebec's interests.
<P>
	For several years, André Laurendeau was the member for 
Montréal-Sainte-Marie. He accepted Lester B. Pearson's 
invitation to co-chair the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission. When 
he and his team tabled the preliminary report, the white paper, I 
think he understood something which is at the heart of the present 
political and constitutional wranglings in Canada. You will recall 
that he wrote ``Out of disappointment will come the irreparable''. 
The irreparable, of course, is sovereignty.
<P>
	André Laurendeau had clearly understood that the federal 
regime's inability to acknowledge that there are two nations which 
must be treated as equals, that there are two nations in fact and in 
law which must engage in dialogue and treat each other as perfect 
equals, and that from this inability of the federal regime and those 
who personify it to recognize those two nations the irreparable will 
ensue. The irreparable will be-already is-that feeling. There is 
great satisfaction in seeing that in less than a decade the soverignist 
option has made a ten per cent gain.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	There are not many examples of an idea which was initially 
perceived as being really marginal ending up with democratic 
backing that has become more and more solid; it is now headed 
toward a majority.
<P>
	We are not wrong in this. I would like to state in closing that we 
in Quebec are committed, as is the rest of Canada, to engaging in a 
dialogue on the basis of what we are, through and through, which is 
a nation. Discussions between nations are on a totally equal  
footing. That equality will be made official in a democratic 
referendum, which will be Quebec's next rendez-vous with destiny.
<P>
	It is my belief that today's debate ought to afford an opportunity, 
particularly on the government side, for recognition that Quebec is 
a nation, that it is entitled to self-determination, and that this right 
to self-determination justifies its demands for full and complete 
sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have read the hon. member's motion and listened to him 
very carefully. Despite his sincerity I have to tell him and the 
House in the strongest possible terms that there is no provision in 
international law which would recognize Quebec's effort to 
become a separate, independent state.
<P>
	In the months leading up to the Quebec referendum on October 
30, many statements were made regarding international law and the 
right to self-determination. Unfortunately those statements have 
led to confusion and especially a false impression that international 
law gives Quebec the right to secede from Canada.
<P>
	Quebec has no right to secede from Canada unilaterally either 
under the Canadian Constitution or under international law. There 
is no principle of international law according to which Quebec has 
the right to secede from Canada. This is the conclusion that was 
reached by five international law experts who produced a study on 
the question at the request of the National Assembly's 1991 
commission on Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	As one author put it in that recent study on self-determination, 
the inhabitants of Quebec ``do not have a legal right under 
international law to secede from Canada''.
<P>
	What then is meant by the right of self-determination? A 
statement of the right is found in various international documents. 
For example, the charter of the United Nations states that one of the 
purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations 
among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and 
the self-determination of peoples.
<P>
	The 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights state that all peoples have the right of 
self-determination. Affirmation of a people's right of 
self-determination is also found in the United Nations 1970 
Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly 
Relations.
<P>
	We must note immediately that these documents speak of 
people's right to self-determination, not the right of a province, not 
the right of a county, not the right of a city. In Quebec there are 
several peoples: the descendants of  New France, the aboriginal 
nations, the Inuit, the descendants of the British settlers and many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17470"> 17470 </A></B>
<P>
immigrants who simply call themselves Canadians. We have to be 
very clear on that point.
<P>
	Within the Canadian federation there is one province of Quebec 
but there are many peoples in that province, a point to which I will 
return in a moment. The first question to be answered is what does 
the right of self-determination mean? This is a difficult question 
which may be best answered by first looking to what is not 
included within a right of self-determination in international law.
<P>
	Most important, a people's right of self-determination is not the 
same thing as a people's right to secede from an existing state. In 
most situations the right of self-determination must be exercised 
without causing any detriment to the territorial integrity or political 
unity of existing states.
<P>
	The United Nations 1970 declaration on friendly relations states 
that the exercise of the right of self-determination must not 
dismember or impair, totally or partially, the territorial integrity or 
political unity of sovereign and independent states. This means that 
a right of self-determination must, except in unusual circumstances 
where a people is subject to a non-representative government, be 
exercised within the context of existing states. A people's right of 
self-determination then means the ability to participate fully and 
freely in the democratic process of governing the existing state. 
Certainly the population of Quebec participates fully and freely in 
the democratic process of governing Canada. This was the 
conclusion of the five international law experts who prepared a 
study for the national assembly's 1991 commission.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Canada is a federal state in which the province of Quebec has its 
own national assembly that exercises exclusive powers under the 
Canadian Constitution over such important subjects as property 
and civil rights, natural resources, education, health and social 
services and the administration of justice, among other things.
<P>
	At the federal level, representatives from the province of Quebec 
hold roughly one-quarter of the seats in the House of Commons. 
Many of Canada's prime ministers, including the current Prime 
Minister, have come from Quebec. Quebec is and has long been 
well represented in the federal cabinet. The Leader of the 
Opposition is also from Quebec. Quebecers, therefore, play a large 
role in governing the nation both through their own national 
assembly and through their representation in the federal Parliament 
and government.
<P>
	Quebec has its own legal system, based on French civil law. 
Quebec is always represented by three of the nine appointments to 
the Supreme Court of Canada. The current chief justice is also from 
Quebec.
<P>
	Quebecers also benefit from a strong set of cultural and 
linguistic guarantees under the Canadian Constitution, under 
federal legislation, such as the Official Languages Act, and through 
various programs and activities. Cultural initiatives are strongly 
supported by Radio-Canada, the Canada Council, the National Film 
Board, Telefilm Canada and other Canadian institutions. Therefore, 
the population of Quebec enjoys everything that a right to internal 
self-determination implies.
<P>
	Since self-determination is a right of people, there has never 
been a consensus exactly on what the term people means. To some, 
people is synonymous with the population of a state, such as the 
Canadian people, especially where the entire population of the state 
participates fully and freely in the governing of the state. Others 
take a broad view that the term people means any group that meets 
certain basic criteria, such as common language and history, along 
with a sense of collective identity.
<P>
	Given these different views of what the term people means, it is 
not self-evident that the political entity known as the province of 
Quebec, which embraces a diverse range of people and a diverse 
range of cultures and linguistic groups, would qualify for the 
spectrum of people able to assert the right to self-determination.
<P>
	Quebecers have had a direct say on their future within Canada 
through two referenda held in Quebec in the last 15 years. In both 
1980 and 1995 a majority of Quebecers reaffirmed their 
commitment to Canada and rejected attempts to break up the 
country. Even had the result of the referendum been yes to the 
question formulated by the Parti Quebecois government, 
international law would not have recognized the yes vote as a legal 
basis for the creation of a new state.
<P>
	International law demands that a political entity meet several 
specific criteria before it can be considered a state. Along with 
satisfying these criteria, a political entity trying to achieve 
statehood must also receive international recognition. Recognition 
by other states is both an acknowledgement that the new state 
meets the criteria of statehood and an expression of willingness to 
enter into relations with the new state.
<P>
	Therefore, any movement toward the independence of Quebec 
would not only be without legal foundation in international law, it 
would have to meet the legal criteria for statehood and the practical 
necessity of international recognition, which in both cases would 
be extremely difficult.
<P>
	In conclusion, and in response to the motion before the House, 
there is no right in international law for Quebec to secede from 
Canada. To imply otherwise, as this motion does, is to depart from 
international law in contravention of Canada's right to continued 
existence.

and thus recognizing the right of this federal Parliament to debate 
and judge this question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In speaking against this, it is the position of the Reform Party 
that Quebec has no inherent right under international law to 
self-determination because it is neither a colony nor an occupied 
country, and that the Quebecois are probably not a people within 
the meaning of international law. For this I cite almost exclusively 
the work of the Bélanger-Campeau commission on the sovereignty 
of Quebec. The strongest argument in support of the view that 
Quebec is neither a colony nor an occupied country is found at 
pages 382 to 383 of its report:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``According to those who support Quebec's accession to 
sovereignty, the right to self-determination constitutes the basis of 
the alleged right of the Quebec people to form a distinct state, but 
pursuing the same reasoning, many of their opponents and the 
spokespersons for most aboriginal peoples take the position that:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If Quebec can opt out of Canada then obviously sections of 
Quebec that preferred to remain part of Canada could opt out of 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
This analysis is based on a postulate we believe to be erroneous, 
according to which the right to self-determination implies the right 
to independence''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The report then suggests on pages 419 to 422 that the principle of 
self-determination implies the right of people to participate in 
shaping their political, economic, social and cultural future, and 
that due to the principles of respecting the territorial integrity of 
states, self-determination could result in independence only in the 
rarest circumstances.
<P>
	The report suggests the principle really only applies to 
non-autonomous or colonized people who have been recognized as 
such by the United Nations. This is clearly not the case in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And this quote again from page 422: ``On the evidence, that is 
not the situation of Quebecers nor that of the various minorities 
within Quebec's territory''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For non-colonial peoples, self-determination has ``at least for 
now stopped being a principle of exclusion and became one of 
inclusion; the right to participate. The right now entitles peoples in 
all states to free, fair and and open participation in the democratic 
process of governance freely chosen by each state''. The report 
goes on at page 425 to endorse this position.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another quote: ``One cannot reasonably maintain that Quebecers 
are colonial people nor that they are deprived of the right to their 
own existence within the Canadian federation or exercise their 
democratic rights. Consequently, the Quebec people have no legal 
basis for invoking the right to self-determination to justify a future 
accession to independence''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The conclusion of the report is clearly stated:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``From the legal point of view, a possible accession to sovereignty 
by Quebec cannot be based on the principle of the equal rights of 
peoples and their right to self-determination, which implies the 
right to independence only in the case of colonial peoples or of 
those whose territory is occupied by a foreign power''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The second point is that the Quebecois are not a people within 
the meaning of international law. Even the Bélanger-Campeau 
commission is not sure whether the Quebecois constitute a people.
<P>
	At page 418 the commission recognizes that the Quebecois can 
either be French speaking or English speaking. At page 425 the 
commission states:
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``Some authors have tried, with some success, to establish the 
existence of a Quebec or, alternatively, French Canadian people''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although the commission is not explicit, undoubtedly its 
members were aware that for the purposes of international law, a 
nation is defined in <I>Black's Law Dictionary</I> as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A people, or aggregation of men, existing the form of an organized jural society, 
usually inhabiting a distinct portion of the earth, speaking the same language, 
using the same customs, possessing historic continuity, and distinguished from </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17472"> 17472 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>other like  groups by their racial origin and characteristics, and generally, but not 
necessarily, living under the same government and sovereignty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Obviously given the ethnic and sociocultural make-up of modern 
Quebec society, only the pûre laine Quebecois could arguably be 
considered a people. While they constitute a majority of the 
Quebec population, they do not constitute a majority in each region 
of Quebec. This produces a curious result, that if the Quebecois 
pûre laine are a people and if they have a right to secede, they could 
not claim the right to territorial integrity. Therefore Quebec 
separatists cannot have this both ways.
<P>
	If the strict definition of the word people is applied, only the 
aboriginal people in the north would likely qualify. This is clearly 
not in the interest of sovereignists and quite probably the reason 
why the Bélanger-Campeau commission did not explore the point 
further.
<P>
	While Quebec does not have the right to self-determination, this 
does not mean that whatever Quebecers decide in a referendum is 
unimportant from a democratic standpoint. We in the Reform Party 
have said it is very important. However, the Government of Quebec 
would also have to admit to the importance of a large number of 
Quebecers opting for federalism. So far it continues to be a 
majority. Even if a minority opted for Canada this would also 
constitute an important democratic fact which the Government of 
Quebec would have to take into account.
<P>
	From the standpoint of the Reform Party and I believe from the 
standpoint of the majority of Parliament, the motion is not based on 
international law or fact. Quebec does not have the right of 
self-determination other than by negotiating its future in Canada 
and with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate the hon. member for Hochelaga for a sparkling 
address which had the added advantage of reminding me that I have 
been there before. My colleague, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, also brought me back to time past.
<P>
	I advise the hon. member opposite to beware of experts and 
especially people who claim the title of expert. I was also invited 
and gave evidence as an expert before l'Assemblée nationale de 
Quebec on these and related issues. I admire and respect the five 
experts who have been cited very often by the Quebec government 
and others for their different interpretations. They are experts but I 
would have thought in other domains than those in which they gave 
their opinions which might suggest that perhaps l'Assemblée 
nationale did not do its homework.
<P>
	I have little difficulty in returning to the point made by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, in 
international law. There is no explicit joining of the right of 
self-determination which is  a comparatively recent principle of 
international law with the fission or break-up of existing states or 
with the outright entry into independence.
<P>
	If we trace the history of this principle, it is related, as so many 
things in contemporary constitutionalism are, to Emperor 
Napoleon and the liberating ideas of the French Revolution which 
sometimes are put forward without necessarily the intentions of the 
founders.
<P>
	The spirit of liberalism, the spirit of nationalism and the spirit of 
independence are somewhat antinomic and conflicting principles 
of the heritage of the 19th century, the 19th century of the French 
Revolution, and carried through into the 20th century in Woodrow 
Wilson's 14 points. I suppose the apogee of the concept of 
self-determination as a historical imperative, not a legal one, 
meaning the break-up of large multinational states, was reached in 
the Treaty of Versailles.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The tragedy is that it was a principle carried historically to its 
logical and perhaps foolish conclusion. Most historians today 
would trace as one of the causal factors of the conflict in World 
War II the creation of a vacuum in central Europe by the creation of 
a plethora of mini states, incapable of forming common economic 
policies and incapable of co-operating militarily to resist the larger 
threats from the east and west, from Nazi Germany and from the 
Soviet Union.
<P>
	This is one of the reasons why in San Francisco in 1945 the 
principle of self-determination represented a learning from the 
lessons of history and less enthusiasm for the categorical 
imperative that some had asserted: that every time one is identify 
as a nation or a people-the terms in the UN have been used 
interchangeably and somewhat confusedly-one did not have to 
break up a state to assert one's right of self-determination.
<P>
	The classic demonstration of this is the principle that the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce referred to, friendly relation 
and co-operation among states. It was a symbolic ending of the 
cold war. It is the last great act of east-west relations. It 
supplements the United Nations charter. It is a code of conduct 
between communist Russia and the west when the cold war is still 
on.
<P>
	It contains this very important historical exception. It was agreed 
by all parties that there was nothing in the principle of 
self-determination put in the declaration of friendly relations 
requiring the break-up of existing multinational states, specifically 
federal states like Canada and the claimed federal state, the Soviet 
Union, which specifically were adverted to in the friendly relations 
conference agenda.
<P>
	One can find it over the whole 10 years of the history of this. It 
was pleasant to be reminded of it. I wrote several books that I 
thought were persuasive on this some years ago and it is nice to 
have them brought back.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17473"> 17473 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me come back to present reality. If members look at the 
situation in Bosnia, at Yugoslavia, I suppose some might even 
argue that what has happened there is worse than what existed 
before, a centralized authority imposing unity on a multinational 
society.
<P>
	If self-determination led to the break away, members can see the 
rule of reason emerging in the current settlements. One saw 
immediately with the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia 11 cantons on 
the Swiss model, and one said it will not work. There is no legal 
imperative requiring it. It historically does not make sense.
<P>
	As one follows, as Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has, the 
trend away from Vance-Owen to Owen-Stoltenberg to what we 
could call the Clinton or the Dayton plan, there is the 11, now down 
to 3. The implicit element in it is that two of the three may rejoin 
their neighbouring states, their so-called mother states.
<P>
	What we are really saying is we live in a period of historical 
transition where the main historical currents are contradictory. The 
trend to supra-nationalism, the imperative of larger and larger 
regional supra-national associations, economic, political, replacing 
the old military one, is accompanied by a fragmentation which 
most historians would regard as a pathological condition today.
<P>
	The future of the world community is not a series of little 
Basutolands, enclaves within larger states; nor is it breaking up 
viable economic political units into a plethora of smaller units. It is 
basically in recognizing that the lesson of today is constitutional 
pluralism. People can work together. A state that can successfully 
combine several different peoples or nations, if one wants to use 
those terms interchangeably, is a stronger state.
<P>
	The unity comes from the diversity in the original sense of the 
term used by the great Austro-Hungarian and late Israeli 
philosopher who coined the term community of communities. It is 
that larger concept.
<P>
	To a certain extent when self-determination is preached there is 
the false statement that international law requires it. It does not. 
International law is neutral. In a certain sense it is running counter 
to the preferred view of how history is unfolding: an 
interdependent world community and larger and larger associations 
transcending national frontiers, rendering nationalism in its 
pathological sense out of date, and making Bosnia-Hercegovina 
and the conflicts there an absurd survival at the end of the 20th 
century of an anarchic past that is better left behind. The nation 
state has been the master institution of western European thinking 
for the last 300 years, but it is out of date.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	This is the biggest lesson. There is no international law 
imperative here. There are lessons of history but there are good 
historical trends, trends that rest upon sound  scientific evaluation 
of the past, and there are the bad lessons. It is for us to choose on 
this basis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for 
presenting this motion, which I have here before me, and all other 
members who gave very well documented presentations on the 
subject.
<P>
	It would be interesting to see the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce patriated to the National Assembly, if he 
tries to run for election once Quebec has opted by way of 
self-determination to obtain its sovereignty.
<P>
	Historically, the Canada of today, of 1995, which is also the 
Canada of 1867, was created with the consent of the partners who 
joined the Canadian federation.
<P>
	You will permit me to quote the first ``whereas'' from the British 
North America Act of 1867. It reads as follows: ``Whereas the 
Provinces of Canada [Upper and Lower Canada], Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united 
into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle 
to that of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
	There are, however, three other ``whereas'' clauses. The first 
``whereas'' is crucial. The text continues: ``The Queen's most 
Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the 
Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, in this present 
Parliament assembled''-that is the Parliament of the United 
Kingdom of 1867. The imperial Parliament of 1867 would never 
have enacted the British North America Act without the consent of 
the colonies, of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the Provinces of 
Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, as we know it now.
<P>
	So the consent of the colonies already established at the time of 
Confederation was vital to the existence of the Canadian federation 
as we know it today. Its existence is contingent on the continued 
consent, at least of the well-defined colonies that made up the 
preconfederational British North America and that were joined by 
the colonies of the Pacific coast, essentially today's British 
Columbia and, in 1949, the Dominion of Newfoundland, which 
decided to join the Canadian family.
<P>
	We can see from the documents approved by the imperial 
Parliament following the Charlottetown and Quebec City 
resolutions that the consent of the colonies at the time was 
fundamental to the creation of the present federation. If 
constituents withdraw that consent at some point-and the real 
constituents are those who were asked in London: ``Do you give 
final approval to the Quebec resolutions we agreed on?''-and this 
is what the British Parliament did in 1867. This was within their 
right; for all practical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17474"> 17474 </A></B>
<P>
purposes, they ratified the Quebec  resolutions by giving them 
force of law. For all practical purposes, the imperial Parliament 
gave up its legislative authority over British North America in 
1982.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	As my colleague for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve pointed out 
earlier, Quebec has, of course, a people, a language, a territory, a 
history, rules and regulations, legal institutions, and a common will 
to live together, which are the basic requirements in exercising the 
right to self-determination.
<P>
	I want to focus on the issue of territory. As we recently heard, 
our Reform colleagues, in particular their leader-I think the hon. 
member for Calgary West put less emphasis on the issue, since he 
felt uncomfortable with his leader's position-, would like to turn 
Quebec into a Switzerland-type country, that is to say, full of holes 
with enclaves and removable parts. This essentially amounts to 
asymetrical federalism at its best.
<P>
	I see that the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands belongs 
to a totally different school of thought; he is already fully 
committed to Quebec's right to self-determination.
<P>
	Although the hon. member for Calgary West was uncomfortable 
about explaining his party's position, he still referred to this 
Swiss-cheese Quebec, this Quebec full of holes.
<P>
	One of the basic elements of the right to self-determination is 
territorial control. The Quebec National Assembly, our provincial 
legislature, has control over the territory it was given under the acts 
that led to establishment of the 1912 boundaries, according to the 
interpretation given by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council 
in 1927. These are the present boundaries of Quebec, stretching 
from the Outaouais to the Magdalen Islands, and from the 
Gaspesian Peninsula to the Abitibi. This territory is clearly defined, 
here, with the Ottawa river, as well as with the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, the U.S. border and the polar circle.
<P>
	These are clear boundaries, over which the Parliament of Quebec 
has absolute power, and no one is challenging that. When we hear 
Quebec being described as Swiss cheese, full of holes, with 
enclaves, corridors and ports that would remain under federal 
jurisdiction, that does not reflect the reality.
<P>
	No one is disputing the authority of the Parliament of Quebec 
over the entire territory of Quebec. Every rule of international law 
recognizes that a people, a nation has authority over the territory 
under its control at the time it achieves sovereignty.
<P>
	If the people of Quebec had voted yes to the question put to them 
on October 30, there is no doubt that Quebec would have control 
over the entire territory of Quebec. No one is denying that every 
RCM, municipality and local government in Quebec is subject to 
the  legislative and constitutional authority of the Parliament of 
Quebec under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867.
<P>
	That being said, in order for the territorial integrity of Quebec to 
be affected, the suggestion-I would say the seditious 
suggestion-would have to made that some portions of Quebec 
rebel against the legislative authority of the Parliament of Quebec, 
which neither Reform members nor our other colleagues in this 
House are suggesting.
<P>
	I think that the greatest lesson we were taught by the October 30 
referendum and will be again in the future is the fundamental 
respect not only for our institutions and our territories but also, 
fundamentally, for the people. Because sovereignty is not 
something that happens first and foremost at the institutional level 
but fundamentally at the grassroots level.
<P>
	Because we have been living for decades, and even centuries, 
under a regime that largely reflects British values and precedents, 
we have a tendency to rely more on institutions than on the peoples 
for whom these institutions exist. However, when a people wants to 
achieve self-determination, there is a basic obligation to respect 
that fundamental choice.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	On October 30, Quebecers said no to the question put to them. 
And it is with the utmost respect for democracy that everyone 
accepted that decision, even though it was, for all intents and 
purposes, taken by the smallest of majority.
<P>
	In a democratic system, the rule is 50 per cent plus one. In this 
case, it played in favour of the no side. Had the results been 
reversed, the Prime Minister himself said that he might not have 
recognized them. But the rules cannot be set once the game is over.
<P>
	These rules must be agreed on before the beginning of the game. 
For example, it would be preposterous if, during a final between 
the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Rangers, the governors 
of the league decided, at the end of the best of seven series, that the 
series would now be a best of nine, because Toronto won. Again, 
the rules are established before the game begins. And the rule here 
is that the people is sovereign.
<P>
	I am pleased that the hon. member for Saint-Henri-Westmount, 
who is here and who supported Bill 150 in Quebec's National 
Assembly, which affirmed Quebec's right to self-determination, 
now sits in this House, because she will hopefully convince her 
colleagues from the Liberal caucus of the validity of these claims.
<P>
	This said, I will have an opportunity later today to speak at the 
report stage on Bill C-110 and to talk more about the bogus veto the 
government wants to give every man and his brother.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before giving right of reply 
to the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, under whose 
name the motion we are presently debating stands, I want it to be 
very clearly understood by all members of the House that his will 
be the last words spoken on the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I consider our debate particularly rewarding. I believe the 
word ``gall'' will pass in parliamentary language, but I will use the 
word ``nerve'' instead. It takes a certain amount of nerve on the 
part of our colleague and continued friend for Calgary West for him 
to rise in this House and say we are not a people, because, as the 
people of Quebec watching will have understood, the member, in 
his sometimes unparliamentary spontaneity, clearly said that he did 
not consider Quebec was entitled to self-determination, because 
Quebecers were not a people. I find something extremely 
disquieting in the desire to engage in dialogue on this basis.
<P>
	I realize that there has been a federalist movement in this House 
and throughout our history. It is entitled to be heard and to speak. I 
do not think, however, that you will find many in Quebec, whatever 
the family, who will not acknowledge that we are a people.
<P>
	Quebec's parliament, the National Assembly, has in three 
official documents acknowledged that Quebecers are a people and, 
in doing so, has accorded the province the right to 
self-determination. These documents, which have been fairly 
unanimously approved are: the act to establish the commission to 
determine the political and constitutional future of Quebec, the act 
respecting the process for determining the political and 
constitutional future of Quebec and the motion of the National 
Assembly of 1991.
<P>
	When I was a student, I read with pleasure, whether the reading 
was assigned or optional I read with equal pleasure, the writings of 
the member for Vancouver Quadra, who joined with Senator 
Beaudoin in writing a book. I thought he belonged to a school that 
recognized Quebecers as a people. It is true that our being a people 
does not automatically entitle us, under international law, to the 
right to secede. What prompted the five legal experts to conclude 
that we did have the right to secede was the rejection of the 1982 
Constitution. There is a convention in international law which says 
that a people cannot decide by itself it has a right to 
self-determination unless that right has been recognized. As part of 
their grounds for determining the right to self-determination under 
international law they used the fact that Quebec did not ratify the 
1982 Constitition through the most legal of channels possible.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	At any rate, as the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve I 
understand, as do my colleagues, that in a democracy one cannot be 
more sovereignist that democratic. One is equally sovereignist and
<P>
democratic, but by virtue of being as sovereignist as we are 
democratic, we are well placed to understand our right to hold a 
referendum in future. No smoke and mirrors on the part of the 
federal government can deny Quebec the right under a law passed 
by the National Assembly, a law on public consultation, to go to the 
people and offer them the opportunity to choose and to mandate 
their government to accede to sovereignty.
<P>
	When that day comes and there is a majority behind that 
mandate I am sure our colleagues, both in the government party 
and in the Reform party, will understand that they have no choice 
but to sit down at the negotiating table and engage in a dialogue on 
the basis of total equality, nation to nation, as should have always 
been the case.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96, this item is dropped from the Order 
Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Later today the House will go through the procedures to consider 
and dispose of the supply bill. In view of recent practices, do hon. 
members agree that the bill be distributed now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>December 1, 1995-Minister of Human Resources Development-Second 
reading and reference to the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development of Bill C-111, an act respecting employment insurance in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-111, an act respecting employment insurance in Canada, be 
referred forthwith to the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this motion is to refer the 
new employment insurance bill to the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development. By referring the bill directly to 
the committee, we signal our commitment to invite and engage the 
largest amount of direct public participation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17476"> 17476 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill was derived from the very extensive public 
consultation which has taken place over the past year. The work 
of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development has 
pulled together much of that information and has provided 
extraordinarily valuable input toward the development of the 
original legislation. It is our hope that by giving the committee 
the earliest opportunity to listen to Canadians and hear their 
various points of view, we can improve the legislation even further 
and ensure that we get an active and involved commitment and 
engagement.
<P>
	We all recognize that this is important legislation. It affects the 
lives of millions of Canadians. It is a major restructuring and 
modernization of a bill which will provide for new opportunities 
for people to get work and to have a hope of once again being 
employed.
<P>
	We have come up with an approach which has been carefully 
constructed and is balanced and fair. It may not satisfy one special 
interest or the other but it does provide a proper equitable balancing 
of interests across Canada. We believe the bill is consistent with 
what Canadians want. We listened very carefully to them and we 
listened very carefully to what the committee said.
<P>
	What we have heard is directly reflected in many of the 
recommendations and parts of the legislation. It upholds our 
responsibility to ensure the program is based on solid insurance 
principles while at the same time provides a strong combination of 
incentives which enable people to get back into the job market. It is 
about jobs; it is about people. It is about jobs finding people and 
people finding jobs. It has shown that we as a government and as a 
Parliament can construct a new system. We can restore for many 
Canadians an opportunity to once again become full participants in 
Canada's labour market.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	If it is shown, as I believe it can be, that legitimate 
improvements and constructive proposals are needed, we will look 
to the committee to bring those ideas forward and apply its 
judgment and wisdom in that application.
<P>
	For example, in the last week or so we have heard that some 
areas are concerned about work patterns in parts of Canada. We 
hope that the committee will take a careful look at that.
<P>
	Minority groups have expressed concern that they will not have 
full access to training because of the new development of 
transferring training to the provinces. Some are concerned that 
their rights be protected. We certainly hope the committee will take 
those matters into account.
<P>
	We are also very interested in how the transitional jobs fund will 
work to create good, solid, long term jobs for people who are in 
high unemployment areas. Again, we expect and hope that the 
committee can provide major guidance in this area.
<P>
	These are just some of the issues I believe the committee may 
want to look into.
<P>
	We should not lose sight of the hard evidence that has been 
provided throughout the debate which has been encouraged over 
the last week. The House and the committee will be looking at how 
the new program will extend eligibility for coverage under the 
program to over 500,000 Canadians, something they have not had 
before. We demonstrated that the change of going from a weekly to 
an hourly based formula will be equitable, particularly for tens of 
thousands of seasonal workers who work long hours for short 
periods of time and who could not qualify under the old system, or 
who were not given full credit for all their hours of work.
<P>
	We have also spoken about the innovative family income 
supplement which has been widely approved across the country. It 
will provide 80 per cent of benefits for families of low income, 
those earning under $25,000, mainly single parents, by introducing 
a form of guaranteed annual income which has been talked about in 
this country for a long time. As a result, over 350,000 low income 
families will receive on average 7 per cent to 15 per cent higher 
benefits in the new program than under the old program. This is a 
true, progressive, liberal-minded initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I mentioned new partnerships with all levels of government and 
of the opportunity for federal, provincial and municipal 
governments to concentrate their efforts where it counts, at the 
local level, in our communities, while respecting the 
responsibilities of all concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the brief time I have today I want to go back to the importance 
of developing this partnership for jobs, bringing the levels of 
government together to work in common, harmonize and work in 
partnership so that we can help create employment for Canadians 
in every part of Canada.
<P>
	A key impact of this reform has to do with income. Not benefits 
but income. Providing ways for people to earn more money, to 
sustain themselves, their families and their communities is a key 
component of the objectives of the program. Many unemployed 
Canadians need more than just income support as a bridge between 
jobs. The new employment insurance system will build a better, 
stronger, wider bridge to help them make a more solid, long lasting 
connection to the work world.
<P>
	The employment benefits we are proposing are made up of five 
new back to work measures and provide real, positive help to get 
people back into jobs. We have tested these measures and we know 
they work. We know that wage subsidies can help level the playing 
field for people facing a disadvantage in the workplace, especially 
women and young people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17477"> 17477 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to underline that we are seeing a 70 per cent to 80 per 
cent improvement in job retention, allowing 14 to 15 more weeks 
of work and up to $5,000 more a year in income earnings. This 
is far more than would be received under a benefit program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Self-employment assistance will help people start a business. 
During the past two years, this program has helped 30,000 
individuals start their own business and thus has created 60,000 
jobs for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Also in these employment measures are the job partnership 
projects. For example, one in New Brunswick is now enabling 
1,000 older workers who lost their jobs in the forestry industry to 
go back to work, particularly in reforestation, rebuilding a 
resource, replanting for the next generation. They are now involved 
in passing on their skills and doing so in a rewarding and satisfying 
way.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	There is also the individualized skills, loans and grants which, if 
the provinces agree, will enable people to use the opportunity to 
upgrade themselves so that they can get the new jobs available in 
the new economy.
<P>
	Another tool, the income supplements, will increase the incomes 
of people by encouraging them to take jobs sooner. For example, 
this will help unemployed single parents to get back on their feet 
and gain new skills and experience. The early analysis of a 
self-sufficiency project we have been running in British Columbia 
and New Brunswick shows that the average hourly starting wage 
during the first year was $7.63 and that one-third of the participants 
were making at least $2 more than the minimum wage. Thirty-five 
per cent of single parents offered supplements leave welfare to 
work within a year compared to an average of 2 per cent or 3 per 
cent under normal circumstances. Again it shows that the tools 
work and work effectively.
<P>
	We will be investing $800 million on these five extra tools of 
savings. This will be added to the existing $1.9 billion of our 
programs. There will be a total of $2.7 billion in helping people get 
jobs. Those who dismiss this reform as mere cuts should reflect on 
this number and what it represents in terms of new opportunities 
for Canadians. It means that 400,000 unemployed workers will get 
additional help to find a job. Therefore, those who are opposed to 
such reforms are basically saying to over 400,000 Canadians that 
they do not want to help them.
<P>
	This legislation is designed to provide the opposite, to provide a 
new bridge and a new tool. I can only say we are very much looking 
forward to the active and engaged work of the committee. We hope 
it will provide us with an opportunity to hear the best judgments 
and  accumulated ideas of Canadians and in particular, to let the 
committee help formulate the legislation in a way that can most 
effectively service its basic opportunity, which is to get people 
back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I simply want to advise the 
House that for the purposes of this debate, hon. members are 
entitled to 10-minute speeches, without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
official opposition deeply regrets that the government should resort 
to this exceptional procedure and thus deprive the public of 
information, of a debate, televised for the benefit of individuals 
across Canada, on this extremely important bill.
<P>
	At this stage, according to the usual procedure in Parliament for 
dealing with bills, we would normally be on second reading, and 
the official opposition would be entitled to one 40-minute speech, 
followed by 20-minute speeches by as many members as wish to 
speak. We could then propose amendments and keep the public 
informed.
<P>
	The official opposition and the third party play a crucial role in 
ensuring that citizens are aware of the subject and substance of a 
bill as important as these unemployment insurance reforms which, 
over the years, will affect hundreds of thousands of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	However, within the very short time frame we have been 
allowed, we will hardly have time to say that this bill, despite all 
the denials of the minister and his attempts to claim the opposite, 
and despite the improvements he will make in the bill, and we will 
certainly participate in that process, that basically this bill is aimed 
at making more savage cuts in benefits for the unemployed.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	This $2 billion in drastic cuts is in addition-I can never repeat it 
often enough-to this year's cuts of $735 million in Quebec and 
$620 million in the maritimes. Quebec will lose another $640 
million by the year 2001.
<P>
	Contrary to what the government implies, $800 million of this 
additional $2 billion will not be set aside for other active measures, 
as the information papers we have been given clearly specify. It is 
right there in black and white.
<P>
	The truth is that this $800 million from the UI fund will replace 
the $600 million that used to come from the consolidated revenue 
fund, which means that, in reality, all of Canada will get only $200 
million more over five years. What is true is that $600 million will 
come from the UI fund rather than the consolidated revenue fund, 
as indicated in the papers and information given to us by senior 
officials during the briefing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17478"> 17478 </A></B>
<P>
	The reality of this bill is that qualifying for UI will become 
much more difficult for women, young people, seasonal workers, 
new immigrants, and all those not already eligible. It will become 
much more difficult in a labour market of precarious, short term 
jobs that often arouse feelings of anxiety, frustration and 
despondency in those trying to make a living in such a market.
<P>
	This reform targets certain classes of persons. It is directed at 
specific job markets, starting with the Atlantic Provinces and 
Quebec.
<P>
	Looking at the charts prepared by senior officials of Manpower 
and Immigration Canada, we are astounded to find that certain 
classes of persons, namely repeat claimants, seasonal workers and 
newcomers, are indeed larger in eastern Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	I think it is safe to say, at any rate, this is not a matter of human 
nature because this would mean that human nature has special 
characteristics in the Atlantic Provinces and Quebec that it does not 
have in western Canada. It is not human nature that is different, but 
the job market.
<P>
	The official opposition will be participating very actively in this 
committee. Not only will we listen to every person or group of 
persons who want to come and tell us what is wrong with the UI 
plan and who expect this plan to really be an employment insurance 
plan but we will also denounce, every chance we get, this unhelpful 
attitude of hiding a deficit cutting measure behind fancy rhetoric.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The official opposition will make every effort to ensure that 
workers, in fact any person who may have to rely on UI, can have 
access to it in the way that is the most beneficial to them. Yes, some 
active measures are required, and we in Quebec have implemented 
such measures and asked for such measures to be implemented, so 
that people can have access to benefits derived directly from 
premiums paid by workers and businesses.
<P>
	Having listened to the people of Canada and Quebec, we know 
that these active measures designed to help people find a job must 
not in any way take the place of jobs. We were told right across 
Canada, because we did tour the country, that the real issue is 
employment. It is not the will of people to work: it is employment.
<P>
	Sure, we must do everything possible to help people qualify 
when there are jobs available. However, we must also stop making 
the jobless feel guilty by saying that it is their fault, particularly in 
light of the dramatic increase in the number of people actively 
looking for work, who can no longer tolerate not being able to live 
decently, have some hope, and have some stability in order, for 
example, to have children.
<P>
	This bill seeks to introduce twisted family policy measures, and 
we do not hesitate to say so. What is needed is a true family policy.
<P>
As for the UI program, it should help by bridging the gap between 
jobs. Active measures should be left to the decision makers who are 
best able to decide. Quebec, as we know, wants to have total control 
over manpower policies.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the government withheld the information 
that would have put Canadians on track, in terms of the reforms 
needed, instead of merely making speeches that do not reflect 
reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
history of unemployment insurance in Canada dates back to 1919 
when the concept was first discussed. It finally became a legislated 
labour market institution under the government of Mackenzie 
King.
<P>
	Let me read some of the quotes from that great debate in 1940 
which focused on the original intent of unemployment insurance:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend to your government the question of making some provision 
by a system of state social insurance for those who, through no fault of their 
own, are unable to work, whether the inability arises from lack of opportunity, 
sickness, invalidity or old age. Such insurance would remove the spectre of fear 
which now haunts the wage earner and makes him a more contented and better 
citizen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have a second quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How much unemployment there will be and over what period it will last is 
impossible to forecast. But, whatever it be, there must be a great deal of 
unemployment which can only be dealt with in one of two ways: either by a 
considered scheme of insurance or by state doles, hurriedly and 
indiscriminately issued when the moment of crisis arrives. There can be no 
question which is the better way. State doles lead straight to pauperization. A 
well devised scheme of insurance preserves the self-respect of the worker and 
assists and encourages him to supplement it by provision made industrially 
through an association.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	I am well aware that we are debating a motion to refer this bill to 
committee prior to second reading and that the government will tell 
us that doing so is supposed to provide the committee with greater 
opportunity to make amendments to the bill. However, as we all 
know, the fact is that this mechanism which the government 
introduced into the standing orders shortly after taking power, has 
been consistently used to limit debate in the House and as a 
mechanism to speedily move controversial legislation through the 
parliamentary process in a manner which minimizes opposition.
<P>
	I vehemently oppose sending the bill to committee prior to 
second reading. I believe that every member of Parliament should 
have an adequate opportunity to speak to the bill in the House of 
Commons, where they may both pose and respond to questions 
from their colleagues and opposition members. By drastically 
limiting debate,  the government is demonstrating its complete 
disdain for such a parliamentary process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17479"> 17479 </A></B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, this is a House of free speech and I have written 
something which reflects my view of Bill C-111. Goodness knows, 
it is always a challenge to pique interest in House debates. In any 
event, I give the House my version of the 12 days of Christmas.
<P>
	On the first day of Christmas the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, known as HRD, having no understanding of the 
meaning of insurance, gave us one more long awaited non-reform. 
Carried along on the mantra of job creation, we received our year 
end Christmas gift: employment insurance.
<P>
	On the second day of Christmas the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us two 
hard-working Canadians who, despite their considerable financial 
contributions to UI over all of their working lives, died without 
ever having received a penny of benefits: taxed to the grave.
<P>
	On the third day of Christmas the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us three French 
Canadian leaders who, to no one's surprise, babbled on incessantly 
about Quebec and how unemployment in Quebec was distinct from 
all other unemployment in the rest of Canada and who felt, as 
always, that no one understood them.
<P>
	On the fourth day of Christmas, the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us four calling 
premiers from the Atlantic region; calling for this, calling for that 
and finally, completely worn out from all of the calling, the 
minister of HRD called it quits to reform and went back to 
tinkering.
<P>
	Five suffering regions, formally known as ten equal provinces, 
are all demanding more from less. Regional development 
boondoggles remain an active ingredient in the magic of creating 
jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	On the sixth day of Christmas the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us six government 
strategists laying future plots for further tax grabs. After all, the 
implementation of the employment insurance scheme does not 
begin until July 1996, with a phase-in period to full implementation 
extending to the year 2000.
<P>
	On the seventh day of Christmas the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us seven assistant 
deputy ministers swimming in UI cash surpluses. These new found 
friends of the finance minister will help him meet his deficit target 
of 3 per cent of GDP in hidden taxes, EI premiums and not reduced 
spending.
<P>
	On the eighth day of Christmas the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us eight milking 
tax collectors who targeted the part time worker, the working mom 
and the small business  owner. So much for tax relief; just 
continued taxes on the tax oppressed.
<P>
	On the ninth day of Christmas the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us nine drumming 
seasonal workers who expressed outrage at being encouraged to 
accept available jobs in the shoulder season. But the government 
forgot to mention that under the new rules, claimants can still 
receive UI benefits equal to as much as 110 per cent of their 
earnings from employment.
<P>
	On the tenth day of Christmas the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us ten piping 
journalists who heralded the miracle of changing UI to EI and gave 
us the new meaning of ``un''.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	On the eleventh day of Christmas, the minister of HRD, having 
no understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us 11 dancing 
parliamentary committee members who, as the good Liberals they 
are, followed Government Orders to limit debate and refer Bill 
C-111 to committee before second reading, another promise broken 
by a government whose promise was for openness.
<P>
	On the twelfth day of Christmas, the minister of HRD, having no 
understanding of the meaning of insurance, gave us 12 leaping 
bureaucrats to promote jobs and growth. They called this new 
program the job fund. This $300 million initiative is sure to sustain 
at least the 12 jobs enjoyed by these bureaucrats.
<P>
	Merry Christmas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to support the motion before us today, since 
it will allow us to consider Bill C-111, on employment insurance 
immediately.
<P>
	With this motion, the government shows the importance of this 
legislative measure and the need to immediately undertake detailed 
consideration of its content.
<P>
	The proposed reform is a very complex one. It has been 
discussed for months and months now, openly and publicly across 
Canada, and if there is one consensus that has emerged from these 
consultations, it is to give a new orientation to the entire 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	It was quite a challenge: how to give a new direction to 
unemployment insurance? During these consultations, a number of 
ideas were proposed. What we have before us today represents a 
real change of direction, a major reform of what used to be 
unemployment insurance. It needs to be really well understood, 
which is why we shall need to take all of the time available in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17480"> 17480 </A></B>
<P>
committee to  study this change of direction and to ensure that the 
bill before us will really meet the objectives we have set.
<P>
	Those objectives are, of course, part of our overall job strategy. I 
believe that each and every person in this country understands just 
what a priority it is for all Canadians have jobs, to keep their jobs, 
or to create jobs. Unemployment insurance reform was considered 
in that overall context. It is but one element in this government's 
strategy for maintaining jobs and creating new ones, not a strategy 
in itself.
<P>
	Over the years, we have seen that the unemployment insurance 
program as it existed led to a number of problems. First of all, we 
have seen how very quickly the costs have risen. Just think, in 1982 
the program cost $8 billion, while by 1995 it was up to $16 billion. 
With the passing years we have seen the program being overused. 
When I say overuse, it is certainly not my intention to blame 
workers who receive unemployment insurance benefits, as the 
official opposition seems to imply, but it is a fact that over the 
years, the unemployment insurance plan had become more like an 
income support plan. We also found that the system was overused 
by employers to the extent that it influenced their hiring approach. 
That is why we had to get back to basics.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	We also found that over the years inequities had developed in the 
system. It was designed at a time when employment was widely 
available, when people worked from 9 to 5, 35 hours a week. That 
is no longer the case in 1995. So a number of inequities had 
developed in the system, and I am thinking more particularly of 
part time workers. Working part time has become a way of life, so 
how can we make the system available to part-time workers as 
well?
<P>
	We also found that the system tended to favour those on higher 
salaries, when we looked at how benefits were distributed. Could 
we restore a measure of equity to the unemployment insurance 
system? That is why what we have here is a thorough reform. This 
is a new system that wants to give workers and employers an 
incentive to maintain jobs and create jobs.
<P>
	So there are three important elements in this reform. Number 
one: unemployment insurance benefits; number two: employment 
benefits, and number three: a transitional job creation fund to help 
the most disadvantaged regions in our country. I think this reform 
is comprehensive in its approach to these dimensions.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about employment benefits, 
because since this reform was announced by my colleague, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, we have heard a 
number of views on these employment benefits, how they will be 
implemented, how we will work together with the provinces to give 
our workers an incentive to be on the labour market and our 
employers an incentive to maintain jobs.
<P>
	I think it was very clear that in this reform the government was 
intent on developing pro-active employment measures. That is why 
it has specifically identified five employment benefit measures. 
The government intends to develop, implement and evaluate them 
with the provinces. So, imagine my surprise at discovering last 
week that the Bloc Quebecois in its opposition day motion was 
criticizing the unemployment insurance reform, saying it increased 
overlap and duplication.
<P>
	I must say that I could see our friends opposite had not yet read 
the bill, because the reverse is clearly true. We are in fact trying to 
avoid overlap and duplication. I also heard it said that the federal 
government wanted to supervise the provinces, because the bill 
defined requirements for employment measures. So, here again, 
you can imagine my surprise.
<P>
	The bill talks of guidelines. There is nothing about national 
standards. It talks about guidelines. There are six different 
guidelines. Let us have a look at them and see how a provincial 
government could object to them. The first really aims at avoiding 
overlap and duplication. Clause 57 of the bill provides that we are 
to aim for:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) harmonization with provincial employment initiatives to ensure that there 
is no unnecessary overlap or duplication;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That seems clear. Every effort must be made to ensure that there 
is no overlap but rather complementarity when a province already 
has employment measures.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, as far as Quebec is concerned, I must tell you that 
it is quite a challenge, because there are now something like three 
service delivery networks in Quebec. There is the Société 
québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, which has 
offices in all regions of Quebec; the Travail Québec centres, which 
are scattered throughout the province; and the Employment Canada 
centres.
<P>
	Even within the province of Quebec, there is an obvious need for 
harmonization between the Société québécoise de développement 
de la main-d'oeuvre, the Travail Québec centres and the 
Employment Canada centres.
<P>
	This is one of the guidelines; there are five others that show our 
desire to be as flexible as possible. I cannot see how a province 
could object. But again, this bill will be referred to a committee for 
consideration and we will see how it can be enhanced.
<P>
	Looking at the overall impact of this bill on all Canadian 
provinces and at Quebec's situation, I can tell you that Quebec 
comes out ahead. At the present time, for every dollar contributed, 
Quebec receives $1.33. After the reform, for every dollar 
contributed, it will receive $1.31. Quebec will still come out ahead.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17481"> 17481 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, like any other province, Quebec will have control 
over employment benefits, as it has always demanded over the 
years.
<P>
	Both sides must show some goodwill. In this regard, I want to 
commend the open-mindedness of Quebec's Minister of 
Employment who, unlike the Bloc Quebecois, agreed to sit down 
with us to determine how we can provide better services to Quebec 
workers.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope that the committee will help improve and 
enhance the bill before us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not how I 
had originally planned to start my speech and, even though we are 
given only ten minutes, I would like to share my first reactions with 
the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	She claims to have been very surprised by our response. She did 
not look that surprised when I saw her on television over the 
weekend, as she addressed a group of Quebecers, including 
members of the Liberal Party of Quebec, who reminded her and the 
public at large of the consensus in Quebec in favour of seeing all 
the money earmarked for employability development and 
occupational training measures as well as all employment-related 
services be handed over to the Quebec government, which must be 
in charge.
<P>
	In our view, being in charge does not mean being responsible for 
implementing national standards or reaching national goals 
imposed by the federal government. This is a clarification I wanted 
to make at this stage. In a certain way, the Minister of Labour tried 
to divert the debate onto that subject. I would like to come back to 
the substance of this bill, such as the objectives that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development outlined this morning.
<P>
	He started by saying: ``You know, we are taking a special 
measure in the House to ensure that this bill goes to committee as 
soon as possible''. He made this out to be positive.
<P>
	It should be pointed out, and you know that it is, Mr. Speaker, 
that this is an exceptional measure, a type of measure that this 
government has used three or four times already over the past two 
years, supposedly to speed up the process. We must look at the 
context.
<P>
	If consideration by the committee was so urgent, and I am 
putting the question to the government, why did it wait for so long 
after tabling the green paper and after last year's tour, to bring this 
bill back to the House? The government waited for something 
called the Quebec referendum on sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It waited for the referendum, because it knew that introducing a 
bill that provides for cuts totalling some $2 billion, including $600 
million in Quebec, might influence the outcome of the referendum. 
So, the government waited until after the referendum. Still, it  
could have tabled its bill a few days, or even a few weeks after the 
referendum. Instead, the government brings this legislation back to 
the House on the Monday of the last week before the Christmas 
recess.
<P>
	Why? To get a better idea of what Canadians think of the bill. 
Oh, sure. The minister knows full well that December is like the 
summer months. The media are less interested in such debates, and 
the public does not read the papers or follow the media as much, 
because it is busy doing other things.
<P>
	The government has the nerve to say that it is to make things 
easier. Come, now. The human resources committee will probably 
sit this week. What does that mean? Interested groups will be asked 
to submit briefs in January; in short, those wishing to present such 
a brief will have to take time during the holiday season to prepare a 
brief, have it approved by their officials, and make sure it gets here 
before the deadline. This is not democracy, it is just the opposite.
<P>
	It is an old trick used by many bodies. I have seen it used by 
municipal governments, namely to present controversial projects 
during the Christmas or summer holidays. It is an old trick often 
used. It is not very clever, it has been done before, and anyone with 
any degree of critical sense can see right through it.
<P>
	We are being presented with this and, of course, we will attend 
committee proceedings. But for the sake of this, we are sacrificing 
the debate which should have taken place in the House, starting 
with 40 minute speeches followed by 20 minute speeches by as 
many members as were interested in expressing their views, from 
both sides of the House, the official opposition, the government, 
and the third party.
<P>
	But instead, the government wants to consult. The parliamentary 
secretary might remember the consultations we held last year in 
December. The weather was not very cold yet. We started in 
mid-November and kept at it until the Christmas holidays. We went 
all over the place, in every major city, and no one, no organization 
supported the government 's position, on the contrary. Between 75 
and 80 per cent of the people we heard were against the 
government's proposals.
<P>
	And this is supposed to be a government that listens? No, Mr. 
Speaker, it does not. It does remember, though. Last year, in every 
city it toured, it was met with protests. It remembers and is 
thinking: ``If we act faster, we might hold the hearings in Ottawa, 
and people will appear in committee there''.
<P>
	I challenge the government to go and present its UI project in 
major cities. I bet it will not do it, hoping to proceed unnoticed, in 
the deep of winter. The committee will get briefs from national 
organizations, but not from citizens. I remember the last hearing, 
last year in Bathurst, when Acadians came to tell us how difficult 
and dangerous it would be for this part of New Brunswick.  They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17482"> 17482 </A></B>
<P>
feared the worst, because of the cuts the government said it would 
make somewhere. This time, we are not going to do the same.
<P>
	As opposition critic for training and youth, I would like to take 
the last few minutes I have left to tell you how much damage this 
bill will do to young people in particular. The minister was saying: 
``This bill is very progressive''. I say this bill is regressive. The 
minister was talking about fairness for everybody, I say that, on the 
contrary, it is unfair for young people. Why? Because from now on, 
to be eligible to unemployment insurance, you will need 910 hours 
of work, instead of the present 300 hours.
<P>
	This bill is not only bad for young people, it is also bad for 
women who re-enter the workforce. After raising their children, 
many women would like to get a job, but they will be in the same 
situation as young people. This legislation is also regressive for 
new immigrants looking for jobs after landing in this country.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The 910 hours mean 26 weeks at 35 hours per week. This is a 
considerable number of hours.
<P>
	Before that 20 fifteen-hour weeks, that is to say 300 hours of 
work, were enough for first time claimants to qualify for benefits. 
After the reform you will need 26 thirty-five-hour weeks, that is to 
say 910 hours of work, to be eligible for benefits.
<P>
	Before the reform 12 fifteen-hour weeks, or 180 hours, were 
enough to qualify for benefits in areas of high unemployment.
<P>
	After the reform 28 fifteen-hour weeks, or 420 hours of work, 
will be necessary to be eligible for benefits in areas of high 
unemployment.
<P>
	Before the reform, people who were already entitled to 
unemployment insurance and who had worked 20 fifteen hour 
weeks, or 300 hours, were able to collect benefits in low 
unemployment areas. After the reform, they will be able to collect 
benefits if they have worked 20 thirty-five weeks, or 700 hours.
<P>
	Here is another case of inequality. For frequent users, that is 
people who have been on UI three times in five years, there is an 
absolute guarantee that their benefits will be reduced by at least 1 
per cent each year, which is at least 5 per cent in five years. This 
category of unemployed workers will definitely lose out. And the 
government says yes to equity? What the minister is saying about 
equity is that a number of people who were working less that 15 
hours a week did not have to pay UI premiums. Now, everyone 
must pay from the first hour of work. However, there is no 
guarantee that they will be able to benefit from it, quite the 
contrary.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Labour Congress, in 1970, 77 per 
cent of unemployed workers were covered by UI. This percentage 
would be less than 50 per cent today.  The Canadian Labour 
Congress estimates that, with the reform, two unemployed workers 
out of three will not be eligible for benefits. Is that equitable? Is 
that progressive? I say no.
<P>
	Since you are inviting me to do so, Mr. Speaker, I will conclude 
by pointing out that if this reform had been known in detail in the 
form of a bill and if a real consultation was still going on in an 
appropriate context and an appropriate period, and if this period 
had been established before the Quebec referendum, I tell you 
sincerely that we would now be talking about other things in this 
House, because this reform would not have been adopted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak against the Bloc motion being debated 
today. The reforms of Canada's unemployment insurance are not 
only overdue. In many ways they do not go far enough and are too 
complex. While the reforms will impose hardship on some 
Canadians, they will at the same time bring much larger economic 
and social benefits to society as a whole.
<P>
	I make this judgment after much study. In my career as a 
professional economist I was deeply concerned with the economic 
and social effects of unemployment insurance. In the mid-1970s I 
published a number of studies and organized an international 
conference that examined the effect of the level of benefits and 
ease of access to UI on recorded unemployment rates in Canada.
<P>
	A few years ago I published a study that argued the large gap 
between Canadian and U.S. unemployment rates, which first 
appeared in the early 1970s, was caused by the increased 
generosity of our system initiated by Canadian reforms at that time. 
Incidentally the co-author of this study was Dr. Josef Bonnici, a 
former student of mine who is presently the minister of finance for 
the Government of Malta.
<P>
	In February 1996 I will participate in a major conference of 
social scientists which will re-examine the issue of Canada-U.S. 
differences in unemployment rates to be held in Ottawa. My work 
on the effects of unemployment insurance on unemployment was 
fundamental economic theory which in turn guided reproducible 
econometric measurement co-authored by several colleagues and 
experts in this field.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	Our results were verified by the economic council. It is fair to 
say that today even the left leaning part of the chattering class of 
academics, journalists and other intellectuals has accepted the 
validity of the basic premise.
<P>
	Assar Lindbeck, a famous Swedish economist who is a strong 
supporter of social democratic policies, recently published a paper 
in which he noted that social support  programs like unemployment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17483"> 17483 </A></B>
<P>
insurance induce the creation of institutions and ethical norms 
which increase the demand for the support programs.
<P>
	The chattering classes in the past tended to infer from my 
analysis that I recommended the abandonment of unemployment 
insurance. I never did. The policy issue has always been the correct 
level of UI benefits and ease of access which maximize overall 
social welfare. There is no doubt the more generous the system is, 
the higher is the welfare of those receiving the benefits. However, 
on the other hand, the higher the benefits, the higher the 
unemployment, the higher the premiums payable by workers, the 
higher the risk of dependency of habitual users, and a host of other 
economic and social costs.
<P>
	For a long time the political culture in Canada has resulted in the 
denial that these costs exist or, if they exist, that they are largely 
relative to the benefits received by unemployed.
<P>
	About 15 years ago I was asked to be a guest on ``Cross Country 
Check-Up''. The views expressed during that period on the subject 
were most extreme. However, most important, as Claude Forget 
told me after he found that his report on the issue was ignored by 
the political system, the case for a less generous system has no 
political constituency quite simply because the economic and 
social benefits are diffused and poorly understood.
<P>
	Those suffering from the reduction of benefits are clearly 
identified and well organized. No political party in Canada could 
afford to make the system less generous. This was true until 
recently when the Canadian debt and deficit began to threaten the 
very existence of all social programs.
<P>
	The shift in the perceived political payoff from doing nothing 
and making UI less generous has not come easy to people like the 
Minister of Human Resources Development who used to deny 
vehemently even the existence of insurance induced 
unemployment and other costs. The timid and convoluted reforms 
to which his ministry gave birth reflect the struggle he had in 
admitting that these undesirable effects not only exist but are very 
costly to society.
<P>
	Let me return to the Bloc resolution being debated today. It is 
true, as it states, that UI reforms will make some Canadians worse 
off, especially those in seasonal industries. However, my long and 
intense study of the UI system has convinced me that these reforms 
at the same time bring substantial benefits to many other Canadians 
so that overall welfare has increased. This certainly has been the 
finding of a number of royal commissions which looked at the 
question.
<P>
	A basic theorem in economics is that under conditions like these, 
where some gain and some lose from a given policy, the 
government should offer assistance to those who have been asked 
to carry the burden of adjustment.  After all it was a government 
created system, not their own fault, which caused them to enter 
these seasonal industries in excessive numbers and at 
non-economic wages. At the same time the rest of society which 
benefits from the changes may be expected to pay for easing the 
costs of transition for those asked to bear them.
<P>
	For this reason I take the opportunity to urge the government to 
stick to its reforms and possibly strengthen them while at the same 
time make more generous provisions to ease the pain of transition 
felt by those affected adversely and directly by the reforms.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in support of the motion made by the Minister 
of Human Resources Development to refer Bill C-111 to the 
standing committee.
<P>
	We have every reason to move forward with a thorough 
examination of this bill by a committee of the House. We have 
every reason to allow an early public review of its provisions. We 
have no reason to hold back and nothing to gain by preventing the 
broad consultations necessary with such an important piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	All members of this House recognize that this is a very important 
bill. It has been the subject of vigorous debate and intense 
questioning from all sides, yet throughout the debate we have seen 
something very rare: the unanimous agreement on the central point 
of this legislation. We all agree that we need to reform the old UI 
program. Throughout all the debate and questioning, no one has 
suggested that the status quo is acceptable. No one has suggested 
that we can afford to leave things as they are. Everyone has spoken 
of the need to find a better way to help unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	This rare unanimity reflects a broad consensus throughout the 
country. More than 100,000 people who took part in the 
consultations said we need a better jobs system for Canadians. 
Almost nine out of ten Canadians told us we need a fundamental 
overhaul of the old UI program to make it work. Provincial leaders, 
business groups, professionals and community organizations have 
spoken clearly over the past weeks about the need for change. Bill 
C-111 presents a clear and progressive agenda for change.
<P>
	Now we have an opportunity to hear from Canadians about this 
agenda. Members of the House have an opportunity to subject the 
bill to the rigorous examination of standing committee hearings. 
We have an opportunity to use our time well over the coming weeks 
to make the debate on Bill C-111 more inclusive, to open up the 
process, to consult and to listen before we proceed with the 
legislative process when the House resumes.
<P>
	It would be inexcusable to delay these consultations. Every day 
we delay we put jobs and hope for thousands  of Canadians on hold. 
Every day we delay we are perpetuating a UI program that is not 
only out of date but is actually hurting the people it is supposed to 
help. We are perpetuating a system that leaves too many Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17484"> 17484 </A></B>
<P>
stuck in the past when what they need is a springboard to help them 
change, adjust and adapt to the future.
<P>
	The new jobs system, employment insurance, will make it easier 
for people at risk to work longer and encourage employers to keep 
people in their jobs longer. Think about what that means. Think 
about what it means to the 400,000 Canadians right now who find 
themselves stuck in a constant rut of getting from one benefit 
program to another.
<P>
	If the new system can get those people just one additional work 
week, we will save the entire system $50 million, money we can 
plough back into the system to turn that one extra week of work 
into two, two weeks into four, four weeks into eight. Instead of a 
cycle of joblessness we can create a new cycle of employment and 
hope for almost half a million Canadians who want to work and 
deserve an even break.
<P>
	That is what this new jobs system is all about. Think what it 
means for the thousands of people who can move into new jobs 
created by small businesses across the country. Right now the old 
UI program is killing those jobs every day. A survey of small 
businesses in Atlantic Canada tells us that employers just cannot 
compete with the UI system for workers.
<P>
	With our new jobs system we will cut insurance premiums, the 
tax on jobs, to assist them. We will create a system that supports 
employment and job creation instead of one that perpetuates 
unemployment. Think of what it means to the hundreds of 
thousands of job seekers who will get direct help through new 
employment benefits, help that is more effective, that is more 
flexible, that will get results faster than anything they can get now.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	With wage subsidies, each year we will be able to help some 
65,000 people get off benefits and into jobs. Studies show that 
these subsidies can help each one of these people increase their 
income and gain an average of 17 additional weeks of employment 
each year.
<P>
	With earnings supplements we can help make work pay for some 
75,000 workers each year, people who deserve more than the old UI 
treadmill. We know from joint pilot projects with New Brunswick 
and British Columbia that these supplements get results and help 
people secure their place in the workforce.
<P>
	We will help thousands of Canadians each year create their own 
jobs through self-employment, a key driving force for job creation 
and growth in the new economy. Studies show that by providing the 
right kind of support at the right time, people who were without 
work can  create businesses that last and create new jobs by hiring 
employees.
<P>
	We can create new job creation partnerships, mobilizing the 
resources of the provinces, community groups and organizations 
across the country to help people adapt to the demands of the new 
workplace, increase their earnings and gain the independence that 
only a job can provide.
<P>
	We can work with the provinces to help individuals through 
skills loans and grants, giving more opportunities for people to 
make a real investment in their own future, to get the kind of skills 
required to enter the job market of the 21st century from a position 
of strength.
<P>
	We can make this kind of assistance, all of these employment 
benefits more accessible to more people: to some 500,000 part time 
workers who are not even covered by the UI program; to people 
who have simply been abandoned by the old system, marginalized 
by a system that does not reflect the realities of the 1990s.
<P>
	Employment insurance is not just another version of the old UI 
program. It is truly Canada's jobs system for the 21st century. It is 
part of this government's agenda for jobs and growth. This agenda 
for jobs and growth is on track and it is working. We are getting the 
deficit under control in reality, not just in rhetoric. By 1997-98 the 
government's new borrowing requirements in relation to the size of 
the economy will be at the lowest level since 1969.
<P>
	We are matching deficit reduction with an all out drive for job 
creation. Over the past year we generated almost half a million full 
time jobs, more than in any year since 1987. That is what this 
government was elected to do. We were given a mandate to get 
Canada and Canadians back to work. Bill C-111, employment 
insurance, is part of our agenda to fulfil that mandate.
<P>
	Canadians need the opportunity now to review Bill C-111 
through the kind of forum that only a standing committee of the 
House of Commons can provide. We can give them this forum now. 
We have no reason to put this very important review of an 
extremely important piece of legislation on hold. We owe it to 
Canadians to move forward. I urge all members of the House to 
support this motion so that we can look to the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel that it is 
my duty to take the floor today to support the motion put forward 
by my colleague, the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	We are now seeing the aftermath of the Martin budget presented 
last February. As we feared, and it is even worse in the opinion of 
many, the unemployment insurance reform hits the most 
vulnerable among us.
<P>
	The people in my riding, Lotbinière, already have an axe to grind 
against the Minister, Mr. Axworthy, who,  with his reform, has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17485"> 17485 </A></B>
<P>
deprived them of the services of the Victoriaville employment 
centre. In the middle of July, thousands of my constituents were by 
my side in an effort to save personalized services near their homes. 
We got the assurance that that minimum would be maintained.
<P>
	However, since then, the minister has been avoiding me and any 
opportunity to meet with me in order to settle the issue. I can tell 
you this was a prelude to the harmful effects of the Liberal 
government's reform.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	People were afraid, and rightly so, that their employment centre 
would become a mere booth, which would have forced them to 
drive over 100 kilometres to get person to person services; you can 
imagine their reaction now that the reform is truly coming to light.
<P>
	Before dealing with manpower development, I would like to 
warn people against the series of measures that, for the most part, 
are to come into force on Canada Day, the 1st of July. It is already a 
sad day, the government chose the date well. The Axworthy reform 
will hit those most in need hardest-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I can 
understand that it is a slight oversight, but we must always refer to 
our colleagues either by their riding's name or the name of their 
department, not by their family name. I would simply ask the hon. 
member for Lotbinière to abide by that rule.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. An impact study by the 
federal government demonstrates that people whose income is 
under $25,000 will be those hardest hit. This shift in policy by a 
supposedly Liberal government follows the lead of the Ontario and 
Alberta governments. It is hard to come to grips with the fact that 
the people opposite are not Conservatives.
<P>
	The government resorts to policies that smack of the Reaganism 
of the 1980s, and are still being advocated by the American right 
wing. Apparently, some Canadians have been contaminated.
<P>
	It is an understatement to say that the most disadvantaged among 
us will be affected. Women, young people, and part time workers 
will be subjected to a treatment that is far from benign. Considering 
that 1.5 million part time workers are women, that women make up 
70 per cent of the part time working force, that one third of them 
would prefer to work full time, that 40 per cent of part time workers 
are under 24, you can tell which groups the Liberals are targeting. 
Eligibility criteria will drive them onto welfare.
<P>
	The qualifying period will be increased from 12 to 28 fifteen 
hour weeks, or from 180 to 420 hours. Part time workers working 
from 15 to 35 hours a week will be hardest hit. This new eligibility 
criterion will impact most  on women, young people and new UI 
claimants, that is those asking for assistance for the first time.
<P>
	These people will have to work 26 thirty-five hour weeks, or 910 
hours. In fact, eligibility requirements will triple for those who are 
filing their first application. As I said, this will greatly impact on 
women and young people, whether at the end of their schooling or 
when they return to the job market after a long absence.
<P>
	Moreover, while the government is trying to make us believe it is 
ready to withdraw from any direct commitment in manpower 
training, it is in fact ignoring the consensus reached in Quebec 
about the transfer of federal resources and powers.
<P>
	The minister and his leader claim they are withdrawing from 
manpower training, but in fact they are once again suggesting what 
the then Quebec premier, Daniel Johnson, a Liberal, had described 
as a bargain agreement back in 1994. Under the bill introduced last 
Friday, if there is no agreement with a province, the money 
invested in training could be given directly to individuals.
<P>
	How can Quebec adopt an efficient manpower policy- which is 
what everybody wants, even the National Assembly, unions and 
employers-when Ottawa could go over its head and get away with 
it?In the previous legislation, the minister did not have the power to 
make agreements with one province or a group of provinces. From 
now on, it will deal with anybody it chooses. Provinces will be 
considered in the same way as municipalities or local 
organizations. Previously, under the national legislation on 
training, the minister had to consult with provinces before 
launching a program in this area of jurisdiction. Now, no limit is 
placed on federal actions. The sky is the limit.
<P>
	If we look at the way the federal government does things, it 
seems highly improbable that it will eliminate overlap and 
duplication in the area of manpower training. The 1994 offer 
provided for the withdrawal of the federal government with 
financial compensation.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Under the Training Loans and Grants Program, Ottawa will 
bypass the Government of Quebec by giving directly to the 
unemployed funds that used to be transferred to the provinces. 
André Bourbeau, the Quebec employment minister in 1991, has 
condemned this tactic, declaring that what was unacceptable was 
that this approach was a total improvisation despite the fact that 
more than ever before government actions regarding manpower 
training must be planned and based on priorities.
<P>
	Two years earlier, the Forum for employment had been a 
decisive step in the claims of Quebec regarding the transfer of 
responsibilities in manpower training.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17486"> 17486 </A></B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, it was at that time that partners in the Quebec 
labour market, namely unions, employers and the government, 
agreed to ask that Ottawa hand over all of the responsibilities 
regarding manpower training.
<P>
	No later that last week, the National Assembly of Quebec 
unanimously passed a resolution asking for the withdrawal of the 
federal government and repatriation of funds invested by Ottawa in 
manpower training.
<P>
	Yet, both governments agree that changes are needed to 
manpower training programs. Minister Axworthy did declare, on 
page 30 of his discussion paper on the social program reform, the 
following, and I quote: ``However, the system now is too 
hit-or-miss. That's why the results have been inadequate-There 
are too many mismatched programs, with inconsistent rules and too 
much red tape-Programs offered by different levels of 
government are often not coordinated. In short, the system must 
change.''
<P>
	In fact, the control that the federal wants to keep is only a 
pretext. Ottawa wants to use the $5 billion UI fund surplus to meet 
its deficit reduction targets. This clearly means misappropriating 
premiums paid by employees and employers, nothing more and 
nothing less.
<P>
	Last Friday, the Conseil du patronat du Québec, whose members 
are definitely not sovereignists, asked Ottawa to leave manpower 
training to Quebec. So, if one considers what has been happening in 
the past few years, one realizes that men and women from all 
parties, of all political stripes, are demanding control over 
manpower training. I say it once again, I believe that Quebec or the 
Yukon, or any Canadian province, is in a better position to really 
know what is needed.
<P>
	So, I wish that one day the federal government, as well as the 
hon. members opposite, will understand that not only manpower 
training, but also all related areas should come under Quebec 
jurisdiction. Money should not be given directly to the 
unemployed, but, for the sake of a consistent policy, we should be 
given all necessary tools and levers. When I say tool chest, of 
course I mean all the tools we have inside it as well. Not just the 
box, but the contents, are needed for the thing to really work. Like 
the tools in their chest, people too need to find a fit within a 
province, whatever the province.
<P>
	Whether that province is Quebec or one of the maritime or 
western provinces, I think we are all grown up enough to do our 
homework on our own. Only this past week the Conseil du patronat 
du Québec submitted a document, the stated purpose of which was 
to prove that federalism can work very well with decentralized 
manpower training. I am not worried in the least; over time the 
federal government will learn, and our friends across the way will 
realize that there is a place for everyone. Let us give to each his 
due. Then those with jobs, those without jobs, everybody will be 
happy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand today to oppose Bill C-111 because I see this as the 
government playing political football with the UI system.
<P>
	I had the opportunity recently of doing a householder 
questionnaire in my riding with regard to UI. Out of 1,110 replies, 
608 said the government should get out of UI and turn the entire 
program over to joint management, as it is already being funded by 
employers and employees.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I have to go along with that when I look at the cost of 
administering the unemployment act today: $1.2 billion taken right 
off the backs of the working people. It is too unmanageable.
<P>
	If there are concerns in terms of the unemployment insurance 
program, it should be left up to the people who are contributing 
directly to it, the workers and the employers, not the government. 
This government, along with the other governments, has done 
absolutely nothing with regard to correcting unemployment.
<P>
	Out of that survey, 436 or 39 per cent said to tighten up and 
streamline the existing programs; 675 said to give employers and 
employees greater say in how it is run; 633 said to have the same 
qualifying period across Canada and forget all these differences; 
628 said to shorten the period people can collect; 608 said to 
establish a separate fund for fishermen outside of the UI program; 
569 said there should be a longer qualifying period but only 369 or 
33 per cent out of 1,110 said to lower the amounts people can 
collect.
<P>
	From this survey there seems to be a widespread awareness with 
regard to seasonal workers. In my constituency there are a number 
of seasonal workers in agriculture, tourism and forestry. These are 
the three biggest areas in my constituency. These are the three 
biggest contributors to the UI program. They see nothing here that 
would do anything to help that situation in order to collect.
<P>
	Families are hard pressed in Canada today. We look at what is 
going on. We wonder what has really happened here. We have 
forced both parents out into the work world in order to pay rising 
taxes. We have lost the total concept of family unity because of 
government policies.
<P>
	I regard this tax grab by the government as just another policy, 
another penalty to put on the working people, another way to keep 
the government satisfied with the way it lives and not the way the 
working people of Canada have to live.
<P>
	Why are so many people unemployed? What has the government 
been doing for two years? This is the question out there. We can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17487"> 17487 </A></B>
<P>
talk to educated people coming out of our universities. They are the 
people  looking for work. What has the government done? Its fancy 
spin doctors put in all kinds of things they have done, this and that, 
but the bottom line is the unemployment level is still there and the 
people on welfare are still there.
<P>
	There is a mine waiting to come into production in northern B.C. 
It is called Kemess. There has been a large amount of money spent 
on the exploration work of this mine. There are a lot of people 
waiting, a lot of jobs waiting. They went through the whole 
scenario, through the provincial jurisdictions. They went to every 
office they had to go to.
<P>
	The province passed the environmental part of it. It passed 
everything. It signed off. It told these people to go ahead. Now 
comes the federal government. Here comes this caring, sharing, 
worrying federal government. It says: ``We checked this lake out 
and there are nine pair of bull trout and so this mine cannot go 
ahead''. Five hundred jobs this caring, sharing government has put 
on hold; $350 million. It means nothing to the people in the House 
sitting over there. Do we really have much faith in any program 
regarding unemployment which the government can bring in? I 
think not.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Where has industry gone? What has happened to our jobs? We 
spend too much. The government spends too much so it has to raise 
taxes. When we raise taxes we drive industry out. When we drive 
industry out we have high unemployment.
<P>
	We listened to the government. It made promises in its beautiful 
fancy red book. It was presented on a platter for the people to look 
at so they could judge the government. This was before the 
election. It mentioned the GST. The GST has hit employers 
something fierce. They spend a lot of their time after hours trying 
to collect taxes for the government while not getting paid for it.
<P>
	They have no more holidays like they used to have. Again it 
takes away one or both from the family so the government can feed 
off the taxpayer. The government promised it was to get rid of the 
GST. Liberals stood on the platforms all across the country. They 
swore to the people out there because they wanted their votes. They 
said the GST will be gone within two years. If I remember correctly 
the Deputy Prime Minister offered to resign; another unkept 
promise and the GST is still there.
<P>
	The big fear now is maybe the Liberals will try to introduce 
something else twice as expensive. They say they will change the 
name: UI to EI, unemployment insurance to employment 
insurance. I ask the hon. members on the other side, what is the cost 
to the taxpayer of the government's changing a lousy name in order 
to introduce this?
<P>
	Why could you not still call it unemployment insurance and 
make your changes, because one of you wanted to get a little star on 
a book beside your name? That will cost us another million dollars 
or so. You think people out there are stupid. They are not stupid. 
They know exactly what you are doing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt any 
member at any time but I ask members for their co-operation to 
direct all their interventions through the Chair and not directly 
across the floor at one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask members on the other side if 
they really think the people out there, the taxpayers, the working 
people, the people who have to give up their home lives in order to 
support the government, do not know what is going on. I think they 
know full well what is going on. The government will have to 
answer to them in a few years, unfortunately. In Canada that is what 
it takes, years and years of trial and error.
<P>
	Here is another example of government regulations. The cost of 
logging on the British Columbia coast has gone from $67 per cubic 
metre in 1992 to over $100 per cubic metre today. Does 
government, federal and provincial-we might as well throw it in 
because it is one and the same-forget these people have to be 
competitive in the world market in order to sell their product? I 
think it does. When jobs shut down, when companies shut down we 
have unemployment.
<P>
	It is nice to sit here and talk about how concerned we are for the 
Canadian people as we chase their jobs out through regulations, 
through overtaxation. We can sit here and pat ourselves on the back 
and say what a wonderful country we have. It really makes one 
wonder what a wonderful country we have.
<P>
	We have a government that does not know how to live within its 
means. It can only raise taxes in order to survive. It says ``this is a 
big deal, we are cutting here. The employee will not have to pay as 
much''. It forgets it jacked the prices up for two years running. It 
jacks them up 7 cents and cuts back 5 cents. It is a five-year 
increase no matter how one looks at it. However, the government 
thinks we will overlook it because of the 5-cent reduction. People 
have a long memory and the government will have to answer to 
them at the next election.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a member of Parliament from Atlantic Canada, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the motion to refer Bill C-111 to the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
	While the proposals to reform the UI system contained in this 
bill will impact on all parts of Canada, it is widely recognized that 
the new system will have a significant impact in the Atlantic 
provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17488"> 17488 </A></B>
<P>
	By referring the bill to the standing committee, members of the 
House and many other concerned Canadians will have a full 
opportunity to review and discuss the legislation. For my part, I 
believe it is important that the special needs of Atlantic Canada 
be considered and understood and that the capacity of the 
measures presented in the bill to meet these special needs be 
understood. The standing committee will offer the appropriate 
forum to do that.
<P>
	I am convinced that as Canadians better understand the new 
approaches being presented and the special employment generating 
measures contained in the bill, they will recognize that there are 
substantial advantages to be gained from this legislation, both 
individually and collectively, for our region. At the same time, the 
committee offers an opportunity to bring all our unique perspective 
to this debate to make sure that these changes look after the 
interests of Atlantic Canada and Atlantic Canadian workers.
<P>
	In moving the new employment insurance act from the House to 
the standing committee, and in considering how we can best serve 
the needs of Canadians, there are a number of points that should be 
kept in mind by our colleagues in the House, by the members of the 
committee and by all concerned Canadians affected by this 
legislation.
<P>
	To begin with, we should recognize the important role the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has had in developing 
this comprehensive new program. In particular, he should be 
congratulated for having already given Atlantic Canadians his full 
attention in these matters. He has taken the time to meet with us in 
the Atlantic Canada caucus. He has met with the provincial 
premiers. He has met with business and labour leaders from 
Atlantic Canada. He has met with many others who have asked to 
have their special needs considered.
<P>
	There has been no shortage of consultation between Atlantic 
Canadians and the minister and his officials as they grappled with 
this very complex situation. I can only say that the minister's office 
has replaced my wife's phone number on my speed dial as the first 
call that I make for the last three weeks.
<P>
	The minister has consistently shown a personal willingness to 
consider various and often directly conflicting points of view with 
an open mind and has demonstrated a capacity to understand and 
integrate them. It is my personal impression that he has shown a 
great deal of integrity in dealing with these issues and that he 
realizes there is a special concern for unemployed people in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I would like to identify some of the very specific benefits of the 
new EI bill. First, the new bill will give broader coverage. 
According to the department as many as 500,000 more people will 
have access to employment insurance than had access to 
unemployment insurance. That is a huge improvement that comes 
as a result of the  shift from weeks of work to hours of work as the 
measure to establish eligibility for benefits.
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians have a short season where people can find 
large numbers of hours of work. Therefore, it is very important that 
all of those hours receive credit when establishing eligibility for 
benefits. By using hours rather than weeks, all of those hours will 
count in establishing the minimum requirement for benefits and 
also in establishing the duration of benefits. That is a big 
improvement.
<P>
	We also have low income protection so that those people who, 
through no fault of their own, cannot find enough work in the 
course of a year to establish an income that would sustain a family 
can get relief. This new legislation on the threshold of the child tax 
credit offers the opportunity for up to 80 per cent in replacement 
income which is another significant improvement over the 
unemployment insurance program of the past.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Also, there is going to be a clawback on the high income side. I 
am very supportive of this. Employment insurance is designed to 
meet two needs, to serve two purposes. First, if one loses a job, 
employment insurance is designed to give income while one seeks 
employment. A second function is performed by employment 
insurance. It sustains a workforce in many communities-and 
many of them are in Atlantic Canada-where there is not sufficient 
income through employment to keep a family year round. Through 
the employment insurance program incomes have been 
supplemented to keep that labour force in place and keep those 
communities alive.
<P>
	The argument for income supplements cannot be applied to high 
incomes. It does not serve that function. Therefore I am very 
supportive of a graduated clawback and I am pleased to see it in the 
new bill.
<P>
	The employment benefits that are unrelated to the income 
benefits of which there will be five replacing 39 will be locally 
administered. The department in Ottawa will not be deciding on a 
whole series of programs, budgeting for those programs and then 
sending the package, in my case, to the local office in Fredericton. 
Rather it will be determined what are the criteria for those five 
programs and the local office can decide which of those five 
programs makes the most sense in my community and in my 
region. That is a big improvement. It will mean a lot more 
flexibility for the local office.
<P>
	Another important point is that by distinguishing between 
eligibility for income benefits and eligibility for employment 
related benefits, many people who were ineligible for benefits in 
the past will be eligible if they have been on employment insurance 
over the last three years or the last five years in the case of 
maternity benefits. This is a big improvement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17489"> 17489 </A></B>
<P>
	In the past people would exhaust their benefits while they were 
in a training program, or in some other kind of a program and 
they would no longer be eligible. Now they will be eligible for 
the duration of that program.
<P>
	In many cases the workers exhaust their benefits before their 
seasonal jobs start again. If someone is working in a park, in the 
woods or in a fish plant and draws a certain duration of benefits 
those benefits are exhausted but the fish plant does not open again 
for three weeks, four weeks and in some case ten weeks. Those 
people will now be eligible for the employment benefits in the 
package. They will have the opportunity to receive other kinds of 
programs that will allow them to supplement their incomes and 
therefore not have to go on income assistance.
<P>
	Probably most important is that all members will have the 
opportunity to speak to additional improvements to this legislation. 
That is why I believe it is going to committee before second 
reading, so we can express to the committee the needs of Atlantic 
Canadians. I would like to speak specifically to the question of 
consecutive weeks as the method by which the rate of benefit is 
calculated.
<P>
	I would make the suggestion to the committee when the bill gets 
there that all the weeks where work is involved should be 
considered when establishing the rate or the income level against 
which the benefit should apply. It is very important to recognize 
that in Atlantic Canada very often work comes in pieces. There are 
spaces in between those pieces of work. People could work in the 
spring, have the summer off and then work again in the fall. All of 
that work should be considered. Otherwise many people will be 
paying premiums on employment that will not be factored in when 
calculating income to establish benefits. That is very important. I 
hope the committee will be sensitive to this issue. I understand the 
minister made reference to it when introducing the bill. I see that as 
a good sign. I hope the committee will take it under consideration 
and make that improvement in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take part today in the debate on the second reading of Bill C-111, 
an act respecting unemployment insurance in Canada. I should 
point out immediately that I and the rest of the Bloc will be voting 
against this bill, which is underhanded, unfair, regressive, 
anti-social, anti-worker and above all anti-unemployed.
<P>
	This new program will be called employment insurance instead 
of unemployment insurance. It could just as well be called poverty 
insurance, or destitution insurance. The government has finally 
tabled its unemployment insurance reform, which it kept hidden 
until after the Quebec referendum on October 30.
<P>
	Basically, as a result of this bill, eligibility criteria will be much 
stricter and frequent users will be severely penalized. The first
<P>
victims of these cutbacks will be young people, women, seasonal 
workers and immigrants. Program cuts will total two billion dollars 
annually, including $640 million in Quebec.
<P>
	The bill, which is to come into force on July 1, 1996, is worse 
than was implied in the leaks that appeared in the media. It is 
particularly hard on part time workers, in other words, individuals 
who work fewer than 35 hours per week. These wage earners will 
now have to work from 420 to 700 hours to be entitled to benefits 
or 910 hours for first-time recipients. I was a referee with the 
Unemployment Insurance Commission for eight years, from 1984 
to 1992, and people kept telling me-benefit recipients, the unions 
and counsel-that the Unemployment Insurance should be 
improved, not dismantled as the Liberal government is doing 
today.
<P>
	As a result of this bill, the number of people eligible for benefits 
will be considerably reduced. Consequently, the number of people 
on welfare will continue to rise over the years to come. In fact, 
stricter eligibility criteria result in a transfer from unemployment 
insurance to welfare. In Quebec, more than 40 per cent of new 
welfare recipients have a connection with unemployment 
insurance. They are on welfare because they are not eligible for 
unemployment insurance or because they have already exhausted 
their benefits.
<P>
	The maximum duration of benefits will be reduced from 50 to 45 
weeks. This measure will further accelerate the shift from 
unemployment insurance to welfare. I repeat, the federal 
government is offloading its responsibilities on the provinces. And 
I may add that since this Liberal government was elected on 
October 25, 1993, the number of welfare recipients in Quebec has 
increased by nearly 50,000, which means more than 800,000 
altogether.
<P>
	In my own riding, Bourassa in Montreal North, one third of the 
population is either on welfare or on unemployment insurance. 
Nearly 70 per cent of part time workers, in other words, 1.5 
million, are women. I may point out that one woman out of three 
who works part time would rather work full time. Almost 40 per 
cent of part time workers are under 24.
<P>
	As we might expect, the reaction of the union movement was 
quick, critical and utterly opposed to this bill.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The CSN and the FTQ, the two largest union federations in 
Quebec, launched a strong appeal to union members and the public 
to mobilize against the social upheaval currently taking place in 
Canada.
<P>
	They criticized the bill in the following terms: ``It is no reform, 
it is the blatant destruction of the thin net of this social protection 
plan. The situation is now very  clear. Workers in Quebec can 
expect nothing more from the federal government, which has axed 
one of the main tools for distributing wealth in Canada. Ottawa is 
now making those in the most precarious situation, women and 
young people, bear the burden of deficit reduction. The worst and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17490"> 17490 </A></B>
<P>
most unacceptable part of this whole destruction operation is that it 
will not resolve Canada's financial problems. Enough is enough''.
<P>
	The two federations are demanding Ottawa return to Quebec its 
share of the unemployment insurance fund and they are asking 
Quebec to take every possible measure to recover all of its 
jurisdiction in the area of unemployment insurance. They point out 
that, since the federal government's withdrawal in 1990, the 
unemployment insurance fund has been financed solely by the 
contributions of workers and employers.
<P>
	The FTQ and the CSN have decided to organize resistance and a 
strong and solid fight against this reform together with community 
and popular groups and in co-ordination with the union movement 
in Canada.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to salute the thousands of workers in 
London, Ontario who are striking today to protest against the cuts 
proposed by the Harris government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	According to the CLC, unemployment insurance changes 
promote a low wage economy. Executive vice-president Nancy 
Riche said: ``The federal Liberals are bent on dismantling and 
destroying our unemployment insurance program and they do not 
care what happens to thousands and thousands of unemployed 
Canadians''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This last series of cuts will reduce UI benefits by $2 billion, in 
addition to the $5 billion already chopped by the federal 
government.
<P>
	The vice-president of the CLC went on to say:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``This legislation will take money from unemployed workers and 
put it directly into the pockets of business. It is an obvious response 
to business demands for lower unemployment insurance 
premiums''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The percentage of unemployed Canadians receiving UI benefits 
has fallen dramatically over the past five years. In 1990, 87 per cent 
of unemployed workers were eligible to benefit. In 1993, after the 
changes made by Mr. Mulroney's Tory government, this 
percentage was 64 per cent. When the Liberal Party came to office, 
this percentage dropped again to 50 per cent. With this reform, the 
CLC estimates that two thirds of the unemployed could be deprived 
of their right to collect UI benefits.
<P>
	It must be noted that the UI program is fully self-financed. The 
federal government does not fund this program in any way. 
Furthermore, the UI fund runs very large annual surpluses. The 
accumulated surplus will reach $7 billion to $8 billion by the end of 
the next fiscal year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nancy Riche stated: ``This legislation is just a way of robbing 
Canadians of their unemployment benefits. The finance minister 
wants to meet his deficit target and he wants to do it on the backs of 
the unemployed. It is all quite dishonest and very, very heartless''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For all these reasons, I am opposed to this bill and will vote in 
favour of the motion tabled by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has tabled two bills amending the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. It is trying to make it better, trying to improve it to 
make it something that holds hope for all Canadians. The 
government is trying to show Canadians that it is being 
responsible.
<P>
	In my role as an opposition member and as an individual who 
has employed a lot of people and has seen how the unemployment 
insurance system works, I am sorry to report that upon evaluation 
of all the items, clauses and elements in the bill, basically the 
minister of human resources has taken a 12 or 15-year old idea, 
brought it to the surface and finally has his way. Instead of making 
it simple, he has proceeded to make it even more complicated, 
more confusing and more convoluted than the Income Tax Act. He 
has done nothing to make it sound and appear in language that 
people can understand. He had a choice between using the KISS 
method in accounting, keep it simple stupid, as opposed to what he 
has done.
<P>
	I have a number of concerns about this. The minister had the 
opportunity to make unemployment insurance truly a program for 
which it was designed: an insurance program against the time when 
someone is unemployed. The payments should be equal between 
employer and employee. I do not know why the minister has 
allowed the practice to continue where an employer has to pay 
almost 1.4 times that of an employee. This is what kills jobs. This 
is why payroll taxes are called job killers. The minister has not 
listened to this.
<P>
	If this were a true insurance program, there would be no need for 
the minister to use moneys from UI for five development tools; 
$800 million for targeted wage subsidies; targeted earnings 
supplements; self-employment; job creation partnerships; skills 
loans and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17491"> 17491 </A></B>
<P>
grants. This is nothing more and nothing less than a  vote getting 
method of spending money. It is old style politics. It reeks of 
self-service, reeks of missing the point.
<P>
	The money should go to reduce UI payments for both employer 
and employee instead of being used for these programs. Then if we 
want job training programs or to subsidize businesses to hire 
people, it should be a separate envelope and spending should be 
made visible instead of invisible.
<P>
	We are giving the human resources development minister$19 billion to play with when all we are spending on UI benefits is 
$11 billion. All the other programs amount to approximately$3.1 billion and there is still a slush fund of about $5 billion left 
over. Why?
<P>
	We could lower taxes, offer tax relief to the Canadian public 
through relief of payroll taxes. Employers and employees would be 
happy with that. But no, the minister wants to be king. The minister 
wants to hold out a carrot on a stick to say that he is going to help 
all the unemployed people.
<P>
	I do not understand why there are different rates of payment 
across the country for people who collect benefits. Why did he not 
address that problem? In an area of high unemployment, 16 per 
cent or higher, why do people get more for staying there than if 
they moved to an area where there is low unemployment of 6 per 
cent or less, and get less money for staying there? People are not 
being asked to look for a job. They are being paid to stay put and 
are paid more money to stay put than to go and look for a new job. 
That does not solve the problem. It adds to it, just like the Minister 
of Finance keeps adding to our debt by setting targets which add to 
the problem instead of solving it.
<P>
	The name change is serious. Changing the name from the 
unemployment insurance program to employment insurance 
program is really serious. What does that mean to the Canadian 
taxpayer? People are going to say that they paid into it and when 
they are unemployed they expect to get their money from 
unemployment insurance. Fine, they get it. Some people have 
abused the system and we are trying to weed them out.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	If the name is changed to employment insurance people are 
going to think: ``I am paying money into a program which will 
guarantee me a job if I lose my job''. That is what employment 
means. The minister is toying with people's minds. He is toying 
with a name change which will have a serious impact. The people 
will be disappointed if they do not get what they want. It is 
ridiculous. Once again it is all about politics.
<P>
	Why not address the problem and solve it? Let us use the 
unemployment insurance program as such. We should not use it for 
other things which will increase the costs and allow the minister to 
waste taxpayers' money. It should be used for the purposes for 
which it was  intended: strictly for payment when people are 
unemployed.
<P>
	Supposedly somewhere along the line the minister tested a trial 
balloon on a voucher system. If the provincial governments do not 
offer training the way an unemployed individual would like it, if 
they want to be retrained, if they want to receive an income 
supplement, if they want to become self-employed, if they want a 
loan or if they want to create a partnership, they can go to the 
federal government with the voucher and it will give the individual 
what they want. Does that not add to the problem? Is that not 
overlap and duplication of services? Is that not what we are trying 
to avoid with decentralization?
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised the province of Quebec that he 
would transfer manpower training to it. With this bill he has not let 
go of the strings. He has not let Quebec take care of manpower 
training. With this bill he is still involved in job training. He is still 
looking after the training of the people of Quebec. That does not 
solve the problem. Once again it is adding to the problem. I do not 
see the difference between job training and manpower training. 
C'est la même chose, n'est-ce pas?
<P>
	Where would we go? What would the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre do if he happened to be lucky enough to have the job of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development a couple of years from 
now? With all due respect to our current critic, the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast who is looking forward to that job, I do not want 
it. However, if I had the job the first thing I would do would be to 
make it a true insurance program. I would establish matching funds 
for employers and employees, not accelerate the payments made by 
employers. That might create tax relief which might enable 
companies to hire more people.
<P>
	The second thing I would do would be to have everyone pay the 
same rate, qualify the same way and receive the same amount of 
money wherever they are. I realize there are some differences. 
Perhaps in tougher areas they might be allowed an additional week 
of benefits, but that would be it. Everyone would receive the same 
benefits. That would make people move around the country to find 
jobs, rather than staying put, staying cushy and saying thank you 
very much.
<P>
	I would also change job training. I would not have human 
resources development looking after job training. The hon. 
member for Calgary Centre would have the Minister of Industry 
look after job training, if in fact we wanted to offer job training to 
people and if in fact the industry was reluctant to provide 
opportunities for people to learn, to obtain jobs and to become 
skilled.
<P>
	The government should get out of the business of being in 
business. It should lower government spending to the point where it 
is only collecting money to do the things which Canadians want. 
This is not a program which Canadians want; this is a program 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17492"> 17492 </A></B>
<P>
which the  human resources development minister and his 
bureaucrats want.
<P>
	We are collecting $5 billion more than we need. It might be more 
than $5 billion because there are other programs we could abolish. 
We might be collecting $6 billion or $7 billion more than we need. 
That is why our taxes are so high.
<P>
	It used to be that the bureaucrats in unemployment insurance 
who worked in the towns and cities across the land helped the 
people who were unemployed. They would look in the papers, they 
would get on the phone and they would find employment 
opportunities. There was a three-strike rule, which is something the 
minister has not addressed.
<P>
	For example, a plumber is out of work and cannot get a job. He 
collects unemployment insurance. The agency in the old days when 
it wanted to help, would say: ``We cannot get you a job in your 
trade right now, but there is an opportunity over here. Would you 
like to learn something new? Would you like to try something 
else?'' The plumber would reply: ``No. I want a plumber's job''. 
The second time it was: ``We have something over here working in 
a school. If you are on the spot and the pipe bursts you might be 
lucky''. The reply was: ``No, I don't want that''. The third job they 
offered was paying relatively the same amount of money he was 
making or something close to it. Even if it was not close to it, they 
told him to take the job because he is the available person who has 
some skills they need.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
every year, I would like to invite all my colleagues to attend the 
Voyageur Festival in St. Boniface next February. This festival 
celebrates the history, traditions and culture of the French and 
Metis people.
<P>
	We offer an impressive line-up of activities such as exhibitions, 
dancing, singing, music and theatre, all in French. Thousands of 
people from all over the world come to the festival to witness this 
joie de vivre. This year, the Voyageur Festival was voted one of the 
best 100 tourist destinations by the American Bus Association. It is 
the second time that the largest winterfest in western Canada has 
received this honour. The Voyageur Festival  was also awarded 
three prizes by the international association of festivals and events.
<P>
	I therefore invite you, Mr. Speaker and all my colleagues, to be 
our guests at this festival showcasing the tenacity and richness of 
the French and Metis cultures.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the steam 
roller of cuts imposed by the federal Liberal government, that 
posed not so long ago as the great defender of culture, is on the 
move. The first target is unquestionably the CBC and Radio 
Canada International.
<P>
	Over the weekend, more than 600 layoffs were confirmed at the 
CBC. These layoffs are to be distributed equally between the 
French and the English networks, which is unfair.
<P>
	Last week, the Prime Minister said that there was no Quebec 
culture. So why protect it then? That seems to be the reaction of 
CBC senior management, even though the French network has 
demonstrated that it is more efficient, popular and costs less than 
its English sister network.
<P>
	And what about Radio Canada International, which they are 
about to wipe off the face of the earth without even waiting for the 
Juneau report?
<P>
	These cuts will have a devastating impact on the people and 
artists of Quebec and Canada.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
justice minister stood in the House when Reformers demanded 
recognition for victims of crime and told all how he listened to 
victims groups, police associations and chiefs of police. He has 
heard from every victims group in Canada, from police officers, 
police associations and chiefs of police that section 745 of the 
Criminal Code reducing parole eligibility for murderers should be 
repealed.
<P>
	Angry Canadians have told me this justice minister rams through 
legislation that divides Canadians, but when it comes to legislation 
that would unite Canadians like repealing section 745 he does 
nothing.
<P>
	A private member's bill is languishing in committee because the 
justice minister does not have the courage to follow the wishes of 
every victims group, police and the vast majority of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17493"> 17493 </A></B>
<P>
	The justice minister will prorogue the bill that will repeal 
section 745. He will allow first degree murderers a statute of 
limitations on their heinous crimes. He will continue to follow the 
wishes of a few instead of the  many and will continue to divide 
Canadians instead of unite them.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, 
Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Food and Agriculture Organization, an 
agency of the United Nations, released a shocking report on the 
implications of the economic sanctions against Iraq.
<P>
	In the four years since the Persian Gulf war more than 560,000 
Iraqi children have died as a direct result of the sanctions. Present 
day suffering is intolerable; food prices are extremely high; and the 
water and sanitation systems have rapidly deteriorated.
<P>
	Most important, hospitals are functioning at 40 per cent capacity 
and many serious operations are being performed without the 
proper medical supplies. The bottom line is that literally thousands 
of innocent children are dying every day.
<P>
	In the true spirit of the upcoming holiday season I call upon the 
government to support the elimination of the UN embargo and 
support the giving of humanitarian aid and medical supplies to the 
people of Iraq.

the commitment by the minister of defence of the Canadian Armed 
Forces to the new international force that is to maintain the just 
concluded truce between the three warring parties in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina remains within the parameters of the United 
Nations charter.
<P>
	NATO is a regional security organization within chapter VIII of 
the charter. Its military commanders and political governors are 
thereby placed under the aegis of chapter VI of the charter on 
peacekeeping and on international law under the charter, including 
the contemporary laws of war.

terrible tragedy of the Armenian earthquake.
<P>
	On December 7, 1988 nature unleashed its fury and hundreds of 
thousands of lives were changed forever by this tragic event. The 
magnitude of this natural disaster is almost unimaginable. The 
death toll has never been firmly established, but estimates range 
upward of 100,000 deaths and over 500,000 additional people 
injured.
<P>
	In response to the tragedy the Government of Canada provided 
over $6 million in aid to Armenia through the Red Cross and 
Canadians from all regions of our nation donated an additional $2.5 
million in humanitarian relief.
<P>
	When I was in Armenia last year I was told again and again that 
the people of Armenia are forever grateful to Canada and 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week 
thousands of Canadians from all walks of life gathered in Hull for a 
sacred assembly. We brought together spiritual leaders of many 
faiths, aboriginal leaders from coast to coast, youth, elders, 
political leaders, as well as guests and visitors from South Africa, 
Brazil, the United States and Central America.
<P>
	I am happy to tell the House that the assembly was a success. We 
came together in the spirit of faith and reconciliation and agreed on 
a new vision for Canada as a whole. We have laid the groundwork 
for reconciliation and healing in this land.
<P>
	I thank members of the House who joined us in Hull last week, 
especially the member for Saint-Jean who represented the official 
opposition, the hon. minister of Indian affairs and the hon. Prime 
Minister. They all made valuable contributions. I hope they will 
continue to work with us as the process of healing and 
reconciliation continues for all Canadians. God bless.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister's bill to give five regions of Canada a right of veto on any 
eventual constitutional amendment is worse than the amending 
formula contained in the Constitution imposed on us in 1982.
<P>
	In less than two weeks, the Liberal government will have 
imposed distinct society on Quebec against the will of the Quebec 
National Assembly and given a veto to two provinces that do not 
want it or would prefer something else.
<P>
	The amending formula for the Constitution that requires the 
consent of seven provinces representing 50 per cent of the 
Canadian population was already considered particularly coercive. 
Now consent will be required from seven provinces representing 92 
per cent of the population.
<P>
	As Jean Dion writes in today's <I>Le Devoir</I>, we can just imagine 
some smart alecs inferring that the consent of 14 provinces 
representing 142 per cent of the population will be required in the 
future.

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian military performed a miraculous rescue at 
sea recently when five air crew aboard an aging Sea King 
helicopter rescued 30 people from a sinking cargo vessel during a 
raging mid-Atlantic storm.
<P>
	Thirty times during that terrible storm, Master Corporal Rob 
Fisher was lowered on to the heaving deck of the bulk carrier 
<I>Mount Olympus</I>, epitomizing the best traditions of brave men in 
fearful conditions.
<P>
	Piloting that chopper was Captain Dan Burden, a 36-year old 
naval officer from Salmon Arm in my riding of 
Okanagan-Shuswap, where he attended elementary and high 
schools and where his proud parents, James and Norene Burden, 
still make their home.

Over Christmas he plans some <I>r</I> and <I>r</I> with his wife Catherine,

STORA Feldmill of Sweden will be carrying out a $650 million 
expansion of its pulp and paper facilities in Point Tupper in my 
riding of Cape Breton Highlands-Canso. The company made the 
announcement today.
<P>
	The investment in a new paper plant at this location will create 
800 construction jobs over the next two years. Just as important, 
the expansion will secure newsprint and paper production jobs over 
the long term in eastern Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The government, along with its provincial and municipal 
partners, has pursued the expansion vigorously. Once again we 
have proven that Nova Scotia can attract international investment.
<P>
	The location of the facility on the Strait of Canso on our east 
coast offers competitive transport costs to both the United States 
and Europe. The new facility is scheduled to be in operation early 
in 1998 and project planning has already started.

keeping international investment in Canada.

from Ottawa is being applauded throughout eastern Ontario.
<P>
	Besides providing hundreds of construction jobs, the new 
four-lane route will connect the nation's capital with the nation's 
busiest highway.
<P>
	Dozens of accidental deaths and injuries over the last few years 
have been attributed to a highway that is simply inadequate. 
Canadians and visitors alike can look forward to a modern, state of 
the art highway in and out of the nation's capital by the year 2000.

in a recent Ekos poll Canadians were asked what values they 
wanted their federal government to uphold. Responses were 
collated and presented in two groups. One of the top three values 
identified by Canadian elites was minimal government.
<P>
	What did the Canadian public say was their top three values? 
They were freedom, a clean environment and a healthy population. 
Minimal government was last on a list of 23 choices for Canadians.
<P>
	What does the Reform Party want? It wants to cut, to gut and to 
eviscerate the federal government. Canadians want a strong federal 
government with strong national standards. The Reform Party is 
not the party of the people as it says but a party of limited special 
interests, a party for the elite and not for the people.

capable of committing acts more despicable than those of the vilest 
man.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice to order without delay an inquiry by 
the Canadian Judicial Council. Unfortunately, the council rarely 
reprimands a federal judge. In fact, the whole disciplinary process 
concerning federal judges must be reviewed, and a detailed code of 
ethics must be implemented.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just over 
one week ago 1,000 Albertans attended a public rally in Edmonton 
and the people overwhelmingly rejected the notion of giving a veto 
to the separatist Quebec government and turned thumbs down on 
the open ended distinct society clause.
<P>
	However this top down government is bent on ramming these 
Quebec appeasements down Canadians' throats. The Liberals have 
the gall to invoke closure on the distinct society motion, once again 
trampling on the democratic process. This is 1989 all over again 
when the Mulroney Tories rammed the GST down our throats. Now 
look at the federal Tories.
<P>
	To the four Liberal MPs from Edmonton we say Canadians are 
tired of politicians lacking the backbone to represent them in 
Ottawa. When this mixed Liberal quartet votes on the veto and

Mr. Speaker, two announcements in the past week demonstrate that 
the government's approach to reducing the deficit protects the rich 
and punishes the poor.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development picked the 
pockets of unemployed Canadians to the tune of $1.9 billion, yet all 
the top banks in Canada have announced billion dollar profits for 
the last year. Clearly the federal government is forcing the burden 
of paying the huge debt, which it and the Conservatives have 
created, on the least affluent in Canada.
<P>
	The federal government provides absolutely no funding for the 
UI program and one wonders what moral authority it has to attempt 
to reduce the deficit with money contributed to the UI fund by 
ordinary Canadians. Ordinary Canadians are being forced to do 
more than corporate citizens to reduce the deficit. With obscenely 
high bank profits, the government is not taking any measures at all 
to ensure that they too are paying their fair share of the deficit.
<P>
	These two contrasts simply show how natural it is for the Liberal 
government to look after its corporate friends. Maybe some day we 
will have a government for the people, by the people.

	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor

yesterday, in Montreal. As you know, the primary objective of that

<P>
	Depicting Quebec's English-speaking and ethnic community 
members as ``enemies of the Quebec people'', the movement,

necessary to implement the distorted ideas expressed in its

<P>
	The values and the ideas of the Mouvement de libération

closer to the politics of the Reform and the Bloc Quebecois with the 
statement that he would like to see the end of Canada's 
multiculturalism policy.
<P>
	This statement by the Conservative leader suggests that he 
would be ready to dump all of the multicultural policies and the 
multicultural heritage of his party in order to snatch the votes of a 
few intolerant people from the Bloc and the Reform.
<P>
	At a time when the winds of intolerance blow across Canada, the 
Conservative member for Sherbrooke is giving in to an easy fix, 
and he too has started making political hay at the expense of the 
cultural communities.

	It is a pity to see that the political ambitions of the Conservative

multiculturalism, principles he defended tooth and claw when a

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	This morning during a recorded interview for CBC-TV, the 
Prime Minister said he would like to use the federal government's 
constitutional powers to maintain peace, order and good 
government to prevent another Quebec referendum if he judged it 
was based on a vague question.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the words of the Prime Minister that, 
on the very day he feigns recognition of the distinct society in a 
motion, he is announcing his intention to impose his wording on 
the next referendum question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, anyone respecting 
democracy respects the outcome of the referendum that has already 
been held in which Quebecers stated categorically that they do not 
wish to separate Quebec from Canada.
<P>
	The Prime Minister himself knows that the wish of the people of 
Quebec is not for a referendum but economic action. That is the 
area on which we will be focussing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister takes a very short view of 
history. We know that Newfoundland held more than one 
referendum before becoming part of Canada. In that case, it was all 
right, but in Quebec's case, the usual double standard applies.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister must be aware that the vast majority of 
Quebecers have massively rejected his so-called offers, are we to 
understand that the only way the Prime Minister thinks he can win 
the next referendum is by taking control of the process himself, 
thus ignoring the National Assembly?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this was not the first 
referendum. There was another referendum before that. The hon. 
member may want to talk about respect for democracy, but it was 
not the Prime Minister who said he would keep having referendums 
until he won. Respect for democracy is uppermost in the minds of 
the majority of Quebecers, who do not want a referendum. They 
want economic action, something the Leader of the Opposition 
admitted in his speech two weeks ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, respect for democracy means to recognize, in a 
democratic exercise, what people want, and if people change their 
minds, if
<P>
they make a democratic decision, that should be recognized. The 
Prime Minister is saying he will not recognize the democratic 
process. It is all right when he wins, but only then. Some 
democracy.
<P>
	I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister how the Prime Minister 
can reconcile the honeyed words he spoke to Quebecers before the 
referendum with the statement made this morning in which he 
denied the Quebec people the fundamental right to determine their 
own future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is really 
interested in respecting the will of Quebecers, let him come here 
tonight and vote with the government of Canada to enshrine 
recognition of the distinct society in this government, because in so 
doing, we will respect the desire of Quebecers for real change 
within Canada.

question is for the Minister of Justice. On Thursday, December 7, 
in sentencing Tracy Théberge, found guilty of second degree 
murder, Justice Jean Bienvenue of the Quebec Superior Court at 
Trois-Rivières made shocking remarks about the victims of the 
Holocaust and about women in general, who, according to him, are 
capable of reaching a level of baseness the vilest of men could not 
reach. This sort of petty and vile remark represents a grave 
dereliction of a judge's duty.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

	I have asked that a transcript of the judge's remarks be prepared. 
When I receive that transcript, which I expect will be in the next

seen the last of his top down constitutional change, but I was 
wrong.
<P>
	What the current Prime Minister has done is worse than anything 
Mulroney ever did. The Prime Minister scribbled down 
constitutional changes on the back of a napkin without consulting 
Canadians, without consulting the premiers, without even 
consulting his caucus. Now he has resorted to refusing debate in 
this place and shutting Canadians out of the process completely. 
Even Brian Mulroney was more of a democrat than this Prime 
Minister.

	Why is the government breaking its 1993 election promise in the 
red book of open government and greater public consultation?

to resolve the constitutional question she will come to the House 
today with her party and support the motion the government has put 
on the table which permits the Prime Minister to meet the promise 
he made to Quebecers and which will also provide the basis for a 
better Canada, something I hope she and her colleagues are actually 
looking for.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, distinct 
society status for the unity of the country takes more than a vote in 
this place. It takes the public will and support of the people from 
sea to sea.
<P>
	The phrase ``begin damage control'' seems to be the only advice 
coming out of the Prime Minister's office these days: a last minute 
veto thrown to B.C. as opposition to the Quebec package began to 
mount, and now a token town hall public relations exercise on CBC  
to try to breath life into a unity strategy that is dead on arrival. The 
Prime Minister is out of touch, out of control and out of ideas.
<P>
	If the government is truly serious about public consultation and 
if it really plans to listen to Canadians on CBC, will it abandon all 
attempts to ram this Quebec package through the House of 
Commons and submit it to a full debate before Parliament and 
Canadians right across the country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again we see how out 
of touch the Reform Party is. It believes a cross-country 
constitutional tour is what Canadians are looking for. Canadians 
have expressed in the province of Quebec, in the province of 
British Columbia, in the province of Alberta and across Canada 
that they want us to focus on getting Canadians back to work. That 
is the agenda of the government and that is the agenda we intend to 
pursue.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if that 
is its focus, why did it get us into this mess for the last two months? 
Why has it not talked about jobs?
<P>
	Nobody asked for this business to come through the House like 
this. What part of consultation does the Prime Minister not 
understand? It is not that difficult. Consultation is when you ask 
ordinary Canadians, business people, community leaders and 
politicians for their advice and listen to what they have to say; that 
is before the decision is made, not after, as the government is 
doing.
<P>
	Will the government take the advice of the Reform leader, step 
aside and listen to the national unity action plan developed by a 
reconfederation conference of premiers, business and community 
leaders and ordinary Canadians, not this stuffy place here that 
thinks it knows all the answers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party may hold 
the Parliament of Canada in contempt in calling it a stuffy place of 
people who do not know what is going on.
<P>
	If Reform members talked to two or three people in their 
constituencies they would discover it is almost unanimous that 
Canadians do not want a cross-country constitutional road show. 
Canadians want the Prime Minister to meet his commitment, 
deliver on his promises quickly and expeditiously, and develop a 
Canadian consensus on getting Canadians back to work.
<P>

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Last week, the Minister of Canadian Heritage did not indicate 
when he intended tabling legislation on copyright. However, last 
December 22-and I do mean last December 22-the industry and 
heritage ministers made a commitment to have the bill tabled in 
early 1995. The increasingly persistent rumour would have it that 
the Department of Industry and not of Canadian Heritage is holding 
up the tabling of the bill.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Industry tell us today whether he intends 
honouring the commitment he made with his colleague, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, and tabling the bill on copyright 
before the end of the present session?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously such a bill will be introduced as soon as possible.

<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the

bill is due to opposition from the Ontario Liberal caucus, which has 
been lobbied by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters in 
connection with related rights?
<P>

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister said today that he would consider disallowing a 
future Quebec referendum if the question was not honest. I quote: 
``I say that we have powers and we have to use the powers to make 
sure that the question would be fair to Quebecers and would be fair 
to the rest of the country''. He also said: ``The Constitution has a 
lot of powers to act under peace, order and good government''.
<P>
	I will put my question to the Minister of Justice. Is it the 
government's position that it could legally forbid the next 
referendum if it viewed the question as being dishonest? Is the 
government actively considering that as a policy option?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, the 
residual powers to the Canadian government under the peace, order 
and good government provision in the Constitution are 
considerable. They are there for the purpose of ensuring that a 
national government can act in the national interest on matters of 
fundamental importance.
<P>
	Let me simply say that the Prime Minister has simply observed, 
if I may say so, that the power is in the Constitution and can be 
invoked for the kind of proper purpose to which he referred.
<P>
	I should also add that the focus of the government is not so much 
on some future possible referendum. It is on ensuring that no such 
referendum is held because the people of Quebec see for 
themselves that their future is far better within a united Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should know that nobody thinks the Government of 
Canada is going to hold a referendum on this topic. It may be the 
Government of Quebec that will decide to hold a referendum on 
this topic.
<P>
	Would the government also consider a less draconian alternative 
which, if the government is not prepared to live with the question 
or with the result, would be for the federal government to simply 
not formally participate in a future referendum held on an unfair 
question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only say the Government of 
Canada is focusing on providing good government and fulfilling 
our commitments. As the Deputy Prime Minister emphasized 
today, we are focusing on our agenda of jobs and growth with the 
intention of ensuring that no future referendum will be held by any 
government in Canada because there will be no need to do so.

for Canada. Will the minister go back to the drawing board, lower 
his deficit target, cut spending more and offer Canadians what they 
want and what they so richly deserve: a hope for tax cuts before the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

<P>

highway 416 project? What else is the government doing or 
proposing to do to help the economic development of the national 
capital region?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is quite right. In light of the reductions in the size 
of the public service, the national capital region has taken a large 
share of the cost of reducing government costs.
<P>
	I am sure the member will also agree that public servants who 
are leaving the public service have been offered generous 
packages. As well there is the government's support under the 
industrial assistance strategy for the REDO effort to help with 
economic diversification in the region. Even more important is the 
announcement made last Friday on behalf of the Minister of 
Transport concerning the federal government's participation under 
the strategic transportation initiative program to complete the 
construction of highway 416. This was something our party had 
committed to in the last election.
<P>
	The support of the hon. member for Leeds-Grenville was 
crucial in seeing this completed. There is also the support the

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week 
the Minister of Finance stated in this House that the most important 
kind of tax relief this country should look to is a reduction in 
interest rates. Is that all? Is that the reward for his tough, tough 
budget and his two-year revolving target? Is that all this 
government has to offer to overtaxed Canadians?

to pay less in taxes than they did the year before?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if one looks at the 
reaction around the world as governments have talked about high 
deficits and high debt and have talked about tax decreases, in fact 
the money markets have said  to get the deficits down and get the 
debt down. That is very clearly the course we have decided to take.
<P>
	I must say I find it incredible that the member stands up and 
simply dismisses reductions in interest rates. I would suggest he go 
back to his riding and talk to people who have to pay mortgages. He 
should talk to people who are buying cars and refrigerators. He 
should talk to people who want jobs. Maybe then he will 
understand how important it is for ordinary Canadians to have low 
interest rates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
here to compliment the minister. I am here to criticize the finance 
minister for not listening to the leading economists in this country 
and for not listening to the taxpayers. They are overtaxed and 
overburdened. They want fewer taxes and lower taxes.
<P>
	The economists say we should get to 0 per cent of GDP a heck of 
a lot quicker than what the minister has put forward. He obviously 
does not understand what is ticking people off. He is too busy 
praising himself.
<P>
	Why will the minister not do what is right, do what the people 
want and commit today to presenting a balanced budget within two 
years, keep his promise of eliminating the GST, thereby setting the

	In relation to the Eagleson investigation, in 1992 a request was 
made by American law enforcement agencies that the RCMP 
execute two search warrants to seize the records of All Canada 
Sports Promotion Limited in Toronto. The search was not carried 
out for a full two  years after the U.S. agency requested a search 
warrant be executed.

of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member creates the 
impression that section 745 is a provision which results in the 
automatic release of people who have been convicted of murder.
<P>
	Section 745 simply provides that such people can apply to a 
court, composed of a judge and a jury picked from the community, 
to decide the question of whether that person should be permitted 
to ask for an opportunity to have parole.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	When the private member's bill was before the House, there was, 
in effect, a free vote on that bill. As a result it went to the justice 
committee.
<P>
	I have written to the justice committee and I spoke to its then 
chair to ask the committee to deal with this matter as one of 
priority. I want the committee to deal with it. As I told the House 
last week, I shall be making submissions to the justice committee 
about the broader context in which it should look at this single 
important issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make it perfectly clear that I said section 745 could allow the 
likes of those people to be released.
<P>
	This minister has brought in legislation that has divided Canada 
rather than unite Canadians. The gun law, the sentencing bill and 
sexual orientation inclusion and the unity bill are some examples of 
how this minister is working.
<P>
	When is the minister going to support bills that victims, police, 
police chiefs and all other Canadians want, like the removal of 
section 745 from the Criminal Code?

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

may choose to pronounce his words, the fact is that from day to 
day in this Chamber, he makes a career out of creating the spectre 
of public danger because of this section in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The far more responsible approach to criminal justice is to first 
look at the facts and that is exactly what I have asked the justice

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development.
<P>
	In the rush to fulfil the Prime Minister's referendum promises to 
Quebec, the government has hastily assembled a unity package that 
aboriginal leaders say does not recognize their historic 
self-government, land and treaty rights and would make it 
absolutely impossible to obtain further changes to the Constitution 
to clarify those rights.
<P>
	Will the government stop ignoring the aboriginal issues in these 
constitutional initiatives and make a commitment today; first, to 
consult with the Assembly of First Nations; second, to honour 
Canada's constitutional obligations to aboriginal people; and third, 
to recognize First Nations as full partners in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the member, 
who spends a lot of time on the aboriginal file, did not hear the 
speeches of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice or myself.
<P>
	If he had, he would have heard that the words were very similar 
in each one of the speeches. They were very clear that the distinct 
society clause does not derogate one iota from either the inherent 
right or the treaty rights of aboriginal people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the speech to which the minister refers there was a 
commitment to a national aboriginal day, a holiday.
<P>
	I am wondering if, instead of a day off, we might find a day to 
actually sit down and get some work done on some of the things for 
which the aboriginal people have asked, particularly the 
extinguishment clause that aboriginal people have talked about.
<P>
	Will the minister give us a commitment today that as the fact 
finder Justice Hamilton has requested, the extinguishment clause 
will be extinguished?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only does the hon. member 
have the wrong speech but he has the  wrong day. I am referring to 
the speeches that the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and I 
initiated at the start of the debate on distinct society and the veto 
legislation.
<P>
	We were not talking about a holiday per se. We were talking 
about a recognition. It is in place now in the sense that the AFN has 
a unity day on June 21. We can build on that because at the spiritual 
gathering, all the churches were there: the Mennonites, the 
Anglicans, the Roman Catholics, all the spiritual leaders.
<P>
	All the parties were there except unfortunately the NDP and the 
Reform. I am looking at both of them. Maybe if they had been there 
they would understand what we are trying to do collectively as far 
as putting some spiritualism and recognition into what the 
aboriginal people have done for this country and continue to do.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
Newfoundland, as in most other provinces, seasonal work is very 
important to the economy. Would the Minister of Human Resource 
Development assure me, the constituents of St. John's West and the 
rest of Canada, that the particular circumstances of seasonal 
workers have been taken into account in considering the new 
employment insurance legislation?
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question.
<P>
	One very important change, as the member knows, is that we 
have shifted the basis of eligibility to hours. That will be of 
substantial benefit to seasonal workers. It will mean that many 
seasonal workers qualify much sooner for benefits than they can 
now and that many seasonal workers can extend their benefits 
much further. In other words they will be able to extend their 
weeks.
<P>
	To give a working example, today with the new system 45,000 
additional seasonal workers who are not eligible under the present 
system and who now pay premiums could become eligible under 
the new system. More important, 270,000 seasonal workers today 
would be able to extend their benefits a minimum of an additional 
two weeks beyond that which they have now under the old system. 
In other words, they could establish their claim earlier and have 
their claim last longer because we are recognizing and giving them 
full credit for all the work they do.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage recently signed an umbrella 
agreement to provide Quebec anglophone groups with $8.4 
million. Although Reform is against such expenditures generically, 
if the government is to do it we hope it will do it in a fair way.
<P>
	Will anglophone groups that did not sign the deal continue to 
receive funding? Or, will it be channelled entirely through Alliance 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Official Languages 
Act of Canada recognizes minority groups, francophones outside 
Quebec and anglophones within Quebec.
<P>
	The official languages office has been in the process of 
negotiating with a variety of different groups based on principles of 
equity and gender. It will certainly not cut out other groups at the 
expense of Alliance Quebec. Nor would Alliance Quebec expect 
that to happen.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of 
Transport.
<P>
	In reply to an opposition question, the minister said that 
Canadian Airlines International and its partner, Alitalia, had ceased 
operations at Mirabel because of insufficient passenger volume 
between Montreal and Rome. However, Air Canada has applied for 
permission to operate this route.
<P>
	Considering the sizable Italian community in Montreal and the 
fact that there is a real market for flights between Montreal and 
Rome, does the Minister of Transport intend to make an exception 
to his policy for allocating international routes and accede to Air 
Canada's request so as to provide a direct link between these two 
cities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we have no intention of changing the current existing 
rules for allocating routes to these two airlines. However, I 
understand the hon. member's question and his emphasis on the 
importance of the service between Montreal and Italy. In fact, a 
number of ministers and members on this side of the House have 
already raised the matter.
<P>
	However, we must realize that often the other airline applies for 
a route, not because it may be very successful but because it wants 
the international prestige.
<P>
	We should realize, as the hon. member pointed out, that 
Canadian Airlines International is not alone in thinking there is not 
enough passenger volume between Montreal and Italy, since Italy's 
national airline, Alitalia, has also suspended operations on this 
route.
<P>
	However, we will continue our negotiations. We have scheduled 
meetings with Canadian Airlines International to try and find ways 
to solve the problem.

Communication, if so, what is the service provided, (<I>b</I>) what was the billing in 
the fiscal years 1994-95 and for the first half of 1995-96, and (<I>c</I>) what is the 
policy or regulation governing contracts with companies in which departmental 
officials or minister's staff have an interest?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed 
by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Treasury Board as 
follows:
<P>
	(a) The Department of Fisheries and Oceans no longer has a 
contractual relationship with Bristol Communications.
<P>
	(b) $63,493.19 was invoiced by Bristol Communications in 
1994-95 and $5,382.19 was invoiced in the first half of 1995-96.
<P>
	(c) Departmental officials (employees) are subject to the 
provisions of the conflict of interest and post-employment code for 
the public service (public service code). This code does not make 
any specific statement ``governing contracts with companies in 
which departmental officals-have an interest''. However, there 
are provisions relating to assets held by employees.
<P>
	Pursuant to sections 21 to 23 of the public service code, 
employees must make a confidential report to the designated 
official of all assets and of all direct and contingent liabilities, 
where these might give rise to a conflict of interest in respect of the 
employee's official duties and responsibilities. Such assets might 
include ``interests in partnerships, proprietorships, joint ventures, 
private companies and family businesses, in particular those that 
own or control shares of public companies or that do business with 
the government''.
<P>
	Employees must divest assets where it is determined by the 
designated offical that they constitute a real or potential conflict of 
interest in relation to the duties and responsibilities of the 
employee. Divestment of assets is usually achieved by selling them 
in an arm's length transaction or by making them subject to a trust 
arrangement.
<P>
	Minister's staff are subject to the provisions of the conflict of 
interest and post-employment code for public office holders 
(public office holder code). This code does not make any specific 
statement ``governing contracts with companies in which- 
minister's staff have an interest''. However, there are provisions 
relating to assets held by public office holders, which includes 
minister's staff.
<P>
	Section 9(1) requires a confidential report to the ethics 
counsellor of all assets and of all direct and contingent liabilities.
<P>
	Pursuant to section 10 to 14, the public office holders then make 
a public declaration of certain types of assets (such as interests in 
businesses that do not contract with the government and do not own 
or control publicly traded securities), and divest themselves of 
other types of assets which could be directly or indirectly affected 
as to value by government decisions or policy (such as publicly 
traded securities and businesses which contract with the 
government). Such divestment is by sale or by establishing a blind 
trust or management agreement approved by the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	For more detailed information on conflict of interest and code of 
conduct, please refer to the codes.

an act respecting employment insurance in Canada, be read the

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Centre has

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to finish my intervention with about 60 more 
seconds of words of wisdom for the government on its 
unemployment insurance efforts.
<P>
	It collects $19 billion and it pays out some $11 billion. The other 
billions of dollars are just to get votes. The government has the 
opportunity to truly reform unemployment insurance, to truly push 
it down to the level of government that is closest to the people and 
let it serve them, to truly eliminate overlap and duplication of 
services, to save the taxpayers $5 billion, and to lower  government

<P>
spending. If it is a matching fund between employer and employee 
it should never go into a deficit whatsoever.
<P>
	The government had the opportunity to offer some hope and tax 
relief to corporations through a reduction in the payroll tax. It has 
chosen not to do any of those things that stimulate the economy. It 
has chosen not to do any of those things that would benefit 
taxpayers. Instead it has chosen to continue taxing on the side and 
overburdening us with more and more taxation.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to 
the member for Calgary Centre I feel we are reading two separate 
acts. One of his concerns was that we were changing the name of 
this bill from the Unemployment Insurance Act to the employment 
act, and even that bothered him. Imagine trying to take a positive 
stance on getting Canadians back to work; this is just another thing 
they object to.
<P>
	Canada works when Canadians work. This is the essence of Bill 
C-111. The previous Unemployment Insurance Act was basically a 
passive support system. It in many ways encouraged people not to 
seek employment in other areas. The Canadian economy is very 
much evolving from what some economists would like to call the 
old economy into a new economy. It is very appropriate that as 
Canada approaches the 21st century it attempts to evolve its 
legislation in the area of encouraging skills and skill development 
in our workforce.
<P>
	There is always the question of cause and effect when we get into 
the issue of unemployment or employment benefits. Many of our 
younger people are joining the workforce. Alarmingly, over 60 per 
cent of new entrants have received only a high school education. It 
is apropos that the government has recognized that and wants to 
upgrade the basic qualities of skills in the labour market.
<P>
	Many of us can relate stories from their own ridings, anecdotal 
or whatever, of people who have purposely chosen not to work 
because the incentive to work was not there. In other words, they 
received unemployment insurance benefits and for them to take a 
job, with possible babysitting costs or whatever other costs 
attributed to going to work, it was cheaper to sustain themselves on 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I do not believe unemployment insurance was ever intended to 
be an income support system. It was basically supposed to 
encourage and develop skills so that people would seek 
employment.
<P>
	It is interesting how Canadian economist Nuala Beck said the 
economy in Canada has been changing over the last number of 
years. More people work in the sophisticated electronics industry 
than in pulp and paper. This is even true in British Columbia. More 
Quebecers have jobs in health and medical care than in the  
traditional sectors of construction, textile, clothing, furniture, 
automobile, forestry and mining combined.
<P>
	More Nova Scotians work as teachers and university professors 
than in fish processing, forestry and construction put together. The 
province has the largest number of universities per capita of any 
province, making it one of the best knowledge intensive regions in 
the country. Why I submit that information during this debate is 
that sometimes we forget how our economy has been changing. We 
often look at the unemployment statistics and they also follow 
some of what people would call the older economy.
<P>
	Basically we want to not subsidize and underwrite people 
staying with an old economy that possibly is leading to dead end 
jobs. Rather, we want to give them the skills and the incentive to 
move along within the workforce.
<P>
	Canada has one of the highest benefit plans of unemployment 
insurance in the world. Many have suggested this has created a 
situation in which people have been reticent about seeking new 
employment in other areas. In a sense it has actually contributed to 
the immobility of our workforce and has possibly made it not as 
dynamic as it should have been.
<P>
	We have watched the unemployment insurance system change in 
the last 12 years. In 1982, 15 per cent of workers were repeat users. 
By 1994 over 40 per cent of the people who accessed the 
unemployment insurance system have also done so at least one 
other time in the last five years, which tells us that more and more 
people have been using the unemployment insurance system not so 
much as an avenue for getting back to work or looking for new 
work but as a way to maintain their income levels.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Another aspect affecting our economy is a tremendous change in 
the remuneration for young people. Those under 24 years of age are 
today earning less than a similar age group in 1969. Many of these 
younger people are finding it difficult to access the labour market. 
Many aspects of this legislation create an open door which allows 
some of our younger people to get work experience.
<P>
	How is this new act better than the old unemployment system 
with the problems I have mentioned? It is better in a number of 
ways. It assists employers in keeping assistance to small and 
medium size businesses. Premiums for workers will drop from the 
current level, which the previous speaker neglected to mention, of 
$3 to $2.95 in 1996, while employers will pay $4.13 per $100 of 
employee insurable earnings as compared with the current $4.20. 
This combined with a reduction in the annual insurable base from 
the current level of $42,380 to $39,000 means employers could 
save as much as $170 per worker in 1996.

<P>
	Time and again employers have told us as a government that 
payroll taxes kill jobs. Payroll taxes, whether unemployment 
insurance or Canada pension plan and other benefits paid to 
employees, mean a cost to the employer to hire that extra 
employee. The government has realized that, has heard those 
concerns of employers and has changed the legislation to give 
employers more of an incentive to hire new workers.
<P>
	This new system will streamline paperwork and simplify 
reporting requirements facing employers, thus reducing 
administrative cost. The elimination of weekly minimums and 
maximums to determine insurability means employers will save in 
the order of $150 million in administration costs.
<P>
	The old system basically made people account by weeks with I 
believe 15 hours per insurable week of employment. One can 
imagine where an employer who had employees, some working 15 
hours, some working 12 hours, some working more than that, 
would have a horrendous accounting procedure trying to figure out 
who was insurable and who was not. It also created a barrier. Some 
people wanted to get 15 hours in so they could have insurable 
employment. Many relationships between employers and 
employees were about who could get these hours and so forth.
<P>
	It created an administrative nightmare for small business. It also 
created abuse in the relationship between employers and 
employees. The government has recognized this impediment to 
hiring people and has changed it in this legislation.
<P>
	It is estimated that 60 per cent of small firms that currently 
contribute to the unemployment insurance system actually pay less 
under the EI while another 16 per cent will pay the same amount. 
This is a significant factor. Remember, small and medium size 
businesses are the employers of the future and have been almost the 
sole creator of jobs in the past. Over 76 per cent of small businesses 
will realize a significant reduction in their payroll costs. This will 
give them an incentive to hire more people.
<P>
	In addition, further relief will be provided by a temporary 
premium refund for those small businesses that experience a 
significant premium increase over the next two years. Some 300 
small businesses will be eligible for these rebates. This is another 
area where the government has heard the concerns of small and 
medium size business and their desire to create new jobs and a new 
economy.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	In addition, we have recognized the importance of people being 
able to find that new job. Often the problem has been with the 
changing workforce and also a changing economy. In moving from 
the old economy to the new economy people have been displaced. 
Their displacement has also created a situation in which they  were 
reticent about accepting lower paying jobs which may get them 
into a new labour force.
<P>
	This legislation provides up to a $5,000 a year subsidy over a 
three-year period to allow them to access those new jobs. Eight 
hundred million dollars will be spent for new employment benefits, 
and on and on.
<P>
	There is also the recognition of low income families. It was often 
cheaper for them to go on welfare than it was to work. The 
government has recognized that by subsidizing the child tax benefit 
provisions of the unemployment insurance system to providing 
more benefits for those young families trying to find a job, find a 
career. This is only a part of what is a very excellent piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	These changes will assist Canadian corporations and their 
workers in providing new jobs for the young and for all workers in 
Canada in the new economy and putting the old economy behind 
us.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-111 runs counter to the historical demands of Quebec and to 
women's rights to equality.
<P>
	Let us travel back in time, stopping in the year 1864 during the 
discussions leading up to Confederation. The future central 
government wanted to have jurisdiction over higher education. It 
would appear that this did not suit a good number of participants, 
because the provinces ended up with full jurisdiction over 
education.
<P>
	Now, after a long jump forward in history, let us stop in 1940. 
This is the year, you will remember, in which, after an unsuccessful 
attempt to legislate on an unemployment insurance proposal, the 
government succeeded in having the constitution changed by the 
British Parliament and was accorded a new 
jurisdiction-unemployment insurance.
<P>
	This jurisdiction over unemployment insurance was interpreted 
by the courts, and the decisions are very interesting indeed. The 
well known constitionalist, Mr. Beaudoin, covered the subject 
briefly in his <I>La Constitution du Canada</I>.
<P>
	The courts decided the federal government's jurisdiction over 
unemployment insurance included the right to determine the types 
of jobs that were insurable, the sorts of jobs that involved a risk of 
unemployment and could perhaps be covered by the program, the 
sorts of income that could be taken into account in calculating 
unemployment insurance contributions and, finally, the eligibility 
criteria for benefits.
<P>
	From these powers, one conclusion is obvious: Parliament's 
jurisdiction covers unemployment insurance solely. That is, like all 
other forms of insurance-life insurance, fire insurance, disability 
insurance-the risk is insured, period.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17509"> 17509 </A></B>
<P>
	This leads us to the question of where Parliament got its so 
important authority over job training, because it has none over 
education. Training, education, are we not talking about the same 
process? Basic logic would say it was, and yet, in reality, quite 
the opposite is true.
<P>
	The question is simple and so is the answer: Parliament's power 
is not derived from any formal document. No province has ever 
said to the federal government: ``Here, you have control over 
unemployment insurance, you should also have it over job training. 
Take it, I give it to you''.
<P>
	It did not happen that way at all. It happened surreptitiously. The 
federal government said: ``Since I am the one collecting the money 
and redistributing it among those meeting the criteria, I think I 
should also arrange it so that I do not have too many clients. I will 
look after their training. I will provide nice programs, special 
courses, counselling centres, all kinds of goodies. I will see to it 
that they do not come back begging too often, so that I can use the 
money for other purposes as I see fit''.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	That is what happened. All thanks to the famous federal 
spending power. There was a hitch, however: Quebec, this king of 
spoilsports, according to the Deputy Prime Minister, protested.
<P>
	Quebec society as a whole said no to federal control over job 
training. We told the federal government: ``Leave our jurisdictions 
alone. We have a very good idea of the kind of job market we want 
to develop. We know what kind of society we want, what our 
economic priorities are, what family policies we want to include in 
our programs, what markets we want to open''.
<P>
	In short, Quebec society told the federal government: ``We know 
where we want to go. We have the skills needed to do so. Get out of 
here and do not take the money with you; it belongs to us''.
<P>
	Again, as history has shown on many occasions, the federal 
government does not understand anything. It continues to deny us 
through this bill. Worse yet, it has broken all records by changing 
the name of its constitutional jurisdiction, an amendment adopted 
in 1940 when the federal government was given jurisdiction over 
unemployment insurance; it has now decided to call it employment 
insurance. This throws the door wide open to new encroachments, 
since any new initiative can be justified in the name of a so-called 
jurisdiction over employment insurance. The government is acting 
in bad faith, in obvious bad faith.
<P>
	I do not know where this bad faith comes from. What I know is 
that overlap and duplication will not stop there and will continue.
<P>
	I also know that the federal government is maintaining and even 
increasing the amount of duplication and  overlap. And it does so in 
many areas, such as health, education, agriculture, culture, 
communications, the environment, natural resources and fisheries, 
just to name a few.
<P>
	I also know that the 10,000 unemployed workers living in my 
riding are no better off with the HRD minister's new UI reform; in 
fact, they are being penalized. They have nothing to gain from this 
reform. In my riding, the unemployment rate hovers around 20 or 
25 per cent, with a welfare caseload of 28 per cent. This percentage 
will keep growing as the number of people looking for work who 
no longer qualify for UI increases. What choice will they have 
other than going on welfare?
<P>
	I also know that the 2,000 people who gave up looking for a job 
in the Quebec City area last month and were therefore struck off the 
UI rolls as they joined the ranks of the welfare recipients have 
nothing to gain from this reform.
<P>
	Women and young people in particular have nothing to gain 
from the minister's reform proposal. With this bill, women 
continue to be penalized. For example, the new conditions to 
qualify for benefits will penalize women, since 70 per cent of part 
time jobs are held by women and since women are the ones who 
re-enter the labour force after extended leaves of absence for child 
rearing purposes.
<P>
	It is so unfair for a government to add to the negative impact that 
being away from the labour market had on the careers and financial 
position of women instead of recognizing the value of the work 
these women have done with their children. Such an attitude is far 
from promoting equal opportunities for women.
<P>
	I ask the government: whatever happened to the funds that were 
going to be used to create daycare spaces? Where is that money? 
The government promised 100,000 new daycare spaces. This is 
another election promise that was quickly forgotten because it did 
not affect the interests of wealthy contributors to the party's 
election fund.
<P>
	After promising to create massive employment, get rid of the 
GST and eliminate overlap, this is yet another unfulfilled 
commitment that will adversely affect women.
<P>
	History will soon show that the federal government should have 
been content with its already large powers under the original 
constitution. History will also show that Quebec women have 
become tired of being treated like second class citizens.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	They stopped believing in nice rhetoric a long time ago. They 
only believe what they see now, and that is a bleak future for them, 
a future without work, which will hurt the poor in particular, a 
group with which women can identify.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
enter into the debate on the bill today and on the motion before us.
<P>
	I will begin by talking briefly about the problems we will have if 
we send the bill to committee prior to second reading. It is a 
problem for me because I was a member of the committee when 
Bill C-43, the Lobbyists Registration Act, was first tried in 
Parliament. At first I eagerly accepted it. I said it would be a really 
good thing because then we as ordinary members, backbenchers, 
would have input into the bill at the very beginning. Hopefully we 
would be able to craft the bill so it would include from the 
beginning the necessary changes that would produce widespread 
approval among all the parties.
<P>
	However, I was greatly disappointed. During the time of the 
committee everything went really well. We had a good chairperson 
and it was a time when we built good collegiality among ourselves. 
There were many times when we discussed these things. We came 
to a consensus but I was very disappointed when finally we came to 
the end of the process. Even though we thought we had agreement 
on a number of issues we raised on behalf of Canadians we 
represent, the members of the committee on the day of the voting 
of the clause by clause came in with their little check sheets and 
voted according to a pre-plan, which greatly disappointed me.
<P>
	I was really distressed. A number of the things they voted against 
were things that I thought we had reached consensus on. In the end, 
it simply did not materialize that the individual members were able 
to express their convictions.
<P>
	I would like to be on record as being opposed to this process. I 
know it was supposed to be new and innovative but my experience 
is that not only does it not work at that level, but it cuts off the next 
level of amendment possibilities and further debate which is very 
important in the House; to go through the regular procedure of 
having first reading, second reading, committee and then third 
reading.
<P>
	I am against that part and urge all fellow members to preserve 
the functioning of Parliament by rejecting this motion to send it to 
committee at this time. It ought to go through second reading in a 
normal sense first.
<P>
	I would like to now speak about the whole question of 
unemployment. Unemployment is a very severe problem. In the 
downturn of an economy many businesses respond of necessity by 
laying off some employees. Those employees now have lost their 
jobs and because generally the downturn in the economy produces 
fewer opportunities in other businesses, as more and more people 
get laid off the probability and the availability of getting other jobs 
is reduced.
<P>
	Obviously something has to be done. The present plan and the 
plan by the Minister of Human Resources Development are not 
long term solutions to this problem.
<P>
	The types of policies the government is embarking on further 
erode the employability of Canadians. The real task before us is to 
provide a climate in which there are jobs available, in which there 
are employment opportunities and in which it is possible for people 
of all skills levels to find their niche and to contribute to society 
economically and in other ways. Tinkering with the bill will not do 
anything to achieve that fuller goal.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	With respect to meeting the needs of those temporarily 
unemployed, Canadians should begin to recognize they are getting 
a very short shrift from government, from the unemployment 
insurance commission and from the whole system which is 
designed to tide them over through a difficult period. Many people 
would much rather have a job than rely on the limited benefits of 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I will go even further. I reiterate what I have said many times at 
public meetings and in private. A number of employers have 
spoken to me since the time I became involved in the political 
process. They find it very difficult to obtain and keep workers 
because they are competing with unemployment insurance. They 
are competing with a situation in which an individual says: ``I get 
this much if I do not work. Why should I work for you?''
<P>
	I was at one time the recipient of this policy. I owned a small 
business with a partner. We hired someone who worked for us for a 
short time and then abruptly quit. When I asked him about it he 
listed the salary and benefits he received from us and said: ``It costs 
me only about $200 less per month to not do anything, so I am out 
of here''. Unfortunately the business we were in required us to have 
accessibility to our employees at very odd hours. It was not a very 
pleasant working situation. We did not have the financial flexibility 
to pay huge bucks to persuade people to stay. We went through a 
continuing line of people who worked for us basically long enough 
to qualify for unemployment insurance and then they were gone.
<P>
	One thing which really annoyed me was that those employees, 
all of whom were male, as it was heavy industrial work, when they 
filed their income tax returns, in every case they were able to 
receive a refund on their overpayment to UI. They were 
unemployed and under the limit, so they overpaid. However, we as 
employers struggling to keep the business going ended up paying 
the maximum to the UIC and to the Canada pension plan and we 
were ineligible for rebates comparable to the overpayments the 
employees were making. That was a great unfairness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17511"> 17511 </A></B>
<P>
	Unemployment insurance is exactly what its name implies. It 
ensures we will have unemployment. The name is now being 
changed. It is a cosmetic change. All the principles remain 
essentially the same. There are a few cosmetic changes being 
proposed, none of which will produce any profound changes in 
how the system operates and the disincentives built in to take part 
time work.
<P>
	A number of years ago I worked at the Northern Alberta Institute 
of Technology and once again our UI premiums increased. It was at 
the time when they crossed the $100 per month threshold. I talked 
to my fellow instructors. We did some calculating. There were 
approximately 750 instructors at the institute. We were paying 
$100 per month each, which means a monthly contribution of 
$75,000. Our employer, paying 40 per cent more, contributed an 
additional $105,000 per month, making a total of $180,000 per 
month, sent to Ottawa for the UIC from our little group of 
instructors. That makes a total of $2.16 million per year.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Instead of being involved in that coercive system, we would 
have been able to keep the money and invest it or use it. We would 
have been able to provide the equivalent of 54 jobs based on a 
salary of $40,000 per year. Meanwhile, our fellow instructors were 
being laid off because of pressure of taxation and other things. We 
were forced to pay people to leave work when we would much 
rather have shared the workload with them. Fifty-four of those 
people were being subsidized.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to join all my colleagues who asked that Bill C-111 
be referred as quickly as possible to the standing committee of the 
House, so that all Canadians can soon participate in the 
development of the bill, and eventually in its implementation.
<P>
	At the same time, I want to refute many myths concerning this 
bill, particularly as regards part time workers.
<P>
	A moment ago, I was listening to our Bloc colleague, the 
member for Quebec, talking about what else but the big bad federal 
government which is responsible for all ills on earth and in heaven, 
and all over the planet. She mentioned constitutional interference 
and injustices against Quebec. When I listen to the Bloc members 
day in and day out, it seems to me that they would like to continue 
and perpetuate the referendum debate for ever.
<P>
	If I may, since I live in the Montreal area and see it daily, I would 
like to point out the political, social and economic instability which 
is now pervasive in our area as a result of this sterile and divisive 
debate we are compelled to by the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois, and their obsession for a separate Quebec.  The 
Montreal economy is sick due in part to this instability which 
scares away investments and jobs. This is a reality we need to talk 
about.
<P>
	I would like to mention the workers who, either by choice or 
through no fault of their own, are working part time. Bill C-111 was 
drafted, in many ways, to held part time workers. We heard claims 
that Bill C-111 was a new tax on workers, or that it was tightening 
eligibility to such a degree that workers most in need would never 
qualify.
<P>
	It is important to compare the provisions in Bill C-111 with those 
of the old system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the last two decades almost half of the new jobs created 
have been what economists call non-standard jobs. Most are part 
time jobs. By 1994, 17.3 per cent of all jobs in our country were 
part time jobs. Sadly, women filled 70 per cent of those part time 
jobs. Studies show that more than one-third of all part time workers 
actually seek and want full time work. Once again, more than 
two-thirds of the part timers who seek full time jobs happen to be 
women.
<P>
	We should ask ourselves: Has the old approach to unemployment 
insurance benefited part time workers? The answer is no. Under the 
old system a worker needed to work at least 15 hours or earn a 
certain amount to have his or her earnings insured. In 1995 that 
amount was $163. The old system has frozen out 500,000 Canadian 
workers. Many employers have deliberately held workers to less 
than 15 hours. This has kept their wages lower. After all there can 
be no employer share of unemployment insurance premiums for 
uninsured employees. The result has been that these workers have 
not been eligible for any benefits if they lose their job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But there is another aspect to that unfairness. A recent study by 
Statistics Canada revealed that 653,000 Canadians have more than 
one job. That is definitely not a normal situation. More and more 
people now have two or even three part time jobs, but many of 
them are still not covered by the present plan. That is absurd and 
unfair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Then we have people who work more than the minimum some 
weeks but not other weeks. They have only partial coverage. That 
shows why we need this change. One central objective of Bill 
C-111 is to get rid of the artificial notion of a work week. By using 
hours as a measuring device and by making every hour count, part 
time workers earn coverage at the same rate as every other insured 
worker.
<P>
	A person who loses a part time job will be treated the same as 
any other worker if he or she has enough hours of work. This is fair. 
We have set a reasonable standard regarding the number of hours a 
person has to work to  be eligible for benefits. That underlines our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17512"> 17512 </A></B>
<P>
goal to make work pay. It is a necessary step that helps us to meet 
our fiscal targets through Bill C-111.
<P>
	Many part time workers amass very few hours. They may be 
students. Some may be in seasonal work. They may have only a 
little part time employment or maybe only a few weeks of full time 
work. This bill understands that reality. It exempts people who earn 
less than $2,000 a year from employment insurance premiums. 
These people will have premiums deducted from their paycheques 
just like everyone else but that money will be returned to them 
through the income tax system.
<P>
	There will be no tax grab from our lowest income workers. This 
will have a significant effect. The Department of Human Resources 
Development has determined that more than three out of every four 
of the newly insured workers will have their premiums refunded. 
Another 920,000 low income workers who now pay premiums will 
see those refunded. Altogether that is equivalent to 1.3 million 
workers who will not have to pay premiums because their earnings 
are too low. The government has built a system based strictly on 
fairness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What will the impact be on part time workers? They will pay $14 
million less in premiums, and a much greater number will qualify 
for benefits if they are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It reflects the balanced approach this bill takes to the needs of 
people in seasonal work. The government clearly listened to the 
recommendations of the working group on seasonal work and 
unemployment insurance. These recommendations called for an 
hours based system. They called for an increased clawback. They 
called for steps to keep young people from leaving school for a 
cycle of unemployment insurance dependence.
<P>
	Despite the claims of the opposition, these are the facts. Part 
time workers will see less off their income in premiums. They will 
have more access to benefits.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	In contrast, the Reform Party has been pounding away at its 
claims that extending employment insurance to part time workers 
will lead to untold numbers being fired by employers. I use the 
word untold for a reason because I have never heard Reform 
members offer any credible statistics to support this claim.
<P>
	Under the new system, part time workers who have been eligible 
for insurance benefits at any time in the previous three years will 
have the same opportunity for employment benefits as other 
eligible workers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to reiterate my firm support for the 
motion of the government that Bill C-111 be  referred as quickly as 
possible to a committee so that the serious consultations Canadians 
expect can get under way, and that Bill C-111 can be enacted as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is it my turn for 
debate? Ten minutes? I thought I could put questions to my 
colleague opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> No, we have been gagged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> We have been gagged. That is the new 
way of doing things. It means that the government does not go only 
after the victims, but also after the members who represent the 
victims, as my colleague for Portneuf put it.
<P>
	I am not pleased, but rather deeply saddened to rise today to 
speak on a bill which is so tough on the unemployed, on the jobless. 
Instead of tackling the problems and trying to find work for the 
people who live in the regions, the government is going after what 
little they have left.
<P>
	What is this bill all about? As we say in French, and especially in 
my region of Gaspé, it is first and foremost a deficit insurance plan 
for the government, since it would save about $5 billion. It is not 
the jobless who will benefit from this, but the government. So, first 
and foremost, the reform proposed by the minister is a kind of 
insurance program for him, for his deficit, and not an employment 
insurance system, as he would have us believe.
<P>
	I was regional critic for the Bloc Quebecois this last year, and I 
still am, unless changes are made, and the people in areas like the 
Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands are being dealt a double 
blow by this bill, since the vast majority of the unemployed in these 
areas are seasonal unemployed. One of the first measures that will 
be applied by the government is the 1 per cent penalty for recurring 
unemployment. This means that each time an unemployed person 
in our regions receives UI benefits for a period of 20 weeks-20 
weeks, not a year-that person is given a 1 per cent penalty 
applicable to his or her future benefits. That hurts.
<P>
	Then, when you look at how the system works, we know the 
present rate of benefits is 55 per cent of the gross salary. This 
means that, once they have accumulated five periods of 20 weeks 
of UI benefits, these persons will no longer get 55 per cent of their 
gross salary, but 50 per cent. That hurts, and is discriminatory. It is 
not their fault if they work in an area that has to follow the seasons. 
But, nevertheless, they will get a 5 per cent penalty. That is one 
thing.
<P>
	Also, benefits are calculated not only based on the number of 
hours, but also based on the number of qualifying weeks. First, the 
benefits will be divided by 14 and subsequently, in 1997 or 1998 I 
think, they will be divided by 16.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17513"> 17513 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	This means that if I manage to accumulate the required 420 
hours in a period of 10 weeks, the total amount of benefits I am 
entitled to will be calculated and divided by 14, as if I had 
accumulated the required number of hours over a period of 14 
weeks.
<P>
	That is another reduction of the UI benefits to which these 
unemployed people would normally be entitled. What should we 
think of that?
<P>
	But the funniest thing or should I say the saddest thing about 
this-and I am sure all the people from the Gaspé Peninsula and the 
Magdalen Islands who are listening to this will demand an 
explanation from their member opposite-from what I 
understand-and I hope someone will be able to give me an answer 
at some point-the 420 hour minimum requirement must be met 
within a period of 14 weeks. Let us take for example a worker in a 
lobster plant in our area of the Gaspé Peninsula, who works mainly 
in May and June.
<P>
	Suppose this worker manages to accumulate only 400 hours over 
this work period. According to the rules, he or she must accumulate 
20 hours more in order to become eligible.
<P>
	If that worker is unlucky and cannot find work for his last 20 
hours before fall, let us say September or October, what will 
happen between the end of his first job, in June, and the beginning 
of his new job, at the end of September? He will be out of work and 
will receive no benefits of any kind.
<P>
	I have read the regulations and, from what I understand, the UI 
commission will calculate like this: let us suppose he worked 20 
hours at-I will be generous-$20 an hour, that makes $200 during 
that period. When the number of hours of work reaches 420, the 
amount earned is averaged over the last 14 weeks. Since the worker 
in my example did not work in July and August, because he lives in 
area where work is seasonal, his earnings during his qualifying 
period would be $200 and it is that amount that would be divided 
by 14. What, then, would be the amount of his benefits? It would be 
$1.25 or something like that. This is unspeakable.
<P>
	I hope that I am wrong and that my office will receive a fax 
telling me that I made a mistake. I just hope that we can at least 
make the minister and the deputy ministers who came up with this 
scheme understand that in areas like the Gaspé and the Islands, 
where people need unemployment benefits to make ends meet, they 
are very edgy about these changes to the program. People try very 
hard, but nature imposes its work schedules on humans.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, did you ever try to go strawberry picking or lobster 
fishing when there is three feet of ice? It is not easy. What can we 
do? Should we ask our viewers across Canada to give up 
strawberries and lobster forever, because people are no longer be 
able to stay in their  region for lack of unemployment insurance 
benefits, and have to move and find other jobs? Is that the 
message?
<P>
	I am afraid we will see some trades and occupations disappear 
because they are limited to some periods of the year. This is 
unthinkable unless, once again, the member for Gaspé is wrong.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Human Resources Development keeping a 
bargaining chip up his sleeve? I have not yet seen what regulatory 
amendments the Governor in Council can make in the area of 
unemployment for fishermen and seasonal workers and I do not 
know if he can make some other changes. However, the core, the 
basis of this bill is a slap on the wrist right from the start.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I cannot believe how fast time is going by this afternoon. But in 
the main, I have made my point. Canadians and Quebecers must be 
wary. The minister is proposing a very fundamental change, and he 
is the first one to dip into the pot of this insurance which I call the 
deficit insurance. I ask the minister to protect the lives of those who 
live in the regions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the member for 
Calgary North, I woulk like to say to the member for Gaspé, if I 
understood him correctly, that he used the word ``gag'' at the 
beginning of his speech. I will allow him to reply, but I must advise 
all members of the House that we are now under Standing Order 
73(1)(c) which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) no Member may speak more than once nor longer than ten minutes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I can assure the member that I have no intention of gagging him, 
or any other member. However, we are now proceeding under that 
rule. If the member wishes to reply, he can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had no intention 
whatsoever of implying that the Chair wants us to do certain things. 
But if I had the right to make a ten minutes speech, I thought I 
would also have the right to comment after the ten minutes granted 
to the other member.
<P>
	This was to make our work interactive in the House: questions, 
answers. That allows us to understand certain things.
<P>
	In my opinion, what Standing Order 73 does, if you will allow 
me to say so, is gag us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the Reform Party's Atlantic issues critic, I have met with and 
spoken to Atlantic Canadians from all walks of life, including those 
with, to them, an unwelcome dependence on the social program 
known as unemployment insurance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17514"> 17514 </A></B>
<P>
	It is the future of this social program that we are debating today. 
Reforms to the program are long overdue. It is a prize 
understatement to say that there is an unemployment problem in 
the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	The latest unemployment rate in Newfoundland is 15.9 per cent. 
In P.E.I. it is 12.2 per cent; in Nova Scotia it is 11.2 per cent and in 
New Brunswick, the lowest of the four Atlantic provinces, it sits at 
11 per cent. By contrast the national unemployment rate for Canada 
is 9.4 per cent.
<P>
	It is ironic that the Liberals are now going to call the system in 
which these disastrous rates of unemployment are flourishing, 
employment insurance. They have certainly done anything but 
foster employment for Atlantic Canadians in the past. What they 
have done is foster an unwelcome dependence on politicians, their 
programs and their promises.
<P>
	In 1994, the Atlantic region, with 8 per cent of Canada's 
population, collected 16.6 per cent of UI benefits. Also last year, 
$15.8 billion was paid out across the country in UI benefits, $2.6 
billion of which ended up in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	This is a huge chunk of our national wealth. The tragedy is that 
so many of these hard earned dollars do not end up in the hands of 
those who really need assistance. The distribution of these moneys 
is too often governed by political considerations rather than sound 
planning.
<P>
	The great seaworthy vessel known at Atlantic Canada is in need 
of a major refitting. The weight of dependence on political 
intervention has punched a very large hole in the bottom of the 
boat.
<P>
	Now the ship is taking on water at an alarming rate and who is at 
risk of drowning? First, our young people. In some fishing 
communities it is not uncommon for teenagers to drop out of 
school to take a position on a fishing boat because it gets them 
enough weeks of work to qualify for UI. The result is one less 
person in the school system. In the end, one person has been robbed 
of an opportunity to receive an education.
<P>
	Young people like this are suffering twofold. On one hand, they 
will be penalized for being labelled a frequent user. For years, they 
were led to believe that the UI benefits would always be there. 
Now, in a cruel twist of irony, they are also feeling the brunt of the 
years of mismanagement of the oceans' fish stocks which have 
disappeared.
<P>
	Also facing the risk of drowning from the foundering ship of UI 
are the communities dependent on this social program, 
communities where the dollars from UI have literally kept the town 
alive. In the past the government has tried to bring in training 
programs to help workers move out of failing industries. The 
Liberal government is trying this again. Unfortunately, the job 
training  programs, by the minister's own admission, have failed to 
deliver in the past.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As the hole in the bottom of Atlantic Canada's economic ship 
grew and as more water poured in, the people who could save the 
foundering ship were also penalized by the government. For years 
small business, the driving force behind job creation, has asked for 
relief from UI payroll taxes. Now, as the UI surplus fund grows, the 
government is offering a small stipend to the business community. 
The amount a business will pay in UI taxes will drop by 
one-twentieth of 1 per cent. This means that for every $100 of 
earnings it will drop by 5 cents. This is a very frail tool to hand to 
our economic builders.
<P>
	The ship that foundered over the years sank steadily through 
debt, mismanagement and abuse. As the hole in the bottom of the 
ship grew wider, successive governments tried to lighten the 
weight of the sinking ship by throwing overboard a couple of deck 
chairs, rather than by repairing the damage.
<P>
	The Liberal government still has not moved to repair the damage 
caused by the heavy borrowing of its own and previous 
governments. What the ship needs is to be repaired, to be pulled 
into drydock for a short time and to be made seaworthy again.
<P>
	Think of the possibilities of putting back to sea in a fully 
seaworthy ship. We can repair the ship and our social programs by 
making tough decisions now, saving them from being made for us 
down the road.
<P>
	The international community, whether we like it or not, is 
watching what we do very closely. By bringing financial spending 
under control, the economic ship can be rebuilt and put back to sea. 
It will be a refitted ship, able to withstand the storms of the open 
ocean of global competition and avoid the rocks along the coast of 
variable interest rates and currency fluctuations.
<P>
	The ship that is repaired and put back to sea has a host of ports to 
head for. The ports of possibility for Atlantic Canada are bountiful. 
By moving on the Reform Party's policy initiative Atlantica, the 
Atlantic provinces could open up new markets and a new 
north-south trading arrangement with the New England states, a 
market of 15 million people. Let us not forget the opportunity of 
tapping into the European market. By capitalizing on their unique 
proximity to other trading partners, the people of Atlantic Canada 
will be the real winners. The people who helped to carve out a 
country and a harsh new world 200 years ago can compete in the 
21st century.
<P>
	Sending a pile of cash in to try to solve the problems of a region 
does not work. According to the auditor general it never did. 
Programs designed to create employment, growth and prosperity, 
such as those set up by the Atlantic Canada Opportunity Agency, 
have shown questionable results at best. The importance of good,  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17515"> 17515 </A></B>
<P>
solid infrastructure to enable movement of products for businesses 
with initiative cannot be stressed enough.
<P>
	ACOA has often been used as a means to create competition to 
successful enterprises by funding grants to new but unviable 
enterprises. This has had the effect of setting up the new for failure 
and at the same time damaging the success of the old.
<P>
	The people of Atlantic Canada need ways and means to become 
self-sufficient. A region with natural resources such as lumber, 
fish, mining, Hibernia and Voisey Bay has opportunities to rival 
those of any other part of Canada if the shackles of government 
restriction, red tape and taxes could be thrown off. The federal 
government must free up the governments of Atlantic Canada and 
its citizens by giving them the opportunity and their own resources 
to manage and make decisions on the areas they see as being 
needed most. A move toward creating real jobs, not the make-work 
projects of the past, is what Atlantic Canadians need and want 
most.
<P>
	What the government needed to do and failed to do with this bill 
was to send a message to Atlantic Canadians that there is hope. 
There are ways to lessen dependence and restore self-sufficiency. 
We should not have to depend always on the ill-conceived training 
programs which in the past have not worked. Politicians can trust 
the initiative of working people.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians want to work. They have a right to go to work 
but have been prevented from doing so by the very governments 
they say are trying to protect them. They have been taxed out of 
jobs. While the federal government increased taxes over the years, 
the provincial governments followed suit. Borrowing money and 
taking out a mortgage on our children's future is not the way to 
build a strong country.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada is a region of the country which feels that the 
debate on this topic over the next few weeks is one that will have a 
very strong impact on them. I urge the government to take 
measures which will give this part of the country the long term plan 
and hope it needs to build a strong economic future and not tinker 
with programs which have no long term plan or benefit.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="17516"> 17516 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
report stage of Bill C-110, I will discuss briefly some of the 
amendments which have been put forth, including the one in my 
name. As well I have some general comments about the committee 
and report stage.
<P>
	The amendment I have moved today seeks to replace the words 
``by a majority of the provinces'' on line 13 with the words ``by 
two-thirds of the provinces''. I suggest this to the government 
really as a matter of drafting. On looking at the the bill one will see 
that the bill as it is drafted, particularly with the amendment the 
government is proposing, is a bit odd.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The bill says that the government will consult and get the 
consent of a majority of the provinces. Then it lists a formula with 
the amendment to include British Columbia that would include no 
fewer than two-thirds of the provinces in any case. The 
government's own formula would require at least seven provinces 
to get consent. In any case, the sections of the Constitution Act 
which the bill refers to require at least two-thirds of the provinces. 
They require either two-thirds or in some cases unanimity.
<P>
	It seems to me the term ``by a majority of the provinces'' is 
absolutely meaningless and actually is a bit misleading. It 
illustrates one of the problems with the bill. If I have the time I will 
get to that later. There are several instances where it is clear that the 
drafting of the bill leaves a number of considerations fairly 
undefined or wide open.
<P>
	The second amendment I will also speak to is the one moved by 
the government itself. This is the amendment to constitute British 
Columbia as a fifth region. I have said myself in committee and 
before that five regions are better than four but as I said at second 
reading, that does not render this bill acceptable. The bill remains 
fundamentally flawed. It does not give the power of consent to the 
Canadian people in a national referendum. That is what we have 
been seeking.
<P>
	As I said at second reading and in committee, no matter what the 
regional formula is, as long as it is the provinces in the sense of 
provincial governments or premiers or legislatures that are being 
consulted, the fundamental flaw remains that there already exists a 
formula to do precisely that. The formula in most cases is seven 
provincial legislatures representing 50 per cent of the population. 
In that sense we have made the case, which I believe the Alberta 
government will pursue in court, that there are some fairly serious 
legal problems with delegating this power to the provinces for a 
second time.
<P>
	One that I raised in committee to give an example of what I mean 
is that the provinces now required under the government's own 
formula would be provinces representing at least 90 per cent of the 
Canadian  population. Clearly in the Constitution Act 1982 that is 
not the formula the provinces agreed to. They agreed to a formula 
that would require provinces representing 50 per cent of the 
Canadian population.
<P>
	The government obviously has tried to argue this differently but 
it is fairly transparent that this does change the intention of the 
Constitution Act where provincial governments are involved. That 
is why we oppose it. Although the Motion No. 2 by the government 
is in and of itself an improvement to the bill, it is an improvement 
that is not adequate.
<P>
	I also note that in committee the Reform Party did table its 
fundamental amendment which is that this consultation would have 
to occur in all the provinces through a national referendum. I would 
point out that amendment was rejected by the Liberal government 
and also by the Bloc Quebecois. I am somewhat perplexed by why 
the Bloc Quebecois would oppose it. It is the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois that the people of Quebec should be consulted on their 
constitutional future. I do not know why they would object to the 
Parliament of Canada consulting Canadians on a constitutional 
amendment.
<P>
	I should also say that we submitted a second amendment in 
committee regarding protection for the amending formula where it 
concerns aboriginal peoples. We had taken some advice from a 
number of the aboriginal leaders who came before the committee. 
That amendment was also rejected by the committee. My colleague 
from Crowfoot may discuss some of the implications of that a little 
later today.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	It is fairly apparent that this bill is being rushed through the 
House. We have the bizarre coincidence of a government which is 
trying to rush passage of a piece of legislation at almost lightning 
speed, while at the same time it is proposing major amendments to 
it. This is the first time I can recall this kind of situation occurring.
<P>
	I do want to comment on the rush which occurred in committee. 
The committee insisted on hearing all witnesses within a 48-hour 
period with no more than 24 hours notice to those witnesses. The 
names of witnesses who had been submitted included 
constitutional experts, whom we heard two or three of, aboriginal 
leaders, members of provincial governments, representatives of 
intergovernmental affairs departments and in some cases premiers.
<P>
	We received replies. I am not aware of how, but I know the 
committee contacted all governments. I am not aware of how 
specifically they replied, but I will mention that the Government of 
British Columbia did wish to appear. Mr. Petter wished to address 
the committee on behalf of the Government of British Columbia. 
When it became technically not possible for him to do that on the 
given day because of problems we had with the satellite  
communication, he was promptly dropped from the list. I would 
suggest that if we had heard Mr. Petter's testimony, the government 
could well have known that its concession of a fifth region would 
not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17517"> 17517 </A></B>
<P>
have been enough to satisfy the Government of British Columbia, 
but we missed that opportunity.
<P>
	Also, without quoting the letter, I should add that Mr. Shillington 
of the Government of Saskatchewan wrote to me to indicate that he 
had wanted to appear before the committee but simply was unable 
to in the time constraints that were placed on him. I know that is 
also true for Mr. Mel Smith who contacted me earlier this week. He 
is a constitutional expert and former provincial secretary of British 
Columbia. He had indicated he would like to testify but there was 
no opportunity.
<P>
	This is not an extended witness list I am talking about. These are 
people who either are experts in the field or in the case of 
governments are affected parties of the legislation itself. They 
wanted to testify and were refused simply because of the artificial 
deadline created by the government and by the committee for 
hearing witnesses. It was a very short deadline with very little time 
to hear witnesses and very little time to actually notify potential 
witnesses of the possibility of appearing before the committee.
<P>
	In the time that remains I want to point out some of the lack of 
clarity that was in the bill and which was revealed to us in 
committee. These are things I notice the government has not 
submitted clarifying amendments on.
<P>
	First of all, the bill says that no minister of the crown shall 
propose a motion for a resolution to authorize an amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada, et cetera, other than through the process of 
first submitting it to the provinces where there is a five region veto 
formula.
<P>
	The term ``no minister'' is significantly important. This does not 
exclude the government from sponsoring, backing or putting its 
weight behind legislation tabled by a government backbencher or 
even by a parliamentary secretary. In that sense, it is unclear 
exactly whether the government itself does intend to follow this 
legislation.
<P>
	The government assures us it is extremely unlikely that 
something like that would happen, but my experience has been that 
when a scenario is allowed and then we are told it is unlikely, it 
probably means it is likely. That seems to be the way things operate 
around here.
<P>
	This second point was the subject of some debate in committee. 
The bill makes reference to an amendment first having been 
consented to by the provinces. It was unclear and the government 
itself was unclear in its intention of whether provinces meant 
strictly speaking provincial governments, which is what we would 
have anticipated and what the answers of the Prime Minister in 
question period seem to have implied, or whether it  could actually 
mean in a sense the people of a province, which is a very different 
notion.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Neither the minister nor his deputy appeared to rule out legally 
the meaning of consulting the people, although they did say that it 
was not a likely occurrence in their view. In fact the Minister of 
Justice said that it was highly unlikely they would use that 
interpretation. Furthermore, his deputy minister said that particular 
interpretation could also be challenged in court. She was not clear 
how the courts would rule if that meaning of provinces, provinces 
meaning provincial population, was used by the government. She 
was not sure whether the courts would allow that interpretation or 
not. This is very contentious.
<P>
	It is very unclear in a number of ways what the government is 
trying to achieve and why we all know it is trying in effect to give a 
veto to the Government of Quebec over constitutional change and 
in particular to the future premier. It believes it has a way to trap 
him in some future scheme.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as I say, even with the amendments the bill is ill 
considered. Ultimately the government will end up trapping itself 
and the people of Canada in what is, if not unconstitutional, a very 
unwise piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, as the House will 
know, I gave notice of an amendment to Bill C-110, an act 
respecting constitutional amendments, the effect of which would 
be to add British Columbia as a fifth region to which the federal 
veto over constitutional amendments would apply. It is to that 
amendment I rise to speak today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to support this motion which will allow the federal 
veto to be used to protect the interests of all parts of this country, 
that is to say Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, the Atlantic 
provinces, and the Prairie provinces, since their consent will be 
required before we proceed with any constitutional change.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendment to Bill C-110 is the result of the government 
having listened to the members of its own caucus, having listened 
to members of Parliament and senators from British Columbia and 
having listened to the population of British Columbia, all of whom 
clearly and convincingly expressed their views and those of their 
constituents to the effect that the time has come for British 
Columbia to be recognized as a region for the purposes of the 
legislation.
<P>
	The change also reflects the position adopted by the leader of the 
third party who spoke in the House on November 29. On that day 
he asked that the government recognize ``the concerns and aspira-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17518"> 17518 </A></B>
<P>
tions of British  Columbia, the third most populous province in the 
country, as a region in its own right''. We listened to that as well.
<P>
	Bill C-110, as amended, responds to the need for realistic 
reflection of British Columbia's status as a specific region of 
Canada. British Columbia is one of the most rapidly growing 
provinces with 12 per cent of the country's population and almost 
42 per cent of the population of the western provinces.
<P>
	Beyond this the province's economy and its position on the 
Pacific make it different from the provinces in the prairies. This 
recognition coincides with the position that B.C. governments have 
taken for over 20 years. Indeed it was a position of Premier W. A. 
C. Bennett in 1971 that British Columbia should be recognized for 
constitutional purposes as a separate region.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The recognition of British Columbia as the fifth region is 
consistent with the position taken by New Democratic Party 
members from British Columbia before the Beaudoin-Edwards 
Committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is also consistent with the case British Columbia has made in 
recent years with some success that one of the three western 
positions on the supreme court bench be reserved for that province 
on a permanent basis.
<P>
	As to Alberta and the other prairie provinces, it should also be 
noted that the bill as amended will give a veto to a combination of 
three prairie provinces, that is to say two or more of Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and Alberta representing at least 50 per cent of the 
regional population.
<P>
	Given the population figures, the amendment would provide as a 
matter of practical fact a veto for Alberta because it has over 50 per 
cent of the prairie region's population. At the same time, however, 
Alberta alone cannot consent to an amendment due to the minimum 
requirement of the approval of two provinces. The other prairie 
provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, could defeat an Alberta 
consent.
<P>
	The federal government has listened carefully to the case made 
for British Columbia as a separate region. We have been convinced 
and we have acted quickly to make the change. In particular our 
own members of caucus from British Columbia who vigorously 
made the case for the recognition of their province as a region have 
made a real difference in the debate.
<P>
	The government has concluded that the arguments favouring 
recognition of British Columbia, its size, its population, its 
contribution to the Canadian economy and its Pacific positioning, 
were compelling.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We believe that contrary to what is being said by those who 
always try to belittle what we want to do and who always say no, 
this bill and this resolution will contribute to Canadian unity and 
will reinforce the fabric of this country and the bonds between 
regions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, ``the 
Prime Minister has missed the boat with his reform proposals'' 
wrote Mario Fontaine in Friday's edition of the daily <I>La Presse</I>. 
The journalist was commenting the SOM poll published that day.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is probably the victim of political amnesia, 
but Quebecers have a long memory. They remember all the 
promises that the Prime Minister made to get their votes. The 
helmsman of the constitutional <I>Titanic</I> has not delivered, and the 
way things are going he, himself, will be responsible for Quebec 
sovereignty. Quebecers are fed up and they will let the Prime 
Minister and his henchmen know soon enough.
<P>
	The poll I was referring to shows without a doubt that Quebecers 
are dissatisfied. The master of bungling, amateurism, and 
improvisation should not be surprised to see that his proposals on 
distinct society, veto power and the federal government's 
withdrawal from manpower training are rejected by Quebec.
<P>
	According to the SOM poll, not even one Quebecer out of four, 
or 24 per cent, is satisfied. Fifty-three per cent of Quebecers are not 
satisfied. Moreover, 30 per cent of Quebecers see the proposals 
from the federal clowns as clearly inadequate, while only 4 per cent 
think they are completely adequate.
<P>
	The last straw is the motion before us. With his proposals, the 
Prime Minister has managed to do one thing: get himself hated by 
all Canadians.
<P>
	Under the big top of the federal circus, the Prime Minister is 
continuing to perform his act of bungling, amateurism, and 
improvisation. Imagine, in less than 15 days, the Prime Minister 
has forced distinct society on Quebec, against the will of the 
National Assembly, and given a symbolic veto to two provinces 
that never requested it, but would prefer something else from the 
federal government.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Let me recall what has happened to Bill C-110 since it was 
introduced at first reading stage on November 29, not quite two 
weeks ago. Yet, they say it is a major bill. At least, this is what the 
Liberal government says, through its double talk. Why hurry, then?
<P>
	Bill C-110 was introduced on November 29. The day after, on 
Thursday, we started debate at second reading stage. On Friday, the 
government invoked closure to gag the opposition and the debate 
ended. On Monday, December 4, right after the vote at second 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17519"> 17519 </A></B>
<P>
reading stage, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on  
Justice, where at 7.15 p.m., the Minister of Justice gave his sales 
pitch. On Wednesday the 6th, the clause by clause examination was 
already going on.
<P>
	It was on that last day of committee review that the government 
did not see fit to make amendments to the bill.
<P>
	But the next day, the Prime Minister made an about-face and the 
Minister of Justice, surrounded by the British Columbia caucus, 
announced hastily that the Pacific province would also get its veto 
and that, consequently, Bill C-110 would be amended at report 
stage.
<P>
	The federal bulldozer continues to decimate and destroy the 
constitutional landscape of this country. This government uses the 
road roller on any reform of the Canadian yoke. The Prime 
Minister, through his justice associate, is pursuing his almost 
constitutional endeavour without taking anyone or anything into 
account. His narrow-minded attitude may cost him the next 
election.
<P>
	We owe Bill C-110 giving a regional veto to four Canadian 
regions to this same person who did not even want to hear about the 
Constitution during the 1993 election campaign. Today, we are 
wasting our time debating whether the federal government should 
add a fifth region. On top of all that, he tells us that he is fulfilling 
his referendum promises. That is nonsense, that is window 
dressing!
<P>
	Last Thursday, the Minister of Justice hastily announced an 
amendment to Bill C-110 in order to divide the western provinces 
into two ``regions''. The day before, he was still maintaining that 
the bill would remain unchanged. That goes to show how they 
improvise on that side of the House. By giving everybody the right 
of veto, the Minister is blocking any possibility of constitutional 
amendments for future generations.
<P>
	Anyway, this so-called veto is so meaningless that, as far as I am 
concerned, it could be given to P.E.I., Saskatchewan or even 
Newfoundland, I would not lose a wink of sleep over it.
<P>
	What is the real effect of giving a veto to the Prairie provinces? 
Alberta will have what amounts to a constitutional veto on its own, 
because its population accounts for nearly 55 per cent of the Prairie 
provinces' population. Similarly, the other two together will have 
the same type of veto.
<P>
	Last week, the Minister of Justice described these veto rights as 
negative, in that a real right of veto consists in refusing to support a 
constitutional amendment. In fact, Alberta will be able to block the 
Prairie provinces' right to a veto because one of the two conditions 
for exercising the veto will not be fulfilled. Two provinces with at 
least half the region's population are required, and the provinces 
will never be able to meet that demographic condition without the 
agreement of Alberta. So there is a negative veto.
<P>
	On the other hand, while Alberta can block the Prairie provinces' 
veto, it cannot on its own exercise a right to veto, because it does 
not satisfy one of the conditions required. It is obvious that Alberta 
is not two provinces.
<P>
	If Bill C-110 is adopted, four provinces will have a constitutional 
veto, i.e. two more than in a four-region formula. A constitutional 
amendment will require the support of a least six or seven 
provinces representing at least 90 per cent of the Canadian 
population.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	According to the 1982 general amending formula, we only need 
seven provinces representing 50 per cent of the population. That 
amounts to constitutional deadlock. I even wonder if Bill C-110 is 
constitutional, since it changes the amending formula without 
following the procedure provided under the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice ought to know he cannot do indirectly 
what the law does not allow him to do directly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester begins his intervention, I am obliged to tell 
the House that under our standing orders the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member 
for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing-Social Programs; the hon. 
member for Bourassa-Immigration; the hon. member for 
London-Middlesex-the Middle East.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to have an opportunity to speak to this bill. 
Hon. members will soon be asked to vote on measures introduced 
by the Prime Minister of Canada which recognize Quebec's distinct 
society and offer Canada's regions, in other words, Quebec, 
Ontario, British Columbia, the Prairies and the Atlantic regions, a 
veto on constitutional amendments.
<P>
	This is a bill of Parliament. It is not a discussion on the 
Constitution, as members of both opposition parties are claiming. I 
may remind them that the date set for discussions on the 
Constitution is 1997, according to the Constitution Act.
<P>
	Bloc members are of course against our bill, which means the 
government must be right and must be on the right track. Separatist 
members kept telling us and all Quebecers and all Canadians 
during the referendum campaign that they wanted was to be 
recognized as a distinct society, that they wanted veto powers, so 
we took them at their word, and we came to the House and told 
them: ``We listened to what all Quebecers had to say, and we will 
now recognize distinct society as a principle in the Parliament of 
Canada and we also recognize that Quebec has a veto like the four 
other regions of this country''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Put it in the Constitution.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> The hon. member for the Bloc said: ``Put it 
in the Constitution''. As usual, they will not listen and they did 
not understand when I said that according to the Constitution Act, 
we are to discuss these issues in 1997. This was the action taken 
by the federal government in response to the commitment made 
by the Prime Minister during the referendum campaign to meet 
the needs and demands of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Every day I receive correspondence from my French and English 
constituents, étant donné que mon comté est bilingue, who 
although they may have different ideas on how to deal with Quebec 
the majority recognize the different culture of their Quebec 
neighbours and recognize the need for change.
<P>
	The turnout for the unity rally which I attended was a clear 
indication of the overwhelming support from all Canadians, les 
Québécois inclus, for a united Canada that includes Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why recognize the francophones in Quebec as being a distinct 
society and not the anglophones? We could recognize the 
anglophones, but why? What would be the point? The anglophone 
culture is not in danger of disappearing, I know something about 
that. The anglophones are not being targeted by the factors 
threatening the francophone culture in Canada with its demise.
<P>
	Although Canada's anglophone culture is distinct from 
American culture, it will always be supported by it. The media and 
the telecommunications industry will provide an environment that 
will sustain the anglophone culture. On the other hand, there is no 
such support for the francophone culture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When we travel across the country we see the obvious 
differences from region to region. Nowhere is the difference more 
obvious than when one travels to Quebec. The difference in that 
province is accentuated by culture and by language.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Even members of the Reform Party will agree privately, but in 
the House, for obvious reasons, they oppose it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no denying the distinction of Quebec. That fact is that 
Quebecers are different from the rest of Canadians. They have 
always been different.
<P>
	The country was founded by two very distinct peoples, the 
French and the English. The idea of a distinct society began with 
General Murray. Very few Canadians appear to know their 
Canadian history. Wolfe beat Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham. 
The British won that war. The territory we now know as Canada 
was British.
<P>
	Very few people seem to know that when Montcalm died on the 
battlefield he was replaced by General Murray who knew the 
practice of military procedures, that when invading a country we 
should recognize immediately the laws and the distinction of the 
people of the country we invade. It was practical. The practice was 
to recognize their laws, their culture, their religion and their 
language.
<P>
	Like the Reform Party there were in the British mercantile 
society those who thought that Murray was going too far. They 
brought General Murray back to England for a court martial. Very 
few people would know that General Murray won his court martial, 
and the British government in 1774 recognized the duality of 
Canada and distinct society by proclaiming the Quebec Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I highly recommend to Reformers and Bloc members that they 
study their Canadian history. Canada is what it is because of its 
different and distinct cultures. If we allow these cultures to be 
eliminated, we will no longer be Canada, if fact, we will be quite 
close to being American.
<P>
	No doubt it is the francophone community especially that sets us 
apart from our American neighbours. I do not want to become 
American; I want to remain Canadian. Being a fourth generation 
Franco-Ontarian, I have the advantage of being able to converse in 
both official languages everyday. Although I am not a Quebecer, I 
know I am different from my unilingual neighbours, both English 
and French.
<P>
	Reform frightens everybody, including western anglophones, by 
arguing that recognizing Quebec as a distinct society gives that 
province additional powers that anglophones and the other 
provinces do not have. I challenge them to tell us what these 
powers are.
<P>
	Finally, the reason why the Prime Minister offered to give a veto 
to all five regions of Canada is to ensure that every province has a 
say in amending the Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Quebec, Ontario, the maritimes, the prairies and British 
Columbia will share the right to veto any proposed constitutional 
amendment that they feel would not be to the benefit of the 
residents of a particular part of the country and to all Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberal government believes that all Canadians should have 
a say in the future of the country and the regional veto will afford 
them that luxury. The introduction of a regional veto will assure 
equal representation across Canada. Each region will have equal 
power in these matters; no more, no less.
<P>

<HR>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Recognition as a distinct society does not give Quebecers 
additional powers or take any power away from anglophones and 
the other provinces. It gives Quebecers what they deserve: an 
essential tool not only to ensure their survival but also to develop 
their culture.
<P>
	A distinct society does not mean a better or more advanced 
society. The French-language dictionary <I>Le Petit Larousse</I> defines 
the word ``distinct'' as ``clearly perceived; clear, well-defined, 
different; unmistakable''.
<P>
	I hear a lot of noise coming from Reform members on the other 
side of the House. These people who claim that they want to learn 
French, who have suddenly discovered the province of Quebec and 
act as tourists, have finally realized that it is different. They tell us 
as much in the halls, but here, for political reasons and for their 
own reasons, which I find deplorable, they are opposed to 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> describes the word distinct as 
not identical, separate, individual, different or unlike. Those 
members of the Reform Party who have visited Quebec will know 
they are different in kind, not quality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Recognizing Quebec as a distinct society is not a reward for 
francophones or a form of punishment against anglophones. On the 
contrary, it is essential to the survival of Canada-repeat, to the 
survival of Canada-as we know it today. We must recognize 
Quebec as a distinct society for the benefit of all Canadians and not 
only for Quebecers.
<P>
	We as the federal government have a duty to ensure that 
Canadians enjoy the best quality of life possible.
<P>
	Every morning, we can see the negative impact our infighting 
about constitutional issues has on our economy.
<P>
	The hon. members of the Reform Party should take note that we 
should act now to give Canadians, not only Quebecers, a better 
chance to develop as a nation. Only by recognizing our differences 
will we be able to make any headway and only by recognizing them 
here, in this House, can we lead the way.
<P>
	It is high time that we give Canadians the tools they need to see 
the difference and make their country a better place. Recognizing 
Quebec as a distinct society and the regional veto are exactly the 
sort of tools we need.

	``Reform's hard line hinders unity of effort'' was the headline in 
the Toronto <I>Star</I> of December 10, 1995. The article stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But Confederation from the start treated provinces unequally, to 
accommodate their special needs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Protestants in Quebec, for example, have the constitutional right to their own 
school boards, as do Catholics in Ontario. That doesn't apply elsewhere-For 
25 years, Canada has been trying to find ways to give constitutional expression 
to Quebec's special identity-But Manning's visceral opposition to Parliament 
making any special gesture to Quebec is dangerous and divisive. It lends 
credence to the separatist argument that the rest of the country really doesn't 
care. And that gives the separatists more ammunition, at the very time when 
Chrétien is trying to take it away from them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if ever there was an occasion when one should not have 
been generous in allowing an extra minute, that was one. It is water 
under the bridge and we cannot veto it, which brings me to the 
whole point of the discussion today.
<P>
	Any one of us in the House could have vetoed the opportunity for 
the member opposite to add that couple of minutes to his 
presentation. We could have prevented him from coming forward 
for a host of reasons, some of which could have been petty, some of 
which could have been meaningful. Any one of us would have been 
able to prevent that member from finishing his speech. That is the 
nature of a veto and that is why there is no place in a constitutional 
democracy for a veto for anybody.
<P>
	We should compare the American constitution with what we are 
trying to cobble together in Canada. The very fact that a 
constitution has flexibility allows it to live. The ability to change 
and evolve over time is the lifeblood of a constitution. That is what 
allows it to speak to the people and the people to speak to it.
<P>
	Thomas Paine, in the mid-1700s, was an adviser to Thomas 
Jefferson. He had a lot to do with the gist of the American 
constitution. In Thomas Paine's book ``The Rights of Man'', from 
which I have quoted in the House in the past, he makes the point 
that every generation has the right and the responsibility to govern 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17522"> 17522 </A></B>
<P>
for its times  and should no more bind future generations to today 
than past generations should have been able to bind today to the 
past.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	A veto to any specific province puts our Constitution into a 
strait-jacket. It puts the feet of the Constitution into a bucket of 
cement. It also states that from this day forward future generations 
will be stuck with what we give them today. For all Canadians 
watching this debate, wondering why we are debating the 
Constitution when our country's economy is in such a state, that is 
the reason we should not have a veto in the Constitution for any 
province.
<P>
	If we are to have an amending formula in which a super majority 
is required to amend the Constitution, we should stick to something 
like the seven out of ten provinces representing 50 per cent of the 
population.
<P>
	Given that we will not be able to change this, because it is not a 
perfect world, in the Canadian barnyard we are all equal but some 
of us are more equal than others. It has to do with the residents of 
our province. We could all have a veto if we all moved to a 
province with a veto. That would satisfy that little problem. 
However, that is not likely to happen.
<P>
	What is the nature of the veto we are stuck with, the effective 
veto? The government has stated it does not have a whole lot of 
meaning or effect in some parts of the country. It has stated right 
here in the House that the next government can simply remove this 
legislation. However, it states that in Quebec it is extremely 
meaningful.
<P>
	I believe it is extremely meaningful legislation because once we 
have gone down that road and given the commitment of a veto to 
the people of Quebec, there is no going back. There is no way we 
will be able to go back on that ground.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has cobbled this together to try to save his 
political skin in Quebec or perhaps to save the political skin of 
Daniel Johnson in Quebec. He has effectively put our Constitution 
in a strait-jacket, which will make it impossible to change in the 
future.
<P>
	Why on earth would any Prime Minister give a separatist 
government in Quebec a constitutional veto which would prevent 
change of our Constitution for evermore? Surely if we must give a 
veto to a province we should give that veto to the people in that 
province, not to the government or to the legislature.
<P>
	Most legislatures are elected with a minority of the votes cast. A 
case in point is this Chamber. The Liberals have a massive majority 
with 175 seats but received only 43 per cent of the popular vote. 
The same thing can happen because of vote splits in every 
legislature. Therefore a legislature with a veto could use that veto 
even though it has not received a plurality of the votes  cast in that 
province to put it into power in the first place.
<P>
	A legislature could be elected three or almost four years prior to 
the constitutional issue about which it is being required to make a 
decision. Here we have a situation in which a province could have 
the right to veto constitutional legislation. The legislature could 
have been elected with a minority of votes cast and have been 
elected three years before the question at issue came to the floor. Its 
election, the fact that it is there and has the ability to veto the 
legislation would have absolutely nothing to do with its popular 
right to do so.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No mandate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> No mandate. None whatsoever. That is why in 
the regions the veto power must rest with the people and not the 
legislators.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Read the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> A member opposite says read the bill. It does 
not rest with the people. It rests with the federal government which 
may at its pleasure make the distinction of how that decision is 
arrived at. It is not required that it be by referendum of the people 
in the province, which is what I am saying it should be.
<P>
	My friend opposite earlier in his comments made brief reference 
to the distinct society. Very few people would recognize Quebec as 
being anything other than a distinct society, one which the vast 
majority of Canadians cherish as a fundamental part of Canadian 
identity. Most every Canadian recognizes that.
<P>
	Our amendments essentially reinforce that first, recognizing 
Quebec as a distinct society would in no way confer on it powers or 
rights not be conferred anywhere else; second, that there would be 
no chance to abuse minorities; third, one nation, the affirmation 
that we are one nation. These were the things we felt must be 
affirmed in the distinct society status.
<P>
	I thank the House for the opportunity to share a few thoughts. I 
ask the government to consider one other change to the legislation: 
make sure it is a popular ratification by the people.

	An Edmonton <I>Journal</I> editorial states: ``To hear some of our 
politicians'', and we are hearing them today, ``you would think that 
the Quebec referendum didn't happen. There seems to be little 
recognition that Prime Minister Chrétien made necessary promises 
during the referendum campaign and that he is honour bound to 
keep them''. That is what we are doing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has tabled legislation to keep his promises, 
and he is known for that. In his 30 years of politics he has never 
broken a promise, which is why he is so well liked by Canadians 
from coast to coast.
<P>
	However, we have to settle this dispute of Quebec separation 
once and for all. People are fed up hearing about it. People are 
disgusted. It is affecting families psychologically. Families cannot 
have a normal relationship anymore. Instead of coming home and 
talking about hockey scores or other things they get on the 
referendum and become depressed. I know this from my family. 
Whether in education, whether they work for the police force, 
whether in the Department of National Defence, entire families are 
being affected by this dispute. Let us settle it once and for all and 
let us settle it quickly.
<P>
	Some are complaining about why we are pushing this through 
quickly. It is Canadians who want us to act quickly. When people in 
Quebec voted no to separation they also gave us an important 
message to bring about changes but not to bring them about as 
former Prime Minister Mulroney did, dragging out commissions 
and committees and joint committees, et cetera. At the end of a 
one-year or two-year process what did Canada get? Nothing but 
more frustration, more disputes, more dividing of this beautiful 
country which was named number one by the United Nations. We 
do not want that. Canadians do not want that. They want us to act 
quickly and keep the promise we made during the referendum.
<P>
	This frustration is not only within Quebec but outside of Quebec. 
I hear it in my constituency. I held a recent town hall meeting just 
after the referendum specifically to discuss what happened and 
where we should go from there. It covered the entire spectrum with 
frustration across the entire spectrum.
<P>
	Allow me to quote a constituent, Howard Dunnick: ``Dear Mr. 
Flis, I object strongly to giving Quebec distinct society status. As 
for the veto, why should the tail wag the dog? We just cannot afford 
to let Quebec spend our money like drunken sailors any longer. 
They say they are one of the founders of our nation. If they are so 
concerned, why do they first lead us to bankruptcy and then break 
up the nation? In fact, they do not care if they bleed us to death''.
<P>
	That is how strong the feelings are at that end of the spectrum. It 
is not the majority feeling, nor a feeling I share. At the other end of 
the spectrum Janet Page says: ``Quebec needs to be brought into the 
Constitution. I do not want to lose Quebec. Bouchard does not have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17524"> 17524 </A></B>
<P>
the  best interests of the people in mind. The government should 
force him to bargain in good faith. We need an end to this''.
<P>
	That is the frustration at the other end of the spectrum. We need 
an end to this dispute, to this debate. At town hall meetings we have 
to allow the people to share this frustration. What I like about the 
process of a town hall meeting, at least as I observe in my riding, is 
that people get educated. They educate themselves. Initially at 
town hall meetings they are filled with anger, with a let them go 
attitude. By the end of the evening they ask: ``How can we 
demonstrate to Quebec that to us Canada includes Quebec?'' They 
are good debates and discussions: What is Canada? What does it 
mean to be a Canadian?
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	By the end of the evening the same group of people who had 
those extreme views are making suggestions. They asked me 
whether when I was the principal of Argentina School and it was 
twinned with Canada School in Buenos Aires the children learned 
anything. I said yes. They learned about each other's culture and 
language. There were student exchanges and project exchanges. 
That is a suggestion they give for us here in Canada. Others suggest 
that cities and towns should be twinning. Families should be 
meeting so they can talk around the dinner table and get to know 
each other.
<P>
	I was so pleased that out of the frustration grew these kinds of 
positive suggestions. If we go in that spirit and we accept the 
distinct society, if we accept that Quebec has a civil code for its 
justice system, if we accept that regions should be given a veto 
power-and I support the fact that this motion allows B.C. to have 
a veto power.
<P>
	I was born and raised in Saskatchewan, a third of my life was 
spent there. When we talked about the prairie provinces we did not 
include B.C. We included Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta 
and that is a natural region. B.C. has its rising population and its 
distinctiveness of trading with the Pacific Rim and everything else 
that the minister mentioned in his presentation. It is natural that 
B.C. is a region, the prairie provinces are a region, Ontario is a 
region, Quebec is a region and the Atlantic is a region.
<P>
	With that kind of check on changing and bringing amendments 
to the Constitution, we will see this country grow and flower like 
we have never seen. We have to be willing to share and to support 
each other, not like the Reform Party where the leader was the one 
who suggested that we include B.C. as a separate region. What does 
Reform do now? It is going to vote against this motion.
<P>
	It is that party which held up five fingers every question period. 
Why not B.C.? It got B.C. What is it doing? Reform members are 
not interested in Canadian unity. They are interested in scoring 
political points.  They are scoring political points down to the point 
where they are 8 per cent in the polls.
<P>
	I appeal to the Reform Party. I appeal to the Bloc Quebecois. 
This is Canada. It is the most beautiful country in the world. We are 
not building Canada for you and you and you and me. We are 
building Canada for future generations. That is why we were 
elected. If we believe in that, we will all pull together and pass this 
motion and the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have been saying for a long time that the federal Canada of 1867 
was a compromise based on a misunderstanding: the vision of Sir 
John A. Macdonald, who wanted a legislative union, or a single 
parliament for all of Canada, and the vision of George-Étienne 
Cartier, who wanted strong provincial parliaments, as well as 
powers delegated to a federal legislature that would be a creature of 
the provinces.
<P>
	However, the creature decided to become the creator and 
committed the sin of pride like our first parents, who paid the 
ultimate price, as will the federal system. Earlier, the hon. member 
for Parkdale-High Park told us how nice it is to have a resolution 
that recognizes Quebec's distinct nature, because of its civil law 
tradition. But we have known that since 1867. Indeed, subsection 
92(13) provides that property and civil rights come under 
provincial jurisdiction. Consequently, we were allowed, at the 
time, to keep our civil code which, incidentally, was in effect as of 
1866 in Lower Canada.
<P>
	As for our language, one just have to use it in this House to 
realize that it is different, that it is distinct from that of our fellow 
Canadians. The same is true for our culture.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Following the speech made in Verdun by the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister, there was a shortage of Tylenol to bring the fever down, 
and something had to be done very quickly. Consequently, the 
government hurriedly drafted a resolution providing that Quebec is 
a distinct society because of its language, its culture and its civil 
code. We already knew that. But what comes with that recognition? 
Absolutely nothing. This is a meaningless statement. No powers 
are granted along with that recognition.
<P>
	And to make sure of that, the government has introduced Bill 
C-110 and told us: under the resolution, Quebec is a distinct society 
by virtue of its language, its culture and its civil code. That is it. We 
will not get anything else. And to be sure that nothing will change, 
Bill C-110 gives veto power to just about everybody. I call that the 
Colonel Sanders veto power: a big chicken with legs for everybody. 
That is what our federation with vetoes for everybody looks like.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17525"> 17525 </A></B>
<P>
	According to what Mr. Jean Dion was saying last week in <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, from now on it will take the approval of the equivalent 
of 91.8 per cent of the population to change anything in the 
Canadian Constitution. This means that nothing can change any 
more. And the Prime Minister will be saying: ``There is nothing 
I can do now for Quebec. I would like so much to be able to do 
more, but I cannot because of Bill C-110. Heavens, has that piece 
of legislation ever put us in a difficult situation. I would have liked 
so much to give French Canadians, to give Quebecers the same 
rights enjoyed by Canadians in the western provinces and 
elsewhere''. So we are going to be stuck with that.
<P>
	The leader of the Action démocratique du Québec, Mario 
Dumont, was telling us the other day that because of the close 
results in the referendum, the Quebec government would have to 
start opening the mail. The one thing we are sure of today is that, 
with the bill before us, postage will not be very expensive: half a 
page, 45 cents. And they think that they will buy peace in Quebec 
with half a page.
<P>
	As my colleague from Joliette was saying, what Quebec wants is 
a white horse, not a pony, and I totally agree with that. Let us have 
something concrete. Before granting veto powers here and there to 
block any constitutional amendment, the government should come 
up with concrete proposals involving some devolution of powers to 
Quebec. It should repeal the preamble of section 91 which 
authorizes the federal Parliament to make laws for the peace, order 
and good government of Canada.
<P>
	This preamble has been used by the courts to grant the federal 
government unforeseen powers, for example, the general spending 
power, this national dimension theory allowing the federal 
government to get involved in almost every area, emergency 
powers and ancillary powers. All of these constitutional theories 
were approved by the courts, but were never foreseen by the 
Fathers of Confederation. If there had been Mothers of 
Confederation, the women would probably have realized at that 
time that something was wrong with the Constitution.
<P>
	The government should also repeal section 91(29) concerning 
the residual powers. In 1867, it was said that all powers that were 
not specifically granted to the provinces would come under the 
jurisdiction of the federal government. Think about the 
development of all the technologies, like broadcasting, cable 
distribution, television, aeronautics-we are now talking about the 
information highway-which could not have been foreseen in 1867 
and which automatically fall under the jurisdiction of the federal 
government, pursuant to section 91(29). These residual powers 
should be granted to the provinces retroactively, with a transfer 
period of no more than 12 months, so that the provinces can 
recover all of the residual powers which have surfaced  since 1867 
and the federal government can keep the power to subsidize it will 
need to exercise the powers the provinces will let it have.
<P>
	The government should also withdraw from section 91 the 
federal powers in the area of unemployment insurance and give 
those powers to the provinces as it withdraws from the field of 
taxation.
<P>
	If we add a distinct society clause, it should be enshrined in the 
Constitution and not be limited to the present clause concerning 
only language, culture and the Civil Code, or Napoleonic Code, as 
the Prime Minister said the other day, in a rather revealing slip of 
the tongue. The Napoleonic Code is used in France. We have had 
our own Civil Code in Quebec since 1866.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	So, we should have a distinct society clause enshrined in the 
Constitution stating that Quebec is a distinct society. The 
Constitution of Canada must be interpreted in such a way that the 
Quebec legislature is vested with all powers inherent to the 
recognition of its distinctiveness.
<P>
	We would then have an interpretive clause that would colour the 
Constitution. We now hace a resolution of the House of Commons 
similar to the ones we use to vote an anniversary or the end of a 
conflict somewhere. That is not really what Quebecers want.
<P>
	Section 95 of the Constitution says that agriculture and 
immigration are shared jurisdictions. The problem is that in the 
very same section, we see that federal legislation prevails when 
federal and provincial laws clash. Section 95 should be abrogated 
and immigration and agriculture recognized as exclusively 
provincial jurisdictions. The federal government should withdraw 
completely from these fields.
<P>
	We might as well abrogate the sections concerning the Senate. In 
1995, we certainly do not need this chamber any more, a 
non-elected chamber which is now delaying Bill C-69 on electoral 
boundaries, for example. Non-elected people telling us how the 
House of Commons should be elected, that takes guts. We could 
abrogate this at the same time.
<P>
	According to section 91 there is nothing in the present 
Constitution which specifically addresses the management of 
foreign policy. It was inspired by section 132, which set out the 
powers passed down from the imperial Parliament, the Parliament 
of Great Britain. We could add to section 91, under federal powers, 
that foreign policy is a federal jurisdiction, but solely in those areas 
falling under the legislative authority of the federal Parliament. 
Section 92 could have the addition that foreign relations are also 
under the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. 
Lieutenant-governors ought to be appointed by the legislative 
assemblies, as should senators if we keep the Senate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17526"> 17526 </A></B>
<P>
	Since today's debate is a bit short, I will skip over a few 
important aspects I was going to mention. When a package, a 
binding offer, is arrived at by the federal chambers, Commons and 
Senate, and the legislatures of all the other provinces, for there 
are many items that require unanimous consent, when that is done, 
then mail it off to Quebec and the negotiations can start. That can 
be the basis for negotiation. I do not expect to live long enough 
to see the day when postage costs will come down to a level that 
would allow such a document to be mailed.
<P>
	So the Mario Dumont yardstick of at least reading the mail is no 
more, and since October 30, since the referendum results, we have 
had the proof in all ways possible that what the government is 
proposing is a totally cosmetic change with no substance 
whatsoever.
<P>
	At both the report stage and on third reading, I will be proud to 
rise in this House to vote against Bill C-110, which has the sole 
merit of making the Verdun speech even more meaningless.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, let me begin 
my comments by saying that through these naive and 
inexperienced eyes, I view the debates on Bill C-110 and our 
resolution that calls on the House to recognize Quebec as a société 
distincte as some of the most important debates we have had in our 
35th Parliament.
<P>
	We have just completed another chapter in our collective history 
and in our search for ourselves. We know that chapters talk about 
the Vikings. It is absorbing to read about our First Nations, about 
Jacques Cartier and about New France. When I think about the 
chicken tracks that really are the depictions of Champlain's 
voyages across the map of North America in the 1600s, I find that 
the interest is nowhere near as exciting as the interest which is 
created when we study the human intrigue we see beginning with 
the conquest in 1759.
<P>
	That word conquest is such a terrible misnomer. Our Canada was 
never conquered in the traditional British fashion. Canada was 
never a classic British colony. In fact it was quite the opposite. 
Look at the demographics at that time. There were some 65,000 
French living along the St. Lawrence River, compared to only 
5,000 or 8,000 British. The first British governor, Murray, had very 
little opportunity to quash the French culture, its language, its 
religion, its customary civil rights, its civil approach to property 
management and property exchange; nor did he want to.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The history books tell us that Governor Murray Murray at the 
time indicated: ``I will govern by the dictates of my heart and my 
heart dictates clemency and understanding''. Those were some of 
the very first notions of the British governors in Canada. That  
commitment continued and it became much more formalized in 
1774 with the Quebec Act.
<P>
	The British needed the support of the French against the rise of 
republicanism in the United States. They needed to ensure that the 
French were on side. Therefore, with the Quebec Act in 1774 there 
were very strong and real commitments that allowed for the free 
exercise of religion, for customary property and civil rights.
<P>
	Those words are not very different from the words which 
included in this resolution which calls on the House to recognize 
Quebec as a distinct society in its religion, language and its right to 
civil institutions. I do not see the resolution as being anything 
special, unique or new. Rather, it is a very important reaffirmation 
of the commitments made to Canadians so very long ago.
<P>
	Distinct society was understood in a very real sense by my 
ancestors. They were United Empire Loyalists, loyal to the crown. 
They came up from the United States after losing the revolution. 
They United Empire Loyalists came up through the walnut trail 
into southwestern Ontario and found a society different from that 
with which they were familiar. Catholicism was being practised. 
The French language was being spoken. There was no responsible 
assembly. They did not understand the method of transfer of 
property. The fee simple method, which was so much a part of the 
British culture, was not a part of society in Canada.
<P>
	I suppose my ancestors were the first separatists. The United 
Empire Loyalists, who just could not make sense of the new 
community, the new situation, were successful in achieving the 
split into upper and lower Canada, right along the Ottawa River.
<P>
	As time went on the issue and the need for responsible 
government was felt very clearly in both upper and lower Canada. 
We know about the Papineau revolution of 1837. We know that 
Lord Durham was sent over from England to complete a royal 
commission. His decision was to unify the two Canadas. He felt it 
was the right thing to do. He thought it was appropriate because in 
his mind it would create a homogeneous society by bringing the 
two cultures together. However, that is not how it works in Canada. 
It does not now and it did not then.
<P>
	When the two first prime ministers, Baldwin from upper Canada 
and LaFontaine from lower Canada, came together to form the first 
great ministry, English was not the only language of Parliament. 
LaFontaine spoke in French. He and his colleagues from lower 
Canada were encouraged to speak French. As the Parliament 
moved from community to community, because there was not a set 
location, its members spoke in both English and French, without 
translation. Somehow they worked together. They understood each 
other. They took steps backward. They took steps forward and kept 
Canada together with two cultures and two languages working 
together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17527"> 17527 </A></B>
<P>
	I would suggest that it is that very heritage which has made this 
country what it is today. The acceptance of two cultures coming 
together to forge a common foundation has created Canada as we 
know it today: compassionate, humane, understanding, fully 
cognizant of the fact that to get along, to make progress, one does 
not have to deny a person's culture or an individual's history.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	While it is very difficult to do, we can encourage people to keep 
what is so important to them, that is, their own sense and 
understanding of their personal history. It is this that has made 
Canada different from Britain, different from France. It is what has 
made Canada the best country in the world in which to live.
<P>
	We still have difficulties and concerns. We look back and 
understand that shortly after Canada's 100th birthday in 1968 was 
the first comprehensive constitutional review. It was just a year 
after we celebrated Confederation.
<P>
	From then on, we know the history. It is a litany of referenda, 
patriation of the Constitution, constitutional commissions, 
committees. We have been through 20-some years of discomfort, 
confused about where we are as a country.
<P>
	Perhaps it is just the 100-year itch. Perhaps it is just a country 
anticipating a great future in the 21st century. If we step back and 
contemplate that, pull ourselves out of the reality as we understand 
it today, we may be able to find some important solutions for 
ourselves.
<P>
	As we have noted with the extension of the veto to five regions, 
Canada as a result of social, economic and technological changes is 
regionalizing quite effectively. I look to my colleagues in 
Dartmouth and Moncton and consider the work they are doing to 
encourage the people in Atlantic Canada to think about a different 
kind of political unity, the unification of the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Now may be the time and place when Canadians can step back, 
look at ourselves and ask the question, are we being paralysed by a 
paradigm of administrative doctrine of provinces that is 
constraining to us, that is making our clothes fit too tightly? Are we 
ready to break out and think of our country in a different way?
<P>
	Can we actually contemplate a Canada of five regions: a strong 
Atlantic region; a strong region of Quebec with its deep cultural 
heritage that is so important to making the country unique; Ontario, 
which leads the industrial engines of the country; the prairies that 
have such great natural resources and truly are the bread basket not 
only of our country but perhaps even of the world; and of course, 
British Columbia, a different and unique part of the country.
<P>
	Can we step back and allow ourselves to think of streamlining 
our country, bringing it together so that we can focus on our 
capabilities, on our strengths to build  for a future, to make Canada 
not the slow moving, happy leviathan that has been treading water 
both calm and rough, but create ourselves into a darting and 
flexible space ship with five regions. We would add, of course, our 
very important First Nations, all under the umbrella of a strong 
federal government that could direct a comprehensive, cohesive, 
united Canada into the 21st century.
<P>
	These are my ideas. We have so much to offer as a country to the 
people of Quebec, to the people of Ontario, to the people of British 
Columbia. I have great optimism that we have a strong future 
together and I would encourage the House to consider that as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciated very much the words that my colleague has just left 
with us.
<P>
	When the justice minister appeared before the standing 
committee when we examined this bill, we were confronted-at 
least I was-with the fact that in the bill it transfers power or 
influence to the provinces, yet, there is no definition of province. 
We do not know for sure to whom we are transferring the power. 
Are we transferring the power of veto to the provincial legislatures, 
to the cabinet or to the people of that province? This is very 
important. We saw during the Quebec referendum that it was not 
the Government of Quebec that kept Quebec within Confederation. 
It wanted to take the province out of Confederation. It was not the 
cabinet or the legislative assembly that kept Quebec in Canada, it 
was the people of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	If a veto is granted to the provinces surely it ought to be to the 
people of the provinces. The recent history of attempts to amend 
the Constitution shows very clearly that politicians will not 
represent the will of the majority of their people, as was the case in 
Alberta and in a number of other provinces on the Meech Lake 
accord.
<P>
	The people of my province had the Meech Lake accord forced on 
them simply because our premier had signed an agreement. He then 
came back, laid down the law to his cabinet and caucus and that is 
what we were going to be stuck with.
<P>
	If we want to maintain the unity of this country, as the hon. 
member has just so eloquently spoken about, if we want to appeal 
to those people who have vital reasons for staying within Canada 
and remaining united, then we ought not to leave the power to tear 
our country apart in the hands of the politicians. We must place 
power in the hands of the people who have a common sense feeling 
for this country and do not want to engage in these enormous social 
engineering experiments.
<P>
	I asked the justice minister when he was before the committee to 
whom this bill was transferring power because there is no defini-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17528"> 17528 </A></B>
<P>
tion of province in this bill. He said that it could be the legislature 
who could then  transfer that power to the people by way of 
referendum. However, there is nothing in this bill that mandates 
that the provinces go to their people.
<P>
	It is a little bit like the Charlottetown accord where there were 
provisions within the accord for the provinces to elect senators. 
However, some of the provinces, including Quebec, were not going 
to allow the people to elect the senators. It was the legislative 
assembly that was going to elect them. In other words, the power of 
appointment was being transferred from the federal government to 
the provincial governments and they were going to do the 
appointing. We cannot unite a country that way. If we are going to 
keep Quebec within Confederation we must transfer the power that 
this bill is going to provide to the people and not to the politicians.
<P>
	I have heard hon. members say that the people of Canada want us 
to move forward on this, that they support this. That is not what we 
heard from those who appeared before the standing committee. We 
had four distinct groups of aboriginal peoples who do not support 
this bill. These people are referenced in the Constitution. They 
should have been contacted and consulted just as the governments 
of the provinces should have been consulted. They are referenced 
in the Constitution as well.
<P>
	However, the government of the day did not have time for that. It 
rushed this thing through and it is still rushing it through. We were 
given 48 hours, as my colleague mentioned earlier. We were going 
to sit until midnight to hear witnesses if enough witnesses came 
forward on such short notice. Some of them would have to prepare 
with only 24 hour's notice. Is it not amazing that we were going to 
rush this thing through and we are being told that the people of 
Canada want this bill, yet we are not giving the provinces sufficient 
time to prepare, attend and express their views about this bill?
<P>
	We had the justice minister appear before the committee and tell 
us that this bill was constitutional. Some witnesses could not 
appear in person but appeared using a video hook-up in their own 
areas. Professor Morton, a professor of political science at the 
University of Calgary, stated the following concerning the 
constitutionality of this bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Chrétien veto law is unconstitutional, in as much as it proposes to legally 
change the amending process, without following the rules of that process. 
Section 41(e) of the Constitution Act, 1982, states explicitly that there can be no 
amendment to the part V amending formulas except with the unanimous consent 
of all 10 provinces and the federal government. The government's position is 
that because the ``veto law'' is not a constitutional amendment, it need not 
follow the amending formula. But this misses the crucial point that the 
amending process will have been changed and that this change will have the 
force of law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	He said that is the key point.
<P>
	The justice minister is telling us it is constitutional. This 
professor, and I am sure others if they had had time to prepare and 
<P>
appear before the standing committee, are telling us that there are 
very serious concerns about the unconstitutionality of the bill. 
There is an inconsistency in legal opinions on the constitutionality 
of the bill.
<P>
	I want to touch on some of the testimony made before the 
committee and some of the concerns raised by the aboriginal 
people. There were four groups. Grand Chief Matthew Coon-Come 
of the James Bay Cree appeared. Ovide Mercredi, the chief of the 
Assembly of First Nations appeared, as did Rosemarie Kuptana of 
the Inuit Tapirisat and Wendy Moss, her legal adviser. There was 
Zebedee Nungak from the Makivik Corporation. They all spoke 
against this bill. Why? They said it is going to affect their 
constitutional rights that are guaranteed under section 35 of the act. 
In fact, Rosemarie Kuptana said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Last week the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported on a leaked federal memo that 
explicitly recommended our exclusion from national unity and constitutional 
discussions as well as recommending the means to achieve that exclusion. It was 
based on a cynical and wildly inaccurate view that our silence or acquiescence 
on national and constitutional issues could be bought by making financial 
commitments at the local level on unrelated files. In its worst light, this strategy 
can also be viewed as a form of blackmail, progress on matters outside the 
Constitution or national unity will only come in return for silence on our 
constitutional rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That formed part of the presentation from the leader of that 
aboriginal group. I do not have time to go into all of these 
comments, but the Grand Council of the Cree indicated this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-110 is inadequate and unacceptable from an aboriginal perspective 
and we think will be found to be inadequate and unacceptable from the 
perspective of all Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We did not hear that many witnesses, but we heard many things 
said about this bill. The individual who spoke the most and made 
the most fundamental comment was Ovide Mercredi, chief of the 
Assembly of First Nations, who said: ``No autocrat is going to unite 
Canada''. He pointed out very clearly that Bill C-110 has not united 
Canada; it has divided the provinces. It has not brought the 
aboriginal peoples in; it has divided them.
<P>
	I simply cannot support the bill for the reasons given.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to the motion presented by the hon. Minister of 
Justice proposing amendments to Bill C-110 to add a regional veto 
for the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	The amendments to Bill C-110 reflected in this motion are not 
only a step forward for the province of British Columbia, but 
recognize the importance of the province of Alberta within 
Canadian federalism. These amendments show that Canadian 
federalism is flexible  and dynamic. It is an example of our 
commitment to make federalism work for all Canadians.
<P>

<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	With Bill C-110, the motion on distinct society for Quebec and 
the recognition of the essential provincial role in labour market 
training, our government has taken the initial steps to respond to 
the aspirations of Canadians within our local communities for 
change. It is change to make our national institutions more 
responsive to the diverse regional interests and on the basis of our 
unique federal state and change to deliver on the commitments 
made by the Prime Minister to the people of Quebec and to the 
people of Canada to involve Canadians at the grassroots level in 
building bridges of accommodation and mutual respect for 
diversity that will serve to bind our nation together in a common 
purpose as we approach the 21st century.
<P>
	The unity package is a recognition that the province of Quebec is 
a vital part of our Canadian identity, an identity which has as its 
basis the principles of understanding, tolerance and respect for 
diversity.
<P>
	The motion on distinct society reflects an important part of the 
Canadian reality, the unique character of Quebec within our federal 
state. The Government of Alberta has recognized the unique nature 
of Quebec's language, culture and civil law traditions. The March 
1992 report by the special select committee of the legislative 
assembly of Alberta advocated recognition of Quebec as a distinct 
society with recognition to include matters of language, culture and 
civil law.
<P>
	Leadership candidate Ralph Klein was a member of the 
provincial government in 1992 and campaigned in favour of the 
Charlottetown accord which contained the principle of distinct 
society within Canada. Premier Klein has acknowledged that the 
province of Quebec is distinct within Canada: ``There is something 
distinct in terms of civil law, language, tradition and culture that 
makes Quebec distinct''. That is from the October 24 Calgary 
<I>Herald</I>.
<P>
	The regional veto formula contained in Bill C-110 is in accord 
with the Reform Party's vision as expressed on October 15, 1995 in 
its 20 measures to modernize Canada. The Reform Party supported 
the concept that all future constitutional amendments be approved 
by majorities in all regions of Canada through a referendum. I 
would remind the Reform Party that Bill C-110 leaves the regions 
with an option as to how they would apply their regional veto as an 
expression of the will of the people. As an Albertan I would expect 
the province of Alberta would use the referendum act passed in 
1992 to reflect the will of Albertans.
<P>
	The residents of my constituency of Edmonton East may not 
have developed consensus on the nature of changes required to 
renew Canadian federalism but make no mistake: passion for this 
country and the resolve to  ensure its unity is felt by all in 
Edmonton East. Residents in Edmonton East share with Quebecers 
the same values of seeking constructive and positive changes to 
build a more effective Canada for the 21st century.
<P>
	Let me stress for the record that this package is the first step and 
only a first step. The next step must involve Canadians in defining 
the change. Dictating the 20 terms of secession from Confederation 
from the political backrooms as Reform did without the active 
involvement or participation of Canadians in our local 
communities is not consultation. We must begin the process by 
sitting down with Canadians in our cities, in our towns, and in our 
communities to come to a better understanding of our similarities 
and our differences as Canadians and how we can work together to 
meet the aspirations for positive and constructive change that will 
make Canada work more effectively and efficiently for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	We are a better nation when we pull together, building on our 
common aspirations for change and respecting our diversities. We 
are a better nation when we work for the common Canadian interest 
rather than the narrow regional or provincial self-interest. History 
proves it. Over the past 128 years Canadian federalism has shown 
an amazing resiliency. While federalism may have bent at times, it 
has never been broken. That is a tribute to the generosity of the 
Canadian spirit to adapt to changing circumstances through 
creativity and innovation.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	We have successfully met all the challenges over the past 128 
years. Our network of social programs are the envy of the world. 
Medicare, the Canada pension plan, support for the disadvantaged 
and the disabled; these were all implemented through the process 
of consensus and agreement among Canadians.
<P>
	We can meet the challenges of renewing Canadian federalism as 
long as we work together as Canadians in a spirit of mutual respect, 
understanding and co-operation. That is the genius of our federal 
system.
<P>
	I welcome constructive dialogue with the people of Alberta on 
the implications of change. I believe it is important that Albertans 
be able to speak out on change. That is the basis of our economic 
and parliamentary democracy.
<P>
	Our Prime Minister has acknowledged the need to involve 
Canadians in the process of defining change. That is why he has 
indicated that Bill C-110 will serve only as a bridge until the formal 
review of the amending formula which is required by April 1997. 
As we lead up to that formal review, our government is receptive to 
new proposals by Canadians that will better reflect the principles of 
regional equality and equity in the process of constitutional 
amendment.
<P>
	I will be consulting with the people in the communities of 
Edmonton East as to what steps we can take as a government to 
better reflect the principle of provincial  equality within the 
amending formula and what steps we can take to build bridges of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17530"> 17530 </A></B>
<P>
accommodation between the people of Quebec and all regions of 
Canada.
<P>
	I would like to talk about a series of unity initiatives that were 
held in Edmonton East two weeks ago. The purpose of the forums 
and the round tables was to develop a better understanding of the 
issues of distinct society and regional veto and to provide 
Edmonton East constituents with an opportunity to express their 
thoughts and feelings on Canadian unity, to define the desired 
changes to federalism and to develop actions that individuals, our 
government and groups can take within our communities to 
enhance Canadian unity.
<P>
	These forums involved a wide range of participants within 
Edmonton East: school children, families, the business community, 
francophone Albertans and representatives from our multicultural 
communities. I invited the member for Vaudreuil to discuss with 
the constituents of Edmonton East what the people of Quebec want 
and need from Canadian federalism and to explore the changes that 
are required to respect and value our distinctiveness and to enhance 
our shared aspirations for change within a strong and united 
Canada.
<P>
	We examined four questions: How are you feeling and what are 
you thinking about the Quebec referendum and Canadian unity? 
When we talk about language, culture and institutions, how are the 
people from Quebec and Alberta different and how are they 
similar? Given our differences, what changes to our Confederation 
do we need to make to accommodate the needs and aspirations of 
both the people of Alberta and Quebec? What can you and I as 
individuals who live, work and go to school in Edmonton East do to 
enhance Canadian unity? It would be useful and interesting for us 
to ponder some of the responses to these four questions. I would be 
happy to share the report with anybody who is interested.
<P>
	On the Quebec referendum and Canadian unity: ``There is a great 
anxiety as to what is going to happen next. Canadian unity is 
fragile. The referendum was a real wake-up call for all Canadians''. 
A second quote: ``We must explore comprehensive change to 
Canadian federalism. We cannot continue to apply band-aid 
solutions''.
<P>
	To the question of how people of Quebec and Alberta are 
different and how they are similar: ``The differences between us are 
well known. We have diverse cultural aspirations. The real test is 
whether Canadians are prepared to accept these cultural differences 
and aspirations in a spirit of respect and understanding''.
<P>
	To conclude, these are not the comments of people who are 
preoccupied with secession and separation as are the Reform Party 
and the Bloc Quebecois. These are the comments of people who 
want to be involved in a process of defining changes that are 
necessary to respect our distinctiveness, value our diversity and 
reflect our shared aspirations for a strong and united Canada.
<P>
	Frankly, Canadians are tired of the politics of discord and 
division that seem to be the agenda of the Reform Party and the 
Bloc. I can give my assurance to the residents of Edmonton East 
that I will continue to take their suggestions for constructive and 
positive change to Ottawa, to our Prime Minister and to the unity 
committee.
<P>
	Let us acknowledge what the unity package is, that it is the first 
step. Let us move on to the second step, to build bridges between 
our communities, between our provinces and between our regions. 
Let us build the case for Canada by involving all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-110 introduced by the 
federal government. This bill is suppose to legislate the changes the 
Prime Minister promised during the referendum campaign. In 
addition to Bill C-110, we also have motion No. 26 on the distinct 
society and the changes in manpower training.
<P>
	Quite a menu, all these changes, at least the federal Liberals 
seem to think so. Just think, the Prime Minister went on national 
television during the referendum to announce sweeping changes if 
the no side won. Quite a menu, according to the federalists. But 
Quebecers feel they are looking at an empty plate. There is nothing 
here to satisfy Quebec's legitimate demands. Nothing to meet the 
expectations of Quebecers who believed the Prime Minister's 
promises made in haste towards the end of the referendum 
campaign and served up with a catch in the throat and, almost, a 
tear in the eye.
<P>
	The no side won in a photo finish: 50.6 per cent of the voters said 
no, and many of them believed in the last minute national farce 
produced by the little guy from Shawinigan. On the other hand, 
49.4 per cent of Quebecers said yes, in fact 56 per cent said yes in 
the little guy's part of the country. Most revealing.
<P>
	The message from Quebecers was clear, and it will be even more 
so next time. Meanwhile, we have to live with the Prime Minister's 
initiatives which clearly show he did not get the message. In fact, 
will he ever get the message? Will he ever understand what 
Quebecers really want? In light of the changes he proposes and of 
his previous actions toward Quebec, it is easy to conclude that the 
Prime Minister is out of touch with Quebec and that his roots are 
Canadian from coast to coast first and foremost.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the hon. member for Shawinigan is 
following in the footsteps of the illustrious Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 
who has always advocated Canadian unity, equality among the 
provinces, and individual rights and freedoms above all, especially 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17531"> 17531 </A></B>
<P>
with a view to checking Quebec's momentum. These Liberal 
politicians have always believed in 10 little provinces that are 
equal  and subordinate to a dominant central state, the Government 
of Canada.
<P>
	How can someone who has been soaking in this kind of 
atmosphere for 30 years not become contaminated? Can we hold 
this against the Prime Minister? Of course, it is not easy to break 
from the past and the illustrious Trudeau and to amend this 
outdated concept that lives on in federalist minds. Too bad for 
them. But is it their choice and their problem.
<P>
	In this regard, I recently had a discussion with a remarkable 
constituent of mine, Bernard Gilles Grenier, whom I salute, who 
remembered a time when he rubbed shoulders with eminent 
Quebec federalists. He told me: ``They have always wanted to 
clobber us separatists. From Trudeau to the current Prime Minister. 
But we should not worry, because Quebecers evolve much more 
quickly than those people. Problems cannot be resolved by using 
such gutter language or by stooping to that level. I can tell you from 
experience''.
<P>
	We must also acknowledge the giant step taken by Quebecers 
between the 1980 referendum and the one held in October. With 
popular support having grown from 40 to 50 per cent, Quebec's 
sovereignty is at hand, and Bill C-110 as well as the other 
meaningless measures improvised by the Prime Minister will 
certainly not quash Quebecers' will to build a country of their own.
<P>
	In this regard, editorialist Alain Dubuc wrote the following in 
the November 29 edition of <I>La Presse</I>: ``But this beginning of a 
reform remains too modest and too uncertain to represent a 
proposal acceptable to Quebecers and constitute a credible 
alternative to the sovereignist movement''.
<P>
	In his editorial comment entitled ``Quebecers want more, much 
more'', Alain Dubuc goes on to say: ``Let there be no mistake. Had 
the Prime Minister declared during the referendum campaign that 
all Canada had to offer in terms of prospects for change were the 
three proposals put forward on Monday, the yes side would have 
won''. It is interesting to note that Mr. Dubuc had sided with the no 
camp throughout the campaign.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Earlier, I commented on the Prime Minister being out of touch 
with Quebec and not understanding Quebec. Mr. Dubuc, a 
federalist editorialist at <I>La Presse</I>, a newspaper owned by Paul 
Desmarais, who pulls the strings of this Liberal government, 
supported my position on occasions in recent articles. First, on 
November 29, when he wrote: ``This first and rather timid effort 
shows mainly that the Liberal government is having a real hard 
time understanding what is going on in Quebec''.
<P>
	And second, on December 8, Mr. Dubuc wrote: ``The Prime 
Minister is showing that he does not understand all that well the 
country that he is seeking to  save and that he is not living in the 
same world as the Quebecers he has to convince''.
<P>
	Mr. Dubuc is quite clear: the Liberal proposals just do not cut it. 
That opinion is clearly confirmed by a SOM<I>-La Presse-Droit de 
parole</I> poll released on December 8. The results of that poll are 
very telling, since 53 per cent of Quebecers find the proposals 
inadequate, and 30 per cent even find them totally inadequate. Is 
that clear enough?
<P>
	Then there is Claude Ryan who, on Friday, during 
Radio-Québec's <I>Droit de parole</I>, said that he too felt these offers 
were inadequate. Coming from such a firm believer in the 
Canadian cause, this is quite the statement.
<P>
	The veto proposed by the Minister of Justice is part of that last 
minute plan. That second element once again created a circus-like 
atmosphere, something at which the Liberals are expert. That 
second element, that proposal to ``loan'' the federal veto, was 
condemned by just about every major stakeholder in Canadian 
politics. From coast to coast, opponents rose to strongly condemn 
that proposal. The Mercredis, Filmons, Romanows, as well as the 
Reform Party leader and, yesterday, the Conservative leader, all 
condemned the plan.
<P>
	We, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, will have nothing to do 
with this bill, which contributes nothing to the debate. As pointed 
out by our leader, it is, at best, a diversion used by the Liberal 
government to silence those who criticize it for not doing anything 
about the constitutional issue, for making promises and for 
misleading the public.
<P>
	This bill, which, following the minister's amendment, gives a 
veto to five regions, is a political maneuver that does not change in 
any way the substantive issue that concerns Quebec and Canada. 
The Minister of Justice himself has said that it does not change the 
Constitution and that it is primarily a form of self-discipline on the 
part of the federal government. Actually, the federal government is 
resorting to self-discipline in order to avoid giving too much to 
Quebec.
<P>
	Suppose that the federal government acted as if it wanted to give 
an advantage to Quebec by transferring new powers to this 
province, for example under Motion No. 26 which recognizes 
Quebec as distinct. What would happen? Wham. The power of veto 
of the other regions would be invoked immediately to put a stop to 
any such intentions on the part of the federal government. This is 
the new self-discipline the federal government is resorting to. Yet 
the federal government is getting itself of the hook with this 
measure. It will be able to open doors to Quebec without any fear, 
knowing that the veto of other regions will slam those doors shut.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17532"> 17532 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore Bill C-110 will have a perverse effect. While solving 
none of our present problems, it will make it even more difficult for 
the federal government to transfer  powers to Quebec, though I 
strongly doubt it intends to do so.
<P>
	In this morning's issue of <I>Le Devoir</I>, Jean Dion wrote the 
following on this issue: ``The constitutional amending formula 
requiring the approval of seven provinces constituting at least 50 
per cent of the Canadian population was already considered very 
restrictive. Yet, this formula will now require the prior approval of 
seven provinces representing 92 per cent of the Canadian 
population. One can already imagine a few crafty persons coming 
to the conclusion that the approval of 14 provinces representing 
142 per cent of the population of Canada will now be required. 
After all, this would not be the first incongruity for this country''.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	In other words, Bill C-110 is a yoke, a straight jacket, which this 
country is putting on itself. The whole thing is becoming so 
complex that nobody believes in it, except of course the leader of 
this national farce, the Prime Minister himself.
<P>
	Those of us in the Bloc and many Quebecers are left cold by the 
federal proposals. We are light years beyond them, and Quebec 
sovereignty alone is acceptable and inevitable. This real change 
will take place soon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the more I listen to the debate, the more I 
am reminded of Sir Winston Churchill's statement that democracy 
is the worst of all kinds of government except all the others.
<P>
	Today we have heard many views of the solutions to the national 
unity problem we are facing in Canada. Regardless of how much 
we talk about it and to what depth we go into it, we must focus on 
the larger picture. The larger picture is that of a strong, united 
Canada. It means unity at the local level, loyalty to the community, 
loyalty to the province and loyalty to the nation as a whole, all 
blended together. That is what was intended by the Fathers of 
Confederation and great Canadian statesmen who put the country 
together.
<P>
	We are now 128 years old. In terms of years and of the history of 
other countries that is not very long. However, we are still 
experiencing growing problems whether or not we recognize them 
as that.
<P>
	The ongoing project for us today is that of being pioneers of our 
era and building a nation that was the dream of Canadians in the 
past and is the dream of Canadians in the future by bringing 
national unity into reality in a continent-wide country by bridging 
the challenges of geography, by bridging diverse peoples, by going 
against the pull of American influence, by bridging regional and 
cultural differences and by relationships between French speaking 
and English speaking communities.
<P>
	A book that I depend upon a great deal is entitled <I>Canada: A 
Story of Challenge</I> by historian J. Mr. S. Careless. In one sentence 
he goes into the diversities of the country but ends up by saying the 
book is a surprised and measured satisfaction that so much has 
been accomplished in the face of such grave difficulties''. He wrote 
that more than 40 years ago. He ended by saying: ``Nevertheless, 
the author's awareness that Canada throughout her history has met 
and survived repeated and rigorous challenges still gives him a 
basis for believing that she will continue to do so''.
<P>
	As we debate the issue today we must look at the larger picture. 
Instead of getting ourselves all tied up into knots about regional 
matters and who has a veto and who does not, let us be fair to the 
various regions of the country. Let us develop more and more a 
stronger and a more meaningful, deep and abiding national pride in 
the country as a whole. The depth of that feeling is called a national 
spirit or it is a feel for one's country as a whole.
<P>
	We saw a good example of that in Montreal during the massive 
rally when Canadians came together. Our loyalties are a three-tier 
system: the community, the province and the nation. It is a pride in 
the entire nation that will pull the regions and their peoples closer 
together. Canadians can and should have love for their community 
and admiration for their province and their nation at the same time. 
But we must tie it all together with the words and the term, ``love of 
nation-Canada''.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Premiers have a responsibility to their individual provinces but 
must not think of becoming a power unto themselves. A few weeks 
ago the premiers were going to meet without the Prime Minister 
because they wanted to discuss what the provinces wanted. This is 
why Canada should have a strong national government. It will pull 
the nation together. It is why the premiers and the Prime Minister 
must work closely together, not separately as the premiers were 
attempting to do. Everybody must see the national picture if we are 
going to succeed. We must have good communications and good 
transportation links.
<P>
	I have been disappointed with the Reform Party's tunnel vision 
on this, particularly the statement made by the leader of the Reform 
Party on October 28, when he said: ``the less the politicians 
themselves get involved, the better. We have a lot of work to do on 
how to handle the morning after''. The people of Canada expect 
their politicians to show leadership on this issue and it is what the 
government is attempting to do.
<P>
	The B.C. premier complained about other items in order to get 
his point across, but he sounded more like the captain of a sinking 
ship.
<P>
	If we were not going through this process now in the House, then 
the government would be accused of not  being interested, not 
living up to its commitments. Our response to Quebec is a 
necessity. In my view, our response to B.C. is a necessity. I have 
always considered B.C. a very unique part of the country. I have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17533"> 17533 </A></B>
<P>
visited there on many occasions and have a great sense of 
appreciation for it.
<P>
	This legislation is a response of support for those people in 
Quebec who want to stay in Canada and also to persuade others to 
change their minds, to come back and stay with the nation.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc states that he does not want any changes at 
all, that he is not going to accept any changes at all. That too is 
tunnel vision. Is it not surprising that it comes from a man who 
changes political parties like he changes his clothes?
<P>
	I believe today and I have believed in times past that B.C. is a 
different region of the country. I have visited on many occasions 
and travelled through the Rockies on various occasions. I have 
visited the site where the last spike was driven for the CPR. Our 
country should put up a sign there 40 metres long and 20 metres 
high. If this had taken place in the United States it would be 
advertised. It is a big part of our history. Let us be proud of it.
<P>
	After 1871 Canada were committed to building a railway across 
the country to tie it all together. The settlement of the prairies took 
place thereafter. I have visited the prairies on many occasions. 
People say that they get bored travelling the prairies. I do not at all. 
I think it is wonderful. As a person who grew up on a farm I have a 
great sense of appreciation for that great part of Canada.
<P>
	Ontario and Quebec have an industrial base. They have beauty, 
tourism and culture. I have visited different areas of Quebec with 
my family on many occasions.
<P>
	The region of Atlantic Canada is unique, friendly, hard working. 
They believe in tourism and practice it well. The people have a 
wonderful sense of humour.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Come on Canada, look at what we have. Be positive. Be grateful 
and satisfied. The good Lord has been kind to us. It is time we 
showed some appreciation for the gift He has given to us. For 
heaven's sake, let us appreciate it. Let us build bridges through 
understanding, not hate. Let us stand up for Canada and be proud. 
Shout out our national pride and look to our opportunities and our 
good fortune.
<P>
	Anyone can hate and criticize, but it takes a good solid Canadian 
citizen from anywhere in Canada to stand up and say: ``I love my 
community, I love my province and I want Canadian unity and a 
Canadian spirit that works together in a dedicated way so that we 
can move forward and do good things for Canadians today, 
tomorrow and the next day'' and send the message to the whole 
world  that we have a Confederation success story to tell 
everybody. We have that great purpose and vision in our hands 
right now as we discuss this issue in Parliament.
<P>
	Let us do it. Let us join with the Canadian people who showed 
their great unity at the major rally in Montreal and who sent 
messages across Canada when they could not be there. Let us show 
a sense of appreciation by coming together and finding a solid 
solution to the national unity of our beloved Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to make a few comments on Bill C-110, an act respecting 
constitutional amendments.
<P>
	I believe and a lot of people in this House know that this bill was 
concocted in haste. It was concocted to please the wrong people, to 
please the separatists. It has already been criticized by other 
provinces that are supposed to be pleased by it: B.C., Alberta and 
Quebec are not happy with this bill.
<P>
	An amendment to Bill C-110 was introduced today recognizing 
B.C. as a separate region. We knew that right from day one. Where 
has the Prime Minister been? Why did he not include B.C. in the 
first place?
<P>
	The hon. member for Renfrew-Pembroke-Nipissing spoke 
eloquently. He says that B.C. is such a wonderful place that they 
should have signs 20 feet by 20 feet. Where was he a week ago 
when the bill was brought forward? Why were they all sitting there 
so quiet, kowtowing to the Prime Minister who only consulted a 
few people when he brought in this bill?
<P>
	The issue is not five regions or four regions. We know that B.C. 
is a region. We have always known that. All the members of the 
Reform Party from B.C. have known that. The issue comes down to 
the Constitution and what this Prime Minister and a very few 
members of his cabinet are doing to it. This is what the Canadian 
public does not understand. This is what I feel is important for us in 
the House to point out, especially in opposition.
<P>
	The Constitution Act of 1982 has rules on how to make changes 
to it. If we wish to amend the Constitution, wherever it starts from, 
here or in the provinces, it requires the approval of seven provinces 
out of ten representing 50 per cent of the population. That is in 
order to approve an amendment. It also requires the approval of the 
federal government, the House of Commons.
<P>
	The government is now trying to share. It is arguing that it is 
sharing the federal government approval along with the seven out 
of ten provinces. It is going to share that with the provinces but it is 
not clear what ``provinces'' means, whether it means legislatures or 
whether it means the people of a province. It divides the provinces 
into regions and lumps them together.
<P>
	I do not wish to address five regions versus four regions. I want 
to argue that the government is tinkering  with the amending 
formula. By tinkering with the amending formula I am afraid the 
bill is going to be ruled unconstitutional and this is all a waste of 
time. We should be addressing what is on most people's minds--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17534"> 17534 </A></B>
<P>
and the very reason this party got elected supposedly was to create 
jobs-the economic agenda and the criminal agenda.
<P>
	The bill may be struck down as unconstitutional. As my 
colleague from Calgary West pointed out earlier, this bill violates 
the principle of the seven provinces out of ten representing 50 per 
cent of the population. By sharing it with the regions, whether it is 
four or five is irrelevant. The bill is now requiring the approval, 
before the federal House gives it, of 80 per cent or 90 per cent of 
the population. Therefore, it is tinkering. It is tinkering at its worst.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	It is all a waste of time to please some people in the country who 
will never be happy. They are called separatists. The more we give 
them the more they want. Why do we not stop the game, please 
Quebecers and please all Canadians and get on with making laws 
which are important? In fact, the Prime Minister was elected to not 
talk about the Constitution and constitutional amendments, and 
here he is doing it.
<P>
	If the federal government wishes to share its vote, why not give 
it to the people? Why not be clear about it? Why not give it to the 
people of the five regions? No, government members voted against 
that in committee. They want to give it to the legislatures again. 
The legislatures already have a vote through the seven and fifty 
formula for constitutional amendment. Now, whether the federal 
government approves or denies, the legislatures will be given 
another vote based on regions. That is ridiculous. It is a double 
veto. I do not understand that. If it really wants to have more input, 
if it wants to share its veto, if it wants to share its vote, then why 
not share it with the people of the regions as opposed to the 
legislatures for a second time?
<P>
	The reason we are criticizing this is that the legislatures already 
have a say. They have one say. That is great. If they do not get their 
way, then they will go behind closed doors and the leaders of the 
provinces of the five regions will make a deal. We want to protect 
the Canadian people against that. If Canadians are going to have a 
say, they should have it through referenda. That is why we are 
barking, loud and clear, about what we mean. I hope the 
government is listening.
<P>
	It is a double veto and a direct legal instrument. The government, 
instead of the House of Commons where it has the majority, is now 
going to share its veto with five regions. It gets worse. With the 
legislatures of the five regions it is a double veto. Now the 
government is going to give its veto to a separatist government 
from the province of Quebec. How in heaven's name are we ever 
going to make changes to the Constitution? How in  heaven's name 
are we ever going to unify the country if the government gives the 
Parti Quebecois a veto? That party will never vote on anything for 
Canada. It does not want to build a nation; it wants to tear it apart. I 
cannot believe how such a passionate plea can comes from the 
government side with such stupidity. It has failed to recognize who 
it is giving the veto to. It is giving it to the Parti Quebecois, which 
wants to break up the country. That province should not have a 
veto.
<P>
	The people of Quebec should have the veto. The people of 
Quebec should be able to stand on any issue which affects their 
Constitution and which drastically changes the rules of the 
Constitution Act. The people of Quebec should have a say. I trust 
the people of Quebec. They have voted already. Yes, it was close, 
but they voted to stay in Canada. That is who we should be 
pleasing.
<P>
	Why does the government not give them the same right if it is 
going to share? It should share with the people who helped 
government members stay in their seats. It should share with the 
people who helped to save the Prime Minister. It should share with 
those people who want to keep the country together. Do not give it 
to the Parti Quebecois which wants to tear the country apart. That is 
absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	The people of the country are smarter than what we become after 
being in this closed box for a year or two. That is why we need 
input every once in a while. That is why we need a little jab in the 
back or a pinch in the behind to wake us up. A little cool water, 
running fresh over our faces, will make us pay attention to the 
voters who sent us here. It gets too easy when we talk to ourselves.
<P>
	I cannot believe it. I cannot believe that the government will not 
listen. It plays politics with everything. The issue is the people 
versus the legislatures. We are making meaningful amendments, 
such as the amendment of the hon. member for Calgary West.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	It says in the bill that no changes can be made unless the 
amendment has first been consented to by a majority of the 
provinces. We understand that is the seven out of ten. It is kind of 
funny rhetoric-and the member for Calgary West has studied the 
Constitution extensively-that replacing two-thirds of the 
provinces would clear up the mess. It would clear it all up and we 
are down to the issue of whether we mean the people or the 
legislatures.
<P>
	If we give it to the legislatures we are giving it twice. We are 
giving it to the party in power right now for the next two years. If 
saint so-and-so gets elected as a leader of that party, who knows 
how long he will be leader? The country will be held up for ransom 
for time immemorial. A no vote means never and a yes vote will 
mean forever. Just once we have to lose a referendum and we lose 
the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17535"> 17535 </A></B>
<P>
	This is how serious it is, and the government laughs. It makes 
snide remarks at the Reform Party. I call the government to task. 
I am not here playing politics. I am serious about what I am 
saying. I am serious about giving a veto to a government that can 
never ever allow change. It should be difficult to make changes 
to a constitution. There is no question about it, but change should 
be possible with reasoned arguments and reasoned debate.
<P>
	I will end my comments on that note. I hope the Prime Minister 
is listening somewhere in the world.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMS">SOCIAL PROGRAMS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, some time ago I asked the Deputy Prime Minister 
some questions about health care and post-secondary education 
social program cuts.
<P>
	I pointed out that Liberal members were in opposition to similar 
but not so deep Conservative government cuts, but once they 
moved to the government side there had been a change of heart. I 
asked whether or not tearing down the institutions of health care, 
post-secondary education and social programs was a way of 
building a unified country. The answer was no, yet the cuts 
continue.
<P>
	The reports and analyses we have show that the government's 
cuts to health care, post-secondary education and social programs 
are the deepest we have seen in the last 50 years.
<P>
	The race is on to decentralize the federal government and to 
slash social spending, so say the slashers, to save Canada. 
Unfortunately the decentralizers and social program blood-letters 
may well destroy the country before they save it.
<P>
	In the wake of the rather narrow no vote in the referendum the 
government feels compelled to carve up pieces of Ottawa's powers 
as a show of good faith to Quebec and provincial politicians are 
champing at the bit for more power.
<P>
	How can the country achieve unity when the government 
continues to destroy our safety net? We do not have to be experts to 
realize that we cannot save Canada if its very foundations are being 
undermined.
<P>
	What about the interests of Canadians, particularly the interests 
of vulnerable Canadians? Lest we forget, social programs helped 
create a compassionate society and support the robust economy 
that now seems almost a nostalgic memory. Lest we forget, social 
programs greatly reduced the glaring inequities between rich and 
poor Canadians and between have and have not provinces. As we 
have seen those greater cuts, we have seen the inequities between 
rich and poor grow larger. Above all, lest we forget, Canada's 
health care and social system would never have come to be without 
federal leadership and federal dollars.
<P>
	Alas, Conservative and Liberal governments have forgotten that 
between 1984 and 1993 the Mulroney government killed universal 
old age pensions and family allowances. It also made two deep cuts 
to unemployment insurance and reduced the social housing budget. 
The government of the hon. member for Saint-Maurice has 
continued down the path of cuts and devolution. It has made 
unprecedented cuts to unemployment insurance and has announced 
dismantlement of the Canada assistance plan. The government has 
clearly forgotten the path which took us to unity.
<P>
	Throughout these changes Canadians have had no say in 
reshaping their social policy. As a result, allow me to voice the 
views of millions of Canadians who are trying to remind the 
government which path to take. Canadians are saying whenever 
they are asked that social programs played a major role in building 
Canada's society, economic system and political system over the 
last 50 years. Canadians are saying that social programs make 
Canada a distinct society and play an essential part in rebuilding 
Canada.
<P>
	Canadians are screaming that we need strong and efficient social 
programs for a strong economy and a strong Canada. The most 
effective social policy is an effective economic policy that invests 
in job creation, community economic development and skills 
development.
<P>
	Canada will not achieve unity under the government because it 
refuses to listen to what Canadians are saying. In the difficult 
months and years to come, the government must remember how 
social programs have helped to define the country. Social programs 
such as unemployment insurance embody the values of a civil 
society, one in which people care for and care about each other.
<P>
	Most important, in these unstable political times and insecure 
economic times it is crucial to remember how much social 
programs have contributed to Canadian unity. If Canada is to 
survive, Ottawa must provide courageous and effective leadership 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17542"> 17542 </A></B>
<P>
along the path to  rebuilding Confederation. It must stop slashing 
social programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was taking notes while the hon. member was speaking. 
He can rest assured that the government is definitely committed to 
the principles of medicare.
<P>
	The member should also understand that the reason we 
introduced the Canada social and health transfer was that we 
wanted to provide provinces and Canadians with the type of 
flexibility for which hundreds of thousands of Canadians called 
during our consultations on social security review. The hon. 
member is misguided in saying Canadians were not consulted. We 
undertook perhaps the most extensive consultation in Canadian 
history.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	The carrying nature of that consultation was shown clearly with 
the tabling of the new employment insurance bill, which will allow 
Canadians to get jobs and keep their jobs. It will help the most 
vulnerable in society in a sustainable fashion; not to mention the 
great work we are doing on the youth portfolio under the leadership 
of the Secretary of State for Training and Youth. During hard fiscal 
times we have increased the expenditures and investment in young 
people by $43 million to $236 million. We have provided 
thousands upon thousands of young Canadians with their rightful 
opportunity to gain the type of skills required for the new economy.
<P>
	I am glad the hon. member brings to the floor of the House of 
Commons some deep concerns, but he and his party can rest 
assured that we are on the side of Canadians, not against them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, last 
November 30, I put a question to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration concerning the fate of Anatoli Delets and his family, 
who came to Canada from the former Soviet Union in 1992.
<P>
	Immigration officials in Montreal are only waiting for the 
release of Mrs. Delets from the hospital to deport that family to 
Moldavia. Mrs. Delets is Jewish, and Mr. Delets, who has been 
held in custody in Montreal for several weeks, is not considered a 
Moldavian under the citizenship law of that new country.
<P>
	Where will the minister send them? As is often the case, the 
minister has shown no compassion towards the Delets family in 
spite of the difficulties and the significant distress they are 
suffering. They have no country to go to with two young children.
<P>
	Where is Canada's humanitarian policy the minister is always 
boasting about? This family is a typical case, and a very good one, 
where the minister should use his  discretionary powers to grant 
permanent residency in Canada.
<P>
	Again I urgently appeal to the minister, in the days before 
Christmas, to show compassion toward the Delets family. 
Moreover, the minister should remember that he too left his 
country to come and settle here.
<P>
	Another family, the Savas from Romania, is going through 
difficult times. Since November 17, they have taken refuge in a 
church in Saint John, New Brunswick.
<P>
	The Sava family came to Canada four years ago and has 
integrated very well into Canadian society. Since the youngest of 
the two children was born in Canada, he is a Canadian citizen.
<P>
	Mr. Sava is a mechanical engineer. He has just repaired the 
church steeple; the bells now peal every day for freedom.
<P>
	I pay tribute to the United Church for its support for the Sava 
family. The minister should be able to find a way to deal with this 
case. I hope he will not wait for six months as was the case with 
Mauricio Romero, a young Salvadorian who took refuge in a 
Calgary church to avoid deportation to Salvador. I had the 
opportunity to visit him twice, speak to his family and meet the 
pastors who were helping him.
<P>
	Why will the minister not use his discretionary powers right now 
to grant permanent residency to the Delets and Sava families? Both 
have been living and working in this country for several years. To 
deport them now is inhumane.
<P>
	As immigration critic, I have been made aware of several similar 
cases. I have noticed that the Canadian refugee policy is 
increasingly aligned on the policy of the United States and certain 
European countries that, increasingly, are less generous and 
welcoming to people in distress.
<P>
	As the international year of tolerance is drawing to a close, I am 
asking the minister and his officials to show some compassion, 
especially to the Delets and Sava families.

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am surprised the hon. member would try to call into 
question the generous and compassionate immigration system we 
have.
<P>
	Perhaps he is doing it for some ulterior political reason, but our 
immigration system is something we have always taken pride. We 
have been recognized internationally for our generosity, for our 
compassion, for our deep understanding of what the immigrant 
experience is all about.
<P>

	The government understands also the family's disappointment. 
There is no question about that. However, in order to maintain a 
system that is credible and fair we need to absolutely make sure 
we respect the law.
<P>
	The family has had the full benefit of Canada's generous refugee 
determination system. It has been found not to be refugees and 
must now leave Canada.
<P>
	There are other options the family can exercise. We understand it 
has requested removal to another country. The department has no 
objection to removing it to another country as long as that country 
is willing to take it and legally admit it.
<P>
	The other option is for the family to return to Moldova and apply 
through the normal process.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as the member for London-Middlesex, I represent many 
Canadians of Arab origin who are very proud to be Canadian 
citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many of these constituents of mine are very successful small 
business people in their own right. They were so in the Middle East 
and they have continued that success here in Canada.
<P>
	They have met with me a number of times to indicate they feel to 
an extent they are perhaps being under used as new Canadians in 
the sense that they have great knowledge and expertise of their 
former countries in the Middle East; an expertise and a knowledge 
they are very anxious and prepared to share with the Canadian 
government and with Canadian business people looking for 
opportunities for business overseas.
<P>
	These constituents of mine have made it clear they are extremely 
pleased and happy that at long last it looks as though the Middle 
East has entered a new era of peace. There will be a tremendous 
amount of rebuilding and reconstruction needed, particularly in the 
area of infrastructure of all types.
<P>
	It pleases me as a Canadian and as their member of Parliament to 
hear them speak so highly of the Canadian leadership role in 
peacekeeping in the Middle East. They are well aware this dates 
back to Lester B. Pearson and the Suez crisis and his tremendous 
actions then for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
<P>
	It seems to these friends of mine that somehow Canada is 
missing an opportunity to capitalize on the tremendous goodwill 
that exists in the Middle East toward our nation.
<P>
	What they mean by this is simply that they feel Canada is not 
being as proactive or aggressive as we might be in pursuing 
business opportunity which really are enormous  in scope. Most 
Middle Eastern countries would welcome Canadian business with 
open arms. While we are pursuing such opportunities, many of 
these friends and constituents of mine feel we need to be more 
proactive and aggressive.
<P>
	To that end, there is one interesting idea that has been proposed 
to me a number of times. It is the establishment of permanent 
Canadian trade centres in the Middle East.
<P>
	These people would see such centres as being run and financed 
by the private sector, by private business with help from the 
Canadian government in terms of protocol and business contacts, 
that sort of thing, government to government contacts which the 
Canadian government could provide.
<P>
	They certainly see the costs of such trade centres as being shared 
by Canadian businesses. They point out that such a cost sharing 
arrangement would be much cheaper than various Canadian 
businesses year after year sending their own representatives to the 
Middle East at a greater cost and probably with a less efficient 
result.
<P>
	I asked my colleague, the parliamentary secretary, two or three 
specific questions. Is such an idea feasible? Where has Canada 
tried such an idea? Does the parliamentary secretary agree that 
Canada can be more aggressive and proactive in pursuing trade 
opportunities in the Middle East when these countries are so 
anxious to welcome Canadian business people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I congratulate my 
colleague from London-Middlesex. He is a hard working and 
outstanding member of Parliament who has in the past and who 
continues to truly represent his constituents.
<P>
	I will first share with my colleague some of the initiatives and 
some of the things the government has done so far in the Middle 
East. In January of this year the government opened the embassy in 
Beirut. Also we have ongoing negotiations for a free trade 
agreement with Israel and we have approached other countries in 
the Middle East to have free trade agreements with them. Our 
support for the private sector is very strong. We are trying to help it 
explore markets in different parts of the Middle East.
<P>
	I had the great pleasure of participating in the World Economic 
Summit in Jordan where in excess of 20 Canadian companies 
participated. I have also taken a trade mission to the Middle East on 
a number of occasions. I agree with my colleague that the Middle 
East is an emerging market that will be the Giant Tiger of Asia in 
the year 2000 and beyond.
<P>
	His suggestion for a trade centre is an interesting one. I will be 
sure to take it to our officials. We have some of the finest people 
representing us in the Middle East with embassies from one end of 
the Middle East to the other. We have trade commissioners working 
extremely hard.  At the Department of Foreign Affairs we have a 
division working day in and day out.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17544"> 17544 </A></B>
<P>
	The people in the division responsible for the Middle East and 
North Africa work 24 hours a day trying to promote trade and help 
to improve relations between Canada and these parts of the world.
<P>
	We are delighted to see my colleague take an interest in the area 
of trade in the region and I would be more than happy to work with 
him on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.55 p.m.)
