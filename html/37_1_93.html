					 Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to the bill
					 entitled an act to amend the Foreign Missions and International Organizations
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill includes a variety of changes to the existing
					 Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act most of which are
					 technical in nature. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendments are designed to facilitate
					 international events including summits in Canada and to enable us to comply
					 with our existing commitments under international treaties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also correct several housekeeping
					 inadequacies identified since the act was enacted by parliament in
					 1991.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House may know, the Foreign Missions and
					 International Organizations Act provides the statutory basis for the privileges
					 and immunities of diplomats in Canada. It also provides the government with the
					 ability to deal by order in council with the privileges, immunities and legal
					 status of international organizations and their events or summits in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, existing orders in council under this act
					 govern the legal status in Canada of organizations such as the International
					 Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations and the Agence de la
					 Francophonie.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill's core amendment is key to providing
					 privileges and immunities to foreign officials who attend intergovernmental
					 conferences or summits in Canada. The amendment broadens the definition of
					 "international organization" to include international organizations and
					 meetings that are presently excluded such as the Organization for Security and
					 Cooperation in Europe and the G-8.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several years ago the Standing Joint Committee on the
					 Scrutiny of Regulations adopted the formal view that the present definition
					 permits orders to be made under this act only for international organizations
					 that are created by a treaty. Therefore we have the odd situation where, for
					 example, the Sommet de la Francophonie is covered by the act, as there is a
					 treaty relating to L'Agence and la Francophonie in that case, but the summit of
					 the Americas and the G-8 are not.This is an anomaly that we would like to fix
					 before Canada is scheduled to host the G-8 summit in June 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment would ensure that these meetings and
					 foreign officials involved obtain protection and treatment under Canadian
					 law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment in the bill that I wish to draw to
					 the attention of the House concerns the police authority to provide security
					 and protection for intergovernmental conferences held in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the violent protests at international events,
					 for example, Genoa and more recently the terrorist attacks in the United
					 States, it would be timely for the government to clarify in statute the present
					 common law authority for police to provide security and protection for high
					 profile international events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would provide that the Royal Canadian
					 Mounted Police would have the primary responsibility to ensure the security for
					 the proper function or a meeting of an international organization attended by
					 persons granted privileges and immunities under the Foreign Missions and
					 International Organizations Act and for which an order has been passed under
					 that act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions would make clear for greater certainty
					 the present authority of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to take appropriate
					 measures to ensure that such international conferences or meetings are able to
					 be carried out safely and effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would allow the government to extend
					 privileges and immunities to international inspectors who come to Canada on
					 temporary duty in order to carry out inspections under the chemical weapons
					 convention and the agreement with the preparatory commission for the
					 Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the chemical weapons convention, a treaty
					 ratified by Canada in 1999, a verification regime was established providing for
					 both reporting via declarations and on site inspection by inspectors from the
					 Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemical weapons convention requires that
					 inspectors be granted diplomatic privileges and immunities similar to those
					 accorded to diplomatic agents under the Vienna convention on diplomatic
					 relations.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that neither the implementing
					 legislation nor any other Canadian legal instrument can at present provide the
					 privileges and immunities up to this level for these inspectors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a temporary arrangement, privileges and immunities
					 have been provided by an order in council, which invokes less extensive
					 privileges and immunities. This means that Canada could be criticized as not
					 being in full compliance with the treaty. Therefore it is the government's
					 obligation to resolve this situation as soon as possible, and the bill does
					 just that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also broadens privileges and immunities to
					 permanent missions accredited to international organizations, such as the
					 International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, located in Montreal. ICAO is
					 presently the largest international organization operating its headquarters in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By enhancing our relationship with ICAO, the amendment
					 would improve the ability of Montreal and other Canadian cities to service the
					 headquarters of international organizations operating their headquarters in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended legislation would also help Canada compete
					 with other countries to attract these headquarters of other international
					 organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit to the local economy of such organizations
					 is quite significant. A 1990 study showed that the economic benefit to Montreal
					 and the international intergovernmental organizations located there was $80
					 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Montreal is not the only Canadian host city that
					 benefits from the presence of international organizations. Vancouver hosts a
					 Commonwealth of Learning Secretariat and Halifax of course hosts the North
					 Atlantic Fisheries Organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final important amendment that I wish to mention is
					 the clarification of the relationship between the Foreign Missions and
					 International Organizations Act and the Immigration Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment which is supported by the minister of
					 immigration would make clear that when an order is passed under the Foreign
					 Missions and International Organizations Act, the requirement to grant
					 ministers' permits under the Immigration Act is removed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the bill to amend the Foreign Missions and
					 International Organizations Act would allow Canada to live up to its
					 international obligations to grant privileges and immunities to international
					 organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments would enable Canada to continue to
					 safely host important international events and summits in Canada and thereby
					 fulfill our treaty responsibilities.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Surrey Central
					 I am pleased to lead the debate on Bill C-35, an act to amend the Foreign
					 Missions and International Organizations Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues in the Canadian Alliance and I resent the
					 sneaky way in which the bill was introduced. The first debate is taking place
					 four days after the bill was tabled in the House and three days after
					 opposition MPs had a first glance at it. We are debating the bill on a Friday
					 when most MPs are on their way to their constituencies for a one week
					 break.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is trying to slip some major changes
					 through parliament by hiding them in an innocuous looking act surrounded by
					 mundane housekeeping provisions. There has been no advance notice from the
					 government side, no media coverage and no press release from the department.
					 There was no legislative summary or explanation of any kind provided and the
					 Library of Parliament was not instructed to prepare such documents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no meat on the bones in the briefing of the
					 opposition by the department on Wednesday. There was very little in terms of
					 information regarding the legislation. We did not have time to consult and
					 debate it in our caucus. The opposition was not given enough time to adequately
					 prepare, research and develop an indepth analysis. Perhaps this was
					 intentional, and I am tempted to oppose it on that basis alone. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill amends the Foreign Missions and International
					 Organizations Act to modernize the privileges and immunities regime. This would
					 allow Canada to comply with its existing commitment under international
					 treaties and to respond to recent developments in international law. It
					 corrects the deficiencies in the existing definition of an international
					 organization. It attempts, perhaps as a marketing tool, to encourage
					 international organizations to come to Canada. It empowers the RCMP with the
					 primary responsibility of ensuring the security and proper functioning of
					 intergovernmental conferences. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This authority supports the security measures taken by
					 the Canadian police in fulfilling Canada's obligations to protect persons who
					 have privileges and immunities under the act. It attempts to give security and
					 protection a statutory basis. Security at international conferences will be
					 quite significant, especially in light of the recent terrorist attacks and the
					 upcoming G-8 summit in Canada. Despite all of these significant issues the bill
					 is labelled as housekeeping in nature. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposes roughly 10 amendments in five broad
					 categories. The first category of amendments modernize the legislation to
					 comply with Canada's existing commitments under international treaties and to
					 respond to important new developments in international law. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, international chemical weapons inspectors
					 that conduct inspections under the chemical weapons convention would enjoy
					 immunity at par with that of foreign diplomats. It would enable the inspectors
					 to import specialized technical equipment without paying customs
					 duty.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of amendments correct deficiencies
					 in the existing definition of an international organization. Traditional
					 definitions cover only international organizations of a formal
					 institutionalized nature based on treaty such as the United Nations.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unstructured intergovernmental organizations such as
					 the G-8, OSCE and APEC are not covered by that definition. This is a concern
					 because non-treaty based organizations are less accountable to Canadians since
					 they are established by an order from cabinet rather than by a treaty which is
					 then subject to review in parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Missions and International Organizations
					 Act went into effect in 1991. If this is a housekeeping change, albeit an
					 important one, why did it take the weak Liberal government over eight years to
					 correct these deficiencies? It has been sitting on these improper definitions
					 for eight years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows the government's general attitude of
					 neglect. The government has neglected so many important issues facing Canada
					 such as the budget, national security and safety, health care issues, defence
					 and agriculture, it is always taken by surprise by situations such as this
					 one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of amendments gives statutory
					 authority to support security measures for Canadian police to provide security
					 and protection to persons who attend high level meetings held in Canada such as
					 APEC, the summit of the Americas or the G-8.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that the legislation clarifies the
					 role of the police, but in the same breath the amendments authorize the RCMP to
					 take appropriate measures that are justified, reasonable and proportionate
					 under the circumstances. The government uses words like reasonable,
					 appropriate, proportionate and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyers make millions of dollars from vague words like
					 reasonable, appropriate and proportionate. The Hughes report on APEC cost over
					 $5 million. Bill C-35 would multiply that by many times. It might also curtail
					 freedom of expression, the right to peaceful protest and assembly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean that pepper spray, stun guns or even
					 bullets would be appropriate and reasonable? I wonder if this is an escape
					 valve for the Prime Minister to avoid political controversy such as the one
					 over pepper spraying at the APEC summit in Vancouver in 1998.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the Prime Minister and his government do not
					 want to clarify the powers of the RCMP and write them in common law is that it
					 potentially leaves room for political interference. They prefer to keep the
					 directions vague so that they can exert political influence whenever they need
					 to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could the police possibly satisfy the charter
					 requirements? If the bill were passed it would be an invitation for endless
					 charter challenges because the terms are vague. The words appropriate and
					 reasonable cannot be defined clearly. It would provide wide umbrella coverage
					 for the RCMP to take any action against people who are protesting peacefully.
					 This cannot be justified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter for debate and will probably lead to
					 many court cases. I do not understand what the difference would be then between
					 the approaches taken in a repressive regime that we condemn and in a free and
					 democratic Canadian society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-35 leaves no question of who is in charge of the
					 situation since it is the primary responsibility of the RCMP to ensure security
					 for the proper functioning of an international event.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department's shallow briefing notes state that
					 these amendments have no impact on the powers of provincial and municipal
					 police forces. Some members on the other side say that these amendments may not
					 give the police any new powers. Why are these amendments there in the first
					 place? Is it a sugar coated but bitter medicine?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law authorities of police forces have been
					 clarified in legislation in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Why do
					 we not do that in Canada? Our criminal code says that police officers are
					 responsible only to the law itself. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments may affect any number of outstanding
					 court cases to date of protesters arrested at the summit of the Americas in
					 Quebec City or during APEC in Vancouver, British Columbia. That has to be
					 seen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle there are few problems with clarifying the
					 role of who is in charge of security at these important meetings. My concern is
					 that Canada's police, especially the RCMP, is already stretched to the
					 limit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Police Association recently accused the
					 government of playing shell games with the security of Canadians. It said in a
					 press release that when it comes to security at our borders and airports
					 Canadians should not be lulled into a false sense of security. It explained
					 that the RCMP had to borrow from Peter to pay Paul. It means that the RCMP has
					 been moving officers to priority areas in the wake of the terrorist
					 attacks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the RCMP has to reallocate officers from one
					 assignment to the other then we have to study the impact of adding to those
					 demands and responsibilities without adding further resources. Could this mean
					 that when the G-8 comes to Kananaskis next year RCMP officers will be pulled
					 away from their duties providing security to our citizens and communities and
					 leave them without protection?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth category of amendments seek to clarify
					 provisions granting immunities from immigration restrictions to alien
					 registration and overriding the Immigration Act provisions that prohibit the
					 entry to Canada of inadmissible persons but not overriding the Crimes Against
					 Humanity and War Crimes Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the amendment, when an order is passed
					 under the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act the requirement
					 to grant a minister's permit under the Immigration Act would be removed. The
					 minister's permit would be granted by the Minister of Citizenship and
					 Immigration because it is related to immigration matters, but under this
					 amendment that would be overruled. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would happen if a leader or a representative of a
					 country happened to be a criminal or terrorist? The amendment overriding the
					 Immigration Act would allow for that criminal to have easier access to Canada
					 because he or she would be given access by the foreign minister or immigration
					 minister who may not have all the checks and balances in place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where would one draw the line on the nature and
					 magnitude of criminality? What kind of minor criminal act would be exempt? What
					 is the definition of a minor criminal act? We do not know. September 11 brought
					 security concerns to the forefront of everyone's consciousness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-35 would allow the foreign affairs minister to
					 supercede the authority of the immigration minister by allowing him to sign an
					 order for a foreign visitor to be admitted into the country who would otherwise
					 not be allowed to come to Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister of Foreign Affairs does not want
					 the House to rubber stamp this power grab.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a less neutral example, not a Nelson
					 Mandela, but a leader known to have committed human rights abuses or supported
					 terrorism, the government would have the authority to admit him or her on
					 political grounds, if they thought it furthered Canadian interests. What a
					 ridiculous idea.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives more power to the government than with which
					 most Canadians would be comfortable. Also, this power grab by the Minister of
					 Foreign Affairs creates a situation where a serious criminal would be treated
					 better and differently than an ordinary person with a minor criminal
					 record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would create a double standard. For instance,
					 a person with a criminal record, even a minor criminal record, would not be
					 allowed to enter Canada under special privileges. Whereas a spouse of a
					 Canadian with a minor criminal charge would not be. That person would be
					 allowed to enter Canada, despite the person's criminal record, but an ordinary
					 person with a minor criminal record would not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that criminals should be admitted to
					 Canada, but for the sake of this example it might be a case which would cause a
					 Canadian family to split. It could also cause a marriage to break down because
					 that individual, who may have committed a minor criminal offence, would not be
					 able to rejoin his or her family in Canada. Allowing the government to use
					 vague words like national interest is not good enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already clear that the act centralizes a lot of
					 power in DFAIT. Is it the bureaucrats, or the Prime Minister or the cabinet who
					 will decide? We do not know that because the bill does not tell us. The
					 amendment is vague and leaves wide latitude that can be abused or even
					 accidentally or unintentionally erred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that at the francophonie games a record number
					 of sports persons applied for refugee status. Imagine if the participants had
					 come under permits from the foreign affairs minister, superseding the
					 immigration minister. Where are the checks and balances? Who will find out what
					 their backgrounds are? It brings the immunity of delegates to international
					 conferences and international organizations into question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,
					 Canadian authorities do not have the right to arrest, detain or question
					 diplomatic personnel. Canadian authorities cannot search or enter their
					 premises. Also, the convention obliges Canadian authorities to protect
					 diplomatic premises. This also includes the premises of not only the diplomatic
					 missions, but also the premises of international organizations. This means that
					 a terrorist or a potential criminal entering Canada under the guise of
					 diplomacy would not only be immune from prosecution in Canada, but our
					 authorities would also be responsible for his or her safety. This is giving the
					 red carpet treatment for potential terrorists, spies from other countries,
					 criminals or even brutal dictators.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would do two things to supposedly improve the
					 immunity of foreign officials in Canada. First, it would expand the number and
					 type of people who would enjoy immunity. Second, it would deepen the level of
					 immunity they would enjoy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about extradition if someone under diplomatic
					 privilege is charged in another country? Could that person be immune and not
					 extradited to that country? We do not know that. The bill does not touch on
					 that part at all.</p>


	<A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth category of amendments are called
					 housekeeping amendments. There are many amendments, but one that got my
					 attention. It is disgusting that it has been included in a supposed
					 housekeeping section. It clarifies the governing statute for diplomatic
					 missions to import liquor into Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians still remember the immunity given to the
					 Russian diplomat who killed a Canadian citizen last year while driving drunk.
					 This was in spite of a number of previous drunk driving allegations in Canada
					 for that individual. I wonder if that Russian diplomat was ever charged for his
					 crime anywhere, in Canada or in Russia. We do not know that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question about this amendment is not duty free
					 status. I do not have a problem with that. The question is about the drunk
					 driving aspect. The bill does not mention any measures about diplomats under
					 immunity driving drunk or being involved in a fatal accident while driving
					 drunk. Not only that, according to the bill this murderer could be allowed back
					 into Canada as part of a Russian delegation to a conference. While he is on
					 Canadian soil, he could kill someone else and his immunity would protect him
					 again. That is pathetic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government now wants to expand the number of people
					 enjoying these privileges. This is a serious concern. Our briefing by the
					 department said that this section was to clarify the confusion over federal and
					 provincial jurisdiction in the area of liquor imports and diplomatic rights
					 because the liquor imports were a provincial jurisdiction. This means the
					 potential for harm is greater than before the bill was introduced. It
					 highlights the insensitivity of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of proper checks and balances is already a
					 problem with the general concept of immunity and the bill would only make the
					 matter worse. Maybe that is why the government is keeping the bill so quiet on
					 a Friday, when no one is participating in the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other serious concerns I have with the bill are
					 covered under three categories. The bill does not deal with so many other
					 important issues, for example, the corruption at foreign missions. The bill is
					 in respect to the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act. When we
					 talk about foreign missions, we must talk about how our foreign missions
					 operate. The corruption at foreign missions is a serious issue in the wake of
					 security concerns. Our security begins at our foreign missions abroad. They
					 screen people before they even enter Canada. They are our first line of
					 defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some strange things have been going on in Canada's
					 diplomatic missions overseas. Let me first point out that most of our diplomats
					 and foreign services civil servant employees are very honest, hard-working and
					 dignified individuals. I commend them for the jobs they do in representing
					 Canada abroad. However, I will mention that there are a few bad apples as
					 well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give some examples. In Damascus a Syrian
					 national skimmed close to half a million dollars in visa processing fees and
					 tampered with the immigration computer for years. The RCMP managed to recover
					 about a quarter of a million dollars from that individual in 1999.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the New Delhi and Islamabad High Commission offices,
					 corruption has been reported frequently. Based on the information given to me
					 by my constituents, I reported this to the immigration minister and the
					 RCMP.</p>


	<A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the investigation they fired some locally hired
					 employees based on the information I provided them. The question is who was
					 minding the queue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been reported that an office boy at the Canadian
					 high commission in New Delhi, who was supposed to mail out Canadian visas after
					 they were issued, did not mail them. He sat on those passports, hiding them in
					 his drawer, yet wrote down that he mailed them. Every passport had an address
					 so he sent his agents to the holders of these passports and extorted bribes
					 from them before releasing their passport. That individual is gone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Beijing an internal report for CIC warned of
					 organized crime groups providing fake documents to people interested in
					 obtaining student visas as a back door entrance to this country. According to
					 the facts, at least two-thirds of the more than 5,000 visa applications
					 processed in Beijing in 1999 were linked to organized crime. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Los Angeles three Americans from the Canadian
					 consulate were fired in 1997 after they were connected to theft and the illegal
					 issuing of visas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to reports, an RCMP spokesman said the
					 mounties had investigated 38 cases of fraud and theft in about 20 Canadian
					 diplomatic missions in 1998 alone. The extent of corruption and abuse is giving
					 Canada a black eye.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong the RCMP quietly investigated the alleged
					 infiltration of the computer assisted immigration processing system, we call
					 CAIPS, by local staff at the mission who were said to be linked to triads.
					 Remember these foreign missions are our frontline of defence. An estimated 788
					 computer files containing sensitive background information on criminals and
					 businessmen wanting to emigrate to Canada were allegedly deleted from the
					 computers. In addition, the RCMP probed the alleged disappearance of more than
					 2,000 blank visa forms from the embassy. We do not know who got the visas
					 issued on those 2,000 blank forms or whose files were among the 788 computer
					 files deleted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP confirmed investigations of a large
					 immigration consultancy firm believed to have used a secret diplomatic contact
					 and possibly a political contact as well. There is evidence the RCMP knew that
					 the suspect in the case of the missing Hong Kong files on gangsters was living
					 British Columbia. Some RCMP officers were puzzled as to why there had been no
					 follow-up on that information. According to a newspaper report that suspected
					 individual is living in British Columbia in a beautiful mansion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign missions are our firstline of defence for
					 Canada, but I do not see anything in the bill that would protect and restore
					 the integrity of our foreign missions. Despite an abundance of leads, the
					 discovery of fake Citizenship and Immigration Canada stamps in the office of a
					 locally engaged staff member, there have been allegations of political pressure
					 to cover up the investigations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of RCMP officers were assigned to the case and
					 then abruptly transferred just as they made significant finds, according to a
					 former senior employee of the department. </p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian diplomatic staff in Hong Kong were reported to
					 have been treated to nights at the horses races, parties and an abundance of
					 gifts. The RCMP investigated a night at the races involving red envelopes
					 stuffed with dollars. The investigation showed that what they were doing was
					 carrying on with corrupt officials at the horse races and giving them huge sums
					 of money. They showed that they won the money at the horse races and black
					 money was turned into white money which they could then bring into Canada and
					 do whatever they wanted with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases the whistleblowers were harassed,
					 punished and even dismissed from their jobs. Despite all that, no independent
					 public inquiry into these cases was held. It is pathetic. We need a public
					 inquiry into what went on or may still be going on in some of our diplomatic
					 missions abroad. We need to fix the system. We need to restore the integrity.
					 We ought to make it fair but there is no political will by the government to do
					 that. There is no political will on the government benches to restore integrity
					 in Canada's foreign missions. They are the defence line for us when people want
					 to enter Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waste and mismanagement in our foreign missions are
					 big embarrassments which have not been addressed in the bill. A civil servant
					 blew the whistle on the spending of millions of taxpayers' dollars to keep
					 Canada's diplomats in the lap of luxury. After senior foreign affairs officials
					 violated treasury board guidelines, that official blew the whistle and we know
					 what happens to the whistleblowers in this country. We do not have any
					 whistleblower legislation. I have a private member's bill on whistleblowing but
					 I do not know when I will have a chance to debate it in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to that employee, expensive sites have been
					 purchased for offices or residences but they are left unoccupied for many
					 years. If the official does not like the property, he or she is allowed to rent
					 another expensive apartment to live in and the initial investment is wasted.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One site was purchased in Turkey in 1958 and it is
					 still unoccupied. Why did we invest in buying that property in 1958 when we are
					 not using it? It is the taxpayers' money. The litany of waste and negligence
					 has been reported. Millions of taxpayer dollars have been blown on staff
					 housing from Tokyo to Turkey to Mexico. I am not talking about the utilization
					 of the money; I am talking about the waste, the real waste, the real
					 mismanagement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil servants who blew the whistle have been
					 suspended. They have been harassed and their careers have been paralyzed. Has
					 there been a public inquiry? No, there has been none whatsoever. Is there a
					 political will to fix these problems? No, we do not see that. Is there anything
					 in the bill to address these issues dealing with foreign missions? No, there is
					 nothing about these issues mentioned in the bill. This is an area of
					 concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important issue that the bill ignores is
					 Canada's membership in international organizations. I remind members that the
					 title of the bill is “Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act” but
					 there is no mention of Canada's membership in international organizations in
					 the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada belongs to many international organizations.
					 Perhaps we are the world's greatest joiners. Some organizations shut down in
					 the 1970s and those organizations are still on Canada's membership list. We
					 should join international organizations if we intend to do a good job,
					 otherwise we should not join them. We should not join them just for the sake of
					 joining. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the criteria for joining the international
					 organizations? We cannot find them anywhere in the bill. It does not address
					 that issue at all. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know for sure that the costs Canadian taxpayers a
					 lot. Canada's total expenditure on international organizations is difficult to
					 assess. A few years ago we wanted to do some research but we could not get that
					 information. Even the Library of Parliament could not get enough information.
					 It is difficult to assess.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One CBC study estimates that Canada spent as much as $1
					 billion annually on the United Nations and its related agencies. In 1999-2000
					 assessed grants and contributions to international organizations were said by
					 DFAIT to total about $275 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a tendency to view multilateralism as an all
					 embracing panacea. Its reflex reaction to international problems has often been
					 to support and even aggressively promote the proliferation of international
					 organizations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is the Arctic Council, founded in 1996.
					 Touted as a forum for Arctic issues and sustainable development among
					 circumpolar states, its precise purpose and utility still remain unclear.
					 Moreover, United States enthusiasm for the council is limited. As a result, the
					 council cannot deal with military security matters. It is open to question
					 whether Canada's membership in such organizations bears tangible relation to
					 our national interests. This concern is not new.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1928 the then opposition leader, R. B. Bennett,
					 noted that the Mackenzie King government's enthusiasm for signing international
					 agreements did not clearly advance Canada's interests. He questioned the
					 increasing evidence as the days went by of a desire on our part to find a place
					 in the sun by signing conventions and treaties, thus suggesting that we had
					 become a very important people. Importance in the world is not measured in any
					 such manner. In other words, joining a proliferation of organizations does not
					 by itself promote Canada's influence and credibility. Bennett added that that
					 is not a test of our greatness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current Liberal administration, Canada signed
					 the Kyoto, Beijing and Rio conventions without any intentions whatsoever of
					 implementing them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ottawa seems to be proud of its record of paying our
					 dues and frequently criticizing our major ally, the United States of America,
					 for deliberately falling into arrears. Whatever Canada's record is on paying
					 fees, no international organization that receives tax dollars should be immune
					 from audits by the Canadian government. If we pay the dues, we should have the
					 right to audit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example in 1995 UNICEF disclosed that $10 million
					 went missing from its Kenyan operation due to fraud and mismanagement by its
					 employees. Some $10 million from UNICEF was missing. In 1998 an independent
					 audit of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees highlighted serious
					 failings in the agency's financial management procedures, dubious accounting
					 practices and possibly fraud at a cost of millions. That is what the situation
					 is with some of the organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reviews show that we must examine the
					 effectiveness and utility of an international organization to Canada before we
					 join it. After such a review has taken place, parliament should decide what
					 course of action is necessary, whether we should continue our membership,
					 withhold the fee to induce reform in that organization, or withdraw fully from
					 the organization. </p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend that: Canada engage in international
					 organizations which clearly promote conditions for expanding Canadian political
					 and economic interests; the role of parliament be strengthened to provide
					 genuine oversight over the activities of international organizations and the
					 extent to which they serve Canada's national interests; Canada participate in
					 audits and reviews in the international organizations with a view to remaining
					 in those that advance national interests and consider withholding resources to
					 induce reform.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this is a sneaky bill which does not
					 deal with those important issues. It hides the important issues and disguises
					 them as housekeeping changes. I mentioned that waste, mismanagement, corruption
					 and membership of international organizations are serious concerns with respect
					 to the bill.</p>

					 will end my speech here but I have more to say.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill today.
					 In spite of numerous questions and taking into account the answers and
					 decisions we get regarding the amendments we will be proposing at second
					 reading, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill essentially seeks to extend diplomatic
					 immunity to people who are involved in various international organizations, but
					 who are not covered by treaties or members of intergovernmental organizations.
					 Our support is based on that objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diplomatic immunity has recently generated a lot of
					 questions and even resentment among the public, particularly in the Ottawa-Hull
					 area. This feeling spread to all of Quebec and Canada when a Russian diplomat
					 driving under the influence killed Catherine MacLean and injured her friend. We
					 later learned that this was not the first time this diplomat had been caught
					 while driving under the influence. However, his immunity had prevented him from
					 having to face justice the way ordinary citizens would have had to. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can even be said that if, at the time, a poll had
					 been conducted on support for diplomatic immunity, the results might not have
					 reflected the interests of the international community. At the time of this
					 incident, the Minister of Foreign Affairs gave assurances that such a thing
					 would not happen again. The bill makes no reference to this, but the fact is
					 that diplomatic immunity is necessary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diplomatic immunity is necessary and it would be
					 interesting to see what it entails. However, since I have little time until
					 oral question period, I want to affirm that even, and particularly in these
					 difficult times, diplomatic immunity is necessary to allow diplomats to do
					 their job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, there are several countries where the rule
					 of law is not the same as it is here. In many countries, criticizing the
					 government is an offence. In other countries, freedom of religion is not
					 recognized. In others still, a person can be imprisoned without being accused
					 of anything and it may not be easy for that person to regain his or her
					 freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without diplomatic immunity, it would be impossible for
					 the government and its spokespersons to criticize the actions of foreign
					 countries without putting at risk the diplomats who work in these
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were no diplomatic immunity, Canadian
					 nationals abroad also could not benefit from the protection of Canada during a
					 situation of upheaval or conflict.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, if there were no diplomatic immunity, it would
					 be difficult to establish sustained relations between countries, to play an
					 active role in conflict resolution, to maintain dialogue in the event of
					 disagreements, and to defend the interests of Canada and Canadians
					 abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to the proper maintenance
					 of international order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, although the intention of this bill is to
					 extend diplomatic immunity to diplomats working for international organizations
					 not currently covered by treaties or on intergovernmental delegations, it
					 raises very many questions. I will list them now, and will go into further
					 detail after oral question period.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new powers given to the RCMP need to be questioned.
					 Even if the background documents from the government stipulate that this
					 changes nothing, the standard response is “If it adds nothing, why state it,
					 and particularly why write it down for inclusion in a law?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially since the experiences of the APEC summit,
					 and other heated discussions, there are some important questions to be raised.
					 Questions also need to be asked about the changes to certain definitions which
					 appear to limit these organizations, while at the same time recognizing new
					 ones. The number of these organizations seems to have been reduced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter that is not addressed at all,
					 or at least we did not see it: the increasing number of parliamentary
					 organizations, which also have a role to play.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, earlier this week at a press conference
					 after a fundraiser the Prime Minister suggested terrorism is not such a big
					 problem in Canada. What does the Prime Minister consider to be big? Would he
					 care to explain what he meant by that comment to the families of the 329
					 victims of the bombing of Air India flight 182 in 1985? That flight came out of
					 Vancouver.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988 Tara Singh Hayer, a prominent newspaper
					 publisher, was shot, paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair as a result. He had

					 driveway. Many suspect Sikh extremists in his unsolved murder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now being asked is whether journalists
					 like Tara Singh Hayer will be protected under new anti-terrorist legislation as
					 they are under the criminal gang laws. Perhaps the Prime Minister would explain

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care professionals and parka-professionals and

					 care system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community workers include nurses, social workers,
					 physiotherapists, occupational therapists, visiting homemakers, and
					 volunteers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are the frontline workers. They provide
					 home care and long term care in facilities. They offer meal and community
					 support programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many health care services are being moved from the
					 hospitals to the community, community care workers are increasingly in demand
					 to help in the transition and to ensure the continuity of patient
					 care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite you to join me in paying tribute to community
					 care workers in Canada and in acknowledging Community Care Worker

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse yet, there is little if any funding. Children are

	Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago this coming Tuesday, October

					 play presented by the Théatre du Nouveau Monde.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theatre was founded by a small group of theatre
					 people, including Jean Gascon and Jean-Louis Roux, after their stay in Europe
					 studying theatre. Since its inception, the TNM has produced and toured great
					 works from the classic and contemporary repertoire, while promoting national
					 creative talent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of actors and directors have produced works
					 for Quebec audiences that have been milestones in our artistic history,
					 attracting audiences of up to 123,000. These include Jeannine Sutto, Robert
					 Gravel, Denise Boucher, Guy Hoffman, Monique Miller, Michel Tremblay, Michèle
					 Rossignol, Gérard Poirier and Huguette Oligny, to name but a few of the people
					 connected with TNM who have brightened up our spirits and our lives.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 1972, the company moved to the
					 magnificent quarters we are familiar with today. Under the masterful artistic
					 direction of Lorraine Pintal for nearly 10 years now, the Théâtre du Nouveau
					 Monde has a fine future stretching before it. To everyone connected with the
					 TNM, we extend the traditional theatrical wish “Break a leg”.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of agriculture tells us that current

					 national fire prevention week. All Canadians need to stay relevant to the
					 dangers of fires at home and at work to minimize loss of life and
					 property.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all members to be active supporters of fire
					 prevention week in their constituencies and work toward reducing the terrible

	Mr. Speaker, no one is calling a North American

					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fragile economy we must ensure that goods and
					 people can move freely across the border with our largest trading partner. Some
					 86% of our trade is with the U.S. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does this minister insist on putting our trade and

	On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. Because I agree with the
					 preamble to his question, what I suggest to him is that we more quickly and
					 sensibly deal with any issues that may arise on the border by tackling them one
					 by one with our good partner and ally the United States, rather than chasing
					 after a concept which is not well understood and has not had time to be
					 developed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took 40 years to get the Schengen district in

	Madam Speaker, I have a number of petitions that I
					 would like to present today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first petition supports section 43 of the Criminal
					 Code of Canada. This section of the criminal code states that every school
					 teacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in
					 using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child who is under his or
					 her care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the
					 circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 43 recognizes the primary role of parents in
					 the raising and disciplining of their children. The petitioners recognize that
					 the federal government is under pressure from various sources, including the
					 United Nations, to remove section 43 because we have ratified the UN convention
					 on the rights of the child. Removal of this section would strengthen the role
					 of bureaucrats while weakening the role of parents in determining what is in
					 the best interest of the child and, therefore, would be a major and unjustified
					 inclusion by the state into parental rights and responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners recognize that despite the government's
					 stated attempt to preserve section 43, it continues to fund research by people
					 who advocate its removal. Therefore, they request parliament to affirm the duty
					 of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their own
					 conscience and beliefs and to retain section 43 in Canada's criminal code as it
					 is currently worded.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the third petition I am pleased to table

					 concerned about how Canada Post Corporation affects the rural route mail
					 couriers. In particular, these couriers often earn less than the minimum wage
					 and have not been allowed to bargain collectively to improve their wages and
					 working conditions like other workers in similar occupations, such as private
					 sector workers who deliver mail in rural areas or public sector workers who
					 deliver mail for Canada Post in urban areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners' concerns are directed at section 13(5)
					 of the Canada Post Corporation Act which prohibits these couriers from having
					 collective bargaining rights and that this denial of basic rights helps Canada
					 Post keep their wages and working conditions at an unfair level and
					 discriminates against rural workers.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-55665"></A><a HREF="#Int-55677"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-55662"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay
					 (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, the bill before the House is one which
					 deals with the proposed amendments to the Foreign Missions and International
					 Organizations Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should indicate at the outset, Madam Speaker, that I
					 will be splitting my time with my coalition colleague and friend from
					 Saanich--Gulf Islands and critic in this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is aimed at modernizing the privileges and
					 immunities regime that is contained in other legislation. The amendments would
					 enable Canada to comply with international commitments that exist currently
					 under international treaties and respond to recent changes in international
					 law. This is a fairly technical bill yet it has very many practical
					 applications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the bill itself would amend the FMIOA to
					 correct several technical inadequacies that have been identified since it was
					 first introduced in parliament in 1991 under a Conservative
					 administration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments themselves can be broadly divided into
					 five categories. I intend to focus on those as they affect security and the
					 RCMP. My colleague in his remarks will touch on the other elements which deal
					 more with international trade and international obligations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments deal with modernization of legislation
					 as it exists with commitments to international treaties. They also correct
					 deficiencies in the definition of international organizations and further to
					 state clearly statutory authority in support of security measures necessary for
					 Canadian police officers to fulfill Canada's international obligations, in
					 particular, when hosting events such as in recent years where the G-8 countries
					 gathered in Canada, the APEC conference and future conferences like the one to
					 be held in Kananaskis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to clarify some of the technical
					 amendments, so there are housekeeping amendments that are attached. Finally,
					 there is the need to clarify the provisions granting immunity from immigration
					 restriction and alien registration that override the Immigration Act of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical inadequacies have been identified in a
					 number of ways. The legislation aims to: broaden privileges and immunities to
					 permanent missions accredited to international organizations; authorize
					 ministers to make orders with retroactive effect under the act for the purposes
					 of granting tax relief; clarify the act to grant privileges and immunities to
					 political subdivisions of foreign states; authorize ministers to take limited
					 orders under the act and provide legal framework needed to authorize
					 retaliatory countermeasures in the areas of customs, the areas of infringements
					 of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations or the Vienna on consular
					 relations with foreign states; and finally clarify the government's statute
					 with respect to the importation of alcohol by foreign missions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see quite clearly the bill has a broad range and
					 touches on a number of subject matters. It deals in particular with the
					 international organizations in the area of security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a role for the RCMP that is clearly defined.
					 This role is set out in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. What the
					 legislation attempts to do is give greater clarity to the role of the RCMP in
					 its participation in security measures at gatherings, such as the APEC
					 conference in Vancouver. It also allows the RCMP to define its role vis-à-vis
					 security with foreign dignitaries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, there is a need for clarification when a
					 dignitary who comes to Canada may have what is deemed by that country's
					 judicial system a criminal record. The most obvious and compelling example of
					 that is Nelson Mandela. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelson Mandela, as the House knows, was granted
					 honorary Canadian citizenship, which was an extraordinary step on the part of
					 Canada and one of great pride on behalf of the government and all Canadians.
					 However, Nelson Mandela at one point in time was deemed a terrorist by his
					 country of South Africa and spent almost 20 years in prison.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an individual like Nelson Mandela visits Canada
					 there is a need to grant a certain level of immunity where in other
					 circumstances he would not be permitted to enter Canada's borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police authority for security of international
					 events is currently provided under common law. Its specific powers are set out
					 in the RCMP Act. The primary responsibility of the RCMP is to provide security
					 at events where international world leaders may gather. Its authority to take
					 appropriate necessary measures to ensure safe events and safe conduct is set
					 out and empowered in that legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not grant any new powers to the RCMP. It
					 does not confer any new ability to suspend civil liberties, to act in a way
					 that is inconsistent with the current RCMP Act or any other federal statute.
					 However the federal government may have missed an opportunity to improve
					 Canada's ability to host important international meetings in this changing
					 global environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 will impact on the way in
					 which all countries view security in the future. The bill does very little to
					 address this changing environment, with the possible exception of clarifying or
					 restating the role of the RCMP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unclear how the passage of the legislation would
					 improve or allow a host country such as Canada to manage international affairs
					 and conferences. It does not in any way set out in detail what Canada might do
					 differently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Canadians struggled with the degree of
					 force that was used to deal with protesters at the Quebec City summit. That
					 situation raises questions with regard to the G-8 summit to be held in
					 Kananaskis, Alberta.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill may have been the opportunity to explore and
					 examine in greater detail what security measures should exist and what limits
					 should be placed on the RCMP and security personnel in the enforcement of
					 security around the perimeter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hughes report was a voluminous document tabled in
					 response to what happened at the APEC summit in Vancouver. It pointed out the
					 need for clear perimeters and parameters to be placed around RCMP security. It
					 suggested the need for the RCMP to operate within a statutory description and
					 for there to be clear divisions between political commentary and instruction
					 while at the same time fulfilling the role of normal law enforcement and normal
					 security practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was ample evidence that direction was coming from
					 sources outside the traditional RCMP lines of authority. The evidence traced
					 itself right back to the RCMP. Jean Carle was very active and present during
					 the APEC summit. Mr. Justice Hughes concluded that there was a greater need to
					 clarify and in some instances improve the arm's length relationship between the
					 RCMP and political offices including the PMO.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any external interference, and I am talking about
					 political sources, must be limited in carrying out the essential work at any
					 international conference where there are high stakes and/or VIPs in attendance.
					 Unfortunately what we saw at APEC highlighted some of the deficiencies that
					 exist. It led to a lot of questions about who should be making decisions on the
					 treatment of protestors at such events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is intended to move in the right
					 direction although there is a paucity of real direction and no clear indication
					 other than a restatement of what the RCMP is currently doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation covers international organizations. It
					 sets out, for example, that stand-alone organizations can move from country to
					 country, that new international organizations can be given status and
					 headquarters in Canada, and that all international organizations that originate
					 by treaty such as NATO and international civic aviation organizations would be
					 given status.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-35 on
					 behalf of all residents of Saanich--Gulf Islands and as the international trade
					 critic for the coalition in the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague is accurate that this is a lot of
					 housekeeping, but a few important issues should be brought to the floor of the
					 House of Commons. One of the primary points the bill deals with is extending
					 the definition of who should be granted diplomatic immunity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing legislation the definition covers
					 international organizations of formalized institutions which are based in
					 treaty. It does not cover organizations such as the G-8, the OSCE and APEC.
					 When we host these very important international meetings there is discussion on
					 whether the legislation is there to grant immunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to emphasize that in no way would the
					 legislation override the crimes against humanity and war crimes act which would
					 supercede this legislation. Anyone who has committed a crime under the crimes
					 against humanity and war crimes act would in no way shape or form be given any
					 kind of immunity under any circumstances. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were given short notice of the bill. From what we
					 have been informed it is basically a housekeeping bill. I do have concerns
					 whether we would be going too far in granting additional immunities. Are they
					 absolutely necessary? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall when an Ottawa woman was killed by
					 an impaired driver who was a Russian diplomat? There was huge public outcry
					 that the driver should be brought to Canadian justice. Having said that, the
					 democratic representative caucus will be supporting the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue the bill deals with is the primary role
					 of the RCMP. It is to be responsible for security of international meetings
					 such as APEC and the G-8 summit. That is a positive step. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the APEC meetings in Vancouver the Hughes
					 report recommended that the role of the RCMP be formalized. It would be
					 appropriate for the government to put more substance in the bill rather than
					 just broadly describe that the RCMP is the primary organization responsible for
					 international meetings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some parameters need to be set around security so that
					 we can remove the political interference which was very apparent in Vancouver.
					 Millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on subsequent inquiries that the
					 government was compelled to call. That type of detail is not present here.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the parameters of the RCMP when it is entirely
					 responsible for the security of international meetings? That should be laid out
					 so there is no necessity to have any discussions of a political nature between
					 the commissioner of the RCMP and anyone else at a senior level such as the
					 Prime Minister's Office or senior levels of government.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel those concerns should have been included in the
					 bill. We want to ensure that the police do not overstep their bounds or violate
					 the Canadian charter of rights. I am not suggesting the police would do that,
					 but we do not see that information in the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-35 is primarily a housekeeping bill. It would
					 extend diplomatic immunity to people attending a conference in Canada such as
					 the G-8 summit or APEC. I will be recommending that the members of the
					 conservative coalition support this housekeeping bill.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from our coalition
					 for his speech. This is a technical housekeeping bill. Yet, as I have indicated
					 in the House since we have returned, it surprises me that the government would
					 proceed with its legislative agenda as though nothing had changed on September
					 11. It is surprising, given the fact that we need to pay attention to some very
					 serious legislation dealing with terrorism and additional funding for the RCMP.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the area of foreign affairs there is a
					 conflict between what the Minister of Foreign Affairs is saying in comparison
					 to other ministers of the crown. My colleague asked the Minister of Foreign
					 Affairs in question period today why he was putting our trade at risk by ruling
					 out of hand the notion of border security. The minister stated on September 11
					 that indeed the world had changed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House closed for 35 minutes yesterday because the
					 government could not bring forward a bill. It did not have anything to say for
					 35 minutes. That is shocking. I could not believe that we adjourned the House
					 for 35 minutes, given the serious events that have taken place. The government
					 by its actions is showing that it is sleeping.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my colleague share the same surprise that I have
					 with the government's inaction in these major areas and that it is proceeding
					 with its legislative agenda as if nothing has changed?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, the member for Dewdney--Alouette raises
					 an incredibly valid point. He says we are standing in the House today debating
					 a housekeeping bill which deals with in the government's own language technical
					 amendments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now October. On September 11 we saw horrific
					 events which forever changed how our country will operate. Yet we have not seen
					 one word in legislation to deal with terrorism. That is a tragedy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member was correct to point out that the
					 government has run out of things to do. It had to adjourn the House yesterday
					 for 35 minutes. When the government wants a critical piece of legislation
					 drafted it can get it done in a matter of hours. If legislation affects the
					 government it can have it brought in and rammed through the House in a day or
					 two. Yet we have seen nothing on terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has told us it is still waiting. It says
					 it will bring legislation before the House after the break week. That is
					 completely unacceptable. The bill deals specifically with the security of the
					 diplomatic community when we host incredibly important international meetings
					 such as the upcoming G-8 one and APEC. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question on the minds of all Canadians is whether
					 we will be able to provide security and whether we need to make changes in
					 light of what has happened. I am not being critical of the government but we
					 live in a different world now and things must change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy is on eggshells and everyone is concerned.
					 Members on all sides are concerned about where the issue will go. Canadians are
					 concerned. The point my hon. colleague from Dewdney--Alouette is making is that
					 we are in the House dealing with a bill that contains technical amendments and
					 makes no mention of terrorism. It addresses the Hughes report which says the
					 RCMP should be the primary police agency responsible for such meetings. However
					 it has no parameters and does not go into any detail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will support the bill although it contains only
					 technical amendments. The real shame is that we are not standing to debate the
					 events. We are not debating how to protect Canadians, ensure the free flow of
					 goods between Canada and the United States or secure our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish members a happy Thanksgiving. My party looks
					 forward to seeing the government's bill on terrorism when we return because it
					 is the number one issue Canadians are concerned about.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of my
					 colleagues in the New Democratic caucus to debate the important legislation
					 before the House. The legislation was tabled only a couple of days ago so there
					 has been limited opportunity to study it. My comments are made in that light.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told by the government that the bill
					 contains technical changes to the Foreign Missions and International
					 Organizations Act and is in effect a housekeeping bill. I urge parliamentarians
					 to give careful scrutiny to the changes proposed in the legislation because the
					 implications of a number of them are serious indeed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not speak to all aspects of the legislation
					 because we are debating the principle of the bill at second reading. However
					 the member for Surrey Central raised a number of concerns that we share.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to the definition of
					 international organization would be an important change. It would give
					 privileges and immunities to international government organizations such as
					 APEC, the G-8 and others, even if they are not treaty bodies. We would want to
					 study the amendment carefully in committee in terms of its
					 implications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will talk about the bill's proposed amendments to the
					 Immigration Act. At present government representatives who wish to enter Canada
					 and who have criminal records are required to obtain a minister's permit. This
					 provision of the Immigration Act applies whether they are world leaders or
					 members of delegations to international conferences. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly in the absence of compelling evidence to the
					 contrary it is the way the law should remain. It is unacceptable to suggest
					 that an individual who is a government representative, part of a delegation to
					 an international conference, or for that matter a world leader, should not be
					 required to obey the law and submit to the same requirements with respect to
					 ministers' permits as anyone else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this debate a number of my colleagues have
					 referred to the former Russian diplomat charged with the serious offence of
					 drunk driving, an offence that gave rise to the tragic death of a Canadian.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that individual were part of a delegation to an
					 international conference it would surely not be unreasonable for Canadians to
					 have the opportunity to say no. If he were convicted of the offence he should
					 not be entitled to enter Canada as a member of a delegation. At the very least
					 he should be required to obtain a minister's permit to do so. In other words,
					 it is not acceptable that ministerial permit provisions be invoked only in
					 cases of war crimes or crimes against humanity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other provisions in the legislation on which
					 I will not comment but which I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss in
					 committee. I am concerned about the apparent absence of consultation with
					 provincial, territorial and municipal governments about this important
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has indicated in background
					 documents that it understands and accepts the urgency of working in partnership
					 with provinces and municipalities to provide the most appropriate and effective
					 security arrangements for all federally hosted international meetings.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the case why did it not bring forward the
					 bill following consultations with provincial, territorial or local
					 jurisdictions? In the committee that studies the bill we will want to ensure
					 these levels of government have been fully consulted and that we have heard
					 from them before the bill passes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remaining few minutes I will focus on the
					 provisions of clause 5. This is the new clause that gives what is called
					 statutory authority to provide protection or police powers.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's briefing notes say the amendment was
					 developed in response to security issues raised by the summit of the Americas.
					 The Department of Justice and the Department of the Solicitor General of Canada
					 arrived at the view that the existing common law authority of the government to
					 provide security and protection for these events should be given a statutory
					 basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However clause 5 of the bill raises grave questions
					 about the extent to which we are prepared to not only codify existing police
					 powers in law but significantly enhance them. Many Canadians, including myself
					 and my colleagues in the New Democratic Party caucus, are concerned about the
					 growing criminalization of dissent in Canada. We have seen an alarming trend
					 toward giving more powers to the police. Bill C-35 is part of that trend.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the House adopted legislation to give police
					 and law enforcement agencies sweeping powers to break the law in the pursuit of
					 their goals. We in the NDP opposed that legislation. We oppose the bill now
					 before the House because it provides no clear statement as to why it is
					 necessary to amend the law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has put Bill C-35 before the House
					 before presenting us with its package of so-called anti-terrorism legislation.
					 I understand that it will be tabled before the House when we return in about 10
					 days. We will need to scrutinize it carefully because it is precisely at times
					 like this that our most fundamental civil liberties and human rights are most
					 vulnerable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recall the invocation of the War Measures Act in
					 1970. While it may have been popular with the public it was recognized in
					 retrospect to have been a significant overreaction. I am proud that it was my
					 colleagues in the New Democratic caucus of the day, led by David Lewis, who
					 stood and said no, that it violated the most basic and fundamental rights of
					 Canadians. We will need to be vigilant regarding the legislative package that
					 will be tabled in the House when we return.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-35 would give new powers to the RCMP. Clause 5
					 states: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(1) The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
						  has the primary responsibility to ensure the security for the proper
						  functioning of any intergovernmental conference in which two or more states
						  participate, that is attended by persons granted privileges and immunities

</tr>

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  measures, including controlling, limiting or prohibiting access to any area to
						  the extent and in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a sweeping and dangerous extension of the
					 powers of the RCMP. In light of the recent abuse of those powers in the context
					 of the APEC summit we should not be prepared to grant new powers lightly to the
					 RCMP. The report of Justice Hughes raised serious questions about the extent to
					 which it might be necessary to codify in statutory terms the relationship
					 between political authority and the RCMP. Bill C-35 would do nothing of the
					 kind. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most serious illustration of the abuse of
					 RCMP powers was the recent summit of the Americas. We are told the amendment
					 before the House is a response to security issues raised by the summit. Rather
					 than responding with a statutory extension of the powers of the RCMP we should
					 be asking tough questions about the abuse of police power and criminalization
					 of dissent we witnessed at the Quebec City summit of the Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP and others have joined in calling for an
					 independent public inquiry into those abuses. Over 6,000 tear gas canisters and
					 over 900 rubber bullets were fired. </p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the victims were people who were engaged in
					 peaceful, non-violent, legal protest against the assault on democracy, the
					 environment and human rights that was taking place inside the RCMP's wall of
					 shame.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why on earth would the government now bring forward
					 legislation extending new powers to the RCMP when Canadians are asking very
					 serious questions about the abuse of the powers it currently has.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of Éric Laferrière, for example, who was
					 hit with a rubber bullet, a rubber bullet fired at his throat. He was taking
					 part in a peaceful protest, but was shot and hit by a bullet fired by the RCMP.
					 He will never be able to speak again. Obviously, he will be suing the
					 RCMP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to wonder how is it that this government is
					 prepared to grant more powers to the RCMP, when there are so many questions
					 regarding the abuse of power during the summit of the Americas in Quebec City,
					 last April.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose this legislation and we certainly will ask
					 tough questions when it comes to hearings on the bill. It is essential that the
					 committees study very carefully the provisions of this legislation and call
					 extensive witnesses from civil liberties associations.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the Quebec Civil Liberties Union
					 published a report which seriously criticized the conduct and actions of the
					 RCMP, especially its use of tear gas and rubber bullets.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will want to hear from them and others. Before we
					 are prepared to accept these changes in legislation, we want to be convinced
					 that it does not represent a very dangerous and unacceptable extension of the
					 powers of the police.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminalization of dissent in this country is a serious
					 concern and this legislation may very well contribute to that alarming
					 tendency. For that reason, I rise on behalf of my colleagues in opposition to
					 the bill which is now before the House.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this very
					 important bill which affects Canadians across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to echo the comments made by the member from the
					 NDP that this bill was expected to be merely a housekeeping bill, a bill which
					 did not have much significance, a few amendments here and a few amendments
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that buried within this so-called innocuous
					 bill are many profound changes that can have a huge impact on the country, on
					 the powers of the RCMP and on the ability of Canada to not allow certain types
					 of individuals, terrorists and criminals, into Canada. It behooves the Canadian
					 public to know what is in the bill. My colleagues will try to do that over the
					 coming weeks, but we are certainly will not give it the free passage which the
					 government wants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government brought this bill forward four days ago.
					 It gave the bill to us two and a half days ago and did not even allow the
					 Library of Parliament to give us an analysis of it. That is not appropriate.
					 That does not provide for adequate scrutiny of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would allow a number of things, including
					 allowing the foreign affairs minister to order the detention by officers under
					 the Customs Act of goods imported by a diplomatic mission or consulate post of
					 a foreign state. This is very important. We know internationally that certain
					 consulates and embassies use their consulate bags to import and move contraband
					 around. It is known internationally that the contraband can involve diamonds,
					 drugs and weapons. It can also involve the illegal trafficking of endangered
					 species, which is worth billions of dollars. This illegal trafficking is
					 responsible for the decimation of thousands of species around the world, many
					 of which have become extinct.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also deals with a clause involving the RCMP's
					 primary responsibility to ensure the security for the proper functioning of any
					 intergovernmental conferences that may occur. Clearly we do not have a problem
					 with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to bring forward an issue that the NDP have been
					 harping on for a long time, which I find quite offensive. NDP members keep on
					 criticizing the RCMP about its actions at international meetings. It is true
					 that there has to be some analysis, as the Hughes report mentioned, about
					 certain activities. However, for heaven's sake, when individuals who protest
					 are willing to advocate violence, or assault the police, or teardown banners or
					 throw molotov cocktails at the police, the police have a responsibility to
					 protect those who are behind them as well as protect themselves. It is totally
					 irresponsible for certain parties and certain groups to expect members of the
					 RCMP to stand back while certain individuals impart violence against others. It
					 is the responsibility of the RCMP to protect individuals who come to Canada and
					 to protect those who protest peacefully.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do need to investigate those incidents in which
					 peaceful protesters were somehow hurt. We should also investigate the incidents
					 where banners were put up, but were then torn down and where people were
					 apprehended and taken into custody or thrown in jail before anything actually
					 happened. That violates our basic tenets of freedom of speech which cannot be
					 allowed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we cannot keep on using the RCMP as a punching
					 bag for certain political interests that may exist, particularly those who
					 violently oppose anti-globalization efforts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also lists treaties, conventions and
					 agreements that entitle foreign representatives to immunities and privileges.
					 It was brought forward at some of the meetings here that some foreign leaders,
					 who are thugs, or criminals, or who have grossly abused citizens in their
					 countries, are allowed to come to Canada to attend international
					 meetings.</p>


	<A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There certainly is an argument to say that if we do not
					 sit down at the table and discuss matters that may be very difficult and
					 painful, then a resolution cannot be found. Some people we talk to are
					 individuals who, by most definitions, would be considered murderous or thugs at
					 the very least.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use a tool to work toward peace. Perhaps the
					 quid pro quo for international despots to arrive at a table and be welcomed as
					 a member of the international community would be that they show good will
					 within their own countries and stop abusing and violating the basic rights of
					 their people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international community could apply pressure on
					 groups and leaders in countries from Sierra Leone to Liberia, Angola, the
					 Congo, Sudan and others by using the lever that they genuinely put forth an
					 effort to deal with the significant human rights crises and wars in their
					 country or they would not be allowed to attend international meetings in Canada
					 or abroad. This lever ought to be used.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we have with international treaties is that
					 while they have nice words, they are toothless. We have to put some teeth in
					 international treaties like the Geneva convention, or the rights of the child
					 or the convention on nuclear weapons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the United Nations, to the IMF, to the World Bank,
					 many agreements are made, they sound nice on paper and in a perfect world they
					 would make a lot of sense. However many of these treaties are violated, yet
					 there are no penalties, no implications nor ramifications for those who choose
					 to violate them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring attention to an issue that the government has
					 been involved with for a long time and that is the issue of the wars in West
					 Africa. In Liberia, Charles Taylor the president, has for a long time played
					 friend and supporter of a man by the name of Foday Sankoh, the head of the RUF
					 a group of rebels who are committing atrocities in Sierra Leone. They go into
					 villages and chop off the arms or legs of children, women and men, not with the
					 intent to kill them but to terrorize them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international community has until very recently
					 turned a blind eye. Only recently have we applied the tools and levers against
					 Charles Taylor and Foday Sankoh to do something. The implications of failure,
					 in this case, is that tens of thousands of innocent people have had one or more
					 limbs amputated with hatchets and have been left to die. That is beyond
					 comprehension. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conflict is flowing into Guinea as we speak. This
					 has resulted in hundreds of thousands more refugees and the destruction of
					 entire sectors of this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why I bring this up in relation to the bill is that
					 Canada can indeed take a leadership role by applying pressures, using levers,
					 and putting teeth in the international agreements which exist today. The
					 argument to support it is not merely the obvious humanitarian argument that it
					 is wrong to mutilate innocent civilians, or commit gang rape, or murder
					 innocent civilians on the street or purge the economic resources of a country
					 without sharing it with the civilians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the self-centred argument that should be put
					 forth to the international community is that if it does not deal with these
					 despots now then we will pay the price later on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of post-conflict reconstruction are massive.
					 Whether we talk about the former Yugoslavia, West Africa, the Congo or Rwanda,
					 the costs are in the billions of dollars. When the precursors to conflict were
					 staring us in the face, as they have been for years, perhaps we should have got
					 involved. The argument could be that if we had spent a bit of money, if we had
					 put forward a bit of effort and if we had spent a bit of time and attention to
					 deal with these precursors to conflict, economically we would not have had to
					 deal with the disasters that followed.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot talk about the penalty we pay in human terms.
					 That far greater penalty is borne by the civilians in the some 50 countries
					 around the world where bloody conflicts are occurring today and to which we in
					 the international community have by and large turned a blind eye. We need to
					 get involved. We need to apply levers internationally. There is an opportunity
					 to do so in the international agreements referred to in the bill, in treaties
					 and in the meetings we sometimes host.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year we will be hosting the G-8 summit. It is
					 rumoured that the summit in part will deal with Africa. I hope it will also
					 deal with the issue of terrorism. There is a grand opportunity for us as a
					 nation to put some constructive solutions on the table. There is an alignment
					 of the stars. Recently, led by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki, a
					 millennium plan for Africa has been put forth. It deals with such issues as
					 economic development, conflict prevention, resource management, political
					 changes, democracy and human rights. Rather than looking at the past, it deals
					 with some pragmatic solutions that can be done now and in the
					 future.</p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	There is an opportunity for Canada to link up with the
					 some 15 leadership countries on that secretariat dealing with the millennium
					 project and merge the G-8 summit leaders with the millennium project in Africa
					 so that there is some commonality in the actions they pursue. Next year in
					 Kananaskis, there is a great opportunity for Canada to take a leadership role
					 with the G-8 nations. Those constructive solutions could be put forward with
					 the blessing and the co-operation of the members supporting the millennium
					 project in Africa, most notably the South Africans. There would be an enormous
					 possibility for pursuing peace and security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also deals with protecting individuals who
					 have committed crimes in Canada, such as the tragic murder of a woman by a
					 drunk driver, a Russian employee at the embassy. Canada has faced problems in
					 dealing with that because of today's laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 373, placed on the notice paper on June 5,
					 deals with just that. It reads:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That, in the opinion of this House,
						  the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade should: (a) release
						  the names of all foreign nationals and diplomats employed in Canada in the
						  service of their country who are charged with an indictable offence under the
						  Criminal Code; and (b) urge the sending states of said diplomats either to
						  recall their respective foreign officers, allow them to proceed through the
						  Canadian judicial system, or allow their diplomats to be subject to expulsion
						  from Canada as provided by the Vienna Convention of 1961.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion would enable Canada to deal with individuals
					 who have indeed committed crimes here in Canada, rather than allowing them to
					 flee to their countries of origin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing that may be of help to foreign
					 service officers here and indeed to our foreign services officers abroad. Once
					 they come to Canada, their families cannot work. It is a problem. Similarly,
					 the families of our foreign service officers cannot work when they go abroad.
					 It would be useful to have provisions in the bill that would allow the family
					 members of individuals who are employed by foreign embassies in Canada to work
					 in our country. The quid pro quo would be that the family members of our
					 foreign service personnel working in our embassies abroad could work in those
					 countries. That would be beneficial to them and would provide a great deal of
					 security for the individuals and their families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also deals with a number of immigration
					 issues. My staff in Victoria and the staff of every member in the House have
					 been plagued by problems with respect to the immigration department. The bill
					 could have dealt with that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the visa officer is in Gambia for the
					 hearing process once every six months. The office in Gambia deals with a lot of
					 refugees from the bloody conflicts in Sierra Leone , Liberia, Guinea and
					 others. If that foreign service officer comes down with the flu, that officer
					 may not get there for a year. People who apply for refugee status in Gambia can
					 only get hearings every six months and sometimes it takes a year. Bear in mind
					 that this is only one step in the emigration process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That office in particular needs to be looked at. There
					 are other problems. People who go to that office say that the individuals who
					 work there do not really care. When informed that gangs of people were shooting
					 refugees in Sierra Leone on sight, they said there was no danger. Imagine. The
					 international community knows that people have been shot, murdered and chopped
					 up in Sierra Leone, yet our office in Gambia said that there was no danger.
					 When a boatload of refugees was sent back from Sierra Leone, the office in
					 Gambia denied that it ever happened. Either that department is overwhelmed or
					 some significant structural problems exist there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are serious concerns in the embassies in India
					 and the Philippines. I do not know if those concerns have been substantiated
					 but the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration needs to look at this issue.
					 Visas are potentially being sold and there are suggestions that people are
					 being bribed. </p>


	<A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Canadians, but nationals working in our embassies
					 in the Philippines and India allegedly have been selling visas and access to
					 the immigration system in Canada. That is not appropriate. We have repeatedly
					 brought this to the attention of the minister yet we have had no significant
					 response from her to date. Given the number of people who are coming through
					 India and the Philippines it would certainly behoove her to investigate what is
					 going on at those two embassies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing fees and landing right fees are prohibitive
					 for a number of individuals. There has also been little flexibility on the part
					 of the departments there and pettiness has been shown in terms of the
					 documentation required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very disappointed that the government has not
					 taken the bull by the horns. It has not demonstrated to the House the
					 importance of the bill and the critical issues contained within it. We feel the
					 bill is quite sneaky.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill should have dealt with reforms to the IMF, the
					 World Bank and the United Nations. There were opportunities in the bill to deal
					 with some conditionality arrangements. They ought to be made but they do not
					 exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditionality is critically important within the
					 context of how we disburse our taxpayers' funds through these organizations.
					 The World Bank is primarily tasked with aid and development. The International
					 Monetary Fund deals with the security of international markets. The United
					 Nations deals with a whole collection of issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill could have made suggestions on how our members
					 internationally could reform these systems. It could have enabled the UN, World
					 Bank and the IMF to communicate with each other more effectively. Canadians and
					 the international community would be absolutely appalled to learn that those
					 organizations rarely speak to each other. That they rarely speak to each other
					 now is actually headway because they hardly spoke to each other before. That is
					 bizarre given that all three organizations are supposed to be working in
					 concert on a number of critical international security issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of opportunities in the bill. The
					 Canadian Alliance will try to improve the bill by offering constructive
					 suggestions and solutions to deal with the issues within it. I therefore move:
					 That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “that” and
					 substitute the following therefor: “Bill C-35, an act to amend the Foreign
					 Missions and International Organizations Act, be not now read a second time but
					 that the order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the subject matter thereof
					 referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International
					 Trade”.</p>

					 Centre--Rosedale, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, since the speaker from the Alliance had
					 taken advantage of expressing outrage, I thought perhaps at the beginning of my
					 questions and comments I could allow my outrage to be expressed as well. That
					 is, I think, in order, not that I would mention any members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the hon. member for his very
					 thoughtful speech. It is indicative of the great knowledge of the member for 
					 Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca
					 and his interest in international affairs. We really appreciate his comments in
					 the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly appreciated the fact that he pointed out
					 that the bill is largely a housekeeping measure and that when it comes to the
					 police powers which he referred to in the bill, he did point out that in fact
					 if we are to have coherent and excellent international co-operation and
					 international meetings in our country, the police must be able to have the
					 proper powers to be able to manage them, respectful as they are of the rights
					 of Canadian citizens to protest, to express their views.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think back to the most recent summit we held in
					 Canada, the summit in Quebec City, we would say that our police, at all levels,
					 behaved with extraordinary coherence. They behaved extremely well in making
					 sure that the rights of everyone were respected in very difficult and trying
					 circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I mention this is that I was in the House
					 when the member for 
					 Surrey Central, the lead
					 off speaker from the member's party, spoke about the bill. If I understood the
					 member for 
					 Surrey Central, he was
					 very critical of those provisions. He said he did not understand why those
					 provisions would be there. He did not understand the reasonableness that was
					 contained in the bill. He sounded more like the member for 
					 Burnaby--Douglas, who
					 compared the bill to something like the War Measures Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to understand from the hon. member where
					 his party is coming from. Is it supporting the police and the need of the
					 Canadian government to have important meetings in this country and to enable
					 our police authorities to manage those meetings or is it criticizing the
					 provisions of the bill which would enable the police to do that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps he might also wish to comment on his last
					 statement, that he felt the bill should be broader in scope and deal with
					 things like conditionality on IMF loans and other things. I presume the hon.
					 member was just using this as an occasion to talk about a favourite hobbyhorse
					 of his. I would not have thought that he normally would think IMF
					 conditionality would be appropriately put in a bill that deals with diplomatic
					 immunities and other rather more mundane matters.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend from Rosedale,
					 the head of the foreign affairs committee. We congratulate him on his
					 reappointment to that post. It is well deserved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that our party's deep concern is that the
					 bill was labelled, as the minister said, as merely a housekeeping bill. While
					 as a party we have been strong supporters of the RCMP, and indeed have backed
					 them up when others have tried to criticize them in the face of doing a very
					 difficult job, our concern is that when we start giving extra powers to the
					 RCMP we do not believe this is merely a housekeeping issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue deserves a complete and public debate and
					 public knowledge. Only by doing that will we be able to have the buy-in on the
					 part of the public, the buy-in on the part of the House and the full knowledge
					 of the public as to what powers we are giving.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member would abhor the belief that in any
					 way, shape or form we would want to turn Canada into a police state. No one
					 wants that. However in certain quarters there are those concerns, particularly
					 among the anti-globalization crowds he referred to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our responsibility is to make sure that those people,
					 and indeed all Canadians, are well aware, in a transparent fashion, of the
					 kinds of powers that this bill would represent within the statutes of our
					 country, and we will not simply say that this is some housekeeping bill that we
					 will slide in through the back door. That is the problem our party has with it.
					 We want to make sure that there is a transparent and public debate so that all
					 Canadians will know what is in the bill.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to turn to one of the
					 themes that my hon. colleague dwelt upon which falls within his own area of
					 considerable expertise and experience. He talked about the human rights
					 situation in other countries, particularly Africa. My hon. colleague has
					 visited Africa and worked there as a medical doctor on something like 17, 18 or
					 19 different occasions over the past several decades. He has developed an
					 extraordinary knowledge of the situation in Africa in regard to the economic
					 situation and the human rights situation and has a very subtle understanding in
					 some cases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for him that breaks down into several
					 parts. First, in dealing with how we could respond to the situation in Africa
					 and other parts of the world where we see terrorism of domestic populations
					 taking place, I wonder what kinds of sanctions or penalties could actually
					 effectively be imposed and would actually work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking that I would like to extend it out a bit. As
					 an historian I tend to look at what has been done in the past and what has
					 worked and what has not. What has my hon. colleague seen that has worked
					 effectively in other parts of the world? Drawing upon that, which of these
					 possible sanctions could actually be advocated effectively by Canada for these
					 kinds of situations? Of course there are some actions that perhaps we cannot
					 advocate for one reason or another. Looking at countries in situations similar
					 to our own, such as the situations of the Americans, the Australians, the
					 Swedes, the British and so on, what has been advocated by those countries for
					 encouraging a reduction in this kind of abuse of human rights in countries such
					 as Africa and elsewhere?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend, who has a Ph.D.
					 in history, so I would never want to joust with him on this because I would
					 lose every time. He has extensive knowledge in this area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically what his question refers to is what we are to
					 do in the face of domestic terrorism. What do we do in regard to a despot who
					 is willing to abuse his or her citizens in the most egregious way? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we could divide it into two responses, military
					 and non-military. Both would require a multilateral, multifactoral approach. In
					 the non-military response, I think we could use our international organizations
					 through the IMF and World Bank. We can use economic levers as a carrot or as a
					 stick for those leaders who want to abuse their people. That can easily be done
					 through IMF tranches and World Bank help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country we can also apply our help in
					 international aid in a diplomatic carrot or stick approach. Also, with respect
					 to diplomatic recognition and bilateral involvement, we could make them
					 conditional on a country's willingness to support the basic tenets of human
					 rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to deal with communication. As we have
					 seen in Pakistan and Afghanistan and indeed in certain areas of the Middle
					 East, how we actually stimulate people to take up arms against another group is
					 to feed them a steady diet of violent propaganda against that group. We in the
					 international community ignore this when communication is used not as a lever
					 of peace but as a tool to stimulate one group to fight against another group,
					 but we can apply other tools. The UN has ways to do that through shortwave
					 radio and other tools whereby we could institute positive propaganda, positive
					 information, to build bridges among disparate groups and to support
					 moderates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, on the military option I firmly believe a rapid
					 reaction force should be developed with the command and control structure that
					 is already in place. In my view we also need an international arms registry
					 that deals just with the bulk sales of automatic weapons. If we had an
					 international agreement that would enable us to track the bulk sales of
					 automatic weapons it would go a long way to making this world a safer
					 place.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, if I might just bring to your attention
					 the fact that a frequently made error in the House is assuming that the name of
					 my riding is in alphabetical order. In fact it is in reverse alphabetical
					 order. It happens all the time. People frequently misspell Carleton as well. It
					 is an ongoing struggle but we make do as best we can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to dwell on the civil rights aspect of the
					 legislation before the House. It has been referred to by members on the
					 government side as a piece of housekeeping legislation, which is one of those
					 phrases that makes my ears perk up. My hackles rise a bit when I hear that
					 phrase being used, in much the same way that one's nerves get unsettled when
					 there is a knock on the door and someone announces “I am from the government
					 and I am here to help”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too easy to deal with civil rights issues and the
					 reduction in civil rights by means of slicing off a little at a time and saying
					 that it is just housekeeping, that it is just a little right here, a little
					 right there. When we look at the whole question of civil rights and legal
					 rights, the whole system of protection we have built up is a series of very
					 small, very careful protections against those little salami slices that can be
					 cut away. That is why when we read a bill of rights or our own charter of
					 rights, we find that the protections for civil liberties tend to be very much
					 in the nature of protections against a whole range and series of individual
					 potential abuses as opposed to a broad umbrella statement of the rights that
					 ought to exist. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is not enough to talk about freedom of
					 speech, freedom of assembly or the right to a fair trial. One has to go on and
					 say, for example with regard to the right to a fair trial, that one has a right
					 to habeas corpus, that one has a right not to be tried twice for the same
					 offence, and a whole series of other similar protections, the right to counsel,
					 and the right against unreasonable search and seizure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, within that right against unreasonable search and
					 seizure are certain sub-rights to prevent against warrantless searches. When
					 warrants are issued, any evidence collected can only be evidence that relates
					 to the terms of the warrant. For example, if the police come into a person's
					 house because they think that person is guilty of crime <i>A</i> and they find
					 evidence that suggests that in fact the person is guilty of offence <i>B</i>,
					 that evidence cannot be used in that prosecution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of ad hoc protection against ad hoc abuses is
					 absolutely vital when we see ad hoc reductions in these rights, particularly
					 those which are not clearly and specifically spelled out in our charter. We
					 have reason to want to take very special care to make sure that we are not
					 seeing the beginning of this process of slicing off those little salami slices
					 of freedom. Just taking away those little bits of freedom might result in that
					 great mass of freedoms, which makes us such a beacon to the world, being lost.
					 That is the kind of thing we worry about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are dealing with a very specific right. This
					 is the right to freedom of assembly to register one's protest. This is a right
					 that has existed in our society and in our ancestors' societies for centuries.
					 I am thinking particularly of England. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when Britain's parliament was far from
					 being the model that it is today. For example, at one time women could not
					 vote, working men could not vote, men who did not hold property could not vote,
					 and the franchise was exercised only by a tiny fraction, less than 10% of the
					 population. Also, the system of representation in the boroughs was
					 extraordinarily corrupt. There were some boroughs known as the rotten boroughs
					 in which there could be as few as a dozen people casting ballots to elect a
					 member of parliament. Other boroughs were of enormous size and as a result
					 experienced a great deal of underrepresentation</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of theories were developed on how to deal
					 with this. In the end, the right of protest on the street, of going out and
					 demonstrating was practised. Sometimes there was a little bit of alcohol
					 consumed and these things could evolve into riots, but that was understood and
					 accepted. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That actually was the framework within which we in this

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today
					 to deal with the consideration of the merits of private member's bill, Bill
					 C-209. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that encouraging the use of public
					 transit is a laudable goal. As a matter of public policy this is a goal that is
					 obviously consistent with the government's plan. Every time we remove a private
					 automobile from our roadways, there is a direct effect in the reduction of
					 greenhouse gases and that is a relationship that all of us can understand and
					 appreciate. The government recognizes the importance of reducing greenhouse
					 gases, but in doing so we must remember that the tax system is only one of the
					 possible methods and mechanisms we can use in order to help us reach that
					 goal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, governments at all levels must work
					 together to be effective in this challenge. Second, I submit that we should
					 examine the legislation we have before us today in light of the other options
					 that are available to us and also look at where we could most effectively
					 utilize the money that this proposal might cost the public purse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been estimated that this proposal, if enacted,
					 would in fact cost the public purse approximately $100 million annually. For
					 $100 million annually, the question is, do we believe that this would
					 accomplish the goal and would there be other expenses that might be incurred in
					 its implementation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly those who already take public transit do not
					 need a tax deduction to encourage them to use this service, so why, as the bill
					 advocates, should we spend money from the treasury to provide a subsidy to
					 those existing users? It might be beneficial to those current riders, I
					 suppose, if they had sufficient income to be taxable, but the deduction from
					 taxable income is not helpful at all to those who do not have a net taxable
					 income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly this part of the bill is a discriminatory
					 measure and would take away from the benefit a person of lower income might
					 have received. Surely this was not the intent of the drafter of the bill, but
					 it certainly would be the ultimate effect as it is drafted. Whether they were
					 patrons of the transit system or whether they would decide to begin using
					 public transit, surely a section of this nature is truly inappropriate. The
					 bill would not legislate any sort of direct payment to the person who uses the
					 public transit system but in fact would legislate a deduction from net taxable
					 income. That is a very important distinction to make in relation to the bill as
					 it appears before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look at the bill my initial thoughts are that,
					 first, the tax system credits proposed would not be equally applicable to all
					 riders because of our graduated tax system. Second, if one is not taxable at
					 all, obviously there would be no financial benefit or incentive under the bill.
					 Third, if the goal is to reduce greenhouse gases by increasing ridership, why
					 should we provide any financial support to those who already take the transit
					 system? Fourth, this proposal would not appropriately target the group that we
					 wish to encourage to take the public transit system, that is, those who
					 currently simply do not use that system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we reflect on what we should consider, other
					 alternatives ought to be taken into consideration. Some of the alternatives we
					 should be looking at, I would suggest, are the infrastructure programs that are
					 used for transit capital improvements, for direct capital investment and for
					 adding to operating grants. These are effective ways of keeping down the cost
					 of public transportation and also of broadening the base of support through the
					 extra moneys that would be provided by capital infusion. We want to induce more
					 people to use the public transit system and ultimately reduce greenhouse
					 gases.</p>


	<A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit that public expenditures that are
					 directed at creating the least expensive, cleanest, most well maintained,
					 modern and efficient means of public transit would be a better and more direct
					 method of achieving the goal of getting more riders to leave their cars at
					 home.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem with the bill is the practical
					 application of the accountability section as drafted, subclause 118.96(3),
					 which states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The individual shall provide
						  supporting vouchers indicating the amounts paid by the individual for the use
						  of a public transportation system.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the bill itself, the word shall used in
					 subclause 118.96(3) is a mandatory word which requires one to provide the
					 supporting vouchers or receipts in order to deduct from the net taxable income
					 this public transportation expenditure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us think about what this really does. What does it
					 really create? Not only does it create a new administrative problem for the
					 traveller in having to obtain and maintain the receipts, but there is also an
					 expense created for the travel provider on every trip taken by the
					 taxpayer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to mention the fact that ultimately CCRA
					 has to receive and store all of these vouchers, which conceivably could be in
					 the hundreds per taxpayer, which again could be something significant.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of producing the vouchers by the travel
					 provider and the cost to receive and store these vouchers by CCRA would not be,
					 I suggest, a positive use of government resources, again taking into
					 consideration that the primary purpose of the bill is ultimately to reduce
					 greenhouse gases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bill I think what we are looking is possibly the
					 creation of a very expensive administrative system, not only for the federal
					 government but for all levels of government, which in effect really are part
					 and parcel of the whole idea of public transit. That would include the
					 provinces as well as the municipalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to reducing greenhouse
					 gases and clearly excellent public transit is one important part of that
					 policy. The government is committed to the important principles of sustainable
					 development across a wide spectrum of government activities. That means clear
					 goals in relation to the environment. The federal government has required all
					 of its departments to prepare sustainable development strategies for tabling in
					 the House. As well, every federal budget since 1994 has included measures that
					 will help achieve a better integration of the economy and the
					 environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2000 and in budget update 2000, $1.4 billion
					 was allocated toward key environmental challenges. One of those challenges of
					 course is climate change. A green municipal investment fund is a part of those
					 initiatives and is there to provide loans in support of municipal projects in
					 such areas as urban transit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of reducing greenhouse gases within the scope
					 of mass transit, our government is also leading by example. The Alternative
					 Fuels Act of 1995 requires that three-quarters of the federal government fleet,
					 which includes those green buses we see travelling up and down the Hill, if
					 vehicles meet the minimum feasibility requirements, will use alternative fuels.
					 Clearly this is a positive step in reducing greenhouse gases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to thank the hon. member for
					 bringing this important issue to our attention, but as I have articulated there
					 are better ways to use public moneys in order to achieve the goal of minimizing
					 greenhouse gases and better serve the environment. The tax deductibility
					 provided in Bill C-209 does not meet the tests required for an efficient,
					 effective and wise use of public funds. Therefore I am not in support of Bill
					 C-209.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to Bill
					 C-209, introduced by the hon. member for Jonquière. I cannot overemphasize how
					 well advised she was in introducing this bill in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few moments ago, I was listening to the comments of
					 the Liberal member. I should point out that this bill is in response to a
					 motion agreed to by this House in 1999, concerning a tax exemption for using
					 public transportation. That motion was presented by the hon. member for
					 Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, Nelson Riis. The motion was agreed to,
					 but nothing was ever done about it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remember the decisions made by this House
					 before dismissing out of hand a legislative proposal by a parliamentarian based
					 on an earlier decisions of the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary of the bill states its objective very
					 well:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This enactment amends the Income Tax
						  Act to allow an individual to deduct certain public transportation costs from
						  the amount of tax payable.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course a bill that includes many benefits
					 and positive elements. In the next few minutes, I will explain the various
					 positive elements that I see in this legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us look at the economic activity. It is all
					 the more important to talk about it, since all the indicators seem to point to
					 a rather significant downturn in our economy. Consequently, we have to see what
					 we can do to stimulate the economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would provide a tax incentive to individuals
					 who use public transportation and thus reduce the number of vehicles on our
					 roads. This would, in turn, greatly improve the movement of goods and people in
					 and around major urban centres. Since our economy is increasingly based on the
					 just in time delivery principle, it is becoming more and more important that
					 vehicles move as freely as possible, particularly those that transport goods,
					 so as to allow businesses to meet their obligations in this respect.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to point out that one 40-foot
					 bus on the road eliminates 40 to 50 cars from that same road. Multiplying the
					 number of 40-foot buses. one can see the effect that can have on car traffic.
					 In Montreal, for instance, if people all took their own cars, the average
					 length of a trip would be tripled, to one and one-half hours. That is pretty
					 significant. The more emphasis is placed on public transit, the more likely
					 there is to be a drop in the number of vehicles on our roads.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would this incentive have that effect? As I have
					 said, it would be, for people who need to travel, an incentive to use public
					 transportation. This would raise the revenues of public transportation
					 companies and could have the spinoff effect of improving service, frequency and
					 routes, thus improving ridership still further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also numerous advantages relating to the
					 environment and health. Our Liberal colleague has just referred to the Kyoto
					 protocol, which the Canadian government has signed, committing it to a 6% cut
					 in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010-2012.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is wonderful in principle. It is entirely
					 laudable. However, we are waiting for the government to actually follow up on
					 this commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what might have been expected, the
					 government has for some time now taken a number of decisions which struck us as
					 illogical, counterproductive and even harmful, given the stated purpose. One
					 obvious example is the fact that the government, while now racking up
					 significant budget surpluses, has deliberately decided to reduce its annual
					 funding of $7.2 million to the Canadian Centre for Magnetic Fusion. The
					 centre's activities were part of a vast program of international research into
					 nuclear fusion, which will eventually enable us to develop a clean, abundant
					 and safe form of energy that is respectful of the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its great wisdom, when it decided to sign and
					 initial the Kyoto protocol, the Canadian government simultaneously decided to
					 end nuclear fusion research in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it perhaps now realizes, if it had not already been
					 secretly planning this, it is now using taxpayer money to promote the Iter
					 project, which would be located in Ontario. The purpose of the Iter project is
					 to construct a nuclear fusion megareactor. Expected to cost in the billions of
					 dollars, this project comes after the nuclear fusion reactor in Varennes in my
					 riding was shut down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also looked at other decisions and other
					 avenues the federal government has in mind in order to meet the objectives of
					 the Kyoto protocol. It is apparent that the government is trying, or thinking
					 of trying, to shift most of the work onto the shoulders of the private sector,
					 of industry. A look needs to be taken at the legislation in effect in the
					 various provinces. I am thinking of Quebec, where environmental legislation is
					 very tough and where industry has already made considerable efforts to reduce
					 greenhouse gas emissions. They are being asked for 6% more, while the federal
					 government is making little or no effort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be able to expect the federal government to
					 subsidize public transportation, but the federal government is not contributing
					 a penny. This is all the more astonishing when we hear that the U.S. government
					 is investing $41 billion over six years in public transportation. The U.S.
					 government, which is the outcast of the international community because it
					 refuses to implement the Kyoto protocol, because it is going back to thermal
					 power plants and the list goes on, is investing $41 billion over six years in
					 public transportation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it is very clear that public transit reduces the
					 number of vehicles on the road, vehicles that are to a large extent the source
					 of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few statistics supplied by the Canadian Urban
					 Transit Association, which reveal the scope of the problem. A vehicle emits
					 some four tonnes of pollutants annually, nearly four times the per passenger
					 amount emitted by a bus. One bus permits a saving of 70,000 litres of gasoline
					 and nine tonnes of atmospheric pollutants every year. These figures send a
					 clear message.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In health terms and my colleague from Jonquière pointed
					 this out in her speech, some 16,000 Canadians die each year as the result of
					 high levels of urban pollution. This is not to be taken lightly. The number of
					 children hospitalized for problems related to asthma increased by 23% between
					 1980 and 1990. In terms of health care costs alone, the government would likely
					 save as much if not more than the fiscal spending this measure proposed by my
					 colleague from Jonquière would entail. I would like to add that this measure
					 would also be fairer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen recently that the number of Canadians
					 earning over $250,000 and not paying a cent of income tax had
					 increased--</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the hon. member for Jonquière on this
					 good idea.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is very good and provides guidance and
					 direction to the government where it has failed in dealing with more innovative
					 ways in which we can reduce our greenhouse gases and dependence on fossil
					 fuels. The bill would allow tax reductions for users of public transportation
					 services in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cost for our failure to deal with
					 alternative fuels as we have not looked at ways to reduce our greenhouse gas
					 emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Some 16,000 Canadians die prematurely
					 every year from poor air quality. The increase in asthma and other pulmonary
					 related disorders among children has increased by a whopping 23% between 1980
					 and 1990. This has a huge cost upon our health care system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care costs resulting from automobile use alone
					 were reportedly over $1 billion a year. Motor vehicles are the principal source
					 of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 32% of the total amount.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is important because it would lessen our
					 dependence on cars. It is an innovative way to ensure that people would use
					 alternative methods, particularly public transportation. We are one of the very
					 few western democracies that do not have a national public transportation plan.
					 There is no co-ordination within our country on how to lessen the dependence of
					 the movement of people on our roads. The bill provides that option.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many economic benefits apart from the health
					 ones. It lessens our dependence on using roads. Therefore it lessens the
					 considerable costs that we have in terms of rebuilding our transportation
					 arteries. It is a very significant deficit as members from across the country
					 will attest. Almost all of us have some very serious significant problems in
					 all of our ridings with respect to the transportation arteries in our country.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has not been enough money applied to
					 transportation arteries by the government. One source of revenue is gas taxes.
					 The Canadian public would be surprised, in fact shocked, to know that only 4.5%
					 of the revenues derived from gas taxes goes toward the improvement of
					 transportation arteries. By comparison, some 90% of the money that is taken
					 from gas taxes in the U.S. goes toward the improvement of transportation
					 arteries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are no paragon of virtue in terms of public
					 transportation. Perhaps, then, we ought to look not only within the bill but at
					 the experiences within Europe. There were similar activities in Europe and the
					 costs of private transportation use decreased. Private transportation use
					 declined and public transportation increased dramatically. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend in the government made some assertions on the
					 costs to the public purse of employing the bill. I take issue with that. I
					 agree with him that there are certain costs. However those costs would be
					 offset by the benefits not only in terms of health care but in terms of new
					 construction on our arteries and greenhouse gas emissions which have a profound
					 impact on agriculture. Greenhouse gas emissions and weather changes have had a
					 profound impact on agriculture and on our gross domestic product. Therein lies
					 some very strong economic evidence to support Bill C-209.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have done some very good work in looking at
					 innovative ways to use our tax structure as a tool for environmental
					 improvements. The tax structure could encourage the use of alternative fuels
					 and alternative methods of utilizing energy. Those who use electrical power,
					 solar power, or who have cars that do not use fossil fuels but rather
					 combinations of methanol, ethanol and other substances that lessen emissions,
					 should receive a tax credit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers who investigate other forms of energy use
					 should also receive a tax credit. Perhaps gas taxes could be targeted toward
					 the exploration, research and development of alternative fuels. There are quite
					 a few researchers doing innovative work in a number of universities across
					 Canada. Some excellent work on new types of electric fuel cells that hopefully
					 will lessen our demand on fossil fuels is being carried out at the University
					 of Victoria.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-209 could be a jumping off point into some very
					 innovative and positive ways which the government could encourage the use of
					 alternative fuels and alternative uses of energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is another area where there is abuse. The cost of
					 water to us does not represent its true value. There are opportunities within
					 our tax structure to encourage alternative uses of water and alternative
					 methods to save water through the type of toilets we use. There are certain
					 types of low flow toilets that decrease the amount of water use considerably.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are alternative methods to water use within
					 agriculture. Farmers have implemented very innovative ways, copied from Israel
					 and Texas. They use low flow forms of agricultural irrigation that minimizes
					 water use with maximal benefit. Those farmers, industries and consumers that
					 are using alternative fuels of non-renewable resources should receive tax
					 credits. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface one might argue that there is a cost. My
					 friend from the government is correct. That is, however, offset by savings in
					 terms of encouraging this alternative method. The tax structure is a method of
					 encouraging more responsible use of non-renewable resources that would provide
					 not only an environment which is more conducive to our health but significant
					 savings in terms of agriculture, health care and our economy as a
					 whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring to the government's attention its failure to
					 address this issue in a very substantive form and I congratulate the member for
					 
					 Jonquière for bringing
					 this bill forward. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the government to work with the member for 
					 Jonquière and others in
					 the House who are leaders in the environment such as the chair of the
					 environment committee. He has been in the House for a long time and has some
					 very profound and important ideas. He is also a member of the government. These
					 members would advise us on what we could do to improve our
					 environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the government to take a leadership role,
					 step up to bat and look at the ideas within the House and our country.
					 Considerable expertise, knowledge and research has been done. The government
					 should work with the provinces to develop a comprehensive plan to have a more
					 sustainable and healthier environment.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Jonquière
					 for bringing forward this motion, which is not a new request.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Urban Transit Association and the
					 Federation of Canadian Municipalities have been exerting pressure for years in
					 support of this change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Mr. Riis, a former colleague and member of
					 parliament for Kamloops from 1980 to 2000, also supported this
					 initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that between 1991 and 2020 emissions
					 caused by vehicles will increase by 52%. If we really want to reduce greenhouse
					 gas emissions, we must find a way to promote public transportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax exemption for public transportation passes
					 provided by employers would be a very good first step.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support this motion. As I indicated it has a history
					 within the NDP. The former member from Kamloops, Mr. Riis, was a great advocate
					 of this measure, as have been other New Democrats over the years. We would go
					 further to allow businesses to write off the expense of providing public
					 transit passes to employees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some small steps that the government could
					 take toward trying to encourage Canadians to use public transportation. They
					 could be small parts of an overall strategy to meet our commitments as far as
					 Kyoto is concerned and as far as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is
					 concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I was very disappointed a member on the
					 government side rose and did the usual thing. He trashed the idea by saying
					 that it was not good enough. It is a whole lot better than nothing. It is a
					 whole lot better than what we get from the government when it comes to real
					 policy changes to encourage people to use public transportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member has a better idea maybe he should
					 say so, instead of just pouring cold water on every suggestion members come up
					 with for trying to help our society to save the planet so that someday our
					 grandchildren will not inherit from us an environment in which they cannot
					 breathe the air or drink the water as a result of the disposition on the part
					 of the government to find fault with every proposal that is made but then not
					 come up with any of its own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far all I can see on the part of the government is
					 that it wants to get credit for trees when it comes to greenhouse gas
					 emissions. This is the Liberal strategy: count the trees, count them as carbon
					 sinks. In that way they do not have to do anything. They can just be involved
					 in a sort of global bean counting, global manipulation of the figures so that
					 Canada does not have to actually reduce any greenhouse gas emissions at all. Is
					 that not wonderful? Will that not make the air a lot better?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not get it. Yet the Minister of the Environment
					 and the government seem fascinated by this approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think there are a number of measures, and this
					 private member's business is only one aspect of what could be done. Certainly I
					 would have thought that anybody in their right environmental mind would support
					 a motion like this designed to encourage people to use public transportation.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know where the hon. member is from, but I sure
					 hope he is not from Toronto. If one has ever been to Toronto, Montreal, or for
					 that matter Winnipeg or any of our bigger cities, one of the things we have to
					 do is to get more people out of their cars and into public transportation,
					 walking, cycling or whatever. Those things are not always possible,
					 particularly in Winnipeg in the winter. We have to find ways to encourage
					 people to use public transportation and here is a way we could do it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member from the Alliance was very eloquent as to
					 the growing incidence of pulmonary and respiratory diseases, the growing
					 incidence of asthma among young people. This is not a coincidence. It is not
					 like this generation is somehow genetically inferior over the last generation
					 when it comes to their lungs. It has to do with their exposure to air
					 pollution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot read the writing on the wall, how long do
					 we have to ask our children who are coming down with asthma and these other
					 respiratory diseases to be the canaries in the mines for us? The canaries have
					 asthma. The canaries have other conditions. They are telling us something. They
					 are telling the Liberal government to act, to not count the trees and see what
					 kind of credit it can get for that in some kind of global statistical game, but
					 to do something about air quality in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things the government could do and one of
					 the things backbenchers could do, even if their government were not willing to
					 do it, would be not to get up and recite the latest departmental argument
					 against this but to actually show some courage and be for something that
					 parliament could do. We should be giving instructions to the departments on how
					 we will solve our problems and not the other way around.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term the savings to our health care system
					 would be incredible if we could deal with some of these problems, but no, we
					 want to keep all the accounting separate and have walls between all the
					 separate books we keep on health, the environment, transport, et
					 cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are all related to each other. The time
					 has come for us to do a different kind of accounting here and take into account
					 all the costs of the way we do things. If we did that and took into account all
					 the savings that would come from encouraging people to use public transport, we
					 would have an entirely different set of books and a set of books that would
					 justify us taking these kinds of environmental measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case I have not made myself clear, I am in favour of
					 the motion. I hope other members can see their way to being en faveur de cette
					 motion également.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have a few minutes left I would just like to
					 say that there is a comparable public policy issue, a favourite of mine. I
					 cannot resist the temptation to insert it here because it runs parallel with
					 this. The concern to get people out of their cars and into public
					 transportation, particularly in an urban context, is, in my mind, very much
					 like the concern I and other members have to get freight out of the trucks, off
					 the highways and back onto the rails where it belongs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again we have exactly the same situation. We have
					 more greenhouse gases being emitted than need be. There are trains that are
					 about 10,000 feet long, which is too long in my view but nevertheless they are
					 there. Can anyone imagine how many trucks that would equal? Yet they are all
					 being pulled by one diesel unit. The same comparison would be to take all the
					 people off a bus and put them in individual cars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is serious about its greenhouse gas
					 emission strategy, that is to say the reduction of the gases, it should stop
					 counting trees, making up stuff about carbon sinks and get with it. It should
					 devise a transportation policy that will encourage people to use public
					 transportation, that will create incentives for people to ship by rail and, for
					 that matter, disincentives for people to ship by truck where there is no real
					 justification for doing so.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to follow the
					 member for Winnipeg--Transcona. He does have a tendency to build enthusiasm
					 into a debate. I appreciate a number of his comments as well as the comments of
					 other members of the House during the debate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate him chastising the government member for
					 Northumberland who spoke in opposition to the legislation. I am afraid I will
					 to have to continue on with that tact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Northumberland did not put a very
					 convincing debate forward as to why he and the government should not support
					 the legislation which is a small start and a small piece of a very large
					 problem. The legislation put forward today would be one way to start the
					 process and ultimately reduce emissions in the atmosphere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continually see the Liberal government spending an
					 inordinate amount of energy coming up with reasons not to do something positive
					 as opposed to coming up with reasons things should happen in a positive
					 fashion. I will give some examples. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason the government came up with is that
					 this cannot happen because it is a tax rebate of sorts. It would be a tax
					 write-off against the cost of public transportation. The member for
					 Northumberland says that not all people who take public transit actually have
					 taxable income and therefore it would not be an advantage for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not wonderful? If that is the case, perhaps
					 there should not be any taxable write-offs at all. I am sure some people would
					 be affected where they do not have taxable income and therefore it would not be
					 an advantage for them. However it would be quite an advantage to a number of
					 other people who do have taxable incomes. We should look at the positive side
					 of this as opposed to the negative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not believe it when I heard the member suggest
					 that because we now accountability a person has to collect receipts in order to
					 get a taxable benefit write-off. He said that the Canada Customs and Revenue
					 Agency, heaven forbid, would be flooded with the receipts that people would
					 collect and be able to use as a tax write-off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have any taxable write-offs if CCRA cannot put
					 together a simple system to account for the tax deductibility of a bus ticket.
					 Is that not wonderful? We have a tax collection system that cannot possibly
					 handle this flood of receipts that would be put forward for a tax
					 write-off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the reason the government does not want to
					 accept the legislation, it should come back to the House with some better
					 alternatives. It is so easy to say no. It is always easy to throw water on
					 something that is very positive but it is not so easy to come forward with some
					 positive suggestions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at another one. In another life I actually
					 had a lot of experience with respect to public transit. I sat on the board of
					 directors of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. I also sat on the
					 transportation committee of the FCM. Every year we put forward to the federal
					 government a suggestion that there should be a tax advantage if in fact people
					 take public transit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a chicken and an egg scenario here. Public
					 transit is funded by the municipalities and the provinces. Since the federal
					 government has no responsibility for public transit, why should it take any
					 risk and lose income? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The municipalities for the most part fund public
					 transportation. They put a lot of funding into it so they can take people off
					 their infrastructure, get them out of their cars and into buses, LRTs and GO
					 trains. The municipalities and the provinces fix the roads, not the federal
					 government, which has abdicated its responsibility for that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the advantage of the municipalities to put
					 money into public transit and get people out of their cars. All we are
					 suggesting is that the federal government take the small risk of getting people
					 out of their cars and into public transit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, when we take people out of their cars and
					 put them on public transit we also serve a useful purpose, which is to protect

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to live in the wonderful city of
					 Toronto for a number of years. When I drove from my house to downtown Toronto
					 where I worked, I could see in the skyline a terrible yellow haze. The haze
					 came from pollution. We know now that in our major urban centres we have a
					 serious problem with pollution. We know that on an annual basis Toronto has
					 more and more days where there are smog alerts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member for Winnipeg--Transcona has indicated, if
					 members have not got the message already, support the legislation on behalf of
					 the coalition. I would really like to see the government rethink its position
					 because it is a good first small step. It should do something positive for
					 once.</p>
