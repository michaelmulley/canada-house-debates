annually for the purpose of training in the Canadian Armed Forces 
reserve.  This legislation does not affect the private sector and 
private sector employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of legislating employers to allow training time for 
reservists with full time employment has been a contentious issue 
for some time now and, in particular, since the increased 
contributions in military activity since the early 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the problem a national organization called the 
Canadian Armed Forces Liaison Council was designed.  It was first 
established in 1978 with a goal that was not aggressive enough to 
accomplish its mandate of bringing more employers into agreement 
with allowing reservists to participate in the Canadian Armed 
Forces reserve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 it was reorganized, given its present name and a new, 
more challenging mandate.  The Canadian forces liaison council's 
mandate not only includes promoting reserves to the business 
community, but also advances reservists' concerns to business and 
works directly with employers in the area of recruitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces liaison council has been very successful. 
More than 3,000 employers have indicated their support of the 
reserve force in writing, including more than 1,700 who have 
adopted a military leave policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some employers also pay the difference between military and 
civilian pay and other employers are even giving two additional 
weeks' leave for courses in the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that the Canadian forces liaison council has done 
a wonderful job.  However, its role has been limited to the 
private sector and there is room for improvement, in particular 
when it comes to the need for the federal government to take a 
leadership role in allowing its employees to participate in 
reserve training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This first came to my attention in 1994 when the then chief of 
defence staff, General John de Chastelain, appeared before the 
special joint committee reviewing Canada's defence policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I posed a question to the chief of the defence staff on 
this issue he told the committee that the federal government was 
the worst offender in allowing training time for reservists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in 1995, after the report on restructuring the reserves 
was presented to the Minister of National Defence and then to the 
House committee on defence and veterans affairs, I asked the 
members of the commission, the three commissioners, again to 
confirm whether or not the federal government was playing a 
proactive role in allowing reservists the training time they 
required to participate in the Canadian Armed Forces.  Again they 
agreed with me that the Government of Canada, the federal 
government, the largest employer in our nation, was not in fact 
promoting reserve friendly policies in office protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There it is.  A contradiction exists.  On the one hand the 
government encourages private sector employers to have their 
employees participate in reserve training through the Canadian 
forces liaison council.  On the other hand, public service 
employees are not receiving that same encouragement.  Bill C-232 
addresses that discrepancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When surveying different defence associations across the country 
about my bill, I received a letter from Lieutenant Colonel D.W. 
Wright, representing the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps 
Association.  He said that the Government of Canada has provided 
for limited military leave within the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act.  Employees are permitted to receive a leave of 
absence for military duty and may elect to receive either their 
government salary or their military per diem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say that, unfortunately, the regulation is 
permissive rather than directive and most often thwarted by 
supervisors who exercise the ultimate discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat that because it is very important and very 
disturbing for people who wish to serve their country through the 
reserve force.  He said that the policy is most often thwarted by 
supervisors in the federal government who exercise the ultimate 
discretion.  Therefore that means the reservists must devote 
their annual holidays which they have earned through their work 
with the federal government to meet their training obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with this poor record of the federal government in mind 
that I introduced Bill C-232.  This bill does not attempt to 
supersede the fine work done by the Canadian forces liaison 
council in the Canadian business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence, through the Canadian forces 
liaison council, would still be able to negotiate with private 
sector employers training time for private sector reservists. 
This bill does not affect them in any way, shape or form.  What 
it does is directly attempt to address the poor record of the 
federal government when it comes to reserve training. 
With Bill C-232 I hope to accomplish three fundamental things: 
one, to enhance participation in the Canadian Armed Forces 
reserve; two, to ensure reservists receive the training required 
for effective augmentation of the regular forces; and third, to 
lay the groundwork for a national mobilization plan for Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participation in the reserves can benefit employers tenfold. 
Through their part time military experience reservists acquire 
many skills that are transferable to their jobs, including 
leadership, discipline and loyalty.  Often reservists acquire 
special technical skills which they can use in their specific 
trade or profession in their civilian life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many employers have discovered the tremendous value of reserve 
training and education as their employees become more productive, 
more capable and highly motivated.  All they ask in return from 
their employer is to train and upgrade through their military 
qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few years Canadians have had the opportunity to 
examine firsthand the role reservists play domestically and 
internationally.  I thought I would take just a few moments to 
talk about those instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently, of course, the ice storm in eastern Canada 
required the deployment of some 4,000 reservists to the provinces 
of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick to assist in humanitarian 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, last year's floods in the Red River Valley required 
the deployment of some 500 reservists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international scene, 800 UN peacekeepers, or 20% of 
Canada's entire UN commitment during the UNPROFOR mission in 
Yugoslavia were reservists, part time soldiers, citizen soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 it is interesting to note that Canadian soldiers fought 
their biggest battle since the Korean war.  The battle in the 
Medak pocket pitted Canadian personnel and French troops against 
the war-hardened Croatian army.  More than half of that proud 
troop was made up of citizen soldiers, reservists from the 
militia in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadians won the battle.  It was a true success for our 
Canadian Armed Forces, for reservists and for the total force 
operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reservists continue to play an important role in the Canadian 
Armed Forces as part of the total force.  They serve with 
distinction domestically and internationally and remain a vital 
link between the Canadian military and society at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, as Canada's largest employer, should 
create an environment where individuals can explore service in 
the reserves and serve their country.  For example, militia units 
generally are made up with over 60% of their soldiers being 
either students, seasonal workers or unemployed persons.  These 
soldiers have very few problems when it comes to finding the 
necessary time to train.  However, once the militia reservist has 
finished their schooling and finds a full time job, the reality 
is that their priorities change.  They tend to quit the reserves, 
quit the militia unit, and go into civilian life.  They see this 
option as being easier than juggling their lives to ensure time 
for work, friends and the militia.  These soldiers, in a way, are 
being punished for trying to keep a regular job and a regular 
life while trying to serve the government and Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is designed to enhance participation in the reserve 
from all walks of life, not just from the ranks of students and 
the unemployed.  The federal government must take a leading role 
in facilitating participation in the Canadian Armed Forces 
reserve.  As an employer, government departments and agencies can 
help individuals balance their careers with a desire to serve 
their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attitude will filter down to smaller private sector 
employers.  This is a very important point.  One of the reasons 
for this bill is leadership by example.  We want the federal 
government to do what the federal government is asking the 
private sector to do through the Canadian Armed Forces liaison 
council.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will have two dramatic impacts.  First, many working 
Canadians will have the opportunity to consider serving their 
country part time in the reserves.  Second, the reserves and the 
armed forces in general will benefit from the new pool of skilled 
tradesmen and people with new abilities entering the Canadian 
Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-232 will entitle employees of the federal government a 
period not exceeding two months annually for training or service 
in the reserves.  I will talk for a moment about the two month 
period which I have suggested.  It is a length of time not to 
exceed two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I picked the two month period because the first training course 
a reservist must take is the general military training course. It 
is commonly referred to as recruit training.  Some of us would 
call it boot camp.  It is an eight week course and new recruits 
must successfully complete the course in order to continue 
service in the militia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reservists may receive their recruit training on weekends. 
Usually it is over an extended period of time, about six months 
in length.  They have to attend recruit training every weekend, 
or it is offered on an eight week summer course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people interested in serving with the reserves have been 
unable to commit to the eight week period during the summer, 
especially when they are employed full time.  Some are unable to 
give up their weekends for a six month period.  Others cannot get 
permission from their employers to take the summer course. 
Therefore service in the reserves is not an option for these 
people at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-232 will enable employees of the federal government and 
crown corporations to take the initial eight week recruit 
training course.  This will open up the reserve option to many 
working Canadians who previously could not take that course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that the reservists will want a two month 
training period every year.  In fact reservists would not even 
have the opportunity to take two months a year.  They would still 
have to apply for a course.  They would have to meet a certain 
criteria.  Most of the courses available to the reserves are not 
eight weeks in duration.  In fact the normal period is about two 
weeks and that is why in my bill I specifically say up to an 
eight week period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are essentially three types of reserve service.  Class 
<I>a</I> is a part time status which involves working one or two 
nights at the local community armoury and working on some 
weekends.  Training cannot consist of more than 12 full 
consecutive days.  Class <I>b</I> and class <I>c</I> services 
involve longer periods of continuous reserve employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important point to note is that except for the initial 
training course most other training and specialty courses are two 
weeks in duration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point in my bill is forced generation.  If 
Canada is realistically to look at the mobilization plan outlined 
in the 1994 white paper, a policy such as this one would have to 
be put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask for unanimous consent of the House for Bill C-232 to 
be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent of the House to make the bill votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure 
to speak on Bill C-232 presented by my colleague from 
Okanagan—Coquihalla, an act to facilitate participation in the 
reserve forces of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support participation in the reserves.  In fact, in my 
riding of Bruce—Grey we have the Grey and Simcoe Foresters and 
Lieutenant-Colonel Rutherford who went to Somalia.  We know of 
the good work of citizen soldiers.  They serve their country very 
well.  It is actually quite a good program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service of Canada already has regulations in place 
that facilitate the granting of leave to its employees for this 
reason.  Military leave for employees in the federal government 
is subject to reserve forces training leave regulations under the 
National Defence Act and leave with pay and without pay policies 
of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown corporations operate under their own terms and conditions 
of employment.  Many have included military leave provisions for 
their employees who are reservists. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1120

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to report that approximately 3,000 other 
employers in Canada have participated in the provisions for 
military leave on their terms and conditions of employment.  In 
its current form the proposed Bill C-232 does not bring any new 
benefit to reservists and it does not meet Canadian forces 
operational requirements.  I therefore have no choice but to 
oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of members to clause 2(1) of the proposed 
legislation as it actually reduces the current flexibility of the 
length of military leave and its compensation.  First, this 
provision would be more restrictive than the current treasury 
board policy which does not limit military leave to a two month 
period and allows a choice of leave with or without pay to the 
discretion of the deputy minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the restriction of two months of leave would not 
meet some requirements on United Nations peacekeeping missions 
which are at least 10 months and could be in excess of 12 months 
for United Nations military observers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the provision does not address the issue of 
compensation.  It only provides for an annual leave of absence 
for a period not exceeding two months.  As I have pointed out, 
currently public service employees have the choice to request 
leave with pay or leave without pay for most reservist 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this provision does not provide any flexibility to deputy 
ministers who currently may grant or deny military leave.  At the 
time of a downsized public service it is essential that deputy 
ministers keep some flexibility in the operational requirements 
of their departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding, deputy ministers have been granting military 
leave in accordance with Treasury Board policies.  Between April 
1991 and March 1997 an average of 314 public service employees 
per year were granted military leave with pay and an average of 
20 public service employees per year were granted leave without 
pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be noted that since 1970 there has been no 
adjudicated complaint for not granting military leave in the 
public service.  As well, during the gulf war deputy ministers 
supported granting a leave of absence without pay to employees 
wanting to serve in the Canadian Armed Forces whether voluntary 
or involuntary.  These employees were guaranteed the protection 
of their employment status regardless of the length of the leave 
of absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address another point.  Employees of the 
government and crown corporations are subject to different 
legislation and regulations.  Therefore these latter employees 
cannot be treated in the same manner as is being proposed in 
clause 2(1).  It is my view that clause 2(1) of the proposed 
legislation would place more restrictions on the participation of 
reservists.  Furthermore it is my view that clause 2(2) would 
have an effect on the participation of the reservists and that 
private sector employers would view the legislation as 
unjustified interference by the federal government in their 
labour relations practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence already has the authority to 
enter into agreements with any employer.  Therefore clause 2(2) 
would not provide any new authority that does not exist already. 
Moreover it would be impractical for the Minister of National 
Defence to enter into an agreement with an estimated 10,000 
current employers of reservists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possibility of using legislation to mandate employer support 
for military leave and to provide job protection for reservists 
serving the Canadian forces has already been studied.  It was 
found that such legislation could lead employers to discriminate 
against reservists in their hiring practices.  As well, it would 
result in a significant financial burden for certain employers 
and would cause a general backlash on the part of some employer 
associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I reiterate my position.  I fully support the 
participation in the reserve forces.  I must oppose the bill 
because it would not promote participation and it would not make 
it easier for citizens of Canada who wish to participate in 
reservists activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another note, I have been a member of the Grey and Simcoe 
Foresters in my riding of Bruce—Grey since 1968. 
I speak to the men and women who participated whether it was the 
ice storm we recently had in Ontario and Quebec or the floods out 
west.  There is no doubt in mind that reservists are necessary 
and important.  They have certain skills.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we could have a medical doctor who is maybe a 
professor emeritus of some university with specialist skills in 
case of a sudden chemical war.  In situations where their 
services may be required there is no doubt in my mind that these 
men and women will volunteer their services.  Canadians are well 
known for this.  Dr. Bethune who went to school in the riding of 
Bruce—Grey participated in China with blood transfusions and his 
work helping people overseas is well noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that I love the reservists.  I think they play a 
great role.  It is great that we can draft an engineer working 
for a firm to go overseas to rebuild a bridge that was damaged in 
a war torn place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian example is great for the world.  We export our 
democracy and our civil way of living.  We would like the world 
to be like us because we are a great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today in support of Bill C-232 and the 
principle involved in it.  As I understand, it is basically that 
the government should practise what it preaches to the private 
sector and institute a regime within its own house that would 
permit Canadians who work for the federal government to have 
leave for training as the member intends in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There might be some problems that could have been straightened 
out in committee if the bill had been made votable and referred 
to committee.  I do not think the member on the government side 
made a convincing case for the necessity of the bill being 
defeated at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill contains the germ of a good idea, which I think it 
does and which I think the government member thought it did, I do 
not know why unanimous consent was denied by a government member. 
This could have gone to committee.  The committee could have 
sorted out some of the details and perhaps come back to the House 
with an improved and amended bill but nevertheless a bill that 
would have gone some way toward accomplishing what the hon. 
member intends in the original draft of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add my own compliments and those of my colleagues for the work 
done by reservists over the years both domestically in terms of 
the ice storm and the flooding in Winnipeg and in terms of work 
they have done as part of Canada's peacekeeping forces around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill were to go ahead, it would provide an opportunity 
for more Canadians serving in the armed forces reserve to 
participate, having had the benefit of more training than they 
sometimes have now as a result of the difficulty some of them 
experience, particularly those who are working for the federal 
government but also those in the private sector although the bill 
is intended to deal with those working for the federal 
government.  I am referring to the difficulty they experience in 
getting the permission and the time to take the kind of training 
they would like to have the benefit of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears we are to have a smaller regular armed forces as 
there have been numerous cuts both in the strength and in the 
resources available to the Canadian Armed Forces.  Then we would 
rely more and more on reservists to do the kinds of things we 
want our armed forces to do, whether it be in peacekeeping, 
addressing a civil disaster or whatever the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing has always mystified me over almost 19 years of being 
in the House.  Why have reserves always had to be on the begging 
end of things when it comes the defence budget?  It is the one 
area where there has been no disagreement among the parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have disagreed here in the past on cruise missiles, nuclear 
submarines, all kinds of things.  But no one has ever disagreed 
about the importance of the reserves and the fact that they need 
more resources than they get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That unanimity or consensus has never seemed able to provide the 
impetus for any government that I have experienced so far to 
provide the reserves with the kind of policy framework and the 
resources they so clearly need.  These are needed if they are to 
fulfil both their traditional role and the expanded role which is 
being increasingly required of them as a result of the cuts in 
the regular forces and the increasing demand on Canada to 
participate in various peacekeeping efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable the government decided to stand in the way of 
this bill at least going to committee.  These things could have 
been considered in committee so that we might have before us some 
legislation which required the federal government to make this 
kind of leave available to its employees who are active in the 
reserves and who wish to have this kind of training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would have benefited many people who serve in the many fine 
regiments in Winnipeg, the reserve regiments, the Fort Garry 
Horse, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, the Royal Winnipeg 
Rifles and of course those who serve in both the navy and the air 
force reserves. There are a lot of Canadians in Winnipeg who are 
active in the reserves.  I am sure I speak on behalf of them when 
I say that this bill should have been given more consideration 
than it apparently has been given by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that the bill has not been made a votable item on the 
floor of the House of Commons and sent to committee. Then we 
could have had a recommendation come back to the House that would 
have made it that much easier for the men and women in the 
Canadian Armed Forces reserves to get the kind of training they 
are entitled to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague the hon. 
member for Okanagan—Coquihalla not only for bringing this 
private member's bill forward but also on his recent marriage. 
Congratulations to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend and colleague has done a tremendous amount of work for 
the military for quite some time.  As our previous defence critic 
he did an enormous amount of work bringing the plight of the 
members in the armed forces to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-232 which my friend from Okanagan—Coquihalla has brought 
to the House is an effort to try to augment the ability of our 
armed forces to continue to do the great job it does in 
increasingly difficult times.  As we in this House know, the 
armed forces has had a very difficult time with cuts.  As such 
the number of people in our armed forces to carry out its duties 
has diminished dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we deal with this?  How do we ensure that we are going to 
have enough people to carry out our duties and our international 
obligations as a member of NATO and so many other groups? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-232 enables us to buttress up the number of people in our 
armed forces through reserve members.  The bill calls for a 
number of people to be taken from the public sector up to two 
months every year to carry out their training, their duties and 
their activities as part of a Canadian reserve force that would 
be integrated into our existing standing forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill challenges the government to show leadership.  The 
defence committee's 1994 white paper said very clearly to the 
government that reservists are needed to buttress up the armed 
forces.  A way to do that is to provide opportunities for members 
of the public to become reservists.

have roughly 25,000 members in the reserve force today. The 
government has stated that it needs 30,000.  Bill C-232 paves the 
way for the government to do this. The bill allows people in the 
public sector to take up to two months from their jobs to become 
part of a regular standing unit as reservists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill clearly allows the government to fulfil its duties and 
obligations as part of the 1994 white paper. The bill tries to 
stimulate the government into helping our beleaguered armed 
forces personnel and units to have enough manpower to carry out 
their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our armed forces personnel have had very difficult times over 
the last few years.  In my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca they 
have had extraordinarily difficult times with cuts that have been 
made willingly and in the context of fiscal responsibility. 
However, what the government is doing now is cutting even further 
into the muscle and bone of our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the depot area of my riding which has been a model for 
downsizing and streamlining, the government is going to put these 
people's jobs up for tender.  That is okay as long as the people 
who have those jobs right now are able to compete for those jobs 
in a fair and equitable fashion.  The government is not giving 
them that option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is awful.  Many of these people have been working 
in the armed forces for decades and for a wage that is below 
welfare rates and they are actually being forced to leave their 
jobs.  These people who have been working below welfare rates are 
working because they support the military, they support the armed 
forces, they love their jobs and they love our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the downsizing which has taken place within their 
groups and which has been done willingly and effectively, the 
ministry of defence has now said it is going to take away their 
opportunity to bid for their jobs.  It is going to give the jobs 
out to the private sector. This serious problem not only is 
happening in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca but is 
happening all across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking that the members in the armed forces today be 
allowed to bid for their jobs in a fair and equitable fashion. 
The minister should not throw the baby out with the bath water. 
These people should not lose their jobs. We are going to lose 
jobs and effectiveness in the military if these jobs are tendered 
out to the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our armed forces personnel are having a terrible time in terms 
of their finances.  Some are living below the poverty level. 
There are some things the government can do immediately to 
buttress up the situation in our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First a solution could be to make the accommodation assistance 
allowance non-taxable and payable to all people within our armed 
forces. We should also enable the local commanders to have 
greater flexibility in how to handle the resources on their base. 
They are restricted right now by the Treasury Board.  They could 
become much more nimble and fiscally responsible and have more 
money to help their people and would not be a burden on the 
taxpayer if they were able to have more flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also raised rents dramatically on members' 
quarters while they have had a pay freeze for the last seven 
years.  One cannot on the one hand go to our military personnel 
who are already being paid substandard wages and freeze their 
wages, and on the other hand jack up their rents by as much as 
10% to 12% a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of message does that give to our armed forces?  It 
tells them that we do not care about them. That should never 
happen to these hardworking men and women who put their lives on 
the line to keep our country safe and to fulfil our international 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill and other suggestions need to be dealt with as soon as 
possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military personnel have not had the hearing they require 
from this government.  This government has failed our military 
personnel repeatedly in the past.  It has not given them the 
tools to do their job.  It has not given them the money to live 
on.  And this is in the face of men and women, Canadians, who are 
giving their lives and working because they believe in the 
institution of our Canadian military.  Many come from generations 
of military personnel and it is part of their heritage as it is 
part of our heritage to have a fine fighting force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to tell these people what their obligations 
and duties are and where they fit in to the foreign policy 
picture. Do not leave them hanging out in left field. Support 
them. Give them the confidence and respect they have given this 
country for decades and we will have an armed forces that will be 
as good as it can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Okanagan—Coquihalla, a former member of the 
armed forces, a man who knows what he is talking about, has put 
forth Bill C-232.  It is a good and sensible bill, a pragmatic 
bill that is congruent with the government's obligation.  In 1994 
the government promised to build a strong reserve force that 
would complement a shrinking armed forces personnel base. That 
reserve force would enable us to fulfil our international 
obligations in a way which is consistent with our objectives as a 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that every member in this House, in particular government 
members as they are are the linchpins in this, to look at the 
armed forces and to think about supporting its members, many of 
whom live in their ridings.  Support Bill C-232 not only for our 
armed forces personnel but also for Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on this bill, the reserve force act.  As I 
see it this act was designed to facilitate service in the 
reserves of Canada's armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in agreement with the idea behind this bill. This is a very 
real issue of operating and training and recognizes that our 
reservists are a crucial element of the Canadian forces.  Canada 
gets 24% of its soldiers from the reserve for only 3% of its 
budget.  More training means more expertise for our reservists 
and more expertise means stronger Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the reserves as a young man.  I am likely in this 
Chamber today as a direct result of lessons learned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However as with much of what the Reform Party does in this 
House, this bill has not been properly thought through.  There 
are some real dangers in this bill that have to be considered. 
When I say dangers, I mean dangers to the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite sure the Reform Party has not thought of this but if 
this bill were to pass, it would be a further excuse for this 
Liberal government, a government with no respect for the Canadian 
forces, to further cut regular forces.  It would give the 
government an opportunity to say “We have these well-trained 
reservists.  We are a peace loving nation.  We have priorities, 
we can now get rid of our regular force”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know about the Reform Party but my party refuses to 
allow the Liberal Party any more excuses to cut the defence 
department's budget.  It has already been cut by 25% since the 
Liberals took office.  As we have seen in the defence committee, 
this has had negative effects on the military's ability to 
perform.  It has also had a grave effect on the state of morale 
in our forces.  My party will not give the Liberal government any 
more reason to further cut the defence budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk briefly about the practical effects of this bill, 
the effects it will have if implemented and the way it stands 
now.  I am thinking of a postmaster in one of my 39 small 
municipalities.  Could he or she leave for two months?  Because 
of this government's downsizing, there is not enough staff to 
rotate.  Will he leave and the mail will not be delivered for two 
months, or does the Reform Party expect this Liberal government 
to pay for a replacement for two months? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding I know of several government employees who are 
officers in the reserve.  One man is the commanding officer of 
the Sherbrooke Hussars. 
He is in charge of maintenance of all school buildings in the 
municipality.  In his job it would be nothing short of impossible 
for him to leave for two months.  Granted, he has worked out a 
very good arrangement with the school board.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to meet the member for

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
intentions of the bill seem to be quite reasonable. However, when 
we look at the two aspects proposed, it might prove to be 
counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have many reservists who have served their country 
extremely well.  For example, when the flood took place in 
Manitoba, over 800 reservists participated. Over 4,000 reservists 
participated in local communities in Quebec, Ontario and New 
Brunswick and elsewhere across the country.  The recent ice storm 
that struck a good part of eastern Ontario as well as western 
Quebec and the Montreal area saw many reservists helping out 
local communities.  Reservists have played an incredible 
leadership role on the national scene.  Many of our reservists 
have participated in international peacekeeping missions around 
the globe and have proved to be model citizens we are all proud 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is to do two things.  First, it will ask 
the Government of Canada or any crown corporation to allow each 
employee who is a reservists to have two months leave at most. 
The second intention of the bill will also ask the private sector 
to do the same.  As a result of that, each reservists will have 
two months leave to participate in reservist activities, whether 
he or she works for the federal government or for the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this in isolation it sounds reasonable. However, 
many of the activities our reservists participate in will require 
more than two months.  In some cases reservists will have to be 
on the job for 10 months or more.  If there is an activity that 
requires more than two months, reservists will not be able to 
participate. 
At the federal level we have a system which will allow reservists 
to have 10 or more months leave when it is required.  We have no 
need to concern ourselves with government policy concerning 
reservists.  When it comes to the private sector, however, if we 
pass this legislation in the House of Commons, provinces will 
have to modify their labour codes to be consistent with what we 
have passed here.  If we tell an employer that by law he has to 
allow a reservists leave for two months every year, we will 
create an absolute reverse discrimination against reservists. 
The employer may choose not to hire a reservist because he is 
obliged by law to give the reservist two months leave per year in 
order to participate in activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of the legislation may be good, but the implementation 
of it may prove to be counterproductive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have in place a better system.  It leaves an arrangement 
existing now with the liaison office to deal with reservists 
entering into agreement with the private sector so that the 
private sector can do it as a part of that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to report and to share with my colleagues that 
presently there are approximately over 3,000 employers across 
Canada who participate in the hiring of reservists and who work 
with the military and the armed forces in order to make it easier 
for those reservists to have a position that is flexible and a 
position that will allow them to serve their country in times of 
need here in Canada or outside the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may as well not have any legislation that is not consistent 
and that does not provide the reservists with a better 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate my colleague for thinking about the 
importance of making the job of reservists easier and for helping 
them to participate. But these reservists would be better off 
with what we have now than to move to the new proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now over 25% of our military deployment in Canada are considered 
reservists.  They are doing an outstanding job for the country. 
Frankly, if we were to move with some sort of proposal, it would 
have to prove to be better than what we have. To that extent, I 
would be inclined not to support those two amendments in the 
legislation as proposed by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go on record once again on behalf of my constituents 
in Ottawa Centre and many of the people who live in eastern 
Ontario in passing along our great appreciation and thanks to not 
only the reservists who worked so diligently during the recent 
crisis in eastern Ontario and across Quebec and in the Atlantic 
provinces but to the military as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, quite often we forget to look in the mirror to see who 
we are and to realize that in fact we have some of the finest 
military forces in the world, that we are extremely proud of what 
they have done not only here in Canada but across the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are model citizens.  They have served their countries 
greatly, reservists included.  They have participated in missions 
and they were model citizens.  They have done great service to 
their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many reservists in my constituency in Ottawa Centre.  I 
want to congratulate them too. I have many young Canadians who 
want to be part of that wonderful service and also I want to tell 
them that this is a great service to their country, go for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the member's proposals very carefully.  I have a 
very genuine concern that I hope he will address in his summing 
up remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Bill C-232 does, as I read it, is make it a right for a 
reservist to have a two month leave of absence annually from the 
civil service.  This is where my concern is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we give people a certain right to something, then it 
changes the entire character of that institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that if the reserve organization fills its 
complement of soldiers and these soldiers all have a right to a 
two month leave of absence from their employer, I presume with 
pay, then there might be a situation where a poorer quality of 
reservists may stay in the reserve forces.  He or she would be 
guaranteed. 
He or she does not have to make a sacrifice to stay in the forces 
because of the mandatory two week leave of absence they get for 
drilling or service in the militia.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very dangerous. As I read it, one of the reasons 
why our reservists have consistently proven to be such fine 
soldiers wherever they have served is there has been a screening 
of them as volunteers.  They have had to make sacrifices usually 
in order to belong to the reserve forces.  That generally 
elevates the quality of soldier who serves overseas. I would be 
afraid that with making mandatory leave would erode the quality 
of soldier we would have staying in the reserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to thank all members who participated in this debate 
on Bill C-232, an act to enhance the participation of the 
Canadian Armed Forces reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular I would like to thank the government members for 
coming here with the notes of deputy ministers of various 
departments telling us why the federal government should not 
enhance or encourage members of the federal government to 
participate in the reserve force.  This is one of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one of the government members who spoke here today 
basically has talked to bureaucrats and has talked to deputy 
ministers but did not get into the grassroots, did not talk with 
the reservists themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to stand in this House and say that I served 
five years in the regular force and five years in the reserve 
force of the Canadian Armed Forces.  These problems that this 
bill will address are real. These problems are becoming more and 
more evident with the policies of this government. In 1993 when 
this government took over in its white paper it reduced the 
regular force to some 60,000. This government was on track to 
reserve the reserve force.  All the while our international 
commitments and commitments domestically are increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments the government put up today are not reasonable. 
The argument stating this would not allow people in the reserve 
to go out on UN peacekeeping missions is pure balderdash.  This 
is basically saying that the reservists are unable to get the 
training to even apply for that international commitment at this 
point because the federal government is thwarting their ability 
to apply for those courses. The government is saying no and if it 
does say, they have to use their own personal leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not prevent them from applying for a peacekeeping 
mission for 10 to 12 months. Granted, other arrangements would 
have to be made with an employer, because this is not job 
protection legislation.  This is only to ensure they get their 
training to enable them to apply for other missions, to serve our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will address the enhancement of the Canadian Armed 
Forces to more than just unemployed people and students. It will 
open the forces up to a wide variety of people with different 
skills that will bring a new meaning to the term citizen soldier. 
This will bring new skills and abilities and it will also 
address another very important issue in the white paper of 1994 
by this Liberal government, a mobilization plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of the day outlined a mobilization plan with four 
strategic ways to expand our force if needed.  None of those 
commitments have been met.  This bill addresses it because 
whatever mobilization plan we have in this country, we will 
require trained and capable armed forces personnel and they will 
have to be made up partly with reservists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, this bill does not discriminate against reservists.  There 
are discrimination laws in this country.  A pregnant woman cannot 
be discriminated against, and neither can a reservist.   That is 
a basic principle in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those arguments that have been put forward have blinders on to 
the facts.  We have a Canadian Armed Forces that is declining in 
numbers, a reserve force that needs training and training time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have international and domestic commitments that are 
increasing on a yearly basis, almost on a daily basis, yet this 
Liberal government has failed to do anything for those people and 
for the state of the Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, with those arguments and because we have heard today 
in this debate that we have support in principle from the 
Conservative Party, we have support from the Reform Party, we 
have support in principle from the New Democratic Party and, by 
the sound of the Liberal speakers and the notes they got from 
their bureaucrats to argue against this bill, there was even a 
hint of support in principle from those people, I would say, for 
goodness sake, let us not stand in the way of progress.  Let us 
move this bill to the next level, send it to committee and get 
all of these details ironed out there.

by the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is a bill that discusses income tax without providing 
any tax relief for Canadians.  Second, it is a bill that talks 
about income tax but does not provide people with a 
simplification of the tax codes, something that has become very 
confusing for many people.  Finally, it is a bill that really 
typifies this government's aimless approach to dealing with the 
problems of the nation.  It is a bill that really does major on 
the minors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, Madam Speaker, let me speak to the motion that you 
have just read.  This motion attempts to roll back what I believe 
is a real attack on the sovereignty of other levels of government 
by the federal government.  Essentially what the government is 
proposing to do is to circumscribe the ability of municipalities 
to raise revenues for their constituents, for the people of their 
cities, villages and towns, through subsidiary corporations. 
There are many such organizations like that in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain to the House and to people who are watching 
this via television why it is really important that 
municipalities continue to have the ability to raise these 
revenues without having them taxed by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to point out that it was the federal government, 
going back to the 1993 election, which made a solemn commitment 
that it would not cut transfer payments to the provinces.  During 
the leaders' debate we know that our current Prime Minister, when 
asked about cutting federal transfer payments for health care, 
said “I said yesterday, replying to Mr. Bouchard, that I promise 
they will not go down and I hope that we will be able to increase 
them”.  The rest is history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Prime Minister did not meet his commitment.  He 
did not come anywhere close.  In fact he cut transfer payments in 
total by about $6 billion.  The result was that the provinces had 
$6 billion less money for health care and higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did they do?  They had to find some way to save money as 
well, so they started to make cuts.  One of the areas that was 
hit were the municipalities.  Municipalities were hit and were 
unable, in many cases, to provide some of the services that they 
typically had been providing.  At the same time the government 
was expecting them to pick up even more services.  Traditional 
services which they used to fund, they were unable to fund.  At 
the same time provincial governments were asking them to pick up 
new services.  In fact the federal government was doing the same 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now see in this particular piece of legislation, Bill C-28, 
the federal government proposing to tax another level of 
government, something which I think is wrong.  I think it is 
incorrect, particularly when this level of government, which is 
the level of government closest to the people, the one that is 
best able to judge, the level of government that does the best 
job of delivering services, is being asked to pick up more of the 
load.  It is wrong for the federal government to propose to take 
away revenues that they earn through their subsidiaries in their 
own municipalities.  It is absolutely wrong, but that is 
precisely what the government is proposing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the end of it.  The final point, and maybe the most 
important point, is that these taxes inevitably always are passed 
on to the consumer.  We know that.  Every member in this House 
knows it.  We know that when corporations are taxed, those 
corporations pass taxes on to the consumer.  That is precisely 
what will happen this time as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this government has a penchant for raising taxes. 
We know that we have the highest personal income taxes in the G-7 
already.  They are 56% higher than the G-7 average.  We know that 
if we were to be competitive with the United States in terms of 
tax levels we would have to have a tax cut in this country of 
over $35 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my colleagues across the way will say that we must take 
into account what happened in the last budget, which reduced 
taxes by partially eliminating the 3% surtax.  Indeed it did. 
But what they did not tell us in the budget is that they just 
finished increasing payroll taxes through the Canada pension plan 
premiums which people have to pay.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, that tax increase will be the largest tax increase in 
Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government does not talk about is the phenomenon of 
bracket creep, an inflation tax that happens every year.  This 
year alone bracket creep will more than wipe out any tax relief 
that the government is proposing to give us through its reduction 
in the surtax.  Eight hundred and eighty million dollars is what 
the government surtax would give Canadians in tax relief.  On the 
other hand, bracket creep would take $1 billion out of their 
pockets.  Canadians, just on that level alone, are coming out as 
net losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say to our friends in the government that increasing taxes is 
not a way to help anybody.  When are they going to learn?  When 
are they going to figure that out?  We have had 107 tax increases 
since the Tories and the Liberals came to power.  We have 
staggering levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Liberal convention this weekend we heard Liberals saying 
that we must have tax relief.  When is the government over there 
going to wake up and figure out that it is time for Canadians to 
have some tax relief?  I am sick to death of seeing the 
government come up with new and creative ways to tax Canadians. 
That is essentially what it has done with this provision in Bill 
C-28.  This is yet another sneaky, back door way of increasing 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleagues around the House, who are concerned about 
the government's trampling on other jurisdictions, understand 
that what the government is essentially doing is proposing to tax 
another level of government, proposing to invade its jurisdiction 
and to invade its sovereignty.  That is wrong and it is 
unproductive.  It does not help when we are trying to build and 
unite a nation.  However, that is precisely what the government 
is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the finance committee when this bill made its way 
through Parliament in the last Parliament.  We heard a 
representative from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities who 
spoke against this particular provision because they could see 
what was going to happen.  The government is again coming up with 
a new way to rip money out of taxpayers' pockets.  It is wrong. 
We need to stand up against this sort of creeping taxation that 
the government has relied on to suck ever more money out of 
taxpayers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking through some documents a few minutes ago and noted 
that between 1993 and, according to the government's own 
projections, 1999 we will have seen federal income tax revenues 
rise by over 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends will say that was growth in the economy.  Give me a 
break.  Growth in the economy would not even be half of that.  It 
would not even come close to accounting for that massive increase 
in income taxes.  This is an increase of over $20 million.  It is 
a 40% increase.  Where did that come from?  It came from these 
sorts of sneaky, back door taxes that this government has used 36 
times in order to get more money out of the pockets of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder we had people standing up at the Liberal 
convention chiding the government and telling it we need to have 
lower taxes in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply conclude by saying to my friends across the way 
and to my colleagues around the House that this is an important 
issue for municipalities.  They are already struggling to provide 
services that used to be provided by other levels of government. 
They are struggling to provide basic infrastructure for their 
constituents.  Let us not approve this and further circumscribe 
the ability of municipalities to provide those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go the other way.  Let us ensure that the government 
starts to fulfil some of its promises that it made in previous 
elections to provide greater transfers to other levels of 
government which do a far better job of delivering services than 
a big, fat, bloated central government in Ottawa.  Let us hold 
this government to those promises.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I sat here and listened to 
the intervention from the member for Medicine Hat, I could not 
help but come up with a one-word description and that is 
hypocrisy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe he actually stood up and talked about the fact 
that he wanted to now support infrastructure at the local level 
when it was the Reform Party that stood up in this House day 
after day saying the federal government should not put forward an 
infrastructure program for the municipalities that was partnered 
by the federal level, the provincial level and the local level. 
Those projects that took place at the local level took place 
because the local municipalities provided input and direction as 
to where the money should flow, bottom up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he stood there I was amazed that he actually had the nerve to 
talk about the bill doing nothing more than providing tax 
increases.  What about the $1.5 billion increase in transfer 
payment going to health, going to a different level of 
government?  What they do not understand is that if you remove 
something it is a decrease.  If you put something back it is in 
fact an increase in the eyes of those who are receiving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he goes on to talk about tax increases and that is 
what this is all about.  Then he made reference to the Canada 
pension plan.  I think he only once had a point to make with 
respect to the motion.  Other than that he talked about the 
broader issue.  He brought up CPP so I thought it would be 
important to comment on that.  And he made reference to the fact 
that CPP was a tax increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I just want to be perfectly clear, and I will speak 
slowly so the member can understand, that a tax increase occurs 
when in effect revenues flow to the consolidated account, to 
government revenue.  CPP premiums flow to a separate CPP fund and 
that fund will be managed to provide rates of return in the best 
interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know they have great difficulty understanding that.  Let us 
talk about another, what they often refer to as a payroll tax, 
the employment insurance premiums. Let us talk about the $7 
billion reduction which has taken place since we came into 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of points I find quite surprising that the 
hon. member would make and then go on to defend in this motion 
and this intervention.  Let us talk about the motion for one 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have Reformers saying they want the municipalities to 
compete with the private sector.  That is essentially what they 
are saying.  They are saying let us take taxes that are collected 
by the municipality, collected in the form of property taxes, and 
set up a corporation which will compete with other private sector 
organizations.  Now they want municipalities to compete in 
private business.  They stand up here and argue that they are the 
big defenders of businesses.  Now they want municipalities to 
actually go out and compete with those corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What in fact the government is doing with Bill C-28 is ensuring 
there is a level of service provided to local taxpayers by 
municipalities while at the same time allowing those taxpayers in 
the municipality to engage in activities outside their specific 
municipalities while at the same time ensuring that private 
business is allowed to compete on a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10% factor came into play.  If 10% of a municipality's 
income is derived from activities outside its jurisdiction, it 
remains tax exempt.  If its income is derived by more than 10% 
outside its jurisdiction, the municipality loses the tax exempt 
status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an example of where one municipality is providing 
hydro to another municipality through an intergovernmental 
agreement.  The municipality providing the hydro will still 
remain tax exempt.  We are saying in an activity where a 
municipality is deriving income greater than 10% perhaps as a 
result of these intergovernmental activities it should not lose 
that tax exempt status because it is still providing a service to 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about areas where the government did receive 
interventions along those lines and I point to the examples of 
Edmonton and Calgary where those municipalities came forward and 
provided that scenario.  The government responded by allowing 
them to maintain that tax exempt status.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance has received a number of 
interventions.  One of the amendments passed in committee of 
which the hon. member is a member was to provide for a deferral 
of one year from 1998 to 1999 of the application of the proposed 
amendments to tax treatments of municipal corporations.  This 
will allow for a detailed review of all the comments and 
recommendations forwarded to the government's attention on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's intent is not, as the opposition party 
attempted to paint, to tax another level of government.  What is 
intended is to provide a fair and equitable way for 
municipalities to maintain their tax exempt status while 
providing services to their local municipality and their local 
residents while at the same time ensuring that private businesses 
and Canadians who are involved in businesses are able to compete 
on a fair and equitable basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party puts forward this motion that would allow a 
municipality to enter any jurisdiction and compete by setting up 
a corporation with taxpayer dollars collected through property 
taxes and compete with other private sector organizations. It is 
absolutely incredible that it would make that type of 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not competing with the private sector.  The role of the 
private sector is very clear.  Businesses should be allowed to 
compete among themselves and should not use taxpayer dollars in 
the form of local municipal corporations, as the Reform Party is 
suggesting, to compete with.  It is absolutely incredible the 
Reform Party would actually say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more technical note, the motion is deficient in that while 
it intends to remove the 10% income test in paragraph 
149.1(d)(5), it leaves in that paragraph the reference to 
subsection 1.2 which becomes meaningless in the absence of the 
10% income test.  The actual motion presented to this House does 
not reflect what I believe the Reform Party was intending to do 
to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as it is presently put forward is flawed.  The basis 
on which the hon. member makes the argument that this government 
is intending to tax another level of government by putting 
forward this motion is completely false.  Reformers go on to 
argue that the purpose of this federal government is to put in 
place tax increases to Canadians, which is completely incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget provided targeted tax relief and reinvestment not 
only in transfers to the provinces but directly to Canadian 
students in allowing them to access education and compete in the 
global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is providing a framework for municipalities to provide 
services to their local communities in an effective, tax exempt 
manner.  When those municipalities decide they want to derive 
more than 10% of their income from their activities outside their 
local jurisdiction they will be treated just like any private 
business and they will be taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put in that context to any councillor at the local level it 
would be a surprise if they stood in opposition to this.  The 
government has already taken measures to respond to continued 
interventions and we will do so over the next coming year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
speak to the Reform motion.  The arguments of the hon. member 
from the Reform Party have nothing to do with the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would however like to comment on the issue of municipalities. 
I believe the government does not understand the concept of 
municipalities either.  Having been a mayor for over ten years, I 
will point out certain facts.  Municipalities change;  some 
decide to amalgamate while others decide to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, what we are saying—and this will be my question for the 
government—is that, when partners sign an agreement, an 
intergovernmental agreement between two municipalities, the 10% 
will not apply.  I think it is important because, as we are 
increasingly seeing it in Quebec, the mixed enterprises are 
forming partnerships that can go as far as being a 50-50 split 
between a municipality and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government is necessarily familiar with the 
issue of municipalities locally.  So I do have a question. 
Could the government perhaps enlighten us as to what would happen 
if the 10% in income from services outside the geographic limits 
and the jurisdiction of municipalities were exceeded but through 
an agreement with other municipalities.  The government cited the 
example of providing hydro.  Does the 10% not apply in such a 
case? 
Will the tax exemption be maintained? It is not clear. It is not 
clear in the request made by the Reformers, nor is it on the 
government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Close attention will have to be paid to the matter of the 90%. 
As I said earlier, in more and more associations, groups and 
mixed companies, there is much stronger participation from the 
private sector. This is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment I will make—and I must say that we will not be 
able to support the Reform motion—is that the government ought 
to be careful because dealing with federal and municipal taxes is 
one thing, but interfering in a municipal jurisdiction is 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian Constitution, municipalities are delegate 
governments controlled by the provinces. 
They are not governments recognized under the Constitution Act, 
1867 as the federal and provincial governments are. They are 
delegate governments. We could go as far as saying there could be 
a single municipality per province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to caution both my colleagues in opposition and on 
the government side to be careful when they talk about any 
legislation dealing with municipalities. Municipalities are 
facing deficits as well because, let us not forget that, when the 
federal government cuts assistance to the provinces, the 
provinces make a stink. When in turn the provinces make cuts, 
supposedly in response to federal cuts, the municipalities and 
school boards are left holding the bag. Municipalities are 
currently confronted to a major challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should pay attention to this. Unfortunately, in Bill 
C-28, the government lost track of daily realities. 
It forgot to mention that any official agreement between 
municipal governments, even one exceeding 10%, may be exempt from 
tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will address the Reform suggestion that municipalities should 
somehow be given special status or be granted the ability to go 
outside of their own jurisdictions or responsibilities. We must 
first understand that municipal governments are put in place 
primarily to serve constituents within their own boundaries. 
There is no question they are under a lot of stress.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have served some 10 years on municipal council.  In fact my 
wife currently sits as a member of Mississauga and Peel regional 
council.  I am fairly close to what is going on at the municipal 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that what municipalities want more than anything from 
senior levels of government, whether it is the provincial or the 
federal government, are some long term visions, some long term 
planning. What they have experienced particularly in recent years 
has been almost knee jerk.  All senior levels of government in 
attempting to balance their books are shifting the burden and the 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities are not allowed to run a deficit.  It is an 
interesting concept, one which perhaps we should be looking at at 
this level of government.  In fact we should be legislating it. 
We would agree with members opposite on a few of those issues.  I 
think it has merit and makes sense at least within the mandate of 
a government to take a look at ensuring that we balance our 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities are allowed to carry a certain amount of debt. 
They can carry up to what is referred to as 25% of their own in 
kind revenue.  In kind revenue could include everything from 
taxes, to fees, to levies, to special agreements, whatever could 
be cash in lieu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of my municipality we are fortunate in many ways to 
have Pearson International Airport within the boundaries of the 
city of Mississauga.  Every time members of this place land at 
Pearson, they land in Hazel McCallion country.  We were going to 
call it McCallion international airport but that never got off 
the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the federal government pays a substantial 
amount in the form of cash in lieu of taxation because the 
federal government does not pay property tax, nor does the 
province.  We pay a cash in lieu of taxation to the city of 
Mississauga as a result of the facility that we all use, known as 
Pearson International Airport.  We pay a cash in lieu amount 
which is quite substantial. When you combine all the revenue from 
the taxes that are derived from all the businesses at Pearson 
International Airport, the city would benefit from federal cash 
transfers to the tune of $40 million to $45 million a year, 
including the airport cash in lieu, the post office cash in lieu 
and the taxes that are paid by the businesses that exist within 
the structure of Pearson International Airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipality has a very important relationship with the 
federal government.  There would also be a number of instances 
where the province would pay cash in lieu to the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear relationship between the federal government, 
the provincial government and the municipalities.  In fact, the 
Association of Municipalities of Ontario, on which I served as a 
board member for three years, has called upon a new definition 
with the province and the federal government to recognize the 
role of the municipal government in Confederation.  I think that 
makes sense as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tend to guard our territories a little bit in a parochial 
sense, or as my friend Jim Bradley would say, a “pariochal” 
sense. We get a little bit excited about this stuff.  At the end 
of the day and as I hear members opposite say on a regular basis, 
there is only one taxpayer and clearly that is true.  We should 
be trying to establish better relationships with our municipal 
colleagues and to put in place clear definitions and clear lines 
of authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about the parochial issues that surround municipal 
government. We can see it any day in my community.  There are 
fights going on between Mel Lastman and Hazel McCallion, or Peter 
Robertson and somebody else.  There are disagreements that go on. 
At the end of the day the mayors and the municipal councillors 
are elected to fight for the people within their own 
jurisdictions, within their own boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A councillor may be elected on a ward system.  A mayor is 
elected at large.  In some communities both are elected at large. 
I think Guelph elects its council at large. Members have seen 
some of the ads.  The city of Vaughan ran some ads which caused 
consternation. 
It called itself the city above Toronto and everything which that 
implies, that life is better and so on.  Vaughan is a beautiful 
community, no question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to establish tax rules and grant exemptions as the 
Reform members are looking at, in essence we would pit municipal 
politician against municipal politician.  We would pit community 
against community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that has always been avoided at the municipal level is 
this concept of bonusing.  It is something we see in the United 
States.  I know many of the ideas Reform puts forward do indeed 
come from south of the border.  But this is one that would cause 
great disruption in the existing relationship between 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that I think has been very beneficial in the 
GTA has been the establishment of the mayors and chairs 
committee, founded by my mayor but participated in by all mayors 
across the GTA.  The committee meets on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time we see some acrimony.  The new mayor from mega 
Toronto will walk in with an entourage of press and cameras and 
so on behind him and everyone kind of gets their back up.  He 
will stay for a little while and then he will get up and leave 
after they have had a bit of a fight. I have also experienced the 
other side. The other side is that these politicians and their 
staff tend to roll up their sleeves on a regular basis and they 
try to work co-operatively to the benefit of the GTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle is that we want to attract business, tourists, 
conferences, conventions from all over the world into the GTA. 
Once they land at the McCallion international airport they can 
then decide where exactly it is they would like to locate their 
new plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the decisions are based on something as simple and 
yet as profound as the quality of the schools in a community. 
When those businesses locate they want to know that when they 
move their families in from Asia, Europe, the United States or 
wherever it is, that they are going to be able to enrol their 
children in good quality safe environments for them to go to 
school both at the elementary and secondary levels. They look at 
those kinds of minute details when locating here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to set up a system where we would encourage 
municipalities to start offering perks or bonuses to try to 
generate revenue or to try to beat out the guy next door to them 
to try to attract that business instead of working 
co-operatively, it is my submission that we would be establishing 
a system that would not work to the benefit of the people who 
live in those communities. At the end of the day in municipal 
government we all have to try to get along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit in closing that what the Reform Party and all of 
us here should be thinking about are ways that we can say to 
those municipalities  “Here is some long term planning, here are 
some goals, here is guaranteed funding”,  something they would 
love from provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Channelling our energy in that direction will be much more 
constructive than trying to create some form of special status 
that will lead to increased competition in an area where a 
municipal government should not be trying to take business away 
from one of its colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support Reform's motion in this regard.

I was delighted to hear the comments of the hon. member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the Hazel McCallion international 
airport.  Perhaps it should be called the Liberal boondoggle 
international airport after this government has wasted $200 
million in the botched Pearson contract buyout.  It is something 
for the member to stand in his place and remind Canadians, like 
rubbing salt in the wounds, about what a terrible, atrocious job 
he and this government did in reversing the contract rights of 
people who had a vested interest in that airport which cost 
taxpayers over $200 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke as well about the need for the federal 
government and all levels of government to co-operate with the 
municipalities. He said why can we all not just get along. We 
need clear rules and guidelines so the municipalities know 
exactly what the relationship is with the federal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting because the member's idea of a 
co-operative relationship with the municipalities is to pass Bill 
C-28 without their support, to impose a tax on the businesses 
owned by municipalities, on their utility companies.  That is his 
idea of a co-operative relationship.  That is the government's 
idea of a co-operative relationship with taxpayers.  The federal 
government says “We will co-operate in taking money out of your 
wallet”.  That is its idea of co-operation.  I call it a tax 
grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member seeks to do by supporting this bill and 
opposing our motion is to impose a tax on profitable corporations 
owned by municipal governments.  These are important revenues to 
many municipalities.  Many municipalities rely on the revenues 
they generate from these corporations.  They turn those revenues 
back into the corporations to reinvest in the utility 
infrastructures of their cities, towns and villages. Others rely 
on it to help supplement their general revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake about it.  If we do not support Motion No. 1 on 
Bill C-28 we will in effect be deciding to raise property taxes 
indirectly because there will be less revenues coming into 
municipal coffers.  We will also be putting municipal politicians 
who have been dealing with downloading from the senior levels of 
government for the past decade in the very difficult position of 
trying to decide which areas of their utility infrastructure they 
can cut back on.  That is not good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just went through the terrible experience of the ice storm in 
southern Quebec and eastern Ontario.  Tens of thousands of 
Canadians are still recovering from the terrible consequences of 
that devastating natural disaster.  If we learned one thing it is 
the need for all levels of government to be absolutely focused 
and dedicated on maintaining a top rate utility infrastructure 
that can defeat the attacks made on it by natural disasters like 
the ice storm.  We need municipal utility companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that on the island of Montreal, I understand 
that while most of Montreal was blacked out at the height of the 
ice storm, the municipality of Westmount was still lit up.  Why? 
Because it has its own locally managed and owned utility company 
with an infrastructure that is so sophisticated it withstood the 
collapse of the power network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By imposing a tax on that kind of utility company this 
government would undermine the ability of municipalities like 
Westmount to maintain a power infrastructure which can withstand 
some of the challenges it needs to face.  That is one of the 
reasons we have proposed this motion which would prohibit the 
imposition of this tax on subsidiary corporations owned by 
Canadian municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really another back door tax grab.  This Liberal government 
is very artful when it comes to presenting tax increases as mere 
housekeeping amendments.  That is why it claims it has not raised 
taxes in the past five years since it was elected in 1993.  In 
fact any close study of the books will conclude that the 
government has raised taxes at least 37 times, not including the 
most recent federal government budget. It is little amendments 
like this one which, albeit indirectly and almost invisibly, end 
up sucking more out of the pockets of local taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there is only one taxpayer.  The hon. Minister 
of Finance has said that on many occasions.  If it is true, as 
politicians repeat it all the time, then why do we not respect 
that basic truth of political reality?  Why does the federal 
government jemmy around with the rules of taxation of businesses 
owned by municipalities and in effect impose a higher tax on 
local taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not Hazel McCallion or Mel Lastman or Jean Doré or Pierre 
Bourque; it is not the mayors who own these corporations. 
It is local taxpayers who own these corporations.  They belong to 
them.  By taxing money away from the profitable utility 
corporations they own we are imposing a tax on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of a tax change the government made in the last 
session, a change to the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer 
Act, PUITTA, a long, technical name.  Precisely for that reason 
the government thought it could make a significant change to 
Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act that nobody would 
notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course Reformers noticed.  We opposed this enormous tax grab 
as vigorously as we could.  The government still passed it.  It 
said that privately owned utilities, private sector utilities, 
would no longer be able to compete on a level playing field with 
their counterparts in the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta, the province I represent, we have a vigorous private 
sector economy.  We believe in something the government does not 
understand very well called free enterprise. We believe that 
privately owned, privately managed businesses in the private 
sector are ten times out of ten more productive and more 
efficient in servicing consumers than crown corporations. That is 
why Albertans have maintained an infrastructure of private 
utilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just so happens that publicly owned utilities like Ontario 
Hydro and Hydro Quebec do not have to pay income tax or corporate 
tax on their profits.  I do not quarrel with that.  Perhaps it is 
a sensible policy.  Until 1996 the federal government provided a 
rebate to consumers of private utilities because private 
utilities had to pay those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect this rebate levelled the playing field so that an 
elderly lady paying for her heating bill in southwest Edmonton 
would not have to pay the portion that was going into the tax 
coffers of the federal government.  That is what PUITTA did.  It 
helped that woman and millions of other consumers of private 
utility services.  It levelled the playing field so that they 
were not paying more than their counterparts in Ontario or Quebec 
who were taking advantage of utility services provided by public 
crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said to Alberta and private utility consumers 
that it was sorry they did not count as much as the people being 
serviced by crown corporation utility providers.  It made a 
technical change in the tax act like the one in Bill C-28.  It 
made a technical change, a housekeeping amendment, that most 
people did not notice.  The government called it a spending cut 
and generated a few hundred million dollars in new revenue out of 
the pockets of hard pressed taxpayers whose utility bills 
principally in the province of Alberta went up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the change to PUITTA did.  It is the same kind of 
back door, sneaky tax increase we find in Bill C-28, which we in 
the official opposition are trying to rectify through this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, my party and I believe in a principle known as 
subsidiary, a principle of political theory which suggests—and I 
believe it is a self-evident truth—that the lowest level of 
government, the level of government closest to people is the best 
level of government to serve them.   We need to respect that 
level of government, not to treat it in the backhanded manner the 
bill seeks to do.   We say to municipal politicians and property 
taxpayers that we want to avoid this back door tax increase. That 
is why we seek support for Motion No. 1.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak.  After the fine speech by my colleague I 
feel like saying amen and sitting down, but I will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a little different angle on some of the 
problems with Bill C-28.  As has already been noted, it is 
another tinkering bill.  People on that side of the House seem 
impressed that they have a 460 page book in both official 
languages which they can add to the long chain of books that 
drags and tugs behind business people, entrepreneurs and families 
as they try to make their way in the world.  It hangs behind them 
like the dead weight it is.  The bill will not improve the 
situation.  It is tinkering that does not get to the real nub of 
the problem that tax rates are too high. 
The bill does nothing to address that.  The amendment put forward 
by the Reform Party is at least an attempt by the official 
opposition to rectify a systemic problem on for members on that 
side of the House.  They have never met a tax they did not like.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to look at the taxation problems, especially in the 
context of British Columbia, and to put forward some Reform Party 
ideas to stimulate growth, especially in British Columbia where 
we are at the precipice, it seems, of being in a very serious 
financial situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly give some background.  British Columbia was the 
only province in Canada last year to post a net loss in jobs. The 
situation is very serious.  The unemployment rate right now in 
rural areas is pushing 13%.  The idea that British Columbia can 
be taxed and milked and the rewards of that sent off to Ottawa to 
be distributed by the good graces of those across the way is not 
going over very well in British Columbia right now. We feel we 
need to hang on to as many dollars as we can in our own province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February the jobless rate in B.C. hit a four year high. 
Experts predict B.C. will lose even more jobs this year.  The TD 
Bank predicts economic growth of .5%, virtually stagnant growth. 
In essence British Columbia is virtually in a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer and business confidence is down.  The forestry industry 
is on the ropes.  The industry that I made my living in for over 
20 years is now virtually shut down in a good part of the 
province.  I will not blame all the woes of the forestry industry 
on the federal Liberals.  However it is enough to say that B.C. 
is in bad shape economically for a variety of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How have the Liberal tax policies contributed?  In British 
Columbia's case there are some specifics that are only applicable 
to British Columbia.  The Asian economic flu, as they call it, 
affected that province worse than others.  High taxes are 
stunting growth.  There is only one set of taxpayers.  Certainly 
the NDP provincial government of British Columbia is partially 
responsible for the highest marginal tax rates in North America 
at 54%.  It is very much a disincentive to entrepreneurship and 
investing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Liberals are not without fault.  Since 1993 the 
Liberals have raised taxes 37 times in one way or another by 
administrative tinkering as in this bill or as in the PUITTA case 
mentioned earlier, by bracket creep, and by hidden tariffs and 
hidden user fees.  It all adds up to more disincentive for people 
in British Columbia to invest and to take risks with their 
capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Fraser Institute, in 1997 the average British 
Columbia family spent $28,400 in taxes.  The KPMG management 
consulting study suggested what the federal government could do 
to help.  It appears that British Columbia has been shortchanged 
by $1.3 billion through federal government procurement policies. 
Contrary to what the Minister of Finance said in our province 
last week, the Liberals have to take at least some of the blame 
for the economic downturn in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say that it was kind of a cold winter here.  I do not 
know if that is true, but they did say it was interesting the 
finance minister finally had his hands in his own pockets for a 
change.  In British Columbia he still has his hands in our 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill do?  Does it lower taxes to build consumer 
confidence and attract investment across Canada and in British 
Columbia?  No, it does not.  The government continues to collect 
billions and billions of dollars more each year and to offer us 
small amounts of what it calls tax relief by reducing a surtax on 
the income tax and a few other tinkerings.  It takes tens of 
billions of dollars more in increased income.  It is no wonder 
British Columbia finds itself on the economic mat with its back 
to the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP increases passed by the Liberal government were rammed 
through by using time allocation and by refusing to allow lengthy 
debate in the House. 
An Informetrica report indicates that in British Columbia alone 
9,100 jobs will be lost with the CPP tax increases alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to tax and continues to spend.  Instead 
of leaving money in the hands of business people, homemakers and 
families and allowing them to spend it as they see fit, the 
government takes their money, brings it to Ottawa, deducts 50% 
for handling and gives it back in services never asked for or 
programs that do not actually help the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how much longer the government thinks British 
Columbians can handle this kind of abuse.  It cannot be for much 
longer because we are already stagnant.  We are already facing a 
recession.  There is no hope in sight with the Liberal government 
tax policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would Reform do?  Instead of spending the fiscal dividend 
before allocating it in the budget, Reform would invest 50% of 
budgetary surpluses on lowering taxes.  Our initial target is to 
reduce taxes to save the average family over $2,000 by the year 
2001.  That would mean $2,000 every year to do with as a family 
would see fit.  Let us imagine what that would do to the local 
economy of towns like Abbotsford and Chilliwack that I represent 
with 150,000 people or maybe 60,000 or 70,000 families.  Let us 
imagine the impact that much money would have on the local 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would achieve these targeted reductions in 
taxes by reducing the GST and by increasing the basic personal 
deduction to $7,900.  We would reduce capital gains tax, another 
job killer the Liberal government seems to think is a money milk 
cow.  The Reform Party would reduce job killing payroll taxes 
paid by employers and extend the child care expense credit to all 
parents whether they raise their children at home or send them to 
day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion they need help with their finances and more of 
the money left in their hands.  The government should not say 
they can only have the money if they send their children to day 
care.  The government should be saying that it wants to help them 
raise their families and leave more money with them.  The 
government should not choose the type of child care they use.  It 
should allow them to make the decision.  The Reform Party thinks 
that parents or families can make that decision better than the 
government can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall our measures would focus $2.5 billion in tax relief for 
British Columbians.  I cannot tell how desperately tax relief is 
needed.  We need some way of infusing more money into the local 
economy in British Columbia and not sending it to Ottawa where it 
is spent on programs, often programs that we never asked for and 
do not do any good as we try to build our economy back up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes tax reductions would give consumers 
and business people confidence again that when they invest money 
or take a risk they can get ahead.  We believe tax reductions 
would attract investment and immigrants to stay in our province 
with their money, with their investments, to build the province 
and to stay where tax rates are reasonable instead of where the 
tax rates are confiscating too much of the wealth.  The Reform 
Party believes that tax reductions would create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that a nation can tax itself into prosperity is one of 
the cruelest delusions that has ever befuddled the human mind.  I 
agree.  Prosperity is not created in a country by taxing it into 
prosperity.  It is not possible.  It has been tried over the last 
couple of decades.  It is time for another tack, especially in 
British Columbia where tax relief could be offered to the people 
who need it most: the entrepreneurs, the families and the people 
who live in a province that is on the edge of a serious 
recession. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as the 
last speaker pointed out, tax relief certainly is something we 
hear no matter where we go in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget tells us the government's agenda.  As we travel 
around our constituencies the people tell us their concern is for 
debt and tax relief.  They tell us to stop spending.  It appears 
the government has chosen to go in exactly the opposite 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest problem facing the country today is debt and 
interest payments.  The bill does nothing to address them or any 
type of tax relief for the very tired taxpayer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 attempts to make some cosmetic changes but as usual it 
does not go nearly far enough.  We made some amendments but we 
know what will happen to those.  The government is not prepared 
to accept amendments.  It is not prepared to accept what people 
are telling us as we travel around.  Overall, Bill C-28 gets a 
very high failing grade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill unfortunately flies in the face of what people are 
telling us and what a majority of Canadians feel. When it comes 
to tax reform, Canadians want us to flatten the tax base.  They 
want us to simplify the tax system and they want it to be less 
onerous, if nothing else, on small businesses, which provide the 
great majority of jobs in this country. Our tax form is so 
complex with over 2,000 pages.  Amendments come out on a daily 
basis. Accountants must go to course after course on a monthly 
basis in order to simply upgrade.  They are trying to stay ahead 
of what the tax man is trying to tell us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is enormous frustration across this country by individual 
taxpayers and small business taxpayers.  The Liberal government 
fails to hear this message.  It perpetuates rising taxes and the 
overspending that is so common in this place. During the past few 
years there have been over 30 tax increases. Most of them are 
hidden and the government constantly says that there have been no 
tax increases.  But when we look at the revenue figures it is 
very easy to see where the tax increases have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has a few good points.  Encouraging charitable 
donations is an area that should be sponsored.  On the issue of 
volunteerism, we are now asking volunteers to do more and more. 
But if we are going to encourage volunteers and if government is 
going to abrogate its responsibilities, then we must give them 
tax relief so they can do that. We must prevent the abuses that 
go on.  That is the key message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing the contributions for registered education savings 
funds is a positive which has been taken right from our platform. 
We are pleased the government at least can read and has read our 
platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at other things but overall we find that this bill 
simply tinkers. It simply touches a few areas but as usual it 
does not go nearly far enough to provide any sort of tax relief 
for the taxpayer.  Taxpayers must see light at the end of the 
tunnel.  They must know that at some point they are going to get 
a break so that at some point they can rearrange what their lives 
are all about and they can do what we all want, provide more 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By constantly raising taxes we are destroying initiative in this 
country.  While we would all agree there are some areas that need 
help like education and health care, it will come through a 
rearrangement of spending and not by increasing taxation.  The 
very worst thing we could do is put more money in government 
hands because government wastes that money.  We have many 
examples of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weaknesses in this bill are obvious.  It is our job as 
official opposition to alert taxpayers that the tax and spend of 
the Liberal government are back.  This kind of piecemeal bill is 
an indication of how seriously this government takes any kind of 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians are particularly hard hit by this sort of 
legislation.  They are asking what the government does with all 
the tax money it gets.  If these young Canadians are lucky enough 
to get jobs, when they get their first cheques they will start to 
look at their deductions.  Year by year they are asking more and 
more what the government does with that money. 
The government needs to have an answer.  The government needs to 
be more accountable and needs to particularly account for all the 
waste going on.

compete with other countries, with other businesses. We have the 
highest personal income tax in the G-7, 56% higher than the 
average G-7 partner.  We are destroying our ability to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been fortunate for 35 years to travel to pretty well 
every country in the world.  As I have done that I have started 
to realize how our country is falling behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is a great place to live.  Yes, I think we can recover, 
but we are falling behind.  One of the key reasons for that is we 
have too high a tax level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refuses to listen to Canadians.  A Liberal member 
distributed a questionnaire showing that 42% in his riding wanted 
debt reduction as number one and 37% wanted tax relief.  Close to 
80% of his riding said they want to have lower taxes and debt 
reduction.  What does the government do?  It increases spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what the people are asking.  The people do not want 
more spending.  They want rearrangement within the spending but 
they do not want the government to start spending again.  Above 
all, they do not want to pay more taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Liberal government goes on and ignores this factor the 
problem becomes more critical.  We could throw in some what ifs 
here. What if interest rates change?  What if the Asian flu 
affects Canada?  What if oil prices stay low? There are a lot of 
what ifs the government is not taking into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says we are now into a golden age.  It is a golden age as 
long as everything goes as predicted but we also know what 
happens when you assume that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have close to 200,000 young people out of work and looking 
for jobs.  We have a whole generation being lost and we know that 
taxes cost jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payroll taxes in 1966 were $803.  In 1993 they were $3,272.  We 
have the most recent figures.  There has been a 73% increase in 
CPP.  In January one of the things I found by travelling to some 
other countries is that there are other ways to do things such as 
payroll taxes and pension plans.  I will always remember the 
faces of some of those people who told me how proud they are of 
the type of pension plan they have.  Ask young Canadians about 
their pension plans and I know what the results will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the government is happy with 9% unemployment. It 
appears it is happy with a $583 billion debt and $45 billion in 
interest payments.  It appears it is happy and will accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that kind of thinking, I think on this day, Academy awards 
night, the government will be much like the <I>Titanic</I>, and of 
course we know what happened to that ship.  I believe the Liberal 
tax and spend policy will lead to that same sort of final result.

years in providing the tax increases for the Canadian public.  We 
are reaping what we have sown and that is manifest quite clearly 
in the 9.8% unemployment rate that Canadians suffer from, the 
actual rate being much higher, and the nearly 20% unemployment 
rate our students labour under. This is completely unacceptable, 
particularly when we look south of the border and see that the 
U.S. has an unemployment rate of about 4.5% whereas just north it 
is 9.8%.  Why is that so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is we have to look at what we really want to do. 
We want to provide for an economy that is going to enable 
Canadians to have the best social and economic situation that 
they can possibly have.  We also want to have social programs 
that provide for those who cannot take care of themselves and 
provide the social programs that we rely on that set us apart 
from other countries that do not have them such as our health 
care program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need to do that in the context of being able to do 
this within our means.  In other words, we spend not more than 
what we make.  Can we do this?  Indeed we can.  We do not have to 
adopt what went on south of the border where there are huge 
discrepancies between those who have and those who have not, but 
there are leafs to take from that book.  In fact, there are leafs 
to take from our own history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative government around 1992 under Mulroney lowered 
taxes. What happened?  Government revenues went up.  As a result, 
the government went on a wild taxing spree and government 
revenues went down.  The lesson in this, as it is south of the 
border, is when taxes are lowered government revenues can go up 
which would enable us to provide more money for our social 
programs such as health care which is suffering dramatically and 
also ensure that people will have enough money to provide food 
for their children, a place to stay, a roof over their heads, 
education and opportunities.  The government has failed to do 
this.  Instead it has nibbled around the edges with Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples from around the world that we can look 
at.  Look at what is happening in England.  It has taken charge 
of the situation.  It has not nibbled around the edges and it has 
implemented some sensible programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do? For years the Reform Party has told the 
government to ensure that the debt goes down.  If we bring the 
debt down then interest payments will decrease and there would be 
more money for the social programs that we want to pay for. 
Looking at the American or the British situation, people will 
have more money in their pockets to be able to provide for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to tout its much lauded economic statistics 
and say it has done so well.  It has done well on paper but it 
has not done well at the dinner table of Canadians. People have 
less disposable income today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go through a few more solutions that the government can 
adopt apart from what my colleagues in the Reform Party have 
eloquently stated today.  We have to eliminate the waste of tax 
dollars and business subsidies to businesses that do not need 
them and develop a right to work legislation.  When the right to 
work legislation was put forward in the United States over 75% of 
new manufacturing jobs went into those states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right to work legislation enables those companies to be much 
more aggressive on the international market.  For the individual 
person that right to work legislation provided $2,800 more in 
their pockets.  That is what we are trying to, put more money in 
the coffers so we can ensure we will stabilize our eroding social 
programs which are eroding because the government has increased 
taxes, has failed to deal with the economic situation in this 
country and in doing so has failed to provide the stable funding 
required for health care, education and other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payroll taxes need to be decreased.  Right now we are sitting on 
a $13 billion employment insurance surplus.  Why are we doing 
that?  So the government can go in an scoop out a bit of money, 
put it in its pocket and use it when it needs to. 
The best thing that the government can do is lower EI premiums, 
particularly in view of the fact that it has just doubled the CPP 
premium for companies.  Canadians had a rude awakening on January 
1, in particular those who are providing the bulk of the jobs, 
those who are self-employed.  Why do we continually try to 
compromise the private sector in this country, the private sector 
that the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have 
repeatedly said is the primary engine of growth in Canada?  Why 
are we preventing Canadians from getting the jobs they deserve?

</I></B></P><P align=left>England has put forth a new deal for students.  It has created, 
for example, a university of industry.  In this university 
students will learn the skills which will be required in the 
future that will enable them to have high paying jobs.  Also, it 
has provided a new deal for students by giving the private sector 
tax incentives to hire new students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest complaints any of us will hear from private 
employers in our ridings is that the taxes are too high and 
therefore they cannot hire new people.  They cannot invest in 
their companies.  They cannot invest in research.  They cannot 
invest in apprenticeships.  They cannot invest in creating new 
jobs.  When we have a situation like that we erode the ability of 
our economy to be able to provide for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not one or the other.  It is not jobs or social 
programs.  It is not affluence for the rich and be damned for the 
poor.  We can take care of both.  In fact it is beneficial in 
ensuring that we have a strong economy to have strong social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeated government overspending by Liberal and Conservative 
governments has, contrary to popular belief, been the primary 
destroyer of our social programs.  If we spend more and increase 
our debt, we pay more interest which means we have less money to 
provide for programs such as health care.  As a result, we have 
people dying in our hospitals.  People are waiting for two days 
in the emergency department to get into an intensive care unit 
bed.  A senior person in severe pain has to wait 14 months for a 
new hip.  That is not a health care system which is providing 
good care for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do it.  We can provide the strong social programs and we 
can provide a strong economy.  We can do both.  We do not have to 
reinvent the wheel in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other solutions.  We can eliminate the personal income 
tax surcharges.  Why do we continue to pile more taxes on people? 
The government thinks it knows best how to spend Canadians' 
money.  Let the people decide what they want to do.  Let the 
government take what it needs to provide for social programs and 
give the rest to the public to ensure that they have enough money 
to provide for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We underestimate the ability of people to provide for 
themselves.  Let us give them that opportunity, while not 
forgetting that we have an enormous responsibility and a duty to 
provide for those people who cannot take care of themselves. 
That is the hallmark of having a kind, considerate, caring 
society from which we all derive an enormous amount of benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the government should decrease taxes, ensure that 
the money it spends is spent wisely on social programs that we 
need, and also ensure that it pays down the debt.  For heaven's 
sake, it should take a leaf out of the books of other countries 
which have used innovative measures, tax incentives and research 
and development to strengthen the education system and to link 
the education system to the future needs of industry.  If we do 
all of that, instead of nibbling around the edges with Bill C-28, 
we will have a strong economy, we will have strong social 
programs and we will have a stronger nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
far be it for me to refocus the Reform Party on its actual 
motion, but the motion that is before us is with respect to the 
impact of the proposed 10% tax on municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beauty of this motion is that it attempts to focus the 
activities of a municipality. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A municipality, by definition, occupies a particular 
geographical area.  By definition it is to provide services to 
its constituents where the constituents are in need of garbage 
services, education services or services of that nature.  Those 
are public services.  Those are services which are supplied at 
cost and for which people are not expecting the entity that 
supplies the service to be making a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that all municipalities are in this hunt for 
revenue.  All governments in all countries are in a hunt for 
revenue.  But this is a proposal which attempts to refocus and 
rebalance that concept.  Municipalities should not be hunting for 
revenue by supplying services where other entities in our society 
supply those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any motion prevailed with respect to the law of unintended 
consequences, this is it.  May I suggest that there are a number 
of very significant unintended consequences that will result from 
the hon. member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first unintended consequence is that municipality will be 
set up against municipality to supply services in order to be 
able to generate the most revenue.  In other words, it will not 
have to go to its tax base, it will go to other forms of revenue. 
We will have, for instance, the municipality of Hamilton 
competing with the municipality of Kingston to supply service 
<I>x</I> at the cheapest and lowest cost.  Therefore, whichever 
municipality gets to supply that service will not have to go to 
its tax base to generate revenue.  Some of that is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beauty of the proposal by the government is that it will cut 
the matter off at 10%.  After 10% of its gross revenues the 
municipality will not have the incentive to seek to augment its 
income in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, it will set up the unintended consequence of a 
private corporation competing with the municipality to supply a 
service.  That is quite bizarre because the Reform Party's 
motivation, raison d'être, is to enhance and encourage the 
private sector.  We will have this bizarre experience of a 
municipality competing with the private sector over the same 
service.  With the huge advantages of a municipality, the private 
sector will not be able to supply the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a municipality, again by definition, has an enormous 
infrastructure.  It has secretaries, it has telephones systems, 
it has buildings, et cetera.  It could in a number of instances 
undercut the private sector by a means which the hon. member 
might not have thought his way through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third and beautiful unintended consequence is that it 
provides a huge benefit to my municipality of Toronto.  Most 
Canadians, from my experience in travelling across the country, 
do not think that Toronto should receive very many benefits at 
all.  It is a national pastime to hate Toronto.  There are some 
members here who would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might point out to the hon. member that Toronto is the seventh 
largest entity in Canada.  It ranks ahead of a number of 
provinces.  If this motion goes through it will provide to 
Toronto an enormous advantage because there will be an enormous 
incentive on the part of Mr. Lastman and his staff to create 
services to augment revenue, to knock the private sector out of 
the game.  I do not know whether the hon. member wants to create 
a situation such as that, but that is a very real possibility and 
again follows through with the law of unintended consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to set up conflicts between 
municipalities, if he wants to set up conflicts between the 
private sector and municipalities, if he wants to benefit Toronto 
in particular but large municipalities in general, then we should 
probably stand aside and let this motion pass.  However, I 
believe that the government's direction is far wiser.  It is 
saying to municipalities generally that they can generate revenue 
and, yes, they will be allowed a certain amount of activity 
outside their municipal sphere.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, once they go beyond 10% of their revenues being 
generated outside their geographical area or municipal sphere, 
then they will be taxed like any other entity.  As with all 
governments, that achieves a balance which is a good balance and 
is healthy for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope it also addresses the issue of the balancing of revenues 
among all three levels of government.

</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill 
C-28 be amended by deleting clause 241. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the 
debate at report stage on Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things wrong with Bill C-28.  We could 
mention the government's measures feigning sensitivity with 
respect to social programs and the deterioration of health care 
that it has itself brought about through three years of cuts in 
transfer payments to the provinces in the health, social services 
and education sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened this morning as a journalist put a question to the 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons.  What the 
journalist asked him was this: “Has the Government heard the 
public's cry of distress about health care?”  The Leader of the 
Government in the House replied as follows:  “Of course it has. 
In Bill C-28 you will see that we have added $6 billion for health 
care and social services.  If opposition members vote against 
Bill C-28, it is because they have not heard what the public is 
saying”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not the ultimate in demagoguery, I do not know what 
is.  Because what Bill C-28 says about the $6 billion transfer is 
that, instead of cutting $48 billion between now and 2003, the 
federal government is going to cut $42 billion.  We will never 
give our support to a bill that would fly in the very face of 
what people want, which is an end to cuts in social programs and 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a serious problem with an apparent conflict of 
interest involving the bill's sponsor, the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 241 of Bill C-28 provides new tax benefits to 
international shipping corporations, particularly international 
shipping holdings. Clause 241 amends section 250 of the Income 
Tax Act to exclusively protect international shipping holdings 
against any Revenue Canada claims on taxes applying to profits or 
other revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a moral issue relating to this legislation, but there 
is also another problem: the bill, including clause 241, was 
introduced by the Minister of Finance, who owns a holding 
corporation called Canada Steamship Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance sponsored a bill that provides him with 
tax benefits, given his involvement in international shipping.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is at least an apparent conflict of interest in this 
legislation, and this is contrary to the Prime Minister's code 
of ethics adopted in June 1994, soon after he took office. 
Indeed, this code of ethics refers not only to actual or 
potential conflicts of interest, but also to apparent conflicts 
of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously an apparent conflict of interest, given that 
the Minister of Finance tabled and sponsored a bill with 
provisions that favour the finance minister's international 
shipping activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bloc Quebecois put the finger on the problem with 
Bill C-28, after reviewing the 464 pages of this omnibus 
legislation, which includes only two paragraphs on international 
shipping, the Minister of Finance left the House with a historic 
statement. He was speechless. He began to stutter like people who 
are caught in the act, like people who have something on their 
conscience and who just got caught with their hand in the cookie 
jar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reaction came from the Prime Minister during oral 
question period. We had barely finished putting our question 
when the Prime Minister jumped out of his seat to come to the 
defence of his finance minister, saying he had done nothing wrong 
and that this new provision would not in any way benefit Canada 
Steamship Lines, which the finance minister has owned in full 
since 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day, the Deputy Prime Minister joined the Prime Minister 
in saying that this measure did not apply to Canada Steamship 
Lines.  That same day, reference was made during Oral Question 
Period to the Department of Finance press release which also 
stated that Canada Steamship Lines would not benefit from these 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reaction, as time went on, was less decisive and less 
definite.  It came from corporate taxation division senior 
advisor Len Farber, the very person to whom we were referred by 
the Minister of Finance and who is supposedly his right-hand man 
in terms of policies and political strategies—likely more 
political than anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Farber appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance and 
was asked a series of questions which led him gradually into an 
area where he felt cornered.  He was forced to admit that “Yes, 
these provisions could be available to that company”, because 
reference was being made at that time to companies like Canada 
Steamship Lines, the company of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government found itself backed into a corner on the fact 
that clause 241 could apply to Canada Steamship Lines, as even 
its vice-president, Mr. Préfontaine, admitted, saying “Yes, 
perhaps, but we have no intention of applying it”, it turned to 
the process itself. By February 12, it was starting, through the 
Prime Minister, to make statements like: “Yes, but all of the 
rules were respected in tabling the bill.  The Minister of 
Finance did not see its contents, even if he was the one 
sponsoring it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 12, the Prime Minister pointed out that, according to 
what the ethics counsellor had told him, everything was done 
according to the rules and the Minister of Finance was not at 
fault.  He put his assets and shares into a blind trust and is 
therefore protected from any apparent or actual conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, five days after his 
statement in the House, his ethics counsellor appeared before 
the Standing Committee on Finance and was also obliged to 
admit—not only verbally, but also in his written report—that there 
was at least a possibility of a problem, because introduction of 
Bill C-28 had not followed normal procedure.  He stated that, 
normally, had he been approached by the Minister or the 
Department of Finance on the procedure for tabling, steering or 
sponsoring this bill, the Minister of Finance would not have 
acted in this way.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor recognized that there had been at the very 
least an apparent conflict of interest. But he later went back 
on his position and told the finance committee “Look, even if 
Canada Steamship Lines stood to potentially benefit from these 
news provisions and the Minister of Finance stood to save 
substantial amounts in taxes”—we are looking at millions of 
dollars in the future—“that is not the problem. The problem is 
that the process should have been more consistent with the rules 
established in 1994”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson, the ethics counsellor, has many problems. The first 
one is that he changes his tune every time he is questioned on 
the subject. 
He writes one thing and says another or vice versa. He has a 
credibility problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, his credibility problem is compounded by the fact that 
he is paid by the Prime Minister, when he should be an 
independent counsellor reporting to Parliament. In fact, in the 
red book in 1993 the Liberals stated, and I quote “A Liberal 
government will appoint an independent ethics counsellor to 
advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day to day 
application of the code of conduct for public officials”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not independent, he is accountable to the Prime Minister. 
This means the Prime Minister can get him to say just about 
anything, as he is the boss. That is why the government's ethic 
counsellor has lost all credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor should be dismissed and replaced with a 
real counsellor, who would be independent from the government, to 
shed light on cases like this one without having to wait for an 
opposition member to put his or her finger on a problem. As it 
is, the ethics counsellor has become the one who saves ministers' 
heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion basically calls for the deletion of section 241, 
which gives an unfair advantage to shipping companies like the 
one owned by the Minister of Finance, Canada Steamship Lines, 
until this matter and the finance minister's apparent conflict of 
interest have been clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, on February 12, the four opposition parties got 
together to write a letter to the government, asking that a 
special committee be struck to shed light on the whole matter. 
Last week, I personally made a similar request to the Prime 
Minister, but have not received any reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the same request again, but in the meantime section 241 
should be deleted because we are convinced that there is, at the 
very least, an apparent conflict of interest around the 
introduction of the bill containing section 241.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to congratulate my colleague from the Bloc for his motion. I 
think it is an important motion and I think colleagues around the 
House should support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of the finance minister and the finance department 
probably was not to somehow circumvent the rules.  Nevertheless, 
that is the position the government has put itself in.  I think 
fairness and integrity dictate that members support the motion to 
avoid the appearance at least of a conflict of interest.  Pretty 
clearly, that is what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from the Bloc has talked about that at length.  I want 
to talk about a variation on the theme.  I want to talk about the 
irony in having Canada's finance minister have to shelter many of 
his own personal assets offshore to avoid paying the staggering 
taxes that so many Canadians have to pay. I think that is rather 
ironic.  I think it would be very funny if not for the fact that 
every other Canadian really does not have the same opportunity to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the finance minister good for him, I am glad that he 
has found a way to avoid paying the same level of taxes that the 
rest of us pay.  Truly I would like to see the same rules, the 
same compassion extended to all other taxpayers in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be wonderful if somebody who runs the donut shop 
across Wellington Street could put up a Liberian flag so they did 
not have to pay the same high level of taxes they currently have 
to pay? Would it not be wonderful if in a garage in Rosetown, 
Saskatchewan they could put up a Panamanian flag so they did not 
have to pay the same staggering level of taxes they currently 
have to pay?  It could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members get the point.  The fact is in Canada today 
people are driven to extraordinary lengths to not pay the level 
of taxes we currently have to pay.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out in an earlier intervention, we have taxes that 
are among the highest in the world.  Income tax is 56% higher 
than the G-7 average.  I do not blame people for going to great 
lengths to avoid paying those taxes but it is killing this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an article in the weekend <I>Globe and Mail</I> about 
British Columbia's recession.  Not long ago that province was 
leading the country in growth and now it is tenth in the country 
in terms of growth.  One of the primary reasons for this is the 
combination of high taxes between the provincial and federal 
governments that has made British Columbia uncompetitive.  It 
cannot deal with the competition from the northwest United States 
and the Pacific rim.  Consequently that government and that 
province are in recession today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame people for going to extraordinary lengths to find 
ways to not pay these high taxes.  The sad result is that people 
are actually leaving the country.  That is one way people deal 
with the problem of high taxes.  Not long ago a Nesbitt Burns 
report was widely circulated in the media.  It talked about how 
young Canadians, in particular university graduates and 
professionals, are leaving the country in droves to go to the 
United States in particular and to other jurisdictions where 
taxes are not through the roof.  They want to find work where 
they will be allowed to keep enough income to live the types of 
lives they have dreamed about.  They obviously feel they can no 
longer do that in Canada.  That is sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nesbitt Burns report talked about the computer technicians 
this country is losing.  That is terrible.  We are losing 
doctors, nurses, teachers and engineers.  Some of our brightest 
and best are disappearing from this country.  It is not only an 
economic tragedy, it is a personal tragedy too.  We are seeing 
families split up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend, the hon. member for Red Deer, has three children. 
They have all left Canada to find work.  One is in Norway. 
Another is a Rhodes scholar and is teaching in the U.S. at 
Harvard.  He could not get a job in Canada so he left for greener 
pastures where the taxes are not so high.  I believe this member 
has another daughter in the Netherlands.  My friend, the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast, has family spread out around the 
world as a result of the high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can blame the finance minister?  He is only doing what 
everybody else is doing, trying to find ways to avoid the 
crushing burden of taxes in this country.  The challenge to my 
friends across the way and to the finance minister is to find 
ways for people to enjoy their assets in Canada, to find a way 
for us to live the lives we want to live in Canada without having 
to pay taxes through the roof.  That is a novel concept, is it 
not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of focusing on finding new and creative ways to spend 
$11 billion, which is what they chose to spend in the last 
budget, why do my friends across the way not find ways to lower 
the tax burden in this country to help Canadians out?  What is 
wrong with that?  Why do we have to drive people out of this 
country?  People are voting with their feet.  They are leaving. 
The brightest and the best are leaving.  We cannot tolerate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for my friends across the way to wake up and 
understand that clause 41 is a symptom of a much larger problem, 
that taxes in this country are too high.  They are far too high. 
We are now in a position where Canadians work half the year just 
to pay the federal government.  If I were to ask members in this 
House what they would call it if they had to go to work for six 
months of the year, had every cent taken and worked for no 
remuneration, they would call that slavery.  But that is exactly 
what we do in Canada today.  We spend half the year working for 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the government going to wake up and understand that this 
cannot continue?  When is it going to do more than the half 
measures we saw in this budget?  The government said that it 
introduced $7 billion in tax relief in the budget although it 
forgot to point out that it previously introduced new tax 
measures that would take $9 billion out of the economy.  That 
would leave Canadians a couple of billion dollars worse off than 
they were last year. 
The government calls that tax relief.  I call it robbery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous that the government can get away with that type 
of thing.  I hope that friends across the way will come to 
realize that bills like Bill C-28 are simply a symptom of the 
sickness of the government's perverse idea that it has to justify 
its existence by taxing people ever ever more. I ask them to 
reflect on the irony of a finance minister who has put his assets 
offshore so he does not have to pay the staggering level of 
taxation that we have in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely there is a lesson for the House in this example.  I would 
expect that friends in this House would come to appreciate that 
this is ridiculous.  It is time to bring this to an end. I urge 
my friends to support the Bloc motion to oppose the inclusion of 
clause 241. We can no longer have taxation levels that are among 
the highest in the world, ones that not even the finance minister 
can afford.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
not take as much time as my hon. colleague from the Reform Party. 
I would like to return to the matter raised by the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the motion he has moved is important. It is significant 
that all opposition parties have joined together in recent months 
to raise the problematical issue, or potentially problematical 
issue, relating to the Minister of Finance and have demanded 
clarifications.  I believe this is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has very great responsibilities.  The 
entire credibility of the Canadian tax system is at stake. He 
must provide answers to all questions raised by the opposition 
parties. 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has done an excellent job 
on this, and we in this corner of the House wish to congratulate 
him on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, therefore, going to support this motion, and hope our 
friends opposite will do likewise.  Why?  In order to avoid any 
problematical issues around reputations and credibility.  If the 
Liberals understand their Minister of Finance, and are so fond 
of him, so much the better.  If they are so fond of him,  let 
them go along with the parties in opposition in voting in favour 
of this motion, in order to settle the question of potential 
conflict of interest for once and for all, at least in connection 
with Bill C-28 and the way in which it was introduced, as far as 
Canada Steamship Lines and foreign holdings are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals understand their Minister of Finance, and are so 
fond of him, they will support this motion and we will be able to 
defer any discussions on this issue to a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the Liberals, today or whenever we vote, to decide 
whether they support their Minister of Finance or whether they 
are prepared to delay part of Bill C-28 to ensure that their 
Minister of Finance will never be in a conflict of interest—real 
or potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the opposition to raise this issue, 
but it is the responsibility of the House as a whole to support 
the motion of the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that Bill C-28 is a great fat volume that 
Canadians will find muddling.  It requires research, and the 
role of the opposition parties is to ensure that everything is 
proper and to raise any problems before the House so Canadians 
will understand what is really happening with their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope those opposite will join with the members of the 
opposition in unanimously supporting the motion of the member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.  I am sure that, basically, all members 
in this House want the Minister of Finance to be exonerated of 
all blame.  That is what we want as well, because the country's 
fiscal credibility is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So they should hold up this part of Bill C-28, and all the members 
should join together so the Minister of Finance, the government 
and all Liberals can rest easy with this matter.  We will 
eventually get back to the issue of international shipping 
companies in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is interesting to speak to this amendment by the Bloc Quebecois. 
It highlights an area of income tax policy that is a bit of a 
lark.  We have had some fun with it in question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite was feigning a little bit of outrage 
here a minute ago saying that these are all false accusations 
about the finance minister.  He does not think we should be 
talking about that and I can see why he does not want us to. 
However the member for Medicine Hat hit the nail on the head. I 
have asked this question of the minister during question period. 
It goes something like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has registered some of his vessels offshore.  They 
sail under the Bahamian or Panamanian flags.  Why does the 
minister not offer tax relief for all Canadians, including 
himself, so that we could all keep our business in Canada instead 
of offshore?  The Liberals get up, beat around the bush, say how 
indignant they are, say that it is a terrible thing to say and it 
hurts their feelings. I am sure they will soon sue us for that 
because they like to sue as soon as they get into a bit of heat. 
In essence it is a fair question.  The question is exactly that. 
There is nothing wrong with the minister doing what he is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a member here who cannot understand what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I have many years in provincial 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  I know she is going to sue me in a 
minute but if she would just let me continue to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the member sues, just let me repeat again, there is 
nothing wrong or illegal with what the minister does.  He is a 
business person.  He looks at it and says  “Let me see.  If I 
register my vessel here in Canada I have to pay through the nose 
in taxes, registration fees, hidden taxes” and taxes below the 
water line no doubt.  There are all kinds of taxes in Canada 
because the vessel is registered here. When he registers a vessel 
offshore, there is nothing wrong with that. I hope the member 
does not have an apoplexy on us here, Madam Speaker, but there is 
nothing wrong and I will say it again for her benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of message does that send to Canadians who are also 
looking for tax relief and do not have the advantage of an 
international company where they can parade some of their assets 
out of the country.  What kind of a message does it send?  It 
sends them the message that the finance minister knows the truth, 
that taxes in Canada are way too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxes here are a disincentive for investment.  The taxes 
here do not create wealth.  They suck the wealth out of the 
economy. The taxes here in Canada mean that the average family in 
British Columbia spends $28,000 or more just paying taxes to 
governments.  How are they supposed to plan for their kids' 
education, put a little money aside for retirement and maybe if 
they are lucky have a holiday every decade or two? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are they supposed to get investments going on their own to 
start a small business, an in home business, or to invest in 
mutual funds and take advantage of any of those things? They 
cannot because they are so busy paying taxes to all levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this government the Hoover sound can be heard across the 
land from the minister opposite.  There have been 37 tax 
increases since the Liberals took power.  There were many more in 
the 35th Parliament that we did not even get into. Every single 
time the inflation rate goes up even a couple of per cent, does 
the government change the personal exemption amounts, the bracket 
creep?  It just cuts right in and sucks a little more out.  You 
can hear the slurping noise as the economy gets sucked dry and 
the initiative gets sucked dry and the entrepreneurs head south 
or east to anywhere where tax relief is possible.  Is it any 
wonder that the finance minister does what he does.  He does what 
he has to to get ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I face this time and again in my own riding.  My riding includes 
the Sumas border crossing which is one of the busier crossings in 
Canada.  Between the United States and Canada there are billions 
of dollars of trade per day, not all through Sumas, but in total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People bring a tale of woe to my office that goes something like 
this.  They say “Listen.  I was down in the United States and 
they gave me the following deal.  All the other prices are much 
the same but you know their other taxes are much lower. 
I do not have to pay the sales tax.  I do not have to pay all the 
hidden taxes along the way.  It is cheaper to buy the same 
product down in Washington state even with the exchange rate as 
it is, than it is to buy it at my local store because the taxes 
in Canada are too high”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What am I supposed to say to a young couple who is trying to get 
ahead, to feed their kids and do all that stuff?  Do I say 
“Listen here young man, I expect you to pay through the nose. 
Forget looking after your family.  Forget planning for your 
future. Forget about your children's education.  Pay through the 
nose and pay it here in Canada because that is what makes Canada 
great”. Because I fear for my own safety, I do not say that.  I 
say “Yes, is it not too bad that in Canada our taxes chase your 
money out of town and out of the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell them to please shop Canadian if they can and all that 
good stuff. However that couple is struggling and when they come 
in with their hands held out, what do I say to them?  I tell them 
that they are responsible for their family and they should do 
what they have to do.  That is what the finance minister does 
when he looks after his business, which is in a blind trust, but 
it registers vessels offshore.  This is not illegal and nothing 
is technically wrong with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it happening?  It is happening because taxes in Canada 
are too high.  Registration fees are too high. Regulations are 
too onerous and too difficult.  That is why those things happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government across the way would be well advised to take a 
look around the world and see how we compare tax wise with the 
other developed countries.  Our income tax rates are 50% higher 
than the G-7 average.  Does that not strike a little bit of fear 
into the Liberals' little cold economic hearts?  Does it not make 
them think that perhaps they could kill the goose that laid the 
golden egg if they just taxed it long enough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the Liberals not understand the old parable of the little red 
hen?  We keep beating that little red hen on the head with a tax 
booklet.  The chain drags out for dozens of metres behind the 
poor person who is trying to get ahead, sucking their energy and 
distracting them.  They finally ask themselves what the point is 
of even trying because they have all this weight dragging them 
down in the income tax system, the regulatory system and the 
bureaucracy that this government seems to promote.  They finally 
realize they cannot cut the chains because the government keeps 
adding more books on the end of this ever loving thing.  It 
becomes the chain from hell.  It just goes on and on off into the 
distance taking the energy out of the system.  They finally wish 
they too could go to the Bahamas, register there and get ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this amendment in not so nice a way tweaks the nose 
of the government to point out why this is a problem for 
Canadians.  High taxes kill incentive, kill jobs and kill the 
future for not only people raising families now but for future 
generations to come.  That is why this government would be well 
advised to listen up during today's debate, quit adding more 
taxes to the system and allow Canadians the opportunity to get 
ahead the way they should, which is without government help but 
without government hindrance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government would listen up and support this amendment 
during the vote that we will have later this evening.

Speaker, if equality is the ultimate goal that a civil society 
aspires to, then racism is its implacable foe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have struggled and fought hard against the vile enemy 
of social cohesion and although we have been enormously 
successful in integrating almost 200 different nationalities, we 
are far from perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ghettoization in large centres, the enormous difficulties 
aboriginal people face in integrating into Canadian society, the 
politically correct reverse discrimination that occurs still 
demonstrate that much needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue to enforce laws that penalize the purveyors of 
racism, ensure that racism labels are never falsely used, 
strengthen the level playing field where opportunities exist and 
the responsibility to take advantage of those opportunities rests 
with the individual, and that people are judged on their merit 
and not on the colour of their skin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this international day of elimination of racial 
discrimination I would like to thank Canada for the opportunity 
that Canada has given to me to be judged not on the colour of my 
skin but on my abilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal convention of the past weekend passed a resolution 
calling on the Liberal government to “develop a process to 
continuously measure the quality of health care in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later today the House will be debating an NDP motion to amend 
the CHST to set up exactly such a process to require the 
government to table a regular assessment of whether the cash 
floor for the CHST transfer is capable of sustaining quality 
health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Minister consider supporting this amendment?  It seems 
to me that it goes a long way toward implementing the very 
resolution that was passed this weekend at his party convention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the weekend it became clear that the delegates to the 
Liberal convention support the government's choice of health as 
one of its key priorities in the coming year.  Indeed it confirms 
we are on the right track with the change to the level of 
transfers over the coming years making more money available and 
picking areas of priority for action such as home and community 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also say that the federal government must do its share but 
the provinces must also choose their priorities wisely.  We would 
hope the provinces would make health their priority so that 
together we could—

Winnipeg—Transcona. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I asked the minister a very direct question.  There is 
an opportunity available today for the minister, by supporting 
our amendment, to implement the process whereby he could 
regularly table an assessment of how well medicare is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would he not rise today and say that he would support this 
amendment?  Clearly Liberals at the convention shared NDP 
concerns about what is happening to our health care system.  This 
is an opportunity for the minister to show some leadership and 
some consensus building on how to deal with this issue.  Will he 
accept the amendment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
quite simply the amendment in our view is unnecessary because the 
government continuously reassesses the sufficiency of all its 
actions in relation to health care.  We went through that very 
process in changing the amount of the CHST cash transfer during 
the past few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the House both in terms of the transfers and in terms 
of other steps we are taking in relation to health that we will 
constantly be involved in reassessing the sufficiency of the 
support for what we believe is an essential service for all 
Canadians.

described as the second national forum on health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Health whether he will listen to members of 
his own party—Liberals—after not listening to Canadians, or the 
provinces or the people working in the health field, and 
immediately reinstate the system of cash transfers to the 
provinces, which are in desperate need of them?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to know from the minister whether he listened to people in 
this second national forum on health, which took place this 
weekend.  Before setting other priorities, his first priority 
should be to provide services and transfers to the provinces, 
since the provinces look after health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he considers health a priority, just imagine what sort of 
priority the government is giving to employment.  Health is sick 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister make a commitment in this House to listen to 
members of his own party and give the provinces more money in 
transfers than they are currently getting? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
remind the hon. member that the first thing we did after 
resolving the financial situation was to increase the amount of 
transfers to $12.5 billion a year, the exact amount recommended 
by the National Forum on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They looked at the situation for over two years and recommended 
we transfer $12.5 billion, which we did.  This testifies to the 
government's commitment to Canada's health system.

the debate on the Liberal convention has been able to bring some 
life to the shadows and the darkness that exists on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the minister obviously has no plan for the 
people of British Columbia.  If there is any province in the

federal and provincial taxes are making it impossible for B.C. to 
compete with the United States and the Pacific rim.

there was support for tax reductions and, as the Prime Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there was also support, as we have just seen, for 
health care, for resolving the problems of children in poverty

formal way of asking a blue ribbon independent panel to look at 
the state of the health care system, to examine the dynamic of

for the purpose.  In fact the forum recommended that the cash 
floor be moved to $12.5 billion which of course we have done.

Ursel to two years less a day to be served in the community under 
section 742 of the Criminal Code.  Mr. Ursel was convicted of a

</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Canadian forces: (<I>a</I>) what preparations has 
the government undertaken to ensure their integrity during and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
(a) The government has made no preparation for what remains a 
highly hypothetical scenario.  That being said, Canadian forces 
members swear an oath of allegiance and are subject to the code 
of service discipline contained in the National Defence Act.  In 
addition, the mission of the Department of National Defence, DND, 
and the Canadian forces, CF, to defend Canada and Canadian 
interests and values while contributing to international peace 
and security is clearly outlined in numerous documents including 
the 1994 defence white paper.  Canadian forces members understand 
their role and are proud of their contribution and 
accomplishments in promoting Canadian interests. At a time when 
the continued existence of the nation is being debated and 
national symbols take on more importance than ever, the unifying 
role of the department and the forces can only build a stronger, 
more dynamic and prosperous country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The Canadian forces must always act and be seen to be acting 
in an apolitical manner.  There is no intent to limit healthy 
discussion of a private nature, however, public announcements and 
discussions that could lead to the assumption that any such 
statements are CF or DND policy must be avoided, and CF members 
are made fully aware of this through various regulations and 
orders which govern political activities on defence 
establishments and personal political activities of CF members.

<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to begin by saying what a great pleasure it is for 
me to speak to Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am the Bloc Quebecois transport critic, some of my 
colleagues might be wondering what lies behind my interest in 
this bill introduced by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, there are aspects of this bill that I, as 
transport critic, find very important, one of them being a 
clause to which my colleague, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, 
has drawn wide attention during oral question period, in the 
media scrums and in earlier debates.  I am talking about clause 
241. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is the sponsor of this bill, clause 241 
of which improves the tax treatment of offshore shipping 
companies held by Canadian companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several weeks now, the government has denied that this 
measure will benefit the Minister of Finance's companies, but 
senior finance department officials and the government's ethics 
counsellor have admitted that Canada Steamship Lines could 
indeed benefit from this measure.  Important questions remain 
unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is unanimous, and this is not some Bloc Quebecois 
fabrication. 
The four opposition parties on this side of the House have 
indicated clearly to the chair of the Standing Committee on 
Finance, in a letter from the four finance critics dated 
February 12, that they would like to see a special subcommittee 
of the Standing Committee on Finance struck as quickly as 
possible for the purpose of clarifying the situation with respect 
to the interpretation of clause 241 in Bill C-28.  That was clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our contention, and we are supported in this by the other 
opposition parties, that the Minister of Finance is trying, 
through Bill C-28, to get the House to pass a bill that could 
very well give his shipping company, Canada Steamship Lines Inc., 
of which he is the sole owner, certain tax advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the Minister of Finance defends himself by saying that 
his company has been in a blind trust since he became the 
minister, he will not remain the minister for the rest of his 
life and could eventually benefit from these tax changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and representatives of his company 
contend that Canada Steamship Lines does not intend to use this 
provision to benefit from the measures in clause 241.  While it 
is not their intention, that does not mean that they are not 
entitled to, and that is the subtlety we must watch out for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the holdings and the assets of the Minister 
of Finance.  We will look at the ships.  I had information on 
certain ships obtained from the Lloyd's Register of Ships.  Let 
us see if we can untangle things a bit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A look at the Minister of Finance's assets reveals that CSL owns 
a number of companies registered in Barbados: CSL Cabo Shipping 
Line Barbados, wholly owned; Innovaforce Shipping Inc., 
registered in Liberia; CSL Asia Investments Inc., also 
registered in Liberia.  He is up to his elbows in tax havens. 
Over his head in tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I decided to track the registration of the ships belonging to 
Canada Steamship Lines.  My research revealed that <I>Atlantic Erie</I> 
was called, in 1988—and I know I am not allowed to name the 
Minister of Finance, but perhaps it was his father—the 
<I>Honourable Paul Martin.</I>  It was probably his father, who was a 
minister. 
This ship is registered in the Bahamas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also learned from Lloyd's Register of Ships that the <I>Atlantic 
Superior</I>—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Why don't you just get in the gutter? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> So that got a reaction on the other side, did 
it?  When a sensitive spot is touched, it is a bit like a visit 
to the chiropractor, when he hits a sensitive nerve.  It makes 
one holler, like the Liberals are doing now.  Let them.  If what 
I was saying was totally meaningless, the Liberals would not feel 
obliged to defend themselves.  Moving on, let us look at another 
ship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Atlantic Superior</I> is owned by Atlantic Superior Shipping Co. 
Inc., which is also registered in the Bahamas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two others are also registered in the Bahamas: <I>CSL Atlas</I>, owned 
by Canada Steamship Lines, and <I>CSL Innovator</I>, also owned by 
Canada Steamship Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see time is passing, and I will have to conclude in a few 
moments. 
My purpose with these comments is not to carry out a witch hunt 
and formally accuse the Minister of Finance of conflict of 
interest. What we want to demonstrate is that there is an 
apparent conflict of interest.  The meetings between my hon. 
colleague for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot and Finance Canada officials, 
and his contacts with the government's ethics counsellor, 
indicate that there is an apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Apparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Apparent, yes.  I hear the hon. member for 
Ahuntsic yelling “apparent” at me, but I would remind her that a 
minister of the crown has a duty to avoid any suspicion of an 
apparent conflict of interest.  Any suspicion, precisely so as 
to not end up with a conflict.  One must protect oneself from 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still many questions without answers.  Why was the 
Minister of Finance the one to sponsor this bill?  Why did he 
not have the Minister of State for Financial Institutions, the 
hon. member for Willowdale, do it?  Why did he do it himself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider this an imprudent act, one exposing the Minister of 
Finance to criticism. These 4 CSL vessels registered in the 
Bahamas clearly indicate that someone can, if enterprising, take 
advantage of tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know that the company in question belongs 100% to the 
Minister of Finance, it is no wonder ordinary citizens, the 
people watching us today on television, have lost confidence. It 
is because such loopholes exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does nothing for the credibility of this institution.  Most 
members here try to do a good job. 
We try to thoroughly research the issues and when something like 
this is thrown in our faces, how do you think we feel?

</I></B></P><P align=left>One might also wonder why Canada Steamship Lines does not 
register its ships to Canada, as would normally be done.  The 
Desgagnés group bought the <I>Rio Orinoco</I>, which was wrecked off 
île d'Anticosti, and renamed it the <I>Thalassa Desgagnés</I>.  The 
<I>Thalassa Desgagnés </I>carries oil between Miami and certain islands 
in the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico.  It is registered to 
Canada and has a Canadian crew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are shipping companies that show they are capable 
of assuming their responsibilities by hiring people from this 
country and paying their taxes here.  We see that the Minister of 
Finance says one thing and does another. 
Everyone claims to be lily-white, but when we see this sort of 
sleight of hand, it worries us.  That was what I wished to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to speak to Motion No. 2 at report stage of Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion addresses the perceived conflict of interest the hon. 
Minister of Finance finds himself in with respect to certain 
provisions of the bill, principally article 241 which would 
change the tax treatment of shipping companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known to members of this place and the public that 
the Minister of Finance holds through a blind trust principal 
ownership of Canada Steamship Lines, a major international 
shipping company.  Members of the opposition have raised the 
question as to whether or not he may be in a conflict of interest 
by having acted as the sponsor of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that I believe the hon. Minister of 
Finance is a honest and diligent member of this place and is 
deserving of respect.  Even though I often disagree with him, I 
personally do not believe that the Minister of Finance acted as 
the sponsor of this bill in order to derive any kind of personal 
financial benefit.  I rather suspect, given the nature of his 
responsibilities, that he likely never read the bill.  I suspect 
very few members of the House have actually read a technical tax 
bill such as this one.  What we read are summaries provided to us 
by either the department or by our research staffs.  Oftentimes 
those summaries do not stipulate a particular provision such as 
article 241.  It is entirely plausible that the Minister of 
Finance was not aware that article 241 posed a potential conflict 
of interest for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon ministers, when they bring 
bills forward to parliament, that they be well and thoroughly 
advised about the contents of such legislation.  They should know 
whether or not they may find themselves in a potential conflict 
position vis-à-vis their own personal business interests and 
whether or not those interests are managed through a blind trust. 
In this case it would appear to me that the Minister of Finance 
was let down by his advisers, by his bureaucrats who recommended 
that he act as the principal sponsor of the bill but who did not 
flag, did not highlight, did not emphasize the potential conflict 
between his private business interests and article 241 which 
deals with the tax treatment of shipping companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than simply dismissing the criticism which opposition 
members have levelled at the finance minister out of hand as he 
has done, rather than suggesting that this is some kind of 
mean-spirited smear campaign, I suggest the government members, 
and the Minister of Finance in particular, should take to heart 
in a constructive way the criticism that has been levelled with 
respect to this perceived conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should go to his officials, if he has not already 
done so, and say “You have put me in a very embarrassing 
position by giving me bad advice.  I should not have acted as the 
principal sponsor of this bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another minister, say the Secretary of State for International 
Financial Institutions could easily have brought the bill 
forward. 
The Minister of National Revenue could have brought this bill 
forward.  The Minister of Finance should have gone to his 
officials and said, “You gave me bad advice.  There was clearly 
at least a perceived conflict here between myself and this 
legislation.  My name ought not therefore to have been that of 
the sponsor of the bill”, and somebody should be held to 
account.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really the issue I want to address.  It is one of 
ministerial accountability.  It is a principle which is 
absolutely central to the traditions of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have inherited from our mother Parliament in Great Britain a 
remarkable institution.  It is an institution where the executive 
branch of the government represents the authority of the crown 
and has the enormous power of the state vested in it.  Police 
powers, taxing powers and military powers are vested in the 
executive branch.  In this case they are manifested in the 
cabinet, the governor in council.  Members of the cabinet have a 
fiduciary responsibility to this legislative body to ensure that 
they are never even in a perceived conflict between their 
ministerial responsibilities, their responsibilities on behalf of 
the crown, and their business affairs as private citizens.  They 
also have a profound responsibility to this legislature and to 
the people that we as MPs represent to take responsibility for 
what happens in their departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am greatly disturbed by the increasing pattern of ministerial 
unaccountability, where we find instances like this which come to 
the surface where ministers refuse to take responsibility for 
what admittedly may be bad advice given to them by their 
bureaucrats, but advice which they accept and for which they 
ought to be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the ministers are not held accountable, who is?  The 
ministers represent their bureaucracies, their departments, which 
are creatures of this legislature.  If they slough off 
responsibility and they say, “It was just an error.  It was just 
a mistake.  It was a small oversight.  I cannot be answerable for 
it.  My bureaucrats cannot be answerable for it”, then what is 
the point of having this Parliament?  Why not just have an 
executive branch of government that is answerable to no one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the ultimate logical conclusion of this kind of 
incremental diminishment of the principle of ministerial 
responsibility and accountability which ought to have been much 
more clearly respected by the Minister of Finance in responding 
to the criticism levelled at him with respect to Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just Bill C-28 where we see a recent example of 
conflict of interest.  In this House in recent days the official 
opposition has raised the very troubling example of the recent 
appointment to the Senate of a certain Ross Fitzpatrick by the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister.  I do not know Mr. Fitzpatrick.  I 
have no reason to believe that he is anything but an honourable, 
diligent and loyal Canadian citizen.  I have no reason to believe 
he will not be a hard working and responsible senator, fulfilling 
his constitutional responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is a fact that Mr. Fitzpatrick was chairman of the 
board of a corporation on which the current Prime Minister sat as 
a director.  It is furthermore a fact that the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister, when he was a private citizen in 1987, exercised a 
stock option which was given to him by Senator Fitzpatrick which 
generated a personal profit of $45,000 in the space of one week. 
It is furthermore a fact that when initially questioned about 
this stock deal, initially questioned about his corporate 
position on the Viceroy Resources Board, the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister claimed that he had received no compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the rules of this place and would never suggest that the 
Prime Minister has misled the House.  But the facts show a very 
clear incongruity between the reality and what the Prime Minister 
said.  It is another shocking example of where we see a 
perceived, if not real, conflict of interest which government 
members just expect us to walk away from.

the chairman of a board on which he served and from which he 
received a substantial financial benefit that Liberal members of 
Parliament in opposition would have raised a bloody furore that 
never would have stopped until somebody's head was on a platter. 
I say good on them because the role of an opposition party is to 
hold the government to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the Liberal Party in 1987.  Every single person in the 
Liberal Party, every political observer in the country, knew that 
the Prime Minister, who was then a private citizen, was likely to 
run again for political office.  He received a personal financial 
benefit.  It is clearly, in my view, a conflict of interest for 
him to have appointed to the Senate somebody from whom he 
received a personal financial benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These examples carry on.  Just today we raised another case of a 
former employer of the Prime Minister who received a remunerative 
government patronage position.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, just hours before the vote on this legislation, the 
public is still not reassured about clause 241, which would put 
the Minister of Finance in an apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the questions asked by the Bloc Quebecois and the 
other opposition parties, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime 
Minister have avoided any debate by refusing to provide answers 
to the opposition, which wanted and still wants to have the 
situation clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, all the efforts made to have the Standing Committee on 
Finance hear witnesses on this issue have been vain, except for 
the Prime Minister's ethics counsellor, who appeared before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, our fellow members from the 
Reform Party and the Liberal Party should show some respect 
toward my Bloc Quebecois colleague, who is making an eloquent 
speech. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has made a very good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming debate, the hon. member for Drummond. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize this speech is 
hurting the Liberals, but I would ask for a modicum of respect 
during this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister basically gave a gag order to his caucus and 
it was complied with. Since February 5, when the Bloc Quebecois 
showed what— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If hon. members want 
to carry on a conversation, please do so in the lobby.  The hon. 
member for Drummond has the floor.  If you are going to keep this 
up, go outside. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate getting 
back the time I was deprived of because some members do not 
respect my right to speak in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still debating Bill C-28 and, as I was saying, the Prime 
Minister gave his caucus an order to silence the opposition, and 
that order was complied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since February 5, when the Bloc Quebecois showed what is really 
behind Bill C-28, the opposition has been facing systematic 
obstruction co-ordinated by the Prime Minister's office. If the 
Liberal government has nothing to hide, why is it stubbornly 
refusing to respond to the opposition on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor himself said that Bill C-28 had not been 
drafted according to the rules and that, if they had to do it 
again, some measures would have to be taken to avoid this 
conflict of interest situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He recognized, as we do, that there were serious problems with 
the way the finance minister was doing things and that the code 
of ethics the government had adopted in 1994 was not observed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of this statement and in an attempt to get to the 
bottom of the matter, the four opposition parties took the 
unprecedented step of joining together both in the House and in a 
press conference to demand that light be shed on this nebulous 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the Prime Minister did not accede to the 
opposition's request, thereby confirming what we suspected all 
along: it is in the interest of some individuals that the truth 
never be known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To resolve this impasse caused entirely by the government, the 
Bloc Quebecois is proposing a sensible alternative, which would 
be in keeping with expressed wish of the various opposition 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, who is in an apparent conflict of 
interest situation, should delete from Bill C-28 clauses 241 and 
242, which have led to so many questions that have remained 
unanswered for more than a month now. The minister could include 
these two clauses in a different schedule of the bill or in a 
different bill altogether, as suggested by the Prime Minister's 
ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot proposed 
an amendment that I fully support, as it responds to the many 
representations made by the opposition, including a request for 
a special subcommittee to provide answers to some of the 
questions the government has refused to answer so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor, who works for the Prime Minister, 
contends that it is not important to know whether or not CSL, the 
company owned by the Minister of Finance, would benefit from the 
provisions contained in Bill C-28. In that case, why did Mr. 
Wilson contact CSL the very day this matter was brought up to 
inquire as to whether the company was taking advantage of these 
provisions or contemplating to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Mr. Wilson has admitted that he was not an expert 
in tax planning. However, he seems to accept at face value, 
without outside opinions, the statement from CSL to the effect 
that the company had no intention of using the provisions 
contained in Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several weeks, the government has been denying that the 
Minister of Finance is at the very least in an apparent conflict 
of interest situation, arguing that the minister is not the one 
who introduced the provisions on shipping. 
Yet, the ethics counsellor contradicted the government by 
admitting that the Minister of Finance had sponsored Bill C-28 and 
that that creates an appearance of conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson says, in this regard, that procedural problems in the 
Department of Finance put the Minister of Finance in an awkward 
situation and that things would have been done differently had 
he been advised, as he should have, before C-28 was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the ethics counsellor admits that the Minister of Finance 
is in a position of appearing to be in a conflict of interest, 
how should the federal government's June 1994 code of ethics 
apply in this case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson also suggests that the Minister of Finance was not 
aware of the content of Bill C-28 before the Bloc raised these 
issues in the House a number of weeks ago. 
Could the minister responsible for the Income Tax Act so easily 
have shirked his responsibilities in connection with a bill he 
was sponsoring and how does the public view a Minister of Finance 
who did not know what was in his own legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is ministerial accountability not a fundamental principle of our 
parliamentary system?  The least I can say is that the 
government's stubborn refusal to open up the entire matter does 
little to lighten the suspicions hanging over the minister, on 
the contrary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn my attention to another point in Bill C-28, 
which concerns transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill confirms is the unfortunate plan for making cuts, 
which the Minister of Finance dreamt up to reduce his deficit on 
the backs of others.  What they are saying is that $48 billion in 
savage cuts to transfers for education, health and social 
assistance will be reduced to $42 billion.  What a relief.  This 
is no increase in transfers to the provinces.  It is less of a 
cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, changing the cash floor for transfer payments to 
$12.5 billion is nothing more than a vulgar election promise, 
legitimized by the National Forum on Health, in order to fool 
the people into thinking they are giving more, when in fact the 
provinces and Quebec have to work with $42 billion less, while 
the federal government rubs its hands together at the prospect of 
encroaching on provincial jurisdictions with the money it saved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is going to pay the social cost of the budget approach of 
this Liberal government?  The sick, the unemployed and the most 
disadvantaged of our society.  They are the real artisans of the 
first balanced budget.  The Liberals have nothing at all to be 
proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one sees this Liberal government unable to admit it made a 
poor choice in its last budget, when one sees the federal 
Liberals encouraging the government to poke its nose into 
education, is it any surprise that the Prime Minister is trying 
to conceal the truth in the case of the Minister of Finance and 
the apparent conflict of interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of a provincial election, even the Quebec Liberals are 
asking their federal big brothers to be discreet and to respect 
the traditional demands of Quebec, but it is a bit too late for 
the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such eloquent examples as Bill C-28, which once again dumps 
the deficit onto the provincial governments, while offering the 
Minister of Finance some attractive tax opportunities, Quebeckers 
understand better and better whom the federal government is 
working for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They understand that government decisions will never bear any 
resemblance to their wishes until those decisions are all made 
where their interests are really taken into account: in the 
Quebec National Assembly. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like our 
last speaker said, I am sure the finance minister may not have 
had any ill intentions in bringing forward this bill. Certainly 
Motion No. 2 which we are talking to would suit to chastise the 
minister for this.  Probably he could blame a civil servant for 
not advising him correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forward another concept which might be one of arrogance. 
Across the way we see a lot of arrogance.  We see arrogance which 
leads to not considering what the real facts are, in fact not 
really caring much about the kind of perception that is created 
by the bills put forward in the House. When that level of 
arrogance reaches all the politicians right from the front bench 
to the back, we know what usually happens. Possibly that golden 
age we heard talked about this weekend might well be at its peak 
at this point when we witness that sort of arrogance across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics is so much perception; what people think is happening 
is almost as important as what really is.  I put forward that the 
perception that is being painted by the government at this point 
with its patronage appointments, with its special committees, 
with taking care of all of its members so well certainly starts 
to resonate among the people. I will relate a few incidents which 
will bring this point out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the APEC meeting in Vancouver last fall.  It was very 
interesting.  I was sitting at a table talking to foreign 
delegates from the various APEC countries. 
At the table were two defeated Liberal candidates. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT59"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT59"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to give an idea of the patronage and the kind of thing that 
goes on, these two gentlemen made it very clear that they had 
received two nights accommodation at the Waterfront hotel in 
downtown Vancouver.  Those who know that hotel know the cost. 
They had received transfers in a limousine to the hotel. They and 
their spouses had been invited to these various high class 
banquets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These men were defeated Liberal candidates. One of them had run 
in Esquimalt.  He said to the gentleman next to him “So you are 
from Papua.  What is a Papua?”  This candidate said “Why are 
you here?”  “I am from New Guinea and we are actually a member 
of APEC”.  You can see the perception.  All of us at the table 
said he had just insulted a representative of another government. 
The guy from northern B.C. was even better.  He said to the guy 
beside me “So you are from Australia.  You are not an Asian. You 
cannot be here. This is just for Asians.  Sir, what are you here 
for?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perception.  Patronage.  That is what this is all about.  That 
is what this motion is all about.  Remember that perception is 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on to the Senate appointments we have just seen and 
the sort of arrogance there.  Certainly when we go through that 
whole thing regarding Mr. Fitzpatrick the perception is not what 
actually happened.  That happens in business.  I understand that. 
I come from a business background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the perception.  You do not name the guy to the Senate. 
You do not appear to be rewarding that person for something. 
Maybe it is more honest in Alberta where Nick Taylor says “I 
worked for the Liberal Party for 40 years and so I deserved it. 
Yes it is patronage.  Yes I took the patronage.  Yes it is part 
of this whole thing and I do not mind finally getting my 
freebies, my return for that sort of patronage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perception.  It is why people have so little respect for 
the today's politicians.  We could go on.  In the area I 
represent we talk about Mr. Fowler, a good friend of mine who is 
our representative at the United Nations.  This guy got himself 
in lots of trouble. We even had to shut down the Somalia inquiry 
because it was getting too close to him.  He was rewarded with 
patronage. Perception is what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the minister I shadow is the godfather of 
Winnipeg.  Nothing happens in Winnipeg without the godfather 
knowing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patronage. Perception.  That is what it is all about.  That is 
what hurts this place.  That is what hurts this country.  That is 
what hurts what we do here.  It is perception. What the finance 
minister is doing might be just fine, but the perception is that 
something is not working properly there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am in my constituency I talk about planet Ottawa.  I talk 
about the place that is not related to anything to which the 
normal person might relate. There is little accountability. There 
is little transparency.  There is little worry about perception 
and there is a great deal of arrogance.  Seldom do the Liberals 
listen to the people.  Seldom do they ask the people what they 
think because of the confidence and arrogance that is built here 
does not tend toward that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-28 and taxation, what are people saying 
about taxation?  What are they saying in the streets? They are 
saying the government should take care of that debt, lower the 
taxes and stop spending.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at it from a business perspective. As I said I come from 
business.  As soon as the business grew too big, there was no 
more incentive.  The government took more and more and more and 
finally one would say “Why should I keep working for the 
government?  Why should I keep risking my capital for the sake of 
paying more in taxation?” This government is destroying people's 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about young people?  Twenty thousand young people leave 
this country every year, PhDs and masters graduates.  Why do they 
leave?  They leave because we have the highest tax levels in the 
G-7.  They leave because they see no light at the end of the 
tunnel.  They see a doomed pension plan. They see an 
insurmountable debt.  They start looking around.  It is a brain 
drain we as a country cannot afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going on to payroll taxes, there has been a 73% increase in 
payroll taxes. What will that do for jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to tell this House about visiting with people in three 
countries where there was a different method for pensions.  A 
method was there for them to look at and to be part of their 
system.  They had a private plan where they could look at their 
investment and see what it was worth to them.  We must provide 
that initiative, that incentive, that whole thing which makes 
this country such an important and workable unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very briefly, this is a snapshot of this country looking from 
outside. We have a $583 billion debt.  We have a $45 billion 
interest payment which is destroying our social programs, our 
educational programs and is creating unemployment.  In our 
military we discipline the guys at the bottom but none at the 
top. Our dollar is down in the tank.  We have not learned very 
much.  Everything we are doing is hurting our future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with this government to start being concerned about 
perception, about transparency.  Start doing things as the 
Canadian people ask it to. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am the member for 
Lévis. Everyone knows that we have an big shipyard in my riding. 
I felt an obligation to take part in the debate on Bill C-28. 
Although not all its clauses deal with shipping, there is one 
that does, and that is clause 241. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion now before us moved by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is to delete this clause.  Why?  For a number 
of reasons, one in particular.  In our view, there appears to be 
a conflict of interest, because this bill was introduced by the 
Minister of Finance. 
Although his interests are held in a trust, he administers 
several shipping companies under one holding company known as 
Canada Steamship Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This company has several ships, but also has subsidiaries.  The 
main feature of these subsidiaries is that they are all over the 
map internationally.  Clause 241 of the bill reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>241. the corporation has as its principal business in the year 
the operation of ships that are used primarily in transporting 
passengers or goods in international traffic— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked myself why tax benefits were being given only to those in 
international shipping and with offshore interests.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this did not seem fair to the others because, 
ideally, a country's policy should promote its citizen's 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of companies administer the finance minister's 
interests in the shipping sector. The minister's interests are 
held in trust. The minister has companies in various sectors, but 
primarily in the shipping sector, and he has had them for a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some who made comments in this House said the Minister of 
Finance may have made a technical mistake by introducing the 
bill, since only one clause deals with international shipping. 
And we are told the minister did not take part in the drafting of 
that clause. 
Instead, he is said to have asked the Secretary of State for 
Financial Institutions to do it. Therefore, the minister would 
not be in a conflict of interest, or in an apparent conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This explanation leaves a bad taste in the mouth. We did not get 
clear answers to the questions we asked in the House and in the 
finance committee. We noticed that Mr. Wilson, the ethics 
counsellor, sometimes made statements that differed from what he 
wrote. All this does not seem very open, consistent or logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue deserves a closer look. We were told it was a 
technical mistake, but the whole issue must be put in the proper 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 241 of Bill C-28 is similar in every respect to clause 151 
of Bill C-69, which was introduced last year and which, oddly 
enough, died on the <I>Order Paper</I> when the election was called. 
The Minister of Finance or his officials cannot claim it was an 
oversight, since Bill C-69 was also sponsored by the minister, 
which means the same mistake was made twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about the election, I will tell the House a short story. 
During the election campaign, someone phoned and asked me to 
point out, during my campaign, that one of the ships belonging to 
Canada Steamship Lines was flying the flag of the Bahamas. When I 
checked the next day, things had suddenly changed: the ship was 
now registered in Canada. As members can see, one's image is 
important during an election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the election is now behind us and we can see that the 
precautions taken were short lived. The Liberals forgot about 
being cautious, with the result that the Minister of Finance is 
again sponsoring a similar bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 241 is a small provision.  It should have been the concern 
not only of the Minister of Finance, but of all ministers who are 
allegedly concerned about Quebec's interests, especially those 
who were elected in Quebec.  This matter should also have been a 
concern in the maritimes, for everyone with an interest in the 
shipyards.  In 1993, the Liberal candidates at the time made a 
formal commitment to hold a summit on Canada's shipping 
industry.  It was to be held during the Liberals' first mandate, 
but they did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a month before he resigned, the New Brunswick premier, Mr. 
McKenna, was the chair of the provincial premiers' conference in 
St. Andrews.  What did he do in the face of the drop in the 
number of jobs in Saint John? 
There is a major shipyard there too.  When the work on the 
frigates for national defence ended, the number of jobs at Saint 
John Shipbuilding also dropped, as it did in all the small 
shipyards the company had bought in the maritimes.  The same 
thing happened in the west.  The same thing happened in the Great 
Lakes region, where Ontario's two remaining shipyards are to be 
found.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In four years the government has not held a summit and has not 
developed any new shipping policy.  This is why Mr. McKenna 
along with all the other provincial premiers called for a real 
policy on shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mercier, who kept a close eye on the deliberations 
at the Liberal convention on the weekend, told me that the young 
Liberals moved a resolution to have the government establish a 
policy on shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to take this opportunity to remind those 
on the other side, the party in power at this time, of their 
promises of 1993, of the resolution passed by the young 
convention delegates this past weekend, of the adoption of a 
common position by all premiers at Saint Andrews last fall, 
promoted particularly by the former premier of New Brunswick, Mr. 
McKenna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that, in response to all that, the Minister of 
Industry ought to ask the Standing Committee on Industry to 
examine closely a new policy on shipbuilding.  This policy ought 
to take into consideration the suggestions the Shipbuilders' 
Association of Canada has been making for at least a year, which 
boil down to four points. 
First of all, an improved export funding and loan guarantee 
program, similar to the one in the United States, should be 
implemented. Second, they call for new vessels built in Canadian 
shipyards to be exempted from the present Revenue Canada leasing 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should also be a reimbursable tax credit, somewhat similar 
to the Quebec government's measures on ships and drilling 
platforms that have been in place for at least a year.  Finally, 
they call for elimination of the unilateral aspects of NAFTA 
which allow the Americans to send their ships here while we are 
not allowed to do the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out very briefly that the United States has a very 
advantageous policy for shipbuilding.  They do not, 
unfortunately, want to join with the countries calling for an 
end to subsidies. 
Consequently, for the past 20 years at least, the European 
countries involved in shipbuilding continue to subsidize their 
shipbuilders, as do the Asian countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada wants to play a lead role by saying that it will not do 
what they are trying to negotiate internationally.  But, since 
we are one of only a few countries who do not, our shipbuilding 
industry is in the worst position of any in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be fairly brief but I feel I have to rise to 
correct some perceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Red River talked a long time about the 
perceptions of our plan in Ottawa.  I can only say that we have 
some little green men in the House who have trouble with 
perception.  They occupy the benches of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely nobody would expect the government not to follow through 
on its agenda, particularly when we are following a federal 
election.  We went forward, put our plan to the electorate and 
were elected on it.  To make such comments about the Canada 
pension is totally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally preposterous for members of the opposition to talk 
about perceptions and the brain drain after we tabled the budget 
in the House very recently.  We did a whole lot to try to counter 
the brain drain.  We put forward the millennium scholarship fund 
and extended money to the granting councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the electorate has the perception and 
elected the government because it expected that it would carry 
out its promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get in on a long discussion about perceptions 
and what kind of perception is given to the country when people 
say they will not move into Stornoway and the next thing they do 
is move into Stornoway, or what it means when people say they 
came to Ottawa to do politics differently and to establish a 
better decorum and then exhibit virtually the worst decorum in 
the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The perception of the Canadian public in terms of the job we are 
doing as a government in carrying out our mandate is good.  All I 
can say to the member is that he really wants to check out his 
perception to make sure that he, as the government has, 
undertakes the kind of official opposition role the public 
expects from the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we proceed, I 
have been following the debate and I have to tell hon. members 
that from time to time it has been a real struggle to figure out 
how we are staying relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put everybody in the House on notice right now that if you are 
not going to be relevant in discussing the debate at hand, do not 
bother getting up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak to Motion No. 2.  The Bloc motion 
is one that we support.  We think it is a good idea.  We think 
the government should be put on notice, as you have put us on 
notice, Mr. Speaker, that conflict of interest is completely and 
utterly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion was put in an effort to make sure that all members of 
the House would not benefit from the position we have today.  I 
think we would all agree.  That is why the motion was put forward 
and the Reform Party strongly supports it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, the issue strikes at the heart of what has 
been mentioned repeatedly in the debate today, the confidence of 
Canadian people in the government and this institution.  Conflict 
of interest or even the perception of conflict of interest erodes 
public confidence in this institution.  If it erodes the public 
confidence in this institution, we as an institution cannot carry 
out our duties.  If the public does not have confidence in us the 
public will suffer, we will suffer and our nation will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has demonstrated that cracks are developing in 
its midst.  Motion No. 2 not only speaks to the issue of conflict 
of interest but also the repeated efforts by the government to 
use patronage as a way of solidifying its political base, its tax 
and spend sentiment, and its way of doing business that was 
thrown out by countries around the world.  As we can see from the 
Liberal convention last weekend they are now looking at doing it 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government see that tax and spend ways will not 
only compromise the country but its ability to stay in power, not 
that we mind that incidentally?  Taxes have been increased.  The 
government, though, stated that taxes had gone down.  This goes 
back to the root of the confidence of people in the government. 
It cannot say on the one hand that it will decrease taxes and on 
the other hand increase them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Medicine Hat eloquently demonstrated in the 
House that the government has repeatedly increased taxes and 
through bracket creep has taken more and more money out of the 
pockets of Canadians and put it in its own pocket for uses it 
sees fit, not for uses the public sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown a disregard for Canadian people.  It 
will pay a political cost as well as a social cost for doing so. 
The social cost will result in its erosion in the eyes of the 
public.  It will erode our economy and our social programs.  The 
government does not have to go back to its tax and spend ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 illustrates in microcosm that the government 
repeatedly failed to earn the respect of Canadian people. The 
government failed to do a number of things in Bill C-28.  It has 
nibbled around the edges of our tax system rather than actually 
deal with it in a substantive way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few things can be done.  We should improve the skills of our 
workforce.  We should enable the private sector to put enough 
money into its research and development and hiring practices. 
Then we would have an improved workforce which would allow the 
private sector to be competitive in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should lower taxes.  The Reform Party has been fighting for 
lower taxes for a long time, and yet the government has failed to 
do it, even though other countries around the world have been 
doing it and demonstrating the fruits of this action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that by lowering taxes we are going to 
compromise the ability of social programs.  It is the 
government's high taxes which are compromising the social 
programs that the have not people in this country have come to 
rely on.  Therefore the government is compromising the very 
people it professes to want to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to lower taxes and decrease the rules and 
regulations that repeatedly strangle the private sector.  The 
government needs to ensure that we have a pension plan which is 
privatized and effective.  We need a health care system which 
will provide Canadians with the care they need when it is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have rationing on the basis of economics, we have 
rationing on the basis of the government choosing to withhold 
moneys and therefore services because it sees fit.  Therefore 
Canadians from across the country who are poor are going to be 
compromised in their health care; not the rich because they can 
afford to go south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of the erosion of public confidence in 
government.  Motion No. 2, which we support, demonstrates very 
clearly that we need to have this motion if the public is going 
to have its confidence in government restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just returned from the United States.  There are many 
things we can learn from the Americans and there are many things 
they can learn from us.  They did not nibble around their tax 
situation.  They took the bull by the horns and dealt with it in 
an effective way.  As a result, their taxes are much lower.  As a 
result, Canadians have been fleeing this country in droves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best of the best have left our country and gone south.  As a 
result, they are pervasive everywhere from Wall Street to 
Hollywood.  They are giving the United States the best of what we 
have trained them to do.  Why has this occurred? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has occurred because the government has failed to provide 
an environment in which the private sector can function in an 
effective way and by doing so enable Canadians to have jobs that 
are high paying, that are interesting and that contribute to our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to lower our taxes.  The government needs to regain the 
people's confidence by doing that.  The government needs to take 
a lesson from other countries.  It needs to see what they have 
done in order to buttress our economy.  Lower the taxes.  That 
would give the private sector money to invest in education, 
research and development, and that would put Canadians back to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members say that if we do that we will compromise 
health care.  That is bunk.  By taxing and spending, raising the 
amount of money the government spends on the basis of taxes, 
people are prevented from having money in their pockets to 
provide for themselves.  The social fabric of the country is 
actually eroded and the very people the government professes to 
help are compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fiscal responsibility and having a social conscience are two 
halves of the same whole.  One does not exist without the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take a leaf out of the Reform Party's 
book.  Our plan for fiscal responsibility is to spend within our 
means.  That will enable us to have enough money to spend on 
social programs for those who need them.  It will enable us to 
have enough money for health care.  It will enable us to have a 
pension plan that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take money out of Canadians' pockets to put into 
government coffers, thereby compromising the very people who keep 
the country strong, the private sector of our economy and the 
people who slave away day in and day out in the trenches of our 
country trying to make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of helping those people, as my colleague for Medicine 
Hat has said many times, the government has brought in over 39 
tax increases and taken thousands of dollars out of their 
pockets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have strong social programs, we can have fiscal 
responsibility, we can have a stronger economy, we can put people 
back to work and we can have lower taxes.  The government needs 
to look at the plans we have put forward, look at plans that have 
been put forth around the world and, for heaven's sake, act.  Do 
not nibble around the edges with measures such as Bill C-28, act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's repeated failure to do this might make it look 
good, but what goes around comes around.  I can tell hon. members 
this much.  When more and more people die while they are on 
waiting lists in emergency departments, when more and more people 
fail to get needed heart surgery, when more and more pensioners 
fail to have enough money in their pockets when they retire, when 
more and more Canadians become unemployed and look south of the 
border where there is a 4.8% unemployment rate, when more and 
more Canadians get an education in this country and leave to go 
south to make a living, we will recognize once and for all that 
the policies the Liberals have put forward have been an abysmal 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before I recognize 
the next speaker, I thought for the benefit of the House that I 
might trace back to just exactly where we are today because I was 
a little confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on Motion No. 2, which is in the name of the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, which requests that the bill be 
amended by deleting clause 241, which has to do with the 
registration, the head office and the residency of ownership of 
shipping companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a lot easier for me if every once in a while someone 
might, even obtrusively, refer to shipping companies' head 
offices.  If we do not do that we are really making a mockery of 
this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with the greatest respect to the Chair, may I suggest for your 
consideration that, if there is an issue of relevance, under 
normal circumstances government members will take on the 
responsibility of raising the issue of relevance.  I must admit 
that I am a little curious as to why the Speaker felt compelled— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Speaker felt 
compelled because it is the Speaker's responsibility.  That is 
why the Speaker did it.  Very often members of other parties will 
call the attention of the House to relevancy, but ultimately the 
responsibility for relevance is vested in the Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
your direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP supports the amendment to delete clause 241 because it 
calls into question not just the finance minister; it calls into 
question every single MP in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were elected to come here to serve the common good, not for 
our own agenda or our own benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department has put forward amendments which it says 
will accomplish two things.  They will improve the 1991 residence 
rule by applying the same test to all foreign shipping companies 
whether they hold their ships directly or in separate foreign 
subsidiaries.  Second, they will confirm the longstanding policy 
that the exemption applies to capital gains as well as to other 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern has been raised because the finance minister tabled the 
bill and he has a direct relationship with a shipping company, 
the Canada Steamship Lines.  At no time did the minister's 
department let the ethics commissioner know about the tax 
amendment and its relationship to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the Reform member for Fraser Valley said that the 
motivation to do this was because there is a connection to 
business. Even though it is in a blind trust it is important that 
business people make decisions based totally on good business.  I 
disagree and say that decisions to avoid and evade Canadian taxes 
are based on greed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a small business person with a little 
income who is trying to keep as much as possible to continue the 
business; we are talking about a multinational corporation which 
is evading taxes in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really worries me when I hear members of Parliament implying 
that it is all right to evade Canadian taxes.  As citizens we 
agree to pool our resources and then redistribute them for 
medicare, for education and for social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people evade taxes, those who can pay, and who pay a 
substantial amount—and we are talking about millions of dollars 
in taxes every year that will not be coming from Canadians—it 
makes it harder and harder for the rest of Canadians to make up 
for what we are not receiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really shameful that this kind of aspersion should be cast 
on our finance minister.  I bring it back to the point that, as 
members of Parliament in this House, if an aspersion is cast on 
one MP it falls upon all our shoulders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis alone it is important to delete this clause so 
that the House of Commons can maintain a good reputation.  People 
will know that we are here for their good, not our own or not for 
some interest separate from those of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although decisions taken by the Minister of Finance have an 
effect on all Canadians, it is still imperative that at no time 
should any public office holder appear to be in a position where 
there is any suggestion that they would benefit from their public 
office.  Canadians should not be put in the position of thinking 
that we are all here as crooks or dishonest— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Order, order.  Withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
am listening to this debate.  While I am sure there is an amount 
of respect for each and every member of Parliament, I completely 
and very strenuously object to the fact that this hon. member is 
standing in her place and essentially saying that members of 
Parliament in this House, our Minister of Finance in particular, 
are crooks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, I was 
reading Standing Order 11(2) which has to do with relevancy and 
the Speaker's responsibilities thereof.  I did not hear the hon. 
member for Yukon.  If the hon. member for Yukon did say what the 
parliamentary secretary has suggested has been said, I would ask 
the hon. member for Yukon to withdraw either the words or the 
intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess what I would say 
is that I included all of us.  If there is any impression of 
wrongdoing by one, it is wrong for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the member for 
Yukon would just finish her thought then I will be able to 
respond.  Would you finish your thought please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry if there was 
any misunderstanding.  I did not mean to cast any aspersions on 
anyone in this House.  But actions that anyone takes here, 
whether they are good or bad, reflect on every member of 
Parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the operative word that the member used was tax evasion. 
If she withdrew the term “evasion”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Crooks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  It was crooks as well.  Perhaps she 
could withdraw both of those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Will the hon. member 
for Yukon withdraw the word “crooks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Certainly, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are measures such 
as the tax measure outlined in clause 241 of Bill C-28 which put 
the Minister of Finance in the light of giving the appearance of 
going beyond our bounds of ethics, they should be withdrawn. 
Again it reflects on every member of Parliament.  The minister 
should not have tabled the bill— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On a point of order, 
the hon. parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am having great 
difficulty sitting here listening to this member talk about a 
member of the House going outside the bounds and casting a light 
of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The parliamentary 
secretary is quite right. 
By tradition and established custom of the House we do not, 
although sometimes we skate perilously close to the edge, accuse 
other members of things we would not want to be accused of 
ourselves.

pretty thin ice we are on right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the point I am making is 
that I would agree with you.  I do not want aspirations cast on 
any member of this House.  There is the appearance of a conflict 
of interest in this bill and the purpose of the amendment is to 
delete clause 241 so that there will not be an appearance of 
conflict of interest.  It is a difficult issue to discuss. If you 
have to go close to the edge, you have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be talked about because every member of Parliament 
then gets painted with the same brush whether it is good or for 
ill.  I will say no more. However, we do support the Bloc 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I thank the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to 
take part in this debate and particularly to refocus the debate 
on what really matters. Indeed, in spite of what the hon. member 
who spoke before me said, this is much more about the beam in the 
finance minister's eye than about the mote in the eye of the a 
rookie member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why debate today a motion asking that a special committee be 
struck to look at the international shipping legislation to try 
to resolve an apparent conflict of interest involving the 
Minister of Finance? 
I think it is important to establish from the start that this 
situation came about because the Bloc Quebecois found in this 
bill two clauses, including clause 241, which raise many 
questions as to a potential conflict of interest involving the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This apparent conflict of interest has been recognized by the 
director general of the tax legislation division of the 
Department of Finance, who stated before the Standing Committee 
on Finance on February 10, 1998 that the changes to the 
legislation might apply to those companies the finance minister 
has put in trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethics counsellor Howard Wilson went further on February 17, 
1998, when he said that “Mr. Martin sponsored this bill and there 
may be an apparent conflict of interest. However, this prior 
consideration of our options did not take place as it should 
have”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore facing a problem, an apparent conflict of 
interest involving the Minister of Finance. Why does the Bloc 
Quebecois dwell as it does on this issue and why does it have the 
support of all opposition parties in this respect? Because the 
Minister of Finance is the one who tabled the budget a few weeks 
ago. He is partly responsible for the country's financial health 
and for social equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a decision is made, for example, to tax people in a 
particular bracket, this decision has economic and social 
implications for society as a whole. It is therefore important to 
ensure that the person holding the office of finance minister 
cannot in any way be accused of an apparent conflict of interest. 
In the present case, very clear and unequivocal statements were 
made by the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, I am quite prepared to let the 
member say anything, but nobody is being accused of anything. I 
would appreciate it if we went back to the bill, because the 
comments we are hearing now are a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I believe the Speaker who 
just left the Chair had already asked the hon. member to stick to 
the issue before us this afternoon. Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I remind the member for Bourassa 
that I am dealing directly with the motion under consideration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' motion, which is supported by the opposition 
parties, says that the Minister of Finance put himself in an 
apparent conflict of interest. A solution must be found. What we 
are saying is that a special committee should be set up to settle 
the issue. This, I believe, is something that should have been 
done in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government wanted to show openness, it would have said 
“We are in a rather unusual situation. The Minister of Finance 
has a great deal of experience in the shipping sector. He is a 
shrewd businessman, he is successful and he is wealthy. 
His assets are being held in trust while he is acting as 
Minister of Finance. He is making sure that his position cannot 
put his company at an advantage. But now we must legislate on 
international shipping”. If the government had been open, it 
would have informed the Standing Committee on Finance, or any 
other appropriate parliamentary authority. A solution to the 
problem could then have been found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government did not do that. It tried to hide two 
paragraphs in a clause of Bill C-28. Had it not been for the 
vigilance displayed by the Bloc Quebecois, this would have gone 
unnoticed. We started asking questions in the House. The Bloc 
Quebecois raised the issue, and as the weeks went by, people 
realized the seriousness of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this because the Minister of Finance is a key member of 
the government. 
It is he who, at the time of the budget, hands out equity and 
wealth, decides who will be taxed and who not and establishes 
the tax tables for businesses.  This person must appear beyond 
reproach and infallible in delivering the budget speech.  He must 
be able to show clearly that his decisions were made honestly and 
in the best interest of Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the case in the present situation.  Our fellow 
citizens are wondering whether in the decisions made in 
Parliament some things are inappropriate and whether there is not 
a double standard.  The Bloc Quebecois wants this corrected. 
We want to find a fair solution that will appear just and be 
appropriate to the level of debate we want in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current situation, if only the Bloc members had raised the 
issue, it could have been said it was something raised by one 
party, which is entitled to its opinion.  If there were only the 
opposition parties, it could be said that it was something 
between the opposition and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the director general of the tax legislation division at 
the Department of Finance, Len Farber, and the ethics counsellor, 
Howard Wilson, are people outside politics.  As public servants, 
their opinion should be neutral.  In any case, what they have 
both said is that there does in fact appear to be a conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would do well to support the Bloc Quebecois' 
motion, which is very dynamic and which would enhance the 
finance minister's credibility in this situation.  Let us put the 
whole situation on the table.  Let us look for a solution with 
all those involved.  Together, we could find a solution that 
would preserve the finance minister's integrity as well as allow 
international shipping legislation to be implemented properly to 
the benefit of the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But today, and for several weeks now, because it has stubbornly 
stuck to its guns, the government itself is feeding into this 
appearance of conflict of interest. 
The government itself is creating doubts in the minds of all 
Canadians as to whether or not the Minister of Finance is in a 
situation where he is creating an undue advantage for himself, 
one he would not have had if he did not occupy his present 
position.  It is essential that this situation be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be clarified in this particular situation, but it must 
also be clarified for all the future actions of the Minister of 
Finance.  The Minister of Finance has decisions to make every 
day concerning many Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that there be a situation in which these 
decisions can be defended, in which it can be said: “Yes, it is 
a good decision” or “No, it is not a good decision”, but based on 
underlying arguments, on the relevance of decisions, and not on 
undue influence, which should have no place in such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' motion deserves the House's attention.  It 
deserves serious consideration, so that this special committee 
that will review the situation can make a recommendation on how 
to go about resolving the matter.  Instead of passing a lengthy 
bill with a very specific clause quietly slipped in, the 
situation could instead be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the situation is drawn to the attention of all Canadians by 
the Bloc Quebecois, it will be possible to say: “Yes, the 
solution recommended by the special committee restores the 
finance minister's integrity, enables him to avoid the appearance 
of unfairness, of conflict of interest”. Such a decision would 
enhance the reputation of Parliament as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House must realize how important it is to pass 
the motions introduced by the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
important that this motion by the Bloc Quebecois be adopted. I 
will try to convince my Liberal colleagues and, if the finance 
minister himself were here, I would try to convince him also that 
it would be in his best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is designed to suspend section 241 of the bill 
before us until a committee has examined and shed some light on 
this matter. Section 241 would allow shipping companies with 
foreign interests to benefit from tax rebates. That is all we are 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people know that, in his previous life in the private 
sector, the Minister of Finance owned a very successful shipping 
company. We can applaud the fact that he has chosen to go into 
politics, a career which certainly does not pay as much as his 
previous career. We can applaud that fact, but in the bill before 
us, the finance minister appears to be acting in his own 
interest. 
He appears to be favouring the interests he put in trust. Until 
we get to the bottom of this, the minister and all politicians 
will suffer the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance had the courage to tell this House that 
he had made a mistake when the Liberal Party announced that it 
would scrap the GST. He had the courage to make this admission 
even though the Prime Minister did not follow in his footsteps. 
He had the courage to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has a reputation, but I would also remind 
him that he is very much identified with the cuts in social 
programs, including the first drastic cuts in unemployment 
insurance in 1994. That first reform, which was followed by the 
1996 reform, was the toughest. The 1994 reform was the one that 
hurt Canadians the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Canada social transfer also brought drastic cuts to 
social programs in health, education and welfare. These cuts 
have been maintained. The government says it is investing in 
these areas when it is in fact cutting back.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money invested in the CHST has dropped from $19 billion to 
about $11 billion. The government has raised the floor to $12.5 
billion, but that still leaves a huge gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same finance minister who has made these cuts, and written, 
sold and promoted the budget is granting fiscal benefits to 
himself. 
For ordinary taxpayers, this makes no sense. It is detrimental 
to their perception of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was not happy because the media did not jump on the 
bandwagon. 
The minister has a great deal of personal prestige, and we are 
ready to admit that, although we do not approve of his policies, 
he deserves our respect. But with this bill, we have to ask 
whether he really is the person he appears to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has the obligation to clear up this matter, both for him and 
in the interest of Canadian politics. It is of the utmost 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is another consideration, and I know it means a great 
deal to him. His father, Paul Martin Sr., is very much 
associated with the creation of our social programs. He was an 
important progressive figure in the history of Canadian politics. 
I am sure it would be unthinkable for him to have his son 
involved in something that is less than transparent and on which, 
for some obscure reason, he refuses to shed light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe he was not aware of these provisions. But then it would be 
a matter of concern if the finance minister did not know what is 
in his bills. He should have the fortitude to admit it. It would 
lay to rest a matter that will not go away, but only get worse. 
In politics, it is much easier for people to believe in 
wrongdoing than in the opposite. 
Everybody has a responsibility to avoid this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To preserve people's trust, because people cannot accept that 
the minister who has cut social programs and unemployment 
insurance should appear to line his pockets through a bill he has 
introduced himself, and for the sake of his father, the minister 
should clear up this situation, and that is why—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to essentially 
clarify a number of things that were said this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by saying that the motion would remove a clause 
that clarifies the rule on the deemed residence of foreign 
incorporated shipping companies.  It has nothing to do with tax 
policy, shipping policy or any other policy.  It has everything 
to do with political rhetoric, nothing more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back and talk a bit about the clause itself.  To look 
at the clause we have to go back over 70 years.  In the 1920s 
Canada decided that non-resident shipping companies should not 
pay Canadian tax on their income from international shipping as 
long as companies' home countries gave Canadians the same 
treatment.  The reciprocal agreement greatly simplified a complex 
double tax problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around 1990 some foreign shippers, especially in Asia, wanted to 
open offices in Canada that would create jobs and economic 
activity.  If we look at Vancouver, that was exactly the impact 
this policy had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These foreign shippers were concerned that the 1920s tax rule 
was not clear enough.  To benefit from the rule a foreign shipper 
had to be a non-resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Asian companies were concerned that if they opened Canadian 
offices they would fall under this definition and be found to be 
resident in Canada.  They would not benefit from the rule and 
would be subject to tax on all their international shipping 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore shippers along with a British Columbia government 
agency called International Marine Centre Vancouver persuaded 
the government of the time in 1991 to clarify the rule in the 
Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarifying rule was enacted in 1991.  It gives foreign 
shipping companies the assurances that they are not resident in 
Canada provided their principal business is international 
shipping and that is where substantially all their revenue comes 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the rule says international shipping, it specifically 
excludes Great Lakes and St. Lawrence shipping between Canada and 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 IMC Vancouver suggested some fine tuning of the 1991 
rule.  In April 1995 the government responded by announcing the 
technical change that is now in this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change says that in counting a foreign shipper's revenue and 
in deciding what its business is, we can look through to the 
revenue and business of its wholly owned subsidiary.  Why?  The 
shipping companies are organized in different ways.  It would 
hardly be fair to treat foreign shippers differently, depending 
on whether they hold their ships directly or in a subsidiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clause that we are debating is not new policy.  It goes back 
to 1920.  It is not even a new rule.  The rule was enacted in 
1991.  It is just a minor improvement of an existing provision, 
the sort of improvement that makes the tax system work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot about that, but for several weeks allegations 
have been made in this House and repeated both in this House and 
elsewhere about the origins and the effects of this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the beginning, it was stated categorically by certain 
opposition members that this clause would help Canadian companies 
beat what are known as the foreign accrual property income or 
FAPI rules.  That was complete nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not enough to be wrong once.  These members, in effect, 
accuse the Minister of Finance of being in a conflict of 
interest.  That, too, was utterly discredited.  The fact is that 
the minister was kept entirely apart from this issue at all 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original inquiry from IMC, Vancouver and all subsequent 
discussions along with the decisions made on this issue were made 
and handled by the secretary of state.  Then the allegations 
shifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told by these members that the minister could somehow 
benefit from this technical amendment.  Exactly how was never 
explained.  Why?  He cannot benefit.  The allegations persisted 
even after it was made amply clear that this clause, indeed, the 
whole policy that has been in place since 1920 has to do with 
foreign incorporated companies, not Canadian companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we get this motion.  I might be a little emotional about 
this because I had the unfortunate experience of having to sit in 
this House all afternoon and listen to this political rhetoric 
that had absolutely nothing to do with what was before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, having totally misunderstood the amendment, having 
failed to show the slightest impropriety on the part of the 
government, having ignored all the information it has been given, 
the Bloc Quebecois wants to remove the clause from the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not policy.  It is politics.  It is an attempt to 
discredit a respected minister with innuendo by repeating 
unfounded charges in the hope that they could cast him in a bad 
light.  It is an attempt to taint with suspicion a man of honour 
who happened to have a successful business career before entering 
public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The hon. member for Medicine Hat sits there 
and ridicules.  I had to sit here and listen to his rhetoric. He 
cannot stand the facts.  He has to sit there and ridicule. Let us 
be clear.  The Minister of Finance has always exceeded the 
requirements for disclosure for members of Parliament and cabinet 
in 1998 and 1993.  When he became a member of cabinet he 
voluntarily disclosed all his business assets, his personal 
holdings and registered them with the Clerk of the House.  They 
are available to the public, including the media and members of 
the opposition.  That is not a requirement of a member of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor has totally rejected, unequivocally, the 
Bloc's claims entirely.  I will say this ever so slowly because 
this is what I have had to listen to all afternoon.  He said no 
conflict of interest exists and therefore no appearance of 
conflict exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Drummond said today that the ethics commissioner 
actually said this clause should be put in the annex of a bill. 
He never said that.  I do not know where they get this 
information.  He said there is no conflict of interest and 
therefore no appearance of conflict of interest exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite a sad day today to sit here and listen to these 
people in opposition go on and on attacking a member of this 
House, attacking the finance minister who is very well respected 
in this country, who did more for this country and whose family 
did quite a bit for this country. I tried to remain calm. I am a 
little excited now but I think for a very good cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was ever any doubt that the opposition party charges 
are about politics at its worst, that was clearly demonstrated by 
the member for Battlefords—Lloydminster who told the Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I> when asked if he thought the minister behaved 
unethically, and I quote because I think this really puts it in 
context: “Personally I don't believe so.  I think Mr. Martin is 
a man of integrity.  I really do”.  Those are not my words. 
Those are the words of a member of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only hope that the members opposite would listen to that 
member so they understand in effect that what these members in 
the House today did was essentially to go on a political witch 
hunt after this minister for their political gain.  I do not 
believe for one second that there is a Canadian who believes the 
Minister of Finance has nothing but the best interests of 
Canadians in mind first and foremost. He has demonstrated it 
since 1988, since he was elected to this House. He will continue 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will see this clause defeated.  I also hope these 
members at some point throughout this mandate will stand up and 
apologize for the kind of behaviour we saw today in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is not infrequent in the House that we have a lot of sound and 
fury signifying not much.  Unfortunately that is exactly what we 
just had from the member.  There is an issue here of the 
integrity of the minister which is not in question by me.  It was 
certainly not in question by the member for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the issue of how appropriate it was for the 
legislation to be introduced by the minister who has interests in 
shipping.  The issue is that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that the finance minister who gets to set the 
affairs of Canada, in particular the affairs related to taxation, 
is a good businessman who takes full advantage of all rules and 
decides to put assets offshore so he will not have to pay taxes 
like everyone else.  The irony of the finance minister arranging 
his affairs in this way is not lost on the viewers of this 
program or on the readers of this transcript.  The irony of the 
finance minister being able to do that with impunity speaks to 
the issue of the government's policies and indeed his policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject the assertions of the parliamentary secretary that the 
conflict of interest commissioner said that because there was no 
conflict there was no appearance of conflict.  We remember that 
this commissioner was supposed to be the watchdog that would 
answer to parliament.  The Prime Minister and the Liberal red 
book very clearly and unequivocally stated that the conflict of 
interest commissioner would be answerable to parliament, as he 
should be.  However it is yet another Liberal broken promise 
because the conflict of interest commissioner is answerable to 
the Prime Minister.  The watchdog becomes the lap dog of 
parliament. Therefore I am sorry but I take no— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Don't take shots at the commissioner too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Yes, I will take shots at the 
commissioner too because of the position the government and the 
Prime Minister have put this very honourable gentleman in.  The 
Prime Minister and the government have created this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perception about the affairs of the the finance minister is 
that he can do things offshore legally, completely above board 
and within the rules.   That is an accurate perception.  However, 
what do we do with the fact that he also makes the rules which 
permit him to do that?  At the same time virtually all Canadian 
taxpayers do not have that option.  That is the irony and therein 
is the appearance.  Therefore we will be supporting the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are proposing 
a motion this afternoon which we believe warrants the serious 
attention of the House and makes a very serious proposition to 
all members for support consistent with the statement of the 
Minister of Health and consistent with the call of government 
Liberal members who at their recent convention made a very strong 
plea for the government to put in place a mechanism to assess the 
adequacies of cash transfer payments for health care systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we offer a motion in the spirit of constructive 
suggestion.  It is a motion that is made in the spirit of 
co-operation and which deserves the support of each and every one 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the amendment coincides in spirit and in 
intent with the resolutions adopted at the previous Liberal 
convention.  I make a plea to members across the way to assess 
very carefully the motion before them and to look at it as 
something that will be absolutely consistent with the wishes of 
the members of their party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very clear.  It calls on the government to report 
on an official basis annually to parliament about the adequacy of 
the way in which we finance health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides a way for parliamentarians and all Canadians to have 
a say in the future of medicare and to have the means by which 
they can assess the effectiveness of government programs which 
uphold this most important national program, our most treasured 
national institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell the House that health care has been a 
matter of very heated and intense debate in the Chamber.  The 
discussion in the House has evolved from the concerns about the 
extent of the health care crisis in Canada.  It has flowed from 
questions about the appropriate level of federal support.  It has 
arisen from concerns about the degree to which our health care 
system is being privatized. 
It has emerged from a deep commitment by all involved Canadians 
everywhere to medicare.  It is not simply an issue of partisan 
debate.  Concerns being raised cross party lines in the Chamber 
and as we saw on the weekend are very much alive and well in the 
Liberal Party of Canada.

his efforts at the cabinet table for more dollars for health care 
has to be one of the most significant developments in parliament 
over the past six months.  It is certainly an unusual position to 
be taken by a member of government.  It speaks to the seriousness

convention and the call for action from many in the House arise 
from several very critical developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, and I need remind no one in the Chamber about these 
developments, there has been a growing body of incidents about 
hardship, suffering and even death directly related to the level 
of funding of our health care systems.  Those incidents have 
given us all a sense of urgency to act now before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is very clear from the outpourings of Canadians and 
from the polls that have been taken of public opinion that 
Canadians remain committed to a single payer, universally 
accessible, publicly administered health care system.  They 
understand clearly the need for federal funding, for national 
standards and for government leadership.  Canadians when probed 
through public polling techniques agreed that any federal 
budgetary surplus should go first and foremost to federal cash 
transfer payments for health care.  This shows a tremendous level 
of sophistication and an unwavering commitment to medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the debate before us today needs to be dealt with on an 
urgent basis because each and every province has called with one 
voice for the federal government to begin a process of 
reinvestment in health cash transfers.  Each and every province 
is trying to adjust almost overnight to massive reductions in 
federal transfers, to the biggest bite in the history of medicare 
taken out of health care financing by the federal Liberal 
government.  They are attempting with all their remaining funds 
and creative abilities to reform their health care systems to 
achieve savings commensurate with the federal cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the contention of every province and the two territories 
and certainly the belief of many in the House that federal cash 
transfers have dropped to unacceptably low levels.  There is a 
vacuum of leadership at the federal level.  It rings hollow for 
the federal government to claim that the cancelled cut of $1.5 
billion is new money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear understanding about the dramatic shift in 
federal support from the days of 50:50 cost sharing to the 
present day where federal support using full tax points and cash 
transfers is down to 20% at the most.  If one looked only at the 
cash element of the financing system, federal participation is 
down to between 10% and 15%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians, provincial governments included, recognize the 
need to shift our health care system from one that is 
institutional based and illness focused to one that is based on 
prevention, wellness and which is community delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our goal.  That is why we are here today. We are here to 
find a way to help this government ensure that we can preserve 
medicare, reform it in terms of making it better and not just 
achieving a fiscal bottom line and to provide a measure of 
accountability involving Canadians in the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before this House is to help the health minister, to 
help the Liberal government, come to grips with this debate and 
these concerns before everyone, to make decisions based on the 
facts.  This motion gives the government a tool to assess the 
adequacy of federal transfers.  It gives the Minister of Health a 
mechanism to achieve his plea for support from Canadians.  It 
gives Parliament a meaningful role and it gives the public a say 
in this whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would ask all members to consider this motion 
as something constructive and positive in the debate and I hope 
it is adopted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would just like to respond 
to this motion and restate this government remains firmly 
committed to the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 strengthens the federal government's ability to 
enforce the Canada Health Act.  This legislation guarantees that 
the cash portion of the Canada health and social transfer will 
never fall below $12.5 billion in each and every year over the 
next five years.  That is an increase of $1.5 billion over the 
previous cash floor of $11 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the bill before the House means there will be 
more cash to uphold the principles of the Canada Health Act. It 
responds directly to the recommendations by the national forum on 
health that CHST cash be set at $12.5 billion to sustain the 
principles of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion recommends yet another annual report to 
examine the adequacy of the CHST cash and upholding the CHA.  I 
would like to remind her that the Minister of Health is already 
required under the Canada Health Act to table an annual report on 
the administration of the act and provincial compliance with its 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I think the last thing Canadians need is another 
report.  Canadians asked us to take action and we have. We have 
taken real concrete action.  Bill C-28 ensures that there is more 
cash to uphold the principles of this act, $1.5 billion each and 
every year.  The first thing this government did was put back 
$1.5 billion as the fiscal environment changed, and we are well 
on our way as the Minister of Finance said back in February.  We 
will continue to balance the books, we will continue to invest in 
Canadian priorities and we will continue to uphold the Canada 
Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the hon. member that I certainly look forward 
to her interventions to help us ensure that Canadians receive the 
kind of health care they want within the fiscal means we have set 
and the conditions we have set forward.  I am sure Canadians all 
across this country will continue to support this government as 
we continue to provide for them as we move into the next century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the intent of the motion but regrettably I cannot 
support it. I would like to take a moment to explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the motion is calling for the Minister of Health to 
table a report assessing the adequacy of the cash transfer 
portion of the Canada health and social transfer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why we have any confidence that the federal government 
will be a great protector of health care.  Given the past history 
of the federal government, why in the world would we have even a 
shred of confidence in the government to protect health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members once again what the Prime Minister said when he 
was in the 1993 leadership debate.  This is exactly what 
transpired in that debate.  The leader of the Reform Party said: 
“What specifically is your commitment to the level of federal 
transfer payments for health care?  Would you keep them at the 
current level?” The Prime Minister responded: “I said yesterday 
in reply to Mr. Bouchard that I promised that they will not go 
down and I hope that we will be able to increase them”.  I guess 
that did not happen, did it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the parliamentary secretary say a moment ago that the 
government has increased transfers for health care by $1.5 
billion.  He forgot to mention that the government cut transfers 
for health care and higher education by $7.5 billion, the largest 
cut to health care in the history of the country.  The Liberal 
government closed more hospitals, shut down more hospital beds 
than all the provincial governments combined.  Why in the world 
would we think for a moment that somehow the federal government 
will be some great protector of health care in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that when the provincial ministers brought down their 
budgets this spring in each and every case they increased 
spending for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my colleagues in the New Democratic Party that 
the NDP government in Saskatchewan increased spending for health 
care.  All provincial governments did that because they are 
closer to the people.  They know that if they make bad decisions 
about health care, people will be protesting on their lawn, not 
on the lawn of Parliament Hill, which incidentally is probably 
where they should have been protesting when the government 
blatantly broke its 1993 election promise not to cut transfers 
for health care and higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces know that people will be on their lawn protesting. 
They know that when there is a newspaper story about people 
having to wait in hallways to get treatment for health care it 
will be the provincial health ministers who feel the heat first 
and most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I cannot agree with this motion.  I think it is 
ridiculous to ask the very people who took the broad axe to 
health care to be the protectors of health care, to somehow give 
them some new power and to give people a false sense of security 
that somehow the federal government has the best interests of 
Canadians in mind.  It simply does not, it did not and we know 
the record is very clear that given the opportunity the first 
thing it does when there is a crunch is cut health care and 
higher education.  Then when the budget was brought down, 
government members said “we are not going to cut it as deeply as 
we said we were, so now we should be honoured and deserve 
applause from people”.  It is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat the Prime Minister's quote.  He said during the 
1993 leaders debate: “I said yesterday in reply to Mr. Bouchard 
that I promised they will not go down and I hope that we will be 
able to increase them”.  That is what he said about the Canada 
health and social transfer.  What a joke.  Just another one of a 
dozen important election promises that the government has 
absolutely broken, and I guess it does so with impunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that my friends in the NDP and in other political 
parties will not be drawn in to believe that somehow the Minister 
of Health will be a great protector of health care when he has 
proved over and over again that he cannot be counted on to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also encourage my friends in the NDP to remember that they too 
have colleagues at the provincial level who have added money into 
budgets for health care precisely because the level of government 
that is closest to the people is much better able to gauge public 
sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends to rethink this motion.  Remember that 
the real protectors of health care in Canada are the people at 
the lower levels of government, primarily in the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, like 
my colleague from the Reform Party, I did not plan to speak on 
the motion put forward by the New Democratic Party, but what I 
have heard the secretary of state and member for Stoney Creek say 
just made my hair, or what is left of it, stand on end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard things that verge on misleading statements. I have 
heard things that totally contradicted—I hope it was by 
ignorance, not by maliciousness or to be dishonest either—the 
facts and figures that have been presented to us since 1995 in 
the successive budgets brought down by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Reform Party touched on the issue. I would 
like to go into it in a little more detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, when the Minister of Finance brought down his budget, 
it provided for cuts to be made systematically every year until 
2003 in what came to be known as the Canada social transfer. This 
Canada social transfer was designed to fund provincial 
initiatives in higher  education, social assistance and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Minister of Finance pressed the start button for 
systematic cuts to be made year after year until 2003, cuts 
totalling $6 billion each year in higher education, social 
assistance and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they come up with this Bill C-28. What does Bill C-28 say? It 
says, and I agree with my colleague from the New Democratic 
Party on this, that instead of cutting a total amount of $48 
billion between now and the year 2003, cutting $48 billion in 
higher education, social assistance and health, the government 
will only be cutting $42 billion. 
And we are supposed to applaud!  I find it totally abhorrent to 
present things in such a way, to use them to trick the public, 
because that is what is being done right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that there is $6 billion more for health care.  It 
is not true that there will be $1.5 billion more in the coming 
years for health care.  There will, instead, be $6 billion in 
cuts for every year between now and 2003, and a sizeable amount 
of that will be in health care.  That is reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as health care is being slashed, we are being 
told that $1.5 billion is being added yearly for the next three 
years. 
The truth is that they are cutting $6 billion per year in social 
programs and health.  Let them stop trying to fill the public's 
heads with nonsense, let them stop expecting the public to 
swallow any old thing they present it with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cause of the present sorry state of the health system is not 
Minister Rochon in Quebec, nor the other provincial health 
ministers. The main responsibility lies with the federal 
government.  The little band-aid solution offered during the last 
election campaign in response to the heavy pressures for 
something to be done, that $1.5 billion was just a drop in the 
bucket, barely remedying an iota of the pillage the government 
had wrought in the health field.  That is the reality. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the reason 
we need this amendment is we cannot trust the Liberals to look 
after our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to have a Canada assistance plan that reflected the 
needs of the regions.  It would match health care.  It would 
match education.  It would match social assistance.  That is no 
longer in place.  We have a Canada health transfer that is a 
chunk of money which the provinces can do with whatever they 
like.  A sympathetic provincial government will make sure there 
is health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Systematically Liberal decisions and policies have undermined 
health care and now we are in a position where we are forced to 
debate whether or not we will have health care in our country. 
At their convention the Liberals passed a resolution that Canada 
would ensure a national standard of health care for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are chipping away at the foundation instead of putting in the 
windows and doors of our health care system.  We are not 
providing pharmacare.  We are not providing home care.  Health 
care in rural and remote areas is not a given.  There may be a 
health station in these areas which is what is in Old Crow.  It 
is an incredibly expensive flight to get out. You may see a 
doctor once a month or you may not.  We have a situation where 
the Canadian Medical Association says that for Canadians the CHST 
has meant and continues to mean less federal government 
commitment to our health care system and has compromised the 
federal government's ability to preserve and enhance national 
standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to say that the accumulated reductions now total 
$18.9 billion, that the government is giving back 1.5% of the 
total reductions in cash payments to the provinces, and that this 
is supposed to fix the mess that has been made.  Another comment 
was that the CHST cash payments need to factor in other things 
than just the economy, such as the age of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our elderly parents and elders in our communities are not going 
to go away.  We know that elderly people need more health care. 
Sick children are not going to go away.  Mothers and fathers are 
still going to have to stay home to look after those children. 
When they do that, it is a cost to our economy and to our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a mechanism that will hold the Liberal government to 
account so that it does not continue cutting and sneaking its 
cuts in through the back door.  Canadians everywhere want a 
health care system they can count on.  If the government cannot 
go at it by direct cuts—and it was forced to stop cutting and 
not putting anything back—it is going to go at it another way 
around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation of the Canadian Medical Association is to 
increase the amount.  The government should take in a combination 
of factors such as technology, economic growth, population growth 
and demographics.  The government should establish national 
targets, what our health care will be, where we will go with it 
and what we will do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we cannot give the government a free hand because we 
know what it does with it.  It tears our medical system apart. 
We want a mechanism to hold it accountable, whatever government 
is in place, to a standard of medical care that we can all be 
proud of.  Then we can rest at night knowing that no one will die 
in a corridor or on the street because we did not care enough to 
make sure the money was there to look after them.

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabasca, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to speak very briefly to the motion introduced by one 
of our colleagues in the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the first thing I would say is that it is a bit 
weak.  I am not convinced that they have really addressed the 
problem of whether the transfer payment system is adequately 
funded.  Why?  Quite simply because I do not believe that a 
report by the Minister of Health will speed up the recovery time 
of people in hospitals throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced that the Minister of Health or even his 
officials have the time to go and see what is happening in the 
regions.  I think that all members know what is happening there. 
The provinces, health care groups and community groups are also 
well aware of what is happening.  Unfortunately, although the 
stated purpose, which is to inform the House whether health is 
being adequately funded, is important per se, I am not sure that 
we will achieve our goals at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there were the massive cuts in health, post-secondary 
education and social services.  The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot made this point very well.  I can perhaps 
make a small correction.  The federal government is not the only 
one making cuts.  The provinces are doing so too.  They have 
difficult choices to make.  Let us say that Ottawa set the ball 
in motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly things being done in Quebec City that impact 
on municipalities, among others.  The provincial government has 
difficult choices to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> It has had to make them largely because of the 
federal government. 
It is obvious that my hon. colleague is worried that there will 
be a new leader of the Liberal Party in Quebec with a greater 
chance of winning the election.  He is perhaps getting started on 
his provincial campaign.  Who knows?  We might lose the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.  If he were to move to the 
provincial level, it would be a great loss to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One really important thing to bear in mind with respect to health 
is that, since 1993, the government has not kept up its end of 
the bargain.  The public was led to believe that the system was 
in great shape, and assistance to the provinces was cut, but the 
government had not put its own house in order.  This is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unilateral cuts completely destabilized Canada's 
health care system.  Afterwards, when finances returned to an 
adequate level, the government began spending again, without 
regard for the criteria which make Canada's health and education 
system a shared federal and provincial responsibility. 
Education is certainly provincial.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I mean is that the government, as the minister was saying in 
the House today, plans to incorporate new services in the health 
care systems.  So while everyone is saying that the transfers 
are inadequate, the government is preparing to set up a home care 
system.  This is entirely a provincial matter.  And it has not 
mentioned the cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, we spend between $2.4 and $2.8 billion a year in 
Canada on home care.  The government is preparing a proposal, 
but, as we have seen today, not too many of the Minister of 
Health's colleagues are giving their support to this new 
structure. 
They are sending out messages saying “We are looking after 
health; it is a priority.  We are cutting, but then we will set 
up new programs”.  But the problem of the cuts made in the first 
place has not been resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago, during the election campaign last year, there 
was talk of a national pharmacare program.  What has become of 
it?  We hear no mention of it these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we hear “We are not sure that the provinces will go for 
a drug plan.  It may not be popular.  The aging of the population 
is a popular topic.  We will talk about home care.  That should 
grab them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are talking endlessly about home care.  However, we do not 
know what it will cost nor who will manage it.  And in the 
meantime, there is no mention of a drug plan—nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the minister told us that the figure of $12.5 was 
recommended by the National Forum on Health.  I am not talking 
about the one this weekend, but of the one from a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This figure was recommended by the Forum, but we must be careful. 
The Forum also called for new health care measures, new funding 
for health care, for home care and for pharmacare.  That meant 
that the government's contribution was not $12.5 billion, but a 
lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $12.5 billion is strictly for transfers.  But knowing that 
home care currently costs billions of dollars, the Forum said 
more money had to be invested.  They are not quite saying that in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is a very important matter.  Even the Liberal Party 
members said so on the weekend. 
Unfortunately, the minister does not seem to want to listen, nor 
do his cabinet colleagues, because there is nothing new on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for some stabilization and guarantee for the 
provinces. The provinces must be the ones that manage Canada's 
health care sector, to avoid any federal government involvement. 
As we know, our Liberal friends have a tendency to take over 
various responsibilities and to do a bit of politics in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is a provincial matter. We hope that if the federal 
government finds some money, it will transfer it to the 
provinces. One possible source is the $2.5 billion. An amount of 
$2.5 billion was set aside in the budget this year for a program 
that will begin in the year 2000 or 2001, and that will cost 
about $200 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have taken $200 million, starting in the 
year 2000 or 2001, and put the $2.5 billion back into the health 
sector, through the transfers to the provinces. This would have 
shown that the government truly gives priority to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could have used the money to give a tax break to taxpayers 
and help them face the music. But the government did none of 
that. It is setting some money aside. It is taking $2.5 billion 
and will put it there. The interest should normally go to the 
millennium scholarship foundation, but we are not sure whether 
that will happen. We will have to wait and see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party member who chairs the public accounts committee 
pointed this out last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic motion is good for the health sector. Its 
purpose is to make sure we know what is going on. However, it is 
ineffective, because even Statistics Canada releases figures and 
standards on Canadians' health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to check in the field to see if the 
transfers are adequate. However, we do know that they are 
currently inadequate. Some unilateral cuts were made. The 
shortfall will continue for the next few years and this must 
absolutely stop.

very glad to speak in favour of this amendment to the resolution 
put forward by my colleague from Winnipeg North Centre.  It is a 
very good idea and one of a series of very good ideas that have 
come from the member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out already, it is interesting to note that 
the language of this amendment finds its origins in a priority 
resolution passed at the Liberal policy convention this past 
weekend.  It seems a lot of us were glued to the TV set watching 
this convention.  It obviously has an impact on all of our lives. 
We had to keep a very close watch on the things that happened at 
that convention because they have a severe impact on a lot of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It warrants reading the resolution that was adopted at the 
policy convention.  I can find no fault in the language, the tone 
or the content of the resolution.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada encourage the 
federal government to develop a process to continuously measure 
the quality of health care in Canada and at the same time to 
ensure a national standard of health care for all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a lot of merit.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance said that this amendment was not necessary 
because there was already a provision.  The Minister of Finance 
already does an annual analysis of the CHST's spending.  He may 
in fact do an analysis of how the money is being spent, but 
nowhere in that analysis will it record or review whether it is 
an adequate amount of money to uphold the standards of the CHA. 
That is where the amendment stands separate.  It is necessary, 
still has merit as a resolution and should be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution adopted on the weekend merely indicates that the 
Liberals cannot help but listen to what the Canadian people from 
all walks of life have been saying:  young, old, across all party 
lines, interprovincial. When asked their top priority in the 
spending patterns of the Canadian government, what they wanted to 
see money spent on, to a person quality health care ranked in the 
top three priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can back this up with two recent surveys.  The first one is a 
scientific survey conducted by the Angus Reid pollsters on behalf 
of the Canadian Medical Association.  The second one was my own 
informal and unscientific survey of voters in my riding of 
Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I sent out a survey to the people of my riding and asked 
them to list in order of priority the issues they found most 
pressing and the issues they wanted the government to act on in 
the near future, every one of the people who chose to answer 
listed quality health care as their number one priority in the 
list of eight or nine things we asked about.  The other items 
included job creation, education, health care, crime and urban 
violence, and a number of other issues.  The top three were 
health care, education and job creation, followed shortly after 
by crime and urban violence which is another issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to ignore that kind of response. When people in 
a riding are asked what they care about and all of them come back 
with the same answer, we cannot help but listen.  I have a 
feeling that similar surveys are being done by other MPs and they 
are getting the same answers.  Therefore it comes as no surprise 
and does not indicate any great enlightenment on behalf of the 
Liberal Party that the resolution should show up at its policy 
convention.  It is simply due to the fact that the Liberals are 
finally listening to what the Canadian people really want.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other survey is more scientific and perhaps has more merit. 
It was done by the Angus Reid research group for the Canadian 
Medical Association.  Specific questions were asked in that 
survey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Results indicated that in 1997, 65% of people reported that 
waiting times in emergency departments had worsened.  That figure 
is up from 54% in 1996.  Sixty-four per cent reported that the 
availability of nurses in hospitals had worsened.  That figure is 
up from 58% in 1996.  Sixty-three per cent reported that waiting 
times for surgery had worsened.  That figure is up from 53% in 
1996. It is no secret that this issue weighs heavily on the minds 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance stood up 
and argued that the floor of the Canada health and social 
transfer is actually being increased to $12.5 billion.  This is 
an illusion.  It is creative financing to the worst degree. As 
has been pointed out by others, when you go from $19 billion down 
to $11 billion and then crank it back up to $12.5 billion, you 
are not giving anybody anything.  You are simply lessening the 
amount of cutbacks. Many figures have been bandied about to 
describe the cumulative effect that has.  All we really need to 
know is that it is the biggest single cutback in the history of 
Canada's medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite these things to point out that the well-being of our 
health care system is of prime importance.  The amendment put 
forward by the member for Winnipeg North Centre is on behalf of 
Canadians to try to accurately reflect what their real concerns 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak about the Canada health and social transfer as an 
aspect of this whole picture.  We must remember what the National 
Council of Welfare said about the Canada health and social 
transfer when it was first introduced.  It called it the most 
disastrous social policy initiative in the post-war era.  It felt 
very strongly to use language of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us view the redistribution of wealth through federal 
transfer payments as the single greatest achievement of Canadian 
federalism.  We all know that we have a very tenuous grasp on the 
concept of Canadian federalism.  One of the things which has kept 
this country united is that the have not provinces could expect 
the support of a strong central government as it redistributed 
the wealth of the nation.  We have seen that eroded slowly but 
surely in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own political life we have seen the established programs 
financing, EPF, change to CAP, then a cap on CAP, then ultimately 
the Canada health and social transfer. Every step of the way has 
resulted in less and less operating capital for the provinces to 
deliver the services wanted by Canadians.  Slowly and surely we 
have seen that erosion.  The figures have been pointed out that 
50:50 funding has been lowered to somewhere between 10% and 20% 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance is that this amendment is not necessary 
because this type of review is already under way annually. The 
review that is under way will not answer the fundamental question 
of whether the level of funding is adequate to ensure the health 
and viability of the Canada Health Act.  It may study the way the 
money is being spent but it does not study the fundamental 
question of whether it is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggest that this amendment should be adopted as broad 
interests, certainly those who voted for us, are very concerned. 
It would serve them well if we adopted this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to speak to Motion No. 3 regarding the 
proposal to establish an annual report from the Minister of 
Finance on the adequacy of the cash portion of the Canada health 
and social transfer to sustain the principles of the Canada 
Health Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Medicine Hat indicated, the Reform 
caucus, the official opposition, is opposed to this motion. I 
recognize there is a worthwhile principle at play here, namely an 
attempt to increase transparency and accountability in the 
federal government's management of the CHST cash transfers. 
Ultimately however we are concerned that this motion would 
increase the federal government's meddling ability in what is an 
area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction under our 
constitutional framework, namely health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do think it is an opportune motion for us to reflect, as the 
member who spoke just before me did, on the way in which the 
government has managed the cash transfers to the provinces under 
the health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the leaders debate during the 1993 election the current 
Leader of the Opposition asked the then Leader of the Opposition 
and now Prime Minister specifically what the Liberal Party's 
commitment was to the level of federal transfer payments for 
health care.  He asked the now Prime Minister if he would keep 
transfers at the current level and the now Prime Minister 
responded “I said yesterday in replying to Monsieur Bouchard 
that I promise that they will not go down and I hope that we will 
be able to increase them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister running for office in 1993 
representing the entire Liberal Party of Canada and all of its 
candidates said that he hoped that they would be able to increase 
them and the health care transfers would not go down.  Those were 
the words he said then, words that were echoed in Liberal red 
book one which spoke about maintaining the health care transfers 
at their current level. That came from the leader of a party that 
spent four and a half years in the House, from 1988 to 1993, 
relentlessly criticizing the then government for having cut the 
very same health transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has excelled in its acts of political hypocrisy. 
Among those many acts of political hypocrisy, from the GST to 
free trade, to NAFTA, perhaps the greatest one of all was for the 
Liberals to trumpet their traditional Liberal commitment to 
health care funding but then proceed, once having taken the reins 
of power, to ruthlessly slash those transfers not by 5% or 10% 
but by 35%.  It was done unilaterally and without consultation or 
input from the provinces that have to deliver those programs. The 
$7 billion cut in those transfer payments was passed on to the 
provincial premiers, governments and legislatures who have to 
administer those programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few things get me more upset than hearing Liberal MPs and 
ministers rise in this House and criticize people like Premier 
Harris of Ontario for his management of health care.  I hear 
Liberal MP after Liberal MP criticize Premier Harris for having 
increased health care funding by $1 billion, all the while 
reducing taxes for Ontarians, while absorbing $2 billion in 
transfer cuts for health care imposed by the federal government. 
The hypocrisy is truly shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite know that it is shocking.  I had the great 
misfortune of attending the Liberal Party of Canada convention 
down the street. I sat and listened to the resolutions brought 
before the floor.  Very few of them were debated of course. 
After all, the delegates to that convention know that policy for 
the Liberal Party is made in the dark backrooms of the Prime 
Minister's office and not in the front rooms of any convention 
where the public could actually monitor it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals were asking  “Why did we cut these health care 
transfers?”  That is a good question because there are very few 
members of this House who are more in favour of cutting 
government spending than I and my colleagues in the Reform Party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that when it comes to cutting government spending we 
have to create priorities.  This government chose to make the 
wrong priorities.  When it came to the cash transfers from the 
CHST the government cut $7 billion instead of cutting $7 billion 
out of subsidies to crown corporations, out of subsidies to 
businesses, out of regional development programs, out of hundreds 
of millions of dollars in grants and handouts to the Liberal 
Party's favourite special interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the choice the Liberal Party made.  Yes, it had to cut 
spending, but no it did not have to cut it from what was the 
highest priority program area of all Canadians, which is public 
health care. This government should really hang its head in shame 
when it comes to considering what it has done to health care in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I find so remarkably galling is to hear the 
Minister of Health and his cabinet and caucus colleagues 
pontificate about the great Liberal commitment to the federal 
role in health care and that they are going to penalize those 
provinces if they do not keep in compliance with the Canada 
Health Act.  They are going to protect health care they say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have the Liberals done?  They and the previous government 
together have managed to cut the federal government's role in 
cash transfers for health care from 50% of total acute health 
care spending to under 20%.  The Liberals talk tough but they 
have taken away the only leverage they have with the provinces to 
ensure compliance with the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that that is necessarily a bad thing.  I believe 
as I said in speaking to Motion No. 1, in the principle of 
subsidiarity, in the principle that says the level of government 
which is the lowest and the closest to the people is generally 
the best order of government to deliver services. Senior levels 
of government, more distant and remote levels of government such 
as the federal government ought only to be involved in the direct 
delivery of programs when such delivery needs to be done on a 
national basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that MLAs, MPPs and MNAs and provincial governments 
elected by provincial voters and provincial taxpayers know better 
than we do in this remote place in Ottawa how to deliver quality 
health care, public access to universal health care than we do. 
We ought to give them the flexibility to make the choices they 
need to reform health care, to ensure quality health care for all 
Canadians.  That is why this motion would simply extend the 
meddling influence of the federal government in a field which the 
Fathers of Confederation in their wisdom properly attributed to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I hope that if any of the Liberals speak on this 
motion they will explain to us, to their constituents and to all 
Canadians how it is they can talk about increasing health care 
transfers in this budget by $1.5 billion when in fact it is not 
an increase at all.  It is a reduction in the decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the old days when the Tory government would say 
that it was cutting spending when in fact all it was doing was 
reducing the increase.  Now the Liberals say they are increasing 
spending on health care when all they are doing is reducing the 
decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not just look at these numbers straight and simple? 
After the so-called $1.5 billion reinvestment in health care in 
this recent budget, health care transfers, cash transfers to the 
provinces will still be less than they were four years ago when 
the Liberals took power in 1993.  The Liberals have abdicated 
their ability to dictate health care policy to the provinces.  We 
say let the provinces be responsible and accountable to their 
taxpayers, to the real consumers of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I call on my hon. colleagues to defeat this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of brief comments I would like to add on to the issues the 
hon. member for Calgary Southeast just touched on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT85"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT85"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on a few points that were brought forward by the 
member for Calgary Southeast because I think they are very 
prudent points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the discussion that has been going on today and over 
the course of the weekend at the Liberal national convention 
surrounded the issue of health care.  Under the current mechanism 
where the government has raised the ceiling for health care from 
$11 billion to $12.5 billion one would think that was actually 
trying to inject more money back into one of our true priority 
areas, that being health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in my province of New Brunswick over the next few years the 
transfer payments with respect to the CHST will actually plummet 
from $322 million down to $311 million.  Health care is going to 
be cut in the province of New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government.  If it seriously wants to make 
health care a priority under the mechanism for the funding of 
health care, not only should three provinces have increased 
funding under the CHST—those being British Columbia, Alberta and 
Ontario—but the other provinces should have increased funding as 
well.  I am speaking on behalf of my home province of New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am making this point in a very constructive fashion.  When the 
government revisits the issue in terms of what its true priority 
areas are it should revisit the amount of money being allocated 
toward some of the smaller provinces, including New Brunswick, to 
ensure that we have more money for health care and not less. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion 
before us this afternoon is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall table in the House of Commons, in September of 
each year commencing in the year 1998 and ending in the year 
2003, a report assessing the adequacy of the cash portion of the 
total entitlement referred to in subsection (3) to sustain the 
principles of the Canada Health Act— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat indicated that he and his caucus 
were opposing the motion because they believe that these kinds of 
programs should be delivered closer to the people, a point that 
was added to a few moments ago by the member for Calgary 
Southeast.  The member for Medicine Hat said that otherwise there 
would be protesters on the lawns of the legislatures.  That is 
not why the member for Winnipeg North Centre is introducing this 
motion this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My adopted province is the province of Saskatchewan. 
Saskatchewanians feel very strongly about medicare.  We feel it 
is our gift to this country.  The CCF introduced medicare and 
funded it on its own back in 1962.  It was then adopted as a 
national program by the Liberal Party under Prime Minister 
Pearson in 1967 and was funded by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada assistance program and established programs 
financing appropriate funds were delivered to ensure that we had 
a national quality health care program from coast to coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing, to our chagrin, in recent years is that the 
health care program is becoming more and more strained at the 
edges.  To go back to the province of Saskatchewan, with the 
sharp reductions in federal funding to health care beginning in 
1994 and onward, the Saskatchewan government has backfilled every 
cent that the feds have withdrawn from health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previous members have pointed out, all that is being 
suggested now is that the cuts are not going to be as deep as 
were originally envisaged.  The government is not actually 
putting more money in, it is just not taking as much out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that we backfilled in Saskatchewan.  The budget was 
tabled last week.  Once again health tops the agenda in terms of 
the amount of money that is spent.  It is now $1.7 billion in a 
province with just over one million people.  It is a significant 
amount of money.  It makes it very difficult for the province to 
do some of the other things that need to be done because this 
government is not living up to its financial obligations in this 
area and has not done so for several years.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a serious debate going on in this country 
whereby larger, wealthier provinces which do not have such a 
large percentage of their budget going to health care are going 
to begin, in effect, to thumb their noses at the carrot and stick 
approach—mostly the stick approach—taken by Ottawa.  The 
carrots are getting increasingly smaller and the provinces will 
say that they will go it alone, that they will provide the kind 
of health care they think is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will be the end of any kind of national health care program 
in this country.  We will be into a two-tier system, which is, I 
suspect, really why the Reform Party is opposing this motion 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have acknowledged and given credit where credit is due in 
this House.  The government has set, over recent years, deficit 
targets to reduce and now eliminate the deficit in this country. 
I believe I am correct in saying that the government is also 
establishing debt reduction targets.  We fail to see why it is 
hesitant to introduce a target for health care; to do an annual 
check-up on health care, if you will, to see how it is performing 
and what is required to ensure that this gift from Saskatchewan 
continues well into the next century throughout the country. 
There is not only a debt and deficit problem in this country, 
there is also a social deficit that we are very concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare has been the declaration that all Canadians deserve 
quality health care, regardless of how much money they have.  We 
have said consistently that a family's health should never have 
to depend on a family's wealth.  That is the point we are trying 
to make here, except we will substitute province or territory for 
family.  The wealth of a province or a territory should not 
depend on the health of the people who live in that province or 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the Liberal government has cut health care by 
almost $4 billion.  It has opened the door to privatization, as I 
have suggested.  It has indulged in restricted service and user 
fees that signal the arrival of a two-tier system:  the best care 
for the rich and a lower quality of care for everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has cut the promotion of good health, including programs to 
prevent domestic violence, to control the spread of AIDS and even 
to discourage smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three quarters of all health care costs are funded through 
medicare or other provincial plans.  Many important services 
remain unavailable to those who do not have private insurance or 
who are not eligible for provincial or territorial programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act requires provincial health plans to be 
universal, accessible, portable, comprehensive and publicly 
administered in order for them to receive federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the National Forum on Health and the Canadian Health 
Coalition have determined that the current $11 billion, which 
will increase to $12.5 billion, minimum payment to the provinces 
promised by the Liberals is simply not enough to maintain those 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know all of this.  Canadians who were at the Liberal 
Party convention last weekend know this as well.  That is why 
they are concerned about the direction or the lack of direction, 
the inability or the refusal of this government to set targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that members opposite should be supporting this very 
reasonable proposal put forward by the member for Winnipeg North 
Centre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly 
the major points that I think need to be made were made by the 
member for Medicine Hat and the member for Calgary Southeast. 
However, I cannot help but comment on what the last member, the 
member for Palliser, mentioned when he said that Saskatchewan was 
one of the few places that had put all its money back into health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother happens to live in Saskatchewan.  I left Saskatchewan 
around the medicare issue. 
Certainly the complaints I have heard on returning to 
Saskatchewan indicate something quite different from what the 
hon. member just told the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key issue is the fact that the federal government has cut 
30% plus from health care transfers to the provinces.  While it 
has done that it has kind of hid under a rock when it comes to 
taking any credit for the cuts in health care and has left it 
totally to the provinces to bear.  I will not say whose 
responsibility that is, but Canadians should be aware of the fact 
that this federal government cut those massive amounts of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality we need to be aware of—and certainly they tell us 
this every time we meet—is that our constituents are extremely 
concerned about health care.  They want the very best of health 
care for themselves and their families.  We would be missing the 
boat if we did not take that message to heart and did not 
seriously look at what we should be doing to maintain and improve 
our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter whom we talk to, they would agree that the health care 
system was in desperate need of reform.  There were too many 
hospitals.  There were too many duplications of services, too 
many boards and too many extremes in the health care system.  It 
did need some major reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that in creating that system the people 
closest to the system know what they want.  They know the 
standards they want and they should be the ones to make that 
determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had better get on record as mentioning that the biggest 
threat to our health care and our social programs is the $45 
billion interest payment we waste every year.  While we will 
spend $12 billion plus on health care this year, we will spend 
$14 billion on education and $22 billion on pensions.  We do not 
get any services for the $45 billion in interest payments.  Until 
the government recognizes and deals with that we will not solve 
that social problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also look at how to fix the health care system.  The 
bottom line is not that we spend more money.  We need to 
reorganize our spending and all the waste that occurs in Ottawa. 
That would provide lots of money to fix the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would propose to the House and to the provincial governments 
that would be delivering this service that they involve health 
care providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a fairly frequent basis I meet with nurses in my constituency 
who tell me the sorts of things that are wrong with the health 
care system.  They know as they are delivering that service on a 
daily basis.  I also meet with doctors in the constituency.  They 
know exactly what is wrong and exactly what needs to be fixed. 
The most important people of all, the grassroots people, also 
know what they want and what they want the health care system to 
deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than asking the federal government to do this, we should 
let health care givers as well as the people receiving the 
service be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feds cannot expect to control the health care system when it 
gives less than 20% of the funds.  They cannot control the system 
if they do not provide the money.  It is a matter of put up or 
shut up and a matter of opposing this amendment because we do not 
need more federal involvement.  We need to get the provinces and 
the people receiving the service involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, health care is the number one issue.  I think all 
of us agree with that.  Getting the very best health care is what 
we should be concerned about. 
In terms of who can deliver that, I am putting to this House that 
it is the actual care givers in the community, the provincial 
responsibility and the people who are getting the service who 
will make it all happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Motion No. 3 put forth by the NDP member is something we 
do not agree on.  I am not going to support it.  As my colleagues 
mentioned before very eloquently, it speaks to a larger 
involvement in the federal government in an issue, according to 
our Constitution, that is a provincial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get to the heart of this problem on health care. 
It is something that has been used for decades as a political 
football in this country.  If you defend the status quo you are 
looked on as being a white knight, a hero.  This government and 
other governments have done that.  They have said they champion 
the Canada Health Act, that we have the best health care system 
in the world and anyone who disagrees with that is bad, an enemy 
of the poor, an enemy of health care and wants a U.S. style 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolute and utter nonsense.  The cold hard reality in 
our country today is that health care is not being provided to 
Canadians at a time when they need it.  In our country from coast 
to coast, from emergency departments to operating theatres, from 
old age homes to chronic care facilities, to out-patient 
departments, Canadians are not getting their health care when 
they need it.  The reality is there simply is not enough money in 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly cuts have had to be made.  They were made wisely and 
they were made judiciously.  Cuts are continuing to be made 
today. They are not cutting the fat out of the system, they are 
cutting into the muscle and bone of a system that Canadians rely 
on in their time of greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you are sick and realize that our health care system is not 
there for you, you do not have time to politically lobby because 
you are fighting for your life.  This government and previous 
governments have stayed with the status quo in spite of the fact 
that Canadians are not getting their health care system when they 
need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are old and in need of a new hip and are in severe 
pain wait a year and a half for that new hip.  People who need a 
simple 20 minute surgery on their wrist wait nine months to get 
that surgery. People who are elderly and need new knees will wait 
nine months to a year.  People who need bypass surgery can wait 
six months. People are waiting two days to get into the intensive 
care unit while they sit in emergency departments or, worse, they 
sit waiting for a bed in a cold, dark hallway in a hospital. By 
any stretch of anyone's imagination that is not health care when 
a person medically needs it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a myth put forward that we have enough resources in the 
system that people are getting their health care when they need 
it and the Canada Health Act and its five principles are being 
upheld.  That is completely untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not getting their health care in a timely fashion. 
Furthermore, if you have the bucks, you get the health care. 
Twenty-five per cent of the money that is spent today in health 
care comes right out of the pockets of people.  It is money that 
is paid by them to get health care.  If you do not have the 
money, you do not get the service. These involve surcharges for 
physiotherapy and they involve extra charges for a wide variety 
of services.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most graphic example of the multi-tier system we 
already have. If a person is injured and on workers compensation, 
the government will take their money. The workers compensation 
board will pay to have that person put at the head of the line in 
a public system to get his or her surgery done ahead of somebody 
else who is not injured in a WCB case.  In other words, 
preferential treatment is given to those on WCB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system we have today favours the rich and compromises the 
poor.  The examples I gave demonstrate very clearly that 
Canadians are not getting their essential services when they need 
them, which demonstrates again that the Canada Health Act 
principles are being violated in a most egregious fashion.  In 
the rich country we have today we do not have to accept that. 
There are solutions and ways to make a better Canada Health Act 
system, a made in Canada health act system that enables Canadians 
to get their health care when they medically need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need more resources in the system.  Critics from the other 
side say there is enough money in the system right now.  When 
pressed for answers, they can only say that we need to put more 
efficiencies into the system. No other specifics are forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to face the facts that not enough resources are in the 
Canada Health Act today to provide for the services Canadians 
need.  When we look into the future, when we see a population 
that is getting older as demographics change, when we see how few 
people will be in the workforce, we recognize there will be fewer 
resources available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we provide the resources to provide the essential 
services Canadians need without raising taxes, because raising 
taxes is not an option?  If we amend the Canada Health Act to 
allow private clinics and private services where only private 
moneys are exchanged, completely separate from the public system 
and where there is no interchange, then people would have an 
option.  They would be able to access the public system when they 
chose to and access the private system when they wanted to. There 
would be no mixing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That way two separate systems would be created and there would 
be more money on a per capita basis in the public system, as some 
people would take some of their services into the public system. 
In other words, there would be more money in health care in 
Canada without raising taxes.  The people who chose to be in our 
public system would get better health care than we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it unequal?  Yes.  I would argue that first of all we have an 
unequal system today.  Is it not better to have an unequal system 
that provides for better health care access for all people than 
the system we have today that provides for unequal access, 
particularly for the poor? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rich will always be able to get health care when they need 
it, for they go south.  In fact, we spend over $1 billion a year 
south of the border for health care that should be given here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to amend the Canada Health Act, if we were to allow 
private clinics and private medical services in an entirely 
private setting where there is no mixing of the private and the 
public, not only would people have a choice, not only would all 
Canadians have better access to health care, but we would also 
bring patients from the United States to buy their services here 
at two-thirds the price of services in the United States.  This 
would provide for employment, nurses, physicians and health care 
personnel.  In other words, we would be able to drag a huge 
amount of capital from the United States and have it spent in 
Canada, which would dramatically create a lot of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to throw the baby out with the bath water.  We do 
not want an American style health care system which is deplorable 
in many ways.  We want to make sure that people in our country, 
particularly those who are poorest, will have access to health 
care when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good health care is not waiting a year and a half to see an 
orthopaedic surgeon.  Good health care is not waiting nine months 
to have a 20 minute operation so a person can go back to work. 
Good health care is not being turfed out of hospital 24 hours 
after having a baby.  Good health care is ensuring that Canadians 
get the health care services they require in an affordable 
fashion and in a medically necessary and timely fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just a few 
weeks ago, I had the opportunity to question the government on 
the asbestos issue, asking the government why it was not showing 
more haste in lodging with the World Trade Organization a 
complaint about France's ban on the use of asbestos on French 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer I was given was definitely insufficient, and that is 
why, this evening, I am giving the government the opportunity to 
make up for it by clearly stating its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us briefly review the facts. First, a commission of the 
European Council recently recommended that asbestos be banned 
throughout Europe, in all European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say that the consequences of such a ban would 
adversely affect our asbestos industries, particularly those in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, last week, we learned that the federal government 
would rather go the diplomatic way and that it had signed with 
five other asbestos producing countries, namely Russia, Brazil, 
South Africa, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, a memorandum stating the 
merits of this substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find somewhat strange and regrettable at the same time is 
the fact that, as the Bloc Quebecois critic for natural 
resources, to this day, I still have not received any document 
explaining what this document signed with five other producing 
countries is all about. Therefore, I welcome all the more this 
opportunity, tonight, to ask that the government provide us with 
information, so that we know exactly what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that, last week, Belgian reporters toured 
the Bell mine in Quebec. Here is what they had to say. Peter Van 
Dooran said “Either the Belgian people are crazy to be afraid of 
asbestos or the people working in this mine are.” Obviously, they 
were impressed by what they saw. We have a good case on the 
asbestos issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also quote what a departmental official said: “The issue 
is not whether or not Canada will file a complaint before the 
WTO, but when”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will conclude with a quote from another Belgian 
journalist, who said: “Three or four years ago, asbestos was not 
an issue in Belgium, but Canada's representations are one year 
too late”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government dragged its feet on the Pacific salmon 
issue and on the Atlantic cod issue, and it has imposed quotas on 
softwood lumber. Canada has shown a flagrant lack of courage. It 
would be possible to go before the WTO. The smallest countries in 
the world will be respected through the mechanisms put in place 
by the WTO. 
If Quebec were a sovereign state, we would have gone before the 
WTO a long time ago to ensure that our asbestos is protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to hearing what the government has to say 
on this subject. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the objective of the 
Government of Canada in partnership with Quebec, the industry, 
unions and local communities is to maintain market access for 
asbestos.  The Prime Minister raised this issue last fall with 
his counterparts from the U.K. and France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue was also raised on a number of occasions between 
senior Canadian officials and their counterparts. Our officials 
held exploratory discussions on WTO options with interested 
partners as early as September 1997.  On November 26 and again on 
January 28 the deputy minister for international trade held 
subsequent consultations with these same partners.  On February 
10 the deputy minister also held a conference call with 
stakeholders to discuss the next steps on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was made clear that the Canadian government would prefer to 
seek a resolution of this issue through diplomatic means as 
opposed to moving right now to the WTO.  We are prepared to go to 
the WTO at the right time but we prefer to continue our crucial 
dialogue with the French government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We organized gatherings of producers in London in December and 
in Brussels in January and February to work on a common strategy 
for the defence of chyrsotile asbestos.  We believe that 
scientific data favour a controlled approach.  A recent European 
technical paper raises questions about the growing use of 
asbestos bans in Europe as a means of protecting public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada attaches the highest priority to protecting export 
markets for chyrsotile asbestos and we will pursue every option 
available.
