</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal plan to register firearms is shot full of 
holes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Prime Minister vowed registration would cost 
taxpayers $85 million.  Now documents reveal that the justice 
minister overshot that target, spending a cool $81 million in the 
last four months and the finance minister recently tried to plug 
another hole by pouring in $46 million. To date, gun registration 
has cost a staggering $330 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 13% of law-abiding owners have licensed their firearms.  To 
meet the deadline, the CFC must process 2,630,000 applications 
and that does not include all the criminals the minister is 
convinced will line up to register. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Go figure.  Liberal math at its finest.  Why does the minister 
not put a gun to their useless legislation and just blow it away?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to draw hon. member's attention to an atrocity committed against 
the Armenian people on April 24, 1915. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of 1.5 million Armenians lost their lives at the hands 
of the Ottoman Empire.  This year marks the 85th anniversary of 
the Armenian genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hellenic Republic was the first NATO member to denounce this 
crime against humanity, followed by Belgium, which passed a 
resolution acknowledging the Armenian genocide in 1998.  A

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This coming Saturday in Montreal I will have the honour to 
represent the Prime Minister at a ceremony organized by the 
Armenian National Committee commemorating the victims of 1915. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we choose to name it a tragedy, a massacre, an ethnic 
cleansing or a crime against humanity, it remains an historical 
event that today would be described by the United Nations as 
genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all my colleagues to join Canadians of Armenian origin 
in remembering the victims of the first genocide of the 20th 
century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on Sunday, April 9 I attended ceremonies in Toronto to 
commemorate the 16th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many the name Katyn has little meaning.  However, to the 
Polish community the name is associated with a crime without 
parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 17, 1939 forces of the Soviet Union crossed the 
eastern border of Poland on the pretence that they would protect 
the Polish people.  More than 15,000 Polish officers were sent to 
three Soviet secret police prison camps.  On April 13, 1943 
authorities discovered the mass graves of approximately 14,500 
Polish officers in the Katyn forest, a short distance from 
Smolensk, Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 to create an 
atmosphere where the truth would finally be revealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To honour the memory of the Katyn victims, memorials have been 
built and wreaths will be laid on April 13 because these are 
crimes so odious that even the lapse of time cannot lessen their 
impact.  Katyn is not only a Polish issue but one that affects 
the conscience of the entire world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one year ago today the voters of Windsor—St. Clair 
faced a dilemma: go to the opening game of the Detroit Tigers or 
stay at home and vote for a new member of parliament.  Wisely, 
they stayed at home and hit a home run when they elected a 
personable rookie to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some concern that the fourth party might squeak 
through because the late, great Shaughnessy Cohen was a tough act 
to follow.  But our candidate did not strike out, and he powered 
past the token NDP opposition.  I am positive that our colleague 
from Windsor—St. Clair has inherited some of the true grit from 
Shaughnessy whose spirit and tenacity is very evident in her 
successor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Windsor—St. Clair can rest assured that 
their member of parliament has more than lived up to their 
expectations by going to bat on their behalf time and time again. 
He is upholding the Liberal values of a caring, compassionate 
commitment to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to our colleague on his first anniversary.

and awareness to find a cure.  As a result, millions of dollars 
have gone to cancer research.

Mr. Speaker, on April 1, one inmate at Joyceville Institution in 
Ontario was found carrying a concealed knife.

potential for use in terrorism.  However, prison management 
refused to conduct a thorough search on, guess what, grounds of 
violating prisoners' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minor riot erupted that Saturday night, so the warden finally 
decided to lock inmates in their cells while he sent two teams of 
eight guards to search the entire place, including possessions of 
the 475 inmates.

the prisoners when one realizes that the search uncovered needles 
for illegal drugs, escape equipment, contraband used to brew 
alcoholic beverages and more than 60 weapons, including over 20 
homemade knives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's lesson for the solicitor general is that the safety 
rights of guards and well-behaved prisoners should get a higher 
priority than those who continue breaking the law even while they

Minister of the Environment keeps saying that a reduction in 
greenhouse gases is one of his government's priorities. 
However, oddly enough, at the meeting of environment ministers 
in Otsu, Japan, Canada remained on its own, dissociating itself 
from Germany, Italy, France, Great Britain, Japan and Russia by 
refusing to set 2002 as the deadline for the ratification of the 
Kyoto Protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is certainly not in the lead pack. 
It had made a commitment to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 
6% of their 1990 level by 2010.  But the federal government is 
doing nothing.  If it continues to do nothing, the figure Canada 
will achieve by 2010 is a 35% increase, contrary to its 
international commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of limiting itself to awareness programs and voluntary 
action, Canada must specify its reduction objectives.  Really,

visiting our Canadian peacekeepers in the region, of whom we are 
all so very proud.

has appointed a deputy commissioner to ensure that the

<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has made many of these same complaints year 
after year.  Canadians rely on the RCMP for a lot more than just 
photo ops with tourists.  Millions of Canadians count on them as 
their only local police force.  CPIC, which is the nationwide 
tracking program for criminals, is run by the RCMP and police 
forces right across the country depend on it.  Law-abiding 
citizens are threatened because of this government's management 
and the lack of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the solicitor general again, why is he and his government

They are a very competent, well recognized police force in this 
country and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to the RCMP.  That is why last 
year, before the auditor general's report, we committed $115 
million to ensure that CPIC was upgraded.  This government will 
ensure that all of the recommendations made by the auditor 
general will be followed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

circumstances I think our RCMP are as competent as they can be, 
which is in spite of this government, certainly not because of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of priorities.  This government could protect 
public safety, but instead it buys fountains for Shawinigan, a 
high priority I am sure.  We would think the government would do 
everything it could to protect the taxpayers who fund its very 
grant giveaways.  It is sort of like being smart enough to guard 
the goose that lays the golden egg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general, time after time, has listed serious 
concerns about the RCMP's ability to protect Canadians.  Why is 
it that boondoggles are more important to this whole government 
than the safety of Canadian citizens? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

from the Reform Party, and it is not about the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP is a competent police force, which is well respected in 
Canada and around the world and will continue to be so.  That is 
why this government gave $810 million in new money to ensure that 
the RCMP has the resources to ensure the safety of the people of 
Canada.

guy who had an armed intruder in his own home would place a 
higher priority on the RCMP.  Yet the auditor general now 
confirms that the RCMP's criminal tracking abilities are 
seriously hampered and that its computer system is in desperate 
need of an upgrade.

the Government of Canada was wrong, and it cost us $20 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general says that the government has

Centre, CPIC, is down 880 hours a year.  It is handling 10 times 
the volume it was designed for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, 20,000 law enforcement officers across Canada have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

$810 million of new money to the office of the solicitor general 
and $584 million of that to the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before that, $115 million were allocated to the very system that 
my hon. colleague speaks about, the CPIC system.  We are well

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Steve Hindle, the president of the union that represents 
Revenue Canada auditors said, “When head office officials 
overrule assessments by Revenue Canada auditors and doubles a tax 
credit by tens of millions of dollars, it reeks of political 
interference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  Why is it 
that every time auditors look into the government's management of 
programs, they turn up political interference?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions 
of Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if Canadian Alliance members 
were well informed about the research and development tax credit 
program, they would know that this is an administrative program 
managed by the public service and based on the expenses incurred 
by all the companies asking to participate in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there cannot be any political interference in such a 
process. That is very clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think political interference is everywhere. HRDC 
employees are advertising and taking out radio ads complaining 
about political interference.  The RCMP is investigating in the 
Prime Minister's riding.  Now the president of the union for 
Revenue Canada auditors is saying that there is political 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the minister again, why is it that every time there 
is an audit, it turns up the smell of political interference?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and 
Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the 
Regions of Quebec), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously that member 
of the Reform Party must be dreaming.  There is no political 
interference into the question of the management of the SR&ED tax 
credit. As I said in French, it is quite obvious that it is an 
administrative process based on claims by corporations.  We look 
at expenses and then they are given the credits.  It is as simple 
as that.  It is impossible to be politically involved in such a 
process.

Mr. Speaker, the government tabled species at risk legislation

Mr. Speaker, the member is correct at least to the extent that 
the bill was tabled yesterday. The bill will be sent to committee 
and he will find there is ample opportunity for examination and 
any suggestions he may wish to make for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to him that the proposals he has made here would 
deny a right that people have had since the Magna Carta. In other 
words, when one's livelihood or land is affected by government 
action, one has a right to be heard. The socialists over there do 
not seem to think that right is valuable; they do not seem to 
think it is useful.  We on this side of the House think it is 
important.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians want to see endangered species protected 
from extinction and they do not want to entrust that task to 
Liberal cabinet ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if the beluga whale is in danger of extinction 
because an aluminum company is polluting its habitat, the beluga 
whale should be protected, period.  This bill leaves the door 
wide open for that company to lobby Liberal politicians not to 
protect the beluga whale and its habitat.  This is wrong and the 
Liberal chair of the environment committee, that famous 
socialist, says it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister, despite his comments, admit the error of his 
ways and allow scientists, and not politicians, to decide which 
species are to be protected?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we now have these apologists for socialism 
explaining their position.  They are saying that no matter what 
the social or economic impact on any scientific listing, nobody 
will listen to the people, the industries or the communities 
affected.  It will all be done by scientists and the scientists 
will not even take that into account either.  They are only 
considering the one question of whether the animal is endangered.

the fact that the British Columbia Court of Appeal did, on June

today—to invoke section 33 of the charter of rights and

of appeal decision and reinstate subsection 4 of section 163.1 of

For security reasons, details regarding the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, RCMP, protective operations for the Prime 
Minister cannot be revealed. The RCMP is unable to provide 
modification costs, gas mileage and the specific number of 
vehicles utilized. However, the RCMP can state that the total 
operation package, which incorporates the yearly average fuel 
consumption and the maintenance program, costs approximately 
$17,722.50. This amount also incorporates the fuel and 
maintenance of the Prime Minister's limousine. Therefore, the 
total fuel and maintenance program for the past seven years is 
approximately (7 x $17,722.50) $124,057.00. The average purchase 
price of RCMP escort vehicles is approximately $25,000.00 and 
these vehicles are replaced on a rotational basis every four 
years.

<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-32, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 28, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak today at second reading of Bill C-32, the budget 2000 
implementation omnibus bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 is an historic budget.  As the Minister of Finance 
stated in his budget speech, not only is the deficit a matter of 
history, but the government is now projecting its third, fourth 
and fifth balanced budgets in a row, something that has not been 
done in nearly half a century. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are other tangible reasons why budget 2000 
represents a dramatic advance for Canada and Canadians.  Budget 
2000 addresses the fundamental challenges we face as a nation, 
challenges we identified in last October's fall update. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as the minister said, the government will continue to 
provide sound fiscal management.  He said that the days of 
deficits are gone and they are not coming back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government will lower taxes to promote economic 
growth and to leave more money in the pockets of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in order to ensure equality of opportunity, the 
government will make investments to provide Canadians with the 
skills and knowledge they need to get the jobs they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the minister said that together we will build an economy 
based on innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians can be proud of the government's record. However, 
as the minister also stated, it is not a record on which we are 
prepared to rest.  Canadians do not want to dwell on the past; 
they want to focus on the future.  Indeed, that is the message of 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, to paraphrase the minister, the government's challenge 
now is to build on this newfound strength.  The government is 
sticking to its plan of sound fiscal management, lower taxes and 
investing in skills, knowledge and innovation.  Through this 
plan, the quality of life for Canadians and their children will 
be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quality of life runs the gamut, from access to quality health 
care and post-secondary education, to healthy children, secure 
families and vibrant communities.  It also includes sharing the 
benefits of economic prosperity with those who need support the 
most.  That is what we are doing through this budget omnibus 
bill, implementing the budget's proposals to strengthen 
post-secondary education and health care, and to help children 
get the best possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are debating today contains 10 measures that were 
announced in the 2000 budget.  Three of these measures are of 
particular importance to the nation's well-being, starting with 
our health care and education systems, continuing through better 
assistance to families with children, and finally, financial 
assistance to students.  To provide these benefits on time, these 
measures must be passed before the House adjourns this summer.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this bill amends the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act to authorize payment of the $2.5 billion 
increase to the Canada health and social transfer for health 
care and post-secondary education to a trust in support of health 
and post-secondary education. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Income Tax Act is amended to increase child tax 
benefits and to provide indexed GST benefits as of July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill amends the Canada Student Assistance Act to 
ensure uninterrupted delivery of student loans after the current 
agreement with financial institutions expires on July 31, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again let me emphasize the timing for the passage of these three 
measures is crucial.  If we delay, it is Canadians who will 
suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remaining seven components of the bill may not face the same 
deadline.  They are, however, just as important for millions of 
Canadians and for the effective and efficient operation of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures would amend the Employment Insurance Act and the 
Canada Labour Code to double maternity and parental leave to one 
year.  They would increase the foreign property content limit in 
RRSPs and other deferred income plans.  They would amend the 
Canada pension plan to allow provinces to redeem securities given 
to the CPP investment fund.  They would amend the Special Import 
Measures Act to bring Canadian countervailing duty laws into line 
with recent changes to the World Trade Organization agreement on 
subsidies and countervailing measures.  They would enable certain 
first nations to levy a 7% tax on sales of fuel, alcohol and 
tobacco products on reserve.  They would amend the Excise Tax Act 
to preserve the GST-HST base and avoid tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to discuss each of these 10 measures in some 
detail.  I will begin with the $2.5 billion increase to the CHST. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister summed up the reasons for this measure in his 
budget speech when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success that we have achieved as a nation has come not only 
from strong growth but from an abiding commitment to strong 
values: caring, compassion and insistence that there be an 
equitable sharing of the benefits of economic growth. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason the first announcement in the first budget of 
the 21st century was that we would increase funding for 
post-secondary education and health care.  These are the highest 
priorities of Canadians and they are ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 legislates a $2.5 billion increase in the Canada 
health and social transfer.  These funds will be distributed to 
provinces and territories on a per capita basis and paid into a 
trust from which they can draw down over four years, beginning as 
soon as the bill is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the federal government transfers 
approximately $40 billion a year to the provinces and territories 
through three major programs to help them provide vital services 
to Canadians.  The first program is the CHST which supports 
health care, post-secondary education, social assistance and 
social services in the form of cash and tax transfers.  It is 
also the largest federal transfer.  The second is equalization 
which enables less prosperous provinces to offer comparable 
public services to those in other areas of the country.  The 
final one is the territorial formula financing for public 
services in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has already acted three times before now 
in the 1996, 1998 and 1999 budgets to strengthen the CHST. 
Combined with the value of tax transfers, total CHST in 1999-2000 
was $29.4 billion higher than in 1993-94.  With this new 
supplement it will be close to $31 billion for 2000-01. 
That also incorporates the $11.5 billion added to the CHST in the 
1999 budget.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This additional support will provide an additional $1 billion in 
fiscal year 2000-01 and $500 million a year in each of the 
following three years for post-secondary education and health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, combined with the 1999 budget $11.5 billion 
investment this means that the cash component of the CHST will 
reach $15.5 billion in each of the next four years, an increase 
of almost 25% from the 1998-99 level.  If Canadians compare that 
with the rhetoric of the opposition parties, they will understand 
the government's huge commitment and priority attached to health 
care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, this supplement will be paid into a third party 
trust and the provinces and the territories will have the 
flexibility to draw on it as they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should be passed quickly in order to get much needed 
money into the health care system to deal with the pressing needs 
of Canadians.  Some Canadians might wonder, if there is money on 
deposit sitting there that is not being implemented by the health 
care system in certain provinces, why the government would do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are responding to the very urgent needs of Canadians in the 
health care system.  Whether that is in emergency rooms, waiting 
lists for surgery or whatever the case may be, the provinces have 
the flexibility to draw on it as they need it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key measure in this bill concerns child tax benefits. 
As the minister emphasized in the budget, “assisting families is 
not only the smart thing to do, it is the right thing to do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no doubt, he went on to say, that one of the best 
things we can do is to leave parents with more money at the end 
of each month to invest in their children's well-being. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 does exactly that.  To fully protect taxpayers 
against inflation the budget restores full indexation of the 
personal income tax system effective January 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most important change to the Canadian tax system in 
more than a decade.  Indexation has applied to personal income 
taxation for inflation but only when it reached over 3%.  It has 
been that way since 1986.  Indexation will particularly benefit 
middle and low income Canadians because of bracket creep and the 
fact that these taxpayers generally receive the benefits under 
the child tax credit and the GST credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, the Canada child tax benefit is a key 
element of federal assistance to families.  It has two 
components: the Canada child tax base benefit for low and middle 
income families and the national child benefit supplement for low 
income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further help families with the added expense of raising 
children, the bill also increases Canada child tax benefits by 
$2.5 billion annually by the year 2004.  The government's goal is 
to increase the maximum Canada child tax benefit for the first 
child to $2,400 by then through fully indexing the Canada child 
tax benefit, increasing both the base benefit and the national 
child benefit supplement beyond indexation, increasing the income 
thresholds at which the base benefit begins to be reduced and the 
national child benefit supplement is fully phased out, and 
lowering the reduction rate for the base benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes will bring the maximum Canada child tax benefit 
for the first child to $2,056 in July 2000 and to $2,265 in July 
2001, well on the way to the five year goal of $2,400 which I 
just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second child the goal is to raise the maximum Canada 
child tax benefit to $2,200 in 2004.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that benefits to middle income families will be 
substantially increased.  For example, a family with two children 
with an income of $60,000 will see its Canada child tax benefit 
more than doubled from its pre-2000 budget level of $733 to 
$1,541 by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall these increases by the end of five years will bring the 
Canada child tax benefit to more than $9 billion annually, of 
which $6 billion will go to low income families and $3 billion to 
modest and middle income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that low and middle income Canadian families are 
depending on the Canada child tax benefit increases and indexed 
GST benefits this coming July is another reason to pass the 
legislation without delay. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is taking the necessary steps to ensure 
that students who need student loans when they go back to school 
in September will receive them in time.  This bill ensures that 
money will be available to students in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background, the Canada Student Loans Program has 
played an important role in expanding access to post-secondary 
education since 1964. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through loans and other financial assistance totalling over 
$15 billion, approximately 2.7 million students have been helped 
since then. 
Annually, the program helps over 350,000 needy Canadian students 
access post-secondary education. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now Canada student loans have been administered and 
delivered on behalf of the federal government by financial 
institutions, an arrangement that will expire on January 31, 
2000.  Bill C-32 ensures that the Canada student loans program 
will continue to serve students after July 31 of this year. Money 
will be available for student borrowers and there will be no 
interruption in service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Government of Canada is to provide the finances 
necessary to support the Canada student loans program.  Loans 
will be administered by service providers on behalf of the 
federal government.  Service providers, which many financial 
institutions currently use to administer their own loan 
portfolios, are private companies that have the capacity to 
administer loan portfolios including student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service providers would sign an agreement with the government to 
establish loan accounts, maintain contact with the borrowers and 
administer the loan once the borrower begins repayment.  I want 
to assure students that there will be no significant changes to 
the program.  Students who have already consolidated their loans 
and are repaying them will not be affected at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before hon. members ask about students who have difficulty 
meeting their repayments, may I remind them that the federal and 
provincial governments have greatly increased the assistance 
available to borrowers having difficulties repaying their loans. 
One thing is for certain.  This new program will be in place for 
those students who need financial assistance next fall.  I am 
sure hon. colleagues will support this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 budget also does a lot for parents of newborn and newly 
adopted children.  It extends parental leave under the employment 
insurance program and makes benefits more flexible and 
accessible.  At present, including the standard two week waiting 
period for benefits, the EI program provides up to six months of 
maternity and parental leave benefits for new parents.  That is 
15 weeks of maternity benefits for recovery from child birth and 
10 weeks of parental leave available for both adoptive and 
biological parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum amount of child related leave will now be doubled to 
one year.  This will be done by increasing parental leave to 35 
weeks, which can be claimed by either parent or divided between 
them.  Combined with 15 weeks of maternity leave and the standard 
two week waiting period, the amount of child related leave will 
be one full year.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, maternity and parental benefits will be made more 
accessible by lowering from 700 to 600 the number of insurable 
hours that must be worked to be eligible.  Parents will be 
eligible for benefits with as little as 12 hours of work a week 
over the course of a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, parents will have greater flexibility in choosing 
whether one or both of them spend time at home with a new child. 
Only one waiting period will apply rather than two as is 
currently the case. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, parents will be allowed to work part time while 
receiving parental benefits in the same way as regular EI 
claimants.  This will help mothers, if they and their employers 
choose, to gradually return to the workplace following their 
maternity leave, and also enable parents to maintain their 
skills and work contacts while taking parental leave. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, income earned while receiving parental benefits will be 
treated the same as for regular EI benefits.  Parents can earn up 
to 25% of their weekly benefit or $50, whichever is higher, 
without affecting their EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these parental leave benefits changes will positively 
impact some 150,000 families each year at an estimated annual 
cost of $900 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canada Labour Code is being amended so that 
employees in federally regulated workplaces will have their jobs 
protected during the extended parental leave period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move along now and discuss some of the other 
measures in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is one measure that affects registered 
retirement savings plans, RRSPs, and registered pension plans, 
RPPs, which are the primary source of retirement income for 
middle income Canadians.  Several entities, including the House 
of Commons finance committee, the Senate banking committee and 
the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, have asked the 
government to reconsider the current level for the limit on 
foreign property investments in registered pension plans and 
RRSPs.  As a result, to provide better opportunities for 
Canadians to diversify their personal retirement savings 
investments through RPPs and RRSPs, the foreign content limit on 
those investments will be raised from 20% to 25% for 2000 and to 
30% for 2001.  These increases will also apply to the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the CPP, there is an amendment in the bill that 
directly affects the plan.  Let me explain the background to this 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following extensive public consultations, federal and provincial 
governments agreed in 1997 on major changes to the Canada pension 
plan which were enacted by parliament in 1997 and brought into 
effect in 1998.  The changes are expected to sustain the Canada 
pension plan throughout the aging of the population and the 
retirement of the baby boom generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contribution rates are increasing in a phased manner.  This will 
create a sound, adequately funded plan whose earnings can help 
pay for future benefits.  The Canada pension plan provides a 
basic level of earnings replacement on which tax assisted private 
pension plans and RRSPs can build. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important changes in 1997 supported by all Canadians, 
perhaps with the exception of the Canadian Alliance party, was to 
enhance the returns to plan members by investing in the market 
funds not needed immediately to pay for benefits.  A fully 
independent investment board operating at arm's length from 
government manages these market investments in the best interests 
of CPP plan members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP legislation allows all provinces to borrow from the CPP 
for terms of up to 20 years.  The proposed amendment before the 
House is to allow the provinces to prepay their obligations to 
the Canada pension plan in advance of maturity and at no cost to 
the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces asked for this change and federal and provincial 
finance ministers agreed to it at their meeting last December. 
This will provide more flexibility for provinces that are 
enjoying fiscal surpluses as the economy booms and they are 
looking for ways to reduce their debts.  It also means that more 
funds will be transferred to the CPP investment board and 
invested in the market at higher expected returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning now to the Special Import Measures Act, SIMA, these 
amendments will bring Canadian countervailing duty laws into line 
with recent changes to the World Trade Organization agreement on 
subsidies and countervailing measures.  The WTO subsidies 
agreement contains provisions that rendered certain foreign 
subsidies that satisfied very specific criteria immune from 
countervailing duty action.  These non-actionable subsidy 
provisions lapsed on December 31, 1999 as a result of the failure 
of WTO countries to agree to their extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Bill C-32 allow for the suspension of 
provisions in SIMA that implement these non-actionable subsidy 
provisions into Canadian law.  In addition to bringing Canadian 
countervailing duty law into line with these recent changes to 
the WTO subsidies agreement, these amendments will ensure that we 
are not treating our trading partners more favourably than they 
are treating us in countervailing duty investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 also addresses first nations taxation.  This year's 
budget marked the fourth time that government has indicated its 
willingness to enter into taxation arrangements with interested 
first nations.  As a result, the Cowichan tribes, the Westbank 
first nation, the Kamloops Indian band and Sliammon first nation 
all levy a tax on the sales of certain products on their 
reserves.  Personal income tax collection and sharing agreements 
with the seven self-governing Yukon first nations are also now in 
effect. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will enable 13 first nations, all listed in the 
schedule that accompanies this bill, to levy a direct 7% 
GST-style sales tax on fuel, alcohol and tobacco products sold on 
their reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency will collect the first 
nation sales taxes and the federal government will vacate the 
GST room where the first nation tax applies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, interested first nations could be added to the 
schedule through an order in council without the need for a 
legislative amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Excise Tax Act is also amended in the bill.  Among GST and 
harmonized sales tax registrants there is generally a high degree 
of voluntary compliance when it comes to reporting or remitting 
tax.  However, instances can arise where allowing a registrant 
the usual remittance period can put these tax revenues at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency has reason to 
suspect tax evasion in these circumstances, it has been powerless 
to proceed with assessment and collection action.  The bill 
provides the Minister of National Revenue with the authority to 
take immediate collection action to protect revenues in these 
circumstances.  The minister can now apply ex parte without 
notice for judicial authorization to assess the registrant before 
the normal due date and to take the necessary collection actions 
to recover the money.  The registrant will have the right to 
apply for a judicial review of the court's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the Income Tax Act contains a 
similar provision relating to the collection of income tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am confident that hon. members can be counted 
on to pass this legislation with haste.  Canadians across the 
country are awaiting the benefits.  We all know why this bill has 
to be passed quickly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the CHST increase must be enacted to get much needed 
money into the health care system to deal with the pressing 
needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in order for the child tax benefits and indexed GST 
benefits to come into force on July 1, this legislation has to be 
passed before the end of June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And third, the bill must be passed in time for the student loan 
program to be available for students entering school in 
September. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that one telling fact about the 2000 budget was the 
respect it was accorded from hon. members opposite and from 
Canadians in general.  In fact, question period in this Chamber 
the day following the Minister of Finance's speech was revealing 
by how few questions were asked about the budget. Hon. members 
opposite along with Canadians across the country knew that the 
2000 budget delivered what the Minister of Finance promised: help 
for low and modest income families with children, help for the 
health care and post-secondary education systems, and help for 
students who want to pursue higher education. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All are measures that build on the new-found strength the 
minister talked about in the budget and which are designed to 
improve the quality of life of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a new budget signalling a new beginning for a new 
century.  Canada greeted the 21st century with a new fiscal 
record and a renewed hope for improving the quality of life for 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that cares and this is a government that 
has a social conscience.  The 2000 budget measures in this bill 
reflect this.  I urge my hon. colleagues to accord speedy passage 
to this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise and debate Bill C-32, an act to 
implement budget 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my friend across the way who has just spoken that if he 
has a conscience, not just a social conscience, he must feel a 
little twinge after what he said.  He said some things that 
really need to be responded to.  I shall respond to them first 
and then I shall deliver the body of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way suggested that the official opposition, 
the Canadian Alliance, did not ask questions about the budget the 
day following its introduction in the House by the finance 
minister. That is very telling; in fact, it speaks volumes about 
the government, because during that question period the day after 
the budget was introduced, every single question we asked was 
about waste in government and about the scandal in human 
resources development. Somehow my friend across the way thinks 
that is not part of the budget, that the money which is 
allocated, $15 billion a year toward grants and contributions, 
somehow is not part of the budget.  I guess the Liberals assume 
it is part of Liberal play money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians pay a lot of taxes to fund the $15 billion which the 
government uses so unwisely.  I would suggest to my friend that 
he may want to consider his definition of what constitutes 
questions on the budget, because I would argue very strongly that 
Canadians who have to pay those taxes, I can guarantee, feel that 
it is part of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment in an organized way on budget 2000, on Bill 
C-32, and I am about to do that.  My friend across the way said 
that we should pass this piece of legislation with haste.  I 
would argue that if we did that, we would be passing it with 
waste.  As I mentioned a minute ago, there is a lot of waste in 
what the government does, and I am going to elaborate on that in 
a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to argue that to support the government on Bill C-32 
would simply be to entrench the terrible habits the government 
has:  the habit of underachieving, the habit of not addressing 
huge problems which stand in front of it every day.  Instead the 
government tries to paper them over and throws some money at 
them.  It spends all kinds of money on reports and studies to 
give people the impression of action, when that is not the case 
at all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind my friend across the way of the huge problems that 
face Canada today.  We have a crisis in health care.  Canadians 
across the country are required to line up, queue up to get basic 
services.  This is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a country that spends a lot of money on health care 
already.  However, do we hear the government talking about making 
some basic reforms so that we can ensure the money gets down to 
the patients, that we have patient centred health care? 
Absolutely not.  Do we see a government that is willing to be 
upfront and honest about how much money it actually delivers to 
the provinces for health care?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact my friend just spent a long time talking about what they 
have as done for health care.  The simple fact is that in 1995 
the cash transfers for health care were $18.8 billion.  In the 
next several years it will rise to $15.5 billion.  In the interim 
they cut it down as low as $12.2 billion.  They cut the heart out 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  What about tax points? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  I hear my hon. friend.  In 1977 the 
federal government agreed with the provinces to give back their 
tax points.  Tax points are tax revenue earned in the provinces 
which goes to the federal government and is yielded back to the 
provinces.  That agreement was made 23 years ago.  There were no 
strings attached.  No one said they had to go to a particular set 
of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At what point does that money belong to the provinces?  It is 
not part of the cash transfer which the federal government 
originally agreed to give to the provinces to ensure that things 
like health care and higher education were funded.  Absolutely 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were honest for a moment, it would acknowledge 
that cash transfers have dropped dramatically for health care. 
Even with the money it put back in, it is nowhere near where it 
was.  The government has come nowhere near addressing the 
problems in health care.  All it can do today is pick fights with 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness the problems with Ontario.  Witness the problems with 
Alberta right now.  Its solution is to go to the level of 
government that provides the services the moment it tries to do 
anything different.  The provinces are trying to find some way to 
ensure that important health care services actually deal with the 
needs of their own people.  The federal government at every 
opportunity dumps all over them and threatens to withhold 
transfers.  The only level of government which is showing any 
kind of innovation is the provinces.  The federal government's 
answer is to hit them with the big hammer every time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is dealing with the problem.  I would argue 
it is trying to shift the blame to the provinces.  I would argue 
it is an abdication of its responsibility as the senior level of 
government in Canada.  It has completely abdicated its 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an example of where budget 2000 and Bill C-32 fall 
short of addressing a fundamental need of Canadians, which is 
good and timely health care.   It is not happening and Bill C-32 
did not address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are other examples of huge problems which the government 
did not address?  If we go through the entire budget, we find 
piles of documents which are probably eight inches thick.  Do we 
ever see a mention of problems in human resources development, of 
the mismanagement of funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If chief financial officers for a private sector company 
produced an annual report which neglected to mention the type of 
mismanagement the government is involved in human resources 
development, in Indian affairs, in EDC, and in the scientific 
research and experimental development tax credits, which the 
auditor general reported on yesterday, and did not report on 
those things, they would be fired so fast it would make their 
heads spin. 
They would probably be in big trouble with securities regulators 
for producing a report that was so misleading.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government even feel a twinge of conscience about 
producing a budget that does not mention these things?  Not at 
all.  There was not a mention in my friend's speech across the 
way of the problems in human resources development and the other 
problems that have plagued the government over the last several 
months.  When people are not told the whole story it is the same 
as telling a lie.  I would argue that the government is not 
telling Canadians the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the other problems that are not addressed in 
the budget?  Let us consider the fact that in Canada we have seen 
disposable income virtually sit stagnant for 10 years.  It has 
finally risen about 5% over the last 10 years.  Does the budget 
deal with that problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way will say that they brought in $58 
billion in tax relief, but when we break it down is it really $58 
billion?  Let us go through the numbers.  My friend talked about 
the child tax benefit.  Anybody who pays attention at all would 
argue that it is not a tax break, that it is a social program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the definition of a tax break?  It is when the money is 
left in people's pockets in the first place.  It is not taken out 
and redistributed so that some people get it back and some do 
not.  That is not a tax break.  That is a social program.  That 
is what we do with the guaranteed income supplement and old age 
security.  Those are social programs.  They are not tax cuts.  We 
cannot call that a tax cut.  It is a social program of about $7.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about bracket creep?  My friend mentioned that they 
eliminated bracket creep and reindexed the tax system for a tax 
break of $13 billion.  Is that really a tax break?  All that does 
is cancel future tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy the government has done it.  It picked the pockets 
of Canadians for a long time and milked the cow dry.  That does 
not mean all of a sudden when it quits doing it that the 
government should be credited for cutting taxes.  It simply is 
not the case.  It is a cancellation of future tax increases of 
$13 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third trick it used was to suggest that if it cut taxes with 
one hand and raised them with other somehow people would be 
better off.  That is exactly what it does.  Let us consider that 
over the next few years $29.5 billion will come out of the 
pockets of taxpayers to pay for higher payroll taxes, Canada 
pension plan taxes in particular.  That largely erases any 
benefit from income tax cuts that the government would bring in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the net effect?  Out of that $58 billion in tax relief 
emblazoned in headlines the day after the budget Canadians will 
get $8 billion.  That is the real tax relief.  When we break that 
down per taxpayer, it means $100 in his or her pocket a year.  It 
should not be spent all in one place, that $2 a week.  We could 
go to Starbucks and it would be spent in a week.  That is not 
very much tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my friend across the way that it is not simply a case 
of ensuring we put more disposable income in people's pockets, as 
vital as that is.  It is also a situation where we have to remain 
competitive with our neighbours to the south and other 
competitors from around the world.  I will get into that in more 
detail in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the government's failure to deal with the 
problems in health care.  It has failed to deal with the mess in 
human resource development and the general mismanagement of 
government.  It has failed to deal with ensuring that people have 
more disposal income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk for a moment about Canada's competitive position. 
Does it really deal with some of the problems that plague Canada 
when it comes to our competitiveness?  I would argue that it does 
not.  While this debate is occurring to some degree in academic 
circles, and certainly the business community is vitally 
interested and has taken the government to task a number of times 
over this issue in the last little while, I would argue that it 
is not happening in public often enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for it to start to happen.  I also think many 
Canadians are starting to see the connection between high taxes, 
high corporate taxes, lots of regulation, obtrusive governments, 
lack of competitiveness and back sliding against our 
international competitors.  It truly is a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about our situation when it comes to 
competitiveness, especially in relation to the United States, our 
biggest trading partner and certainly the country we are in most 
competition with.  Taxes in Canada, even after all the 
government's changes or its alleged tax relief, are still going 
to be far higher than they are in the United States.  Why is that 
a problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a problem for a number of reasons.  First, if our taxes 
are higher, those who are trying to run businesses charge more 
for their products and services.  They need to charge higher 
prices in order to pay the taxes they have to deliver to 
government.  That makes them uncompetitive.  It also means that 
shareholders start to say there is a point at which it may make 
more sense for them to move to some place which rewards 
initiative.  In many cases, unfortunately, that means moving to 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great ironies involves a company called Clearly 
Canadian that manufactures a soft drink.  It had to move out of 
British Columbia to Seattle.  Clearly Canadian is now clearly not 
Canadian.  It was driven out by the tax policies of the 
government.  It is essentially a tax refugee and we see thousands 
of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see all kinds of young people who were educated at 
taxpayer expense at Canada's wonderful universities and colleges 
being lured south to greener pastures by American firms, 
typically, but also by other firms from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  In some cases people take a look at their tax 
position in Canada and at the tax position in the United States 
and say they would be better off in the United States.  I am not 
suggesting that is the only reason, but it is a reason for a few 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have much higher taxes than those in the United 
States, we do not have the economic activity which breeds the 
type of economy that produces jobs like the economy in the United 
States.  Right across the border in the United States there has 
been much faster growth over the last several years.  As a result 
it produces far more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment in Canada is at 6.8%, the lowest unemployment rate 
in 18 years.  Historically we are doing okay, but internationally 
we are so far behind that it is unbelievable.  Our rate is 70% 
higher than it is the United States.  It is also about 70% higher 
than our average until about the mid-1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With unemployment levels at that rate and when people can go 
across the border and find jobs very easily, they tend to go 
where the jobs are.  When they go to the United States not only 
are there more jobs but the jobs pay better because businesses 
are desperate to find people and offer more money.  When people 
are hired there they find they have more money left over because 
taxes are lower.  Of course they end up being paid in American 
dollars which are worth more than Canadian dollars. When people 
go south of the border they win economically in four different 
ways.  There is a huge attraction to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not to criticize people for being disloyal like 
the Prime Minister would do.  It is not to bury our heads in the 
sand and say the brain drain does not exist.  The answer is to 
learn from the mistakes of the past, learn from other countries 
around the world, heed the advice of people affected by it and 
start to make some changes which ensure that the economy grows 
not as fast as the economy of the United States but much faster. 
It is to ensure that we remain competitive and get ahead of other 
countries so we can attract back some of this talent and 
investment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to become a magnet for talent and we want to become a 
magnet for investment.  Bill C-32 simply does not do that.  It is 
like saying “We will grudgingly make some changes”, but it does 
not catapult us into the lead, and we are critical of the 
government because it does not recognize the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider that between 1988 and 1998 Canada's output per capita, 
which is a reflection of the standard of living, grew by 5% over 
a 10 year period.  In France it grew three times faster.  In the 
United States and Australia it grew four times faster, in Norway 
six times faster, and in Ireland eighteen times faster.  The 
government should be ashamed of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should be a wake up call.  When it is punishing the people 
because of inaction and the inability to make the connection 
between public policy decisions and good outcomes for the people, 
it should be ashamed if it cannot make that connection.  Too 
often this government uses the tools of government to make 
decisions that not only do not benefit its people, but which 
ultimately benefit the Liberal Party of Canada.  There are so 
many examples of that, I could stand here all day and talk about 
them.  That is a shameful legacy which this government is leaving 
behind and there is much human wreckage in the wake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do when we are confronted by this sort of situation 
in this great country, Canada, with its huge and bountiful 
natural resources and wonderful human capital?  We have an 
educated nation.  We have a nation of immigrants, people who have 
brought their experience from around the world to Canada.  We 
have a history of being innovative.  We are entrepreneurs.  These 
are our great natural advantages.  What do we do to enhance those 
advantages, to ensure that we get the most from what we already 
have?  What are the public policy decisions that we put in place 
so that we can really mine our great resources, both natural and 
human?  I would argue that the very first thing we should do is 
to stand out of the way of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first decisions any government should ever make is to 
understand its own limitations.  It should put limits on itself, 
because governments cannot do everything.  They do some things 
well.  They keep the peace well.  They can be very helpful if 
they remove the barriers to trade.  They can be very helpful even 
in redistributing income.  I will concede that.  However, once 
governments go beyond that they get into very dangerous 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record of this government is littered with examples of that, 
whether it be human resources development or the scandals that go 
on in departments like Indian affairs, or even industry, or the 
revenue agency's handling of the scientific research and 
experimental development tax credits, which is absolutely 
shameful.  When governments go beyond that and try to pick 
winners in the economy we have problems.  As the finance minister 
said—and I am sure he wishes he had never said 
this—“Government cannot pick winners, but losers sure can pick 
government”.   Truer words were never spoken.  I just wish that 
he would listen to his own advice because this government 
intrudes into the economy far too much and the result is that 
Canadians are worse off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government takes a dollar from the hands of the 
taxpayer and puts it into the hands of a bureaucrat or a 
politician, we end up with the taxpayer, an entrepreneur, a 
business person, a homemaker, a student, being $1 worse off and 
somebody else, someone who is a friend of the government, doing 
much better.  That is a lousy trade-off.  It stinks.  Many times 
I would argue it is nothing but pork barrelling and patronage, 
and it must come to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do now, once we have decided to limit government, to 
put some clear restrictions on what government should do?  We 
start to take the resources that are freed up as a result of that 
and put them into things which people care about.  What are those 
things? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we suddenly reallocated money from all of those grant-giving 
agencies, what would we do with it?  We would put it into higher 
education.  Absolutely.  That is something which people value. 
They want an educated populace in the country.  They understand 
that one of the things we can do to help make our country more 
productive and allow people to live more enriched lives is to 
ensure that they have an education.  We support that.  That makes 
more sense than giving it to the human resources minister to hand 
out to cronies and friends, which is crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could put it into health care.  We have argued that we have 
to do a lot more than put money into health care, but when it 
comes down to making choices about how money should be spent by 
government, I think most Canadians would concede that money is 
better spent ensuring that we get medical services when we need 
them instead of pouring it into a fountain in the Prime 
Minister's riding, which is some of the crazy stuff that goes on 
through human resources development and other agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make those kinds of fundamental choices.  Let us 
reallocate.  We believe that there is $5 billion to $10 billion 
in the existing envelope of spending in government today that 
should be reallocated from things that are counterproductive and 
low priority, and sometimes outright pork barrelling and 
patronage, and put into things that people care about.  I have 
named a couple of them, higher education and health care, to name 
just two.  That is the first thing we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, once we have established that, we would ask what we 
would do with the approximately $150 billion which will 
accumulate in the next five year period over and above the amount 
we spend this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my friend across the way that in the November fiscal 
and economic update the finance minister laid out a projection of 
what the surplus will be that will accumulate to the government 
over the next five years.  When we get through all the 
gobbledegook, it amounts to roughly $150 billion.  What would we 
do with that $150 billion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that after we have reallocated the waste that already 
exists in government into things that people care about, like 
health care and higher education, we should take the great bulk 
of it and start to give it back to the people who earned it in 
the first place.  It is their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you realize how hard Canadians work today to look after their 
families?  It is incredible.  People work very hard.  All they 
want is to be able to keep the money they earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it unbelievable that if a person is making $10,000 in 
Canada today as a single person, that person has to pay federal 
income tax.  All these people want is the dignity that goes with 
knowing they can support themselves and their families, if they 
have a half-decent job and are working a reasonable amount of 
time.  That is all they ask.  They are not asking a lot.  They 
just want to keep the money they earn.  They are willing to pay 
their share of taxes, but they are not willing to pay taxes to 
all kinds of things that most people regard as wasteful and 
corrupt.  That is what happens too often today in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do this?  The Canadian Alliance has a solution.  We 
call it solution 17.  It is a program of major tax relief and 
important, if not sweeping, tax reform.  It has three major 
elements.  The first element is that we would raise the basic and 
married exemptions, both, to $10,000.  Those people who are 
making $10,000 in income would no longer have to pay any tax.  A 
two income family, each making $10,000, would still not have to 
pay any income tax because they would have a basic exemption of 
$20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing we would do is extend a deduction of $3,000 per 
child to every family in Canada with children.  A single income 
family of four would not pay any tax on the first $26,000 of 
income. 
A single parent with one child would pay no tax on the first 
$23,000.  If there were two children, there would be no tax on 
the first $26,000.  This would help people at the low end.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Library of Parliament when it ran our proposal 
through its modem, it found that 1.9 million low income Canadians 
would no longer have to pay any tax to the federal government, 
which is an outstanding social benefit of solution 17.  It is not 
the only one.  I will say more about some of the other social 
benefits of solution 17 a bit later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is that if we got rid of the 5% surtax, got rid 
of the 29% rate and the 26% rate, we would be left with one rate 
of 17%.  What would that mean to people if they had the big hike 
in exemptions, the deduction for children, for every family in 
Canada with children, and the dropping of the rates to 17%? 
Obviously it would mean a huge tax cut for every Canadian.  There 
would be 1.9 million low income Canadians lifted right off the 
tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends have asked if there would be a tax cut for people at 
the high end.  Absolutely.  Would there be a tax cut for people 
in the middle?  Absolutely.  In fact, if someone was making 
$50,000 a year, in a single income family of four, the tax bill 
would drop by $5,000 in the fifth year of our program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends have asked about somebody earning $200,000.  That 
person would also do very well.  We want to reward people who 
work hard and have in many cases the skills and the options to 
leave this country, as many of them have already done.  We want 
to keep them here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The top 1% of income earners in Canada produce 17% of all the 
tax revenue in Canada.  We want to keep those people here.  The 
top 10% produce around 50%.  The top 10% are people who earn more 
than $50,000 a year.  Do we want to alienate those people and 
drive them out?  I do not think so.  Those people bring in a lot 
of revenue for government, so let us provide incentives for them 
to stay in this country.  Those people are the entrepreneurs, the 
innovators, the people who form the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point this out because it is a pretty important point 
when we are talking about the new economy.  In 1999 on the 
NASDAQ, the new technology stock market exchange in the United 
States, there were 165 initial public offerings for new Internet 
companies.  On the TSE over the same period in Canada, one year, 
1999, there were four.  There were 40 times more in the United 
States.  Why is that?  Because the United States does not punish 
people for being entrepreneurial.  It encourages an environment 
where there is capital accumulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Venture capital is extraordinarily important in ensuring that 
new companies get off the ground.  In 1995 there was 12 times 
more venture capital in the United States than in Canada.  By 
1999 the gap had grown to 18 times more venture capital in the 
United States than in Canada.  Obviously there are incentives for 
people in the United States to save and pool their capital.  In 
Canada it gets taken by the taxman.  We have such high taxes in 
Canada that people cannot save money to invest in new ventures, 
as an example.  That is why the size of Canada's new economy, on 
the biotechnology side, is so tiny compared to that of the United 
States, even on a per capita basis.  It is not a 10th, it is like 
a 50th of the size.  The reason for that is, we do not have the 
proper incentives in place to grow the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a chance with Bill C-32 and the budget to 
address this fundamental problem, but it completely ignored it. 
Solution 17 recognizes that we are in global competition.  We 
understand that.  We would address these things by rewarding 
people for taking a risk and not punishing them for the crime of 
making a good living.  There is nothing wrong with that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe in the politics of envy.  I do not think we 
should say because they have done well, we will now punish them. 
That is crazy.  People should pay their fair share. Under 
solution 17, people at the high end would pay more than their 
fair share. Let me give an example of what I mean by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under solution 17, a single income mom earning $24,000 would pay 
about $170 in taxes.  Compare that to someone who makes $1 
million, an income which is 40 times more than that of the single 
income mom.  That person's tax bill would be 1,000 times more, 
and would pay about $170,000 in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how anyone could say that that system still is not 
progressive.  Obviously it is.  Does it punish people at the high 
end?  No it does not.  It drops the rate at which they have to 
pay and encourages them to stay.  In fact it will draw people 
back. I believe that solution 17 would help Canada become a 
magnet for talent and capital, just like Ireland has become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned Ireland a few minutes ago.  Ireland is an amazing 
success story.  Between 1988 and 1998, the output per capita grew 
18 times faster than it did in Canada. How did it do that?  What 
did it do?  It did a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland put more money into education.  We acknowledge that and 
we are arguing we should do that as well.  We probably should go 
with some reforms because we do not believe just throwing money 
at things is the right way.  We think it is appropriate to put 
some money into the transfers to the provinces for health care 
and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing Ireland did was it bought some labour peace.  It 
had had problems with squabbling between the private sector 
unions and employers.  It bought some labour peace and that is a 
good thing, but that is not nearly the problem in Canada that it 
is in Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing Ireland did which had the biggest impact was it 
dropped taxes.  It dropped corporate taxes dramatically.  It 
dropped personal income taxes and capital gains taxes.  What was 
the impact?  As I mentioned, its standard of living has jumped 
through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland is a country that for 150 years lost population.  Its 
biggest export was people.  Canada was one of the great 
beneficiaries of that problem.  In fact, my own ancestry can be 
traced back to Ireland.  Ireland was such a poor country for so 
darn long but it finally figured it out.  It understood there was 
a correlation between smart public policy and prosperity, 
something our government cannot seem to get through its head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Ireland figured that out, what happened?  Now its 
population is growing for the first time in 150 years.  The 
situation is that Ireland with 1% of the population in Europe now 
gets 20% of all the new investment in Europe.  So much money is 
pouring in that it now provides its citizens with free university 
education.  It has a growth rate which is through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That could be Canada in North America.  We could be what Ireland 
is to Europe.  We could be the place where all the money flows 
to.  The United States does not have to be seen just as a big 
competitor.  It can be seen as a big market, as an opportunity. 
Why do we not mine it by making proper public policy decisions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so mired in the past.  It seems so unwilling 
to change even when problems are so obvious and confront the 
government every day.  It boggles the mind.  It is still caught 
up in a 1970s time warp where it thinks it can intervene in the 
economy, and pick winners and losers.  Ultimately it picks losers 
and the result is we are all impoverished for it.  That is so 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my friends across the way that Canada has a long 
heritage and history of having a standard of living which was 
higher than that of the United States.  As the industry minister 
would point out, that is no longer the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John McCallum of the Royal Bank pointed out in a recent paper 
that Canada's standard of living which was once the same as that 
of the United States is now down to two-thirds.  He said that if 
we keep going the way we are going, in another five years we will 
be down to 50%.  Well, thanks very little. 
I am not interested in that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize the problem and make the public policy 
decisions that will get us out of it, not to make us equal with 
the United States but to move us beyond the United States.  Why 
can Canada with the resources it has not be the most prosperous 
country in the world?  We would be helping not only Canada and 
our citizens if we did that but we would be helping the world 
because that prosperity goes everywhere.  Those are the types of 
public policy decisions we should make. Solution 17 is part of 
that.  I have talked a bit about solution 17.  I want to talk 
about some of the other changes that we would make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of our overall fiscal plan is to take the entire 
contingency reserve and the entire prudence adjustment the 
government itself suggests we need over the next five years and 
use it to pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken a very tepid approach to debt 
repayment.  When it first came to power the debt was $480 billion 
which became a debt of $583 billion and now it is down to $577 
billion.  We should pay down that debt more aggressively. Some 
revenues are starting to come in.  Let us make hay while the sun 
shines.  Our plan would pay down $34 billion over the next five 
years compared to the government's $15 billion, a big difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we would also put another $15 billion into spending, $1 
billion a year over the next five years. This would ensure that 
there is money for things that people care about:  health care, 
education, defence, the RCMP, infrastructure.  Those are 
important things, a lot more important than some of the wasteful 
things the government spends its money on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is coming to a close and I regret that.  I could 
say a lot more, but I will be very satisfied with the 40 minutes 
I have been allotted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
When the member for Medicine Hat speaks about solution 17 and 
taking the working poor off the tax rolls, it bursts hope in the 
hearts of Canadians from coast to coast.  I ask for the unanimous 
consent of the House to extend his time so he can elaborate more 
on that part of solution 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is hardly a point 
of order.  It might have been a point of order if the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre was asking him to expand on his Irish 
heritage.  Nevertheless we will put the question to the House. 
The hon. member for Calgary Centre has asked for the unanimous 
consent of the House to provide another 15 minutes for the member 
for Medicine Hat to expound on his thesis.  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  I appreciate my friend's intervention, Mr. 
Speaker. I will simply conclude by saying that the Canadian 
Alliance believes that solution 17 and the larger policies that 
we propose could propel Canada to be a world leader, a place 
where people from all over the world will come because they will 
be so attracted by the prosperity and the incredible standard of 
living that we have.  I would urge my friends across the way to 
be mindful of this the next time they think about preparing a 
budget.  Let us hope that they do not get a chance to.  Let us 
hope we have an election before then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply say in closing that as the Canadian Alliance is feeling 
a new birth here, I encourage people across the way who are very 
interested in solution 17 and to what we have talked about to 
find out more about it by accessing our website Canadian 
Alliance.ca.  Of course we would love to hear from the public if 
they are interested in this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House and my friend across the way for his 
indulgence over the last 40 minutes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant

be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Halifax West, Veterans Affairs and the hon.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise this afternoon to address Bill C-32, the Budget 
Implementation Act, 2000, at second reading. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public did not know what to think of a government that has 
budget surpluses. We heard many things, because budget surpluses 
give ideas to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some wondered “How will the government strike a balance? Will 
there be tax reductions? Will the debt be lowered? Will social 
transfers finally be increased?” Unfortunately people did not 
realize that the government is secretive and that the Minister of 
Finance stashes money away like a squirrel. The sharper ones 
would have expected this budget to contain a number of somewhat 
misleading elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discovered quite a while ago that the government had much 
bigger surpluses than anticipated, surpluses estimated at 
$137 billion. This is not to mention the waste that we keep 
hearing more and more about when we take a closer look at what 
is going on in the government's administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance once again mislead the public with 
truncated budget forecasts. Indeed, most observers agree that 
the surpluses will be between $115 billion and $150 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois did a conservative estimate of the surpluses 
and came up with the amount of $137 billion over a five year 
period. This is a huge amount. It is clear to us that the 
Minister of Finance could have done a lot more, particularly in 
terms of tax reductions and transfers to the provinces for 
health, education and post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the matter of transfers for health care 
and education, because there is nothing or almost nothing for it 
in this budget.  The minister is releasing $2.5 billion for 
transfers to the provinces.  This amount is both inadequate and 
a one time measure.  In other words, the amounts allocated for 
health care and education are pitiful, when in fact these areas 
have been shown clearly to be priorities for taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet the federal government has plenty of money to invest 
where it feels like.  We need only think of recent events, which 
are ongoing in the House, in connection with the use of the 
grants made by the Department of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it has enough money for various foundations and 
other organizations parliament has no control over, such as 
$6.8 billion this year in order to waste money in the Department 
of Human Resources Development—$1.3 billion annually—and to 
distribute $1.4 billion in contracts without tender.  Despite 
all, the government still refuses to invest where it cut, namely 
in health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize the 2000 budget in terms of transfers to the 
provinces, $240 million is being made available for health care 
in Quebec, enough money to run the health care system for two 
days.  And yet the government has the means to do a lot better 
with the accumulated surpluses.  The $2.5 billion announced for 
the provinces is far from enough.  Quebec's share will be 
$240 million for 2000-01 and $120 million for 2001-02. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it know that hospitals cost, for Quebec alone, $3.7 billion 
a year, or $100 million a day. 
Clearly, the amounts proposed by the federal government will not 
enable the provinces to address the problems in their respective 
health care networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learn as well, in budget 2000, that the $2.5 billion will be 
charged to 1999-2000.  The budget for 2000-01 is charged to 
1999-2000.  This is a ridiculous level of social transfer, frozen 
over four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the minister is continuing his old practices of 
transparent management.  There has been a lot of talk of clarity 
this spring. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again this is a matter of playing with figures in order to 
convince us that Ottawa cannot afford to give back to the 
provinces and to Quebec what the Liberals have taken from them 
in recent years.  Quebec comes out a major loser in this entire 
political masquerade.  It has, in fact, borne the brunt of over 
50% of total cuts to the Canada social transfer since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, including the tax points under the CST, the Minister of 
Finance tells us that, between 1999 and 2004, the total transfer 
will be $156 billion.  This increase is, however, solely the 
result of the value of the tax points which, for the same 
period, go from $14.9 billion to $17.2 billion. 
It must be understood, however, that these tax points are not 
transfers; they are revenues belonging to the provinces and to 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, moving on the social housing, there is a considerable 
difference between $54 million and $1.7 billion.  The Bloc 
Quebecois called upon the federal government to inject $3 
billion  into an infrastructure program, $1.7 billion of which 
was for social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These demands were the outcome of a broad public consultation, 
yet once again the demands of Quebecers have been ignored.  This 
government is so arrogant as to totally ignore the unemployed, 
although they contribute more than $5 billion yearly to the 
minister's surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although his colleague, the Minister of Labour, promised a 
concrete action plan for the homeless, the plan she unveiled 
with much fanfare in December 1999 contains no tangible measure 
for improving the situation.  Yet the need is there, the public 
can see it clearly, and social housing can also be improved in 
various ways according to need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the government's inaction was immediately met with a wave of 
protest.  In all this, it appears that the pressures from the 
Toronto area for short term assistance for the homeless won out 
over the real needs of the homeless and those with inadequate 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the early 1990s, those with inadequate housing have lost 
out to budget cuts and the freeze on budget increases for social 
housing.  Since 1994, the government has been withdrawing from 
housing completely.  In fact, no longer do we hear anything 
about new social housing. 
The federal government no longer talks about helping those whose 
housing is inadequate.  All it does is maintain existing 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the very early 1990s, it was estimated that budget cuts would 
generate savings on the order of $620 million between 1991 and 
1996.  Taking the exponential effects of these cuts into 
account, that is close to $3.5 billion over nine years that has 
not been spent on this sector.  Anyone visiting our ridings or 
taking a look as they travel through this or other provinces can 
clearly see that there are urgent needs in the area of social 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way $268 million over five years—or $54 million 
annually—will do the trick.  This is ridiculous.  For Quebec, 
this comes to less than $20 million a year. 
These budgets will not even be allocated to social housing as 
such but, rather, to renovation projects. I understand that, 
after years of not investing, the immediate priority is to 
renovate, because housing units have fallen into disrepair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One per cent of the budgets, or $1.6 to $1.7 billion more per 
year, would have been a reasonable investment to provide 
adequate social housing. While these amounts would not have met 
all existing needs, they would have allowed us to help the 
social housing program to adjust to today's realities and to the 
realities in the ridings and municipalities that have a real 
need for such housing units.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he delivered his budget speech, the Minister of Finance 
referred to “Secure social programs that recognize that real 
progress is made by reaching for the top, not racing to the 
bottom”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this to say that, for his government, social housing and 
those who live in inadequate housing are at the bottom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this overview of the 2000 budget, I also want to discuss 
the indexing of tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, we say finally, because the Bloc Quebecois has 
been asking for that measure since 1993. 
Since 1994, the federal government has taken $17 billion out of 
taxpayers' pockets, through non-indexation. It is important to 
note that non-indexation is not at all the same as tax 
reductions. It only means that Quebecers will not pay more taxes 
because of inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remind the minister that non-indexation is not a tax 
reduction. In the 2000 budget, the government follows up on the 
representations made by the Bloc Quebecois and by groups of 
citizens to put a stop to hidden tax increases resulting from 
non-indexation. However, that measure comes a little late. 
Indeed, between 1993 and 2000, non-indexation will have generated 
between $12 billion and $17 billion for the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for tax reductions, they will only come later. We will have 
to wait. Yet, the federal government has more than enough leeway 
to redouble its effort to reduce the tax burden, as early as 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake, indexing is not a real tax cut.  In 
fact, with indexing, a taxpayer pays no more or less tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 budget informs us that the annual tax saving in 2004-05 
will total $10.9 billion, including $6.2 for indexing.  If we 
subtract the tax savings for business from this amount, 
indexation represents 60% of the alleged tax cuts.  For the year 
2000 alone, the estimate is that the real tax cuts will 
represent only about 20% of the cuts of $3.3 billion the 
Minister of Finance announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I would like to address another matter, which has become a 
daily matter of interest and that is the management of public 
finances, a black hole of $10.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to address this in the context of a budget, 
since the savings made could have been applied to such important 
items as the social transfer, health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, the Liberal government has created no less than 80 
agencies that are not accountable to parliament.  These agencies 
spend $6.8 billion annually, without any control.  If we add to 
this figure the contracts given out without tender and the 
fiasco at the Department of Human Resources Development, we end 
up with $10.4 billion spent annually with no control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government gives out money and delegates powers to 
agencies, they have to be accountable.  We have to know where 
the responsibility lies.  In order for us to know this, it is 
natural to insist on control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has come up with this formula of creating 
agencies. 
It is no trifling matter.  The 80 agencies created since 1994 
manage to escape these controls, because they are headed by 
directors answering to a minister, who answers to another 
minister, and when we look for ultimate control, we find none. A 
black hole of $10.4 billion is no trifling matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November, the auditor general pointed out that over 77 new 
agencies spending over $5 billion annually were not under the 
control of parliament and were not accountable. It is almost 
incredible. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means $5 billion that are outside the control of the public 
as a whole.  Three new organizations have been added in the 
latest budget, as well as $1.7 billion.  In 2001-02, then, this 
makes $6.8 billion in public funds outside the control of 
Parliament and of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there is the black hole of Human Resources 
Development Canada, which, on its own, represents $1.3 billion. 
HRDC transfers to businesses and to individuals are absolutely 
unmonitored.  Where has the money gone?  Were jobs created?  If 
so, where?  Was there political patronage?  These are questions 
without answers, and this budget will not change a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development has been asked the 
same questions over and over again for weeks, always with the 
same responses; in other words, we have had no response 
questions like the ones I have just asked, namely: Where has the 
money gone?  Were jobs created?  Was there political patronage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No answers.  There were tons of documents, but each time we 
looked into one in greater detail, we found that what the 
departmental employees were giving as answers differed from what 
was in the document we had been given.  This is worrisome enough 
when just one department is involved.  Perhaps if we keep on 
investigating further, more worthwhile discoveries will be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I would like to bring to hon. members' 
attention what the auditor general says in the highlights of his 
report. The auditor general's report is our guide as parliamentarians, 
whether we are in the opposition or the government, in 
determining whether public funds have been properly managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few highlights of the auditor general's report, 
which came out this week.  The following comments are from the 
report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must introduce strong control mechanisms 
in order to eliminate potential fraud in the immigration system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to immigration in greater detail. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education services for aboriginals must be improved in order to 
clearly define what the federal government's role should be and 
control spending. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending is still a concern.  The auditor general has found that 
there is a complete lack of control over spending.  He is 
sounding an alarm. The report also reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules for the treatment of scientific research tax credits, 
estimated at several billions of dollars, should be tightened. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does tightening the rules mean?  It means that somewhere 
there were abuses, that things were not done according to 
procedure. The report goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP's outdated computer system is a cause of concern for 
authorities, and the turnaround times for crime laboratory 
analyses are a threat to public safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills were adopted in this House giving the RCMP increased 
authority to conduct DNA tests for evidence purposes in rather 
horrible cases.  If the results take forever, there is a 
problem.  It is not a case of spending too much money, but not 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Human Resources Development is getting EI 
cheques out faster, but the odds of inaccurate payments have 
increased.  Things are just fine: more haste, less care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Food Inspection Agency inspectors need more information 
in order to better assess the risks posed by travellers entering 
the country.  If all manner of people can enter the country as 
they wish, questions are in order.  If this is what is going on, 
it is probably because of a lack of staff and money. 
Those areas with real, identifiable needs are perhaps where the 
government should be throwing its money.

I cannot get over it.  I am talking about Bill C-32 and defending 
the interest of Quebecers in connection with a budget containing 
excessive spending and very substantial surpluses, but, daily, 
we see absolutely incredible problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, I have the honour to have many immigrants. There 
are two universities in my riding.  I often have occasion to 
speak with these immigrants. 
I knew of the complexity of many problems, but I had no idea the 
inconsistencies of the immigration system were so chronic, so 
persistent and of such magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a look at what this budget reveals. As members know, my 
interests lie in agriculture and biotechnologies.  I would like 
to indicate what I found in the budget pertaining these two 
favourite subjects of mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sum of $90 billion is to be allocated over three years to 
the federal departments and agencies regulating the processes 
and products of biotechnology.  There is nothing to rejoice 
about here.  As the ministers of finance, health and agriculture 
seem to live in a bubble, it is a good idea to remind them where 
things stand in the new biological technologies approval 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 30, 1999, 200 federal experts on food quality and 
safety wrote to the Minister of Health, Allan Rock, to tell him 
of significant gaps in research on GMOs, for example, because of 
the shortage of personnel at the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency. Their letter reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Risk assessment has and continues to be compromised by a 
significant lack of scientists. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Agency is in a conflict of interest situation because it 
must, on the one hand, ensure that foods are harmless, while on 
the other hand encouraging food production and export. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also states that the system's administration and deregulation 
strip those involved of responsibility as far as meeting their 
obligations is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first reference made to stripping of 
responsibility and to impunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not an easy decision for two hundred federal government 
scientists to abandon their usual reserve and sign their names 
to such a letter, thus endangering their jobs.  They were so 
concerned that they felt they had to speak out.  These are 
career scientists; they know what they are talking about. 
Quoting again from the letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not test these products ourselves.  No Health Canada 
researcher is assigned to transgenic foods, because there is no 
funding for such research. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What planet is the Minister of Finance from, if he believes that 
these $30 million yearly are going to make it possible to solve 
all problems, including ethical ones? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is of concern in connection with the new technologies and 
the GMOs is that, when approving transgenic products, the 
federal government depends on research that has been carried out 
by the companies, limiting itself to reviewing or approving 
them.  It does not carry out any systematic counter-expertise on 
all plants and all food items headed for market, because it 
lacks the experts to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government uses the concept of “substantially equivalent”, 
by virtue of which genetically modified plants or foods 
resembling traditional ones and with similar-appearing 
composition are not subjected to more detailed examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the federal deputy minister of health himself, 
speaking before a Senate committee in the spring of 1999, the 
government did not, at that time, have any expertise whatsoever 
in genetics.  As he put it, “its labs are not really up to it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the approval of new drugs may take years of in depth 
studies, the approval of transgenic foods takes only a few 
weeks. How can the government guarantee the safety of these 
foods without adequate expertise and independent scientific 
studies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1999, this same Deputy Minister of Health said, regarding 
Health Canada's capacity to evaluate GMOs, that the department 
was not as ready as it should be to face the enormous changes 
that would occur over the next ten years—yes, ten years—in the 
area of human, animal and plant health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, public resources in the area of genetically modified 
foods are sorely lacking, as this same Deputy Minister of Health—when 
you think of it, he is my favourite—said in May 1999 
before the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and 
Forestry: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must strengthen our capacity in the genetics area...We do 
not, at the moment, have the capacity on board...Some of our 
labs, in particular in the environmental health area, are not in 
good shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that we will see over the next decade in the field 
of human health, as well as animal and plant health, will be 
enormous. You asked whether we are prepared. 
My answer: Not as well as we should be by any stretch of the 
imagination, but we are engaged in trying to become better 
prepared by building up a genetic capacity within the 
department...ensure that consumers know what they are eating. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been advocating this for a long time. I have been asking 
for the mandatory labelling of transgenic foods for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty million dollars per year is very little when we have to 
start from scratch, when we need laboratories, geneticists and 
experts, and when we need to inform the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing scared me when I looked at the budget for the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency. I noted that projected expenditures for 
the year 2000 are $266 million. 
In 2002, the figure is down to $261 million; in 2002-2003, it 
sinks again to $259 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned a ten-year time line; what is clear from the 
figures is that every year spending forecasts for the agency 
responsible for the food safety of Canadians drop further, 
although we live in a world undergoing huge changes—this is a 
rapidly evolving field right now.  There is cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the agriculture critic, I must say that the Agriculture 
Income Disaster Program is aptly named.  It was a disaster to 
administer, first for westerners, who were the first to turn to 
it, and things went from bad to worse when it came the turn of 
easterners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty of using this program discourages a good number 
of farmers and, at the end of the road, the resources they 
obtain are a far cry from what the program promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wanted to talk briefly about agricultural subsidies. 
Right now, while Canadian farmers receive $140 a head, American 
farmers are getting $340; in the European Economic Community, it 
is $380.  We share our entire east-west border with the United 
States; a Canadian farmer raising the same crops as his American 
counterpart driving his tractor on the other side of the fence 
receives $200 less a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that the ideal would be to change world trade 
policies, but when one is competing on a daily basis, this is 
very tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had also prepared a brief speech on small farms.  According to 
a study done in the United States, they are the lifeblood of 
agriculture.  The same is true here.  Here, they have not even 
been defined. 
What are we to make of this?  How can there be a policy to help 
them if they have not even been defined? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to include in its coming budgets, to adopt 
policies that take into account the whole agricultural sector, 
as well as disparities and the competition we face abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on, because agriculture was overlooked in this 
budget.  There are no programs for it.  The department's budget 
is also getting smaller.  When we subtract the money for 
agriculture income disaster programs and income security for our 
farmers, there is not much left in this budget for the 
agricultural sector to get excited about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a citizen, I have no reason to be happy with this budget. 
The Liberal government is not controlling its spending.  If I 
were to do the same thing in my family, I would be in big 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is spending a little here and there to get votes and is doing 
nothing to resolve the problems it created in the health care 
and education systems in all provinces, not just in Quebec.  We 
are all demanding a return to the social transfers of 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the agriculture critic, I am equally disappointed. This 
budget reveals how little vision this government has in the farm 
income crisis.  Although this is not the subject of my speech, 
we need only think of the ad hoc injection of public money for 
western farmers through transportation subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are ad hoc measures. 
They are not long term measures. Farmers in all the provinces 
are calling for long term policies to ensure their survival, and 
they have been exemplary in what they have been doing to ensure 
the sustainability of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the positions this government has 
taken in the matter of the GMOs, where its head in the sand 
policy calls into question the system monitoring the safety of 
our food and our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to paint a clear picture.  As my colleague before 
me said, we could spend a day talking about the budget.  I would 
like the government to remember the important points.  As far as 
I am concerned, the accountability of those responsible is 
vital.  If the government drags in all sorts of red herrings and 
establishes all sorts of agencies so no one is responsible, that 
bothers me.  Wastage bothers me just as much. 
As for the $10 billion hole, we wonder where the money went. 
The government could bring it back for transfer to the provinces 
in the areas of health, education and agriculture, which is my 
greatest interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to say a few words in the debate on the budget 
implementation bill before the House.  We have had a budget 
before the House for quite some time.  When we deal with the 
implementation bill, we have to ask ourselves what kind of a 
society we want and what the goals and objectives should be in 
terms of the budgeting process for the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in a long while we have a surplus with which 
to work.  The minister said in his budget update in November that 
he thought there would be a surplus of around $100 billion over 
five years.  It will probably be more than that.  It may be $110 
million or $120 billion or perhaps even more, because in general 
the economy is doing pretty well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the growth rate in this country compared to that 
in the United States, it is actually quite high.  Revenues to the 
government are increasing.  When the growth rate is high fewer 
people are unemployed and fewer people draw unemployment 
insurance and welfare.  There are fewer costs in the social 
services system and therefore the coffers of the government 
continue to expand and expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no idea for how long this economic expansion will last. 
We have no idea how long the expansion of government revenue will 
last.  In many ways it is very difficult to project into the 
future.  We have to work with the numbers we have.  For the first 
time in many years we have a budget surplus that will go on for 
quite some time.  This is different from the last part of the 
1980s or throughout the 1990s when we had to talk about how we 
deal with debts and deficits and how we deal with valid programs 
that could not go ahead because of the fiscal crunch.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have choices before us and we have to decide what kind of 
an agenda we want.  When I think of the agenda of the future I 
think what should motivate us is doing the most we can for the 
common good of the Canadian people in terms of creating a society 
in which there is more equality of condition and more equality of 
services.  People should be empowered through a better democratic 
system.  We should build a society on co-operation and play an 
international role in terms of development in the third world and 
the promotion of world peace.  Those should be the goals and the 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to fulfil a goal that speaks to doing the best for the 
common good, it seems to me we should start now by reinvesting in 
programs that were cut back by the government a few years ago in 
the fight against the debt and the deficit, namely our social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the last number of years and take health care as 
an example, a tremendous sacrifice was made by the health care 
sector to fight the deficit.  About $30 billion have been taken 
out of the health care system.  That is an awful lot of money, 
and we have problems in health care today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the only problem is not money.  The big problem 
is that $30 billion are missing.  Another way of putting it is 
that when the Minister of Finance decided to radically cut back 
on health care and social programs in his budget of 1994-95 the 
payments made at that time compared to the payments now show a 
deficit of about $4.2 billion a year.  To get back to 1994-95 
levels it would mean an increase in spending on health care of 
around $4.2 billion a year.  That extra money would go a long way 
in terms of making sure that we address our health care problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing about health care is that even in its most recent 
budget the government decided that health care and social 
programs were not priorities.  Indeed the priority for the 
Minister of Finance was a tax cut of some $58 billion over four 
years.  In other words, for every dollar in tax cuts the 
government will put two cents into health care.  That is not the 
right priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right priority should be to reinvest once again in our 
social programs, in particular health care, to build a strong 
health care sector and make sure that we serve people so that 
they can go to hospital or to a doctor and obtain equal service 
regardless of income or background.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this some provinces like Alberta are introducing a 
bill like its bill 11 to set up a partially privatized health 
care system.  I disagree with bill 11.  I disagree with that 
direction.  Under the NAFTA if Alberta does that and allows a 
privatization of health care or a two tier system in health care, 
it will have to go right across the country because the 
corporations in private health care have the right to do it not 
just in one province but across the country.  Therefore that is a 
dangerous precedent to set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason that is happening is the big cutbacks in health care 
to Alberta, to every province in the country.  In my province of 
Saskatchewan about 13 cents on the dollar come from Ottawa and 87 
cents on the dollar are paid by the province of cash injection 
into health care.  In Ontario about 89 cents are put up by the 
Ontario taxpayer and about 11 cents are put up by the federal 
government in terms of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time the federal government paid 50 cents on the dollar 
in terms of funding health care when medicare was founded back in 
the 1960s.  After the seventies it started to pull back, to 
withdraw.  Now that we have a fiscal surplus, a fiscal dividend, 
a major part of it should go into health care to make sure we 
have a public health care system for each and every Canadian 
citizen. If we do not do that and the provinces start to 
privatize, we will lose health care and end up with a two tier 
American system that is unfair, unequal and very expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A greater percentage of the GDP in the United States is spent on 
health care than in Canada. 
We have a public health care system in this country.  In that 
country there is a mixed system.  Some 48 million Americans do 
not have any health care.  Those who do not have health care are 
mainly the poor people, particularly the black people in the 
United States because of the socioeconomic condition that they 
find themselves in.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely unfair to have a health care system that is 
built on the size of a person's pocket book or bank account and 
not on treating people as equals.  That is the way we are going 
unless we convince the Minister of Finance and the government 
across the way that the time has come to put cash on the table 
and make sure that we build once again toward Ottawa paying up to 
50% of the cost of health care in Canada.  That should be our 
number one priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we have the whole question of education and the 
federal government withdrawing money for post-secondary 
education.  There is a need to reinvest in young people for 
post-secondary education, for skills, for training and for 
research and development.  If we are to build a strong society 
and a strong economy in the years that lie ahead, knowledge 
becomes extremely important.  Knowledge is extremely important in 
terms of building a strong economy.  We need a strongly 
motivated, highly knowledgeable and highly educated workforce. It 
is the obligation of the federal government to put up more money 
to make sure we have a workforce that is highly trained and 
highly skilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those should be the major priorities of the government across 
the way, but it seems to me that the government has been 
intimidated by what we used to call the Reform Party.  I am sure 
the Chair would agree that the Reform Party has had a great 
impact on the agenda of Canada which calls for smaller 
government, cutbacks in health care, cutbacks in education, 
cutbacks in the powers of the Canadian Wheat Board, and cutbacks 
in anything that has to do with the common good or the sense of 
community.  It wants to cut back, cut back, cut back and reduce 
the role of government, to the point now where the size of 
government spending is 11.6% of the GDP, the lowest level since 
the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the Liberal government is afraid of the Reform 
Party in terms of setting the agenda.  The government across the 
way is the real Conservative Party.  We have a more Conservative 
government now than we had with Brian Mulroney in 1984 and 1988 
till 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been the agenda, but that is not where the people of 
the country want to go.  In poll after poll after poll they are 
saying that health care is number one.  We need a public system 
of health care.  It should not be privatized.  We do not want a 
two tier American style medicine.  That is what the Canadian 
people are saying.  For that we need more federal money going 
into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal friends across the way should not be intimidated by 
this reborn Reform Party, the Canadian Conservative Reform 
Alliance Party of Canada.  The last time I looked at the Gallup 
poll it is still sitting at 9%, so why be afraid of it?  Why have 
an agenda that is going to the right and is more conservative 
than the Conservatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need real progressive change.  We need some social democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I note from a news release by the former solicitor general dated 
March 23, 1995 that they wanted to upgrade and strengthen the 
existing program by the following criteria:  clearly defining 
admission criteria for witnesses; ensuring that cases are dealt 
with in a consistent manner across the country; setting out the 
responsibilities and obligations of both the administrators of 
the program and individuals entering the program; clarifying the 
management structure within the RCMP for the day to day operation 
of the program, thereby increasing accountability; and finally, 
providing for a complaints procedure and requiring the 
commissioner of the RCMP to submit to the solicitor general an 
annual report on the operation of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure these were good intentions on the part of the 
solicitor general of the day back in 1995, but I have to report 
that it unfortunately has not been completely successful.  I have 
had interviews with people who have been under the witness 
protection program and I am aware that there are some distinct 
problems with the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another document from the former solicitor general, we have 
the criteria for the admission to the RCMP witness protection 
program:  the potential contribution the witness source can make 
toward a particular police investigation; the nature of the 
offence under investigation; the nature of the risk to the 
individual; alternative methods of protection that are available; 
danger to the community if the individual is admitted to the 
program; potential effects on any family relationships; the 
likelihood of an individual being able to adjust to the program; 
the cost of maintaining the individual in the program; and, any 
other fact that the commissioner of the RCMP may deem relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all worthy goals and objectives.  After talking to 
some of the people who are currently in the program, I know that 
the issue of the nature of risk to the individual is one which 
unfortunately is highly suspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Relative to the existing program, not to the proposed program, 
let us be clear that at the time the people become involved in 
the witness protection program, probably the majority of them, 
they are not people at that stage in their lives who we would be 
happy to invite home for a cup of coffee.  These are people who, 
typically at that time in their lives, either have been 
compromised by a given situation they have been involved in with 
the other people involved in criminal activity, or are perhaps 
tied up with drugs, alcohol or other problems of that type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these people perform an exceptionally valuable service 
to the law enforcement agencies in Canada.  What typically is 
happening, in my judgment, is that they are being left hanging 
out to dry by those same law enforcement agencies. 
Some do become involved in the program but, more frequently, they 
actually end up signing agreements with the enforcement authority 
under duress, to the point where an officer may say “If you do 
not get on side with me, I will blow your cover.  I will reveal 
your identity”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important case for jurisprudence recently took place in 
the case of Mr. Francs.  After he had made an agreement in good 
faith with the law enforcement people he was spirited quickly out 
of Vancouver to a motel in Chilliwack along with his family who 
were absolutely petrified.  He was told “I am sorry, it really 
did not work out.  We will have to get something else 
organized”.  The judge rightfully came down like a tonne of 
bricks on the enforcement authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final thing I would say on this particular case is that 
there is further confusion.  The justice department then goes to 
these people, who are trying to get their day in the sun in a 
court of law, and says “You must reveal evidence”, which is 
evidence that if revealed would not only compromise themselves 
but would also compromise the RCMP investigations or the police 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am in favour of this bill being voted on and going 
to committee is so that we can look at the entire picture.  We 
can look at spousal protection and at the whole witness 
protection program because it is in a sad state of disrepair and 
desperately needs work.  Above all, this is not only for the 
protection of society but also so those people who have been 
drawn into the program can receive proper protection for 
themselves, for their loved ones and for their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak to Bill C-223, an act to amend 
the Witness Protection Program Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River 
for introducing the bill.  This matter involves the issue of 
improving safety and security for spouses whose lives are in 
danger.  It is obvious to me that improving safety and security 
for victims of spousal violence has or should have the support of 
the members of the House.  It definitely has my support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River introduced 
the bill he noted that this was a non-partisan matter.  I agree, 
it is a non-partisan matter.  I want to provide my input to this 
debate in a way that respects its non-partisan matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that there is any real debate that measures ought 
to be in place to protect victims of life-threatening 
relationships.  I believe that the only questions are what form 
these measures should take and how we can improve upon what is 
currently in place.  These are important questions that deserve 
careful review by experts who work in the field of family 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we already have numerous measures against family 
violence in place.  Let us look at some of them.  First, we have 
laws that prohibit and punish the physical violence that is 
frequently a tragic part of abusive relationships.  As we are all 
aware, however, these laws have not always worked.  In the past 
our society has been far too accepting of family violence.  Law 
enforcement and justice officials themselves have not always been 
sensitive, and still today are not necessarily as sensitive as 
they should be to the issue when it was, in the past, brought to 
them and when, still today, it is brought to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have recently made some progress in this area. 
Through education and prosecution guidelines, we have sought to 
ensure that the appropriate criminal charges are brought against 
persons who commit these acts.  We have also had success in this 
regard, although I must agree, as many in the House would state, 
there is room for improvement.  While such measures are not the 
whole answer, they obviously play an important role in deterrence 
and in providing sanctions against perpetrators of family 
violence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the standard criminal justice measures against 
violence, we also have measures which are more specifically 
relevant to spousal violence situations.  An important measure of 
this type is the prohibition against criminal harassment found at 
section 264 of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that criminal harassment, such as stalking, is 
frequently a prelude to spousal violence.  Further, beyond the 
direct physical violence that it can lead to, stalking can also 
cause significant harm in and of itself as the constant fear of 
violence takes it toll on that victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice recently announced that she would 
recommend that parliament lengthen the maximum penalty for 
criminal harassment from five to ten years.  In appropriate 
cases, those who carry out criminal harassment would then be 
subject to dangerous offender provisions, allowing for the 
imposition of indefinite sentences.  That is a move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal code measures providing deterrents and sanctions must 
work in conjunction with other measures.  Shelters and transition 
houses have played an important part in addressing safety and 
other needs of family violence victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure a lot of members, if not all members in the House, 
have shelters within their own riding.  I have one in my riding 
and it performs a real service to victims of family violence and 
to the children of the spouses who are victims of family 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to acknowledge, as was pointed out earlier in the 
debate, that there was a tragic incident in a Montreal shelter 
where this safety, which this bill wishes to address, was 
breached and a woman was killed by her spouse.  Such an incident, 
however tragic, should not take away from the important and 
positive role played by shelters and the dedicated people who 
staff them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responses to family violence that I have mentioned are not 
sufficient in and of themselves.  Broader prevention initiatives 
are vital to making a long term difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, family violence has been hidden in silence and 
denial.  We have already done much to bring it out into the open 
but more has to be done.   Notably, governments at all levels, 
the federal, the provincial, the territorial and the municipal, 
have supported counselling and education to help encourage 
recognition and reporting of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, victims receive counselling for immediate trauma 
and long term psychological harm.  It is important to remember, 
as well, that counselling is not restricted to the victims alone. 
Prevention can be and has successfully been addressed to those 
who engage in abusive behaviour.  In fact, I have been told that 
there are over 100 treatment programs in Canada for perpetrators 
of spousal abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, such counselling and treatment programs, both 
for victims and abusers, are supported by governments at all 
levels.  Non-governmental organizations often play a key role in 
delivering the services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level our support is provided through such means 
as the Family Violence Prevention Initiative and the National 
Strategy on Community Safety and Crime Prevention.  These 
initiatives, and those I mentioned earlier, have made Canada a 
leader in efforts to put a halt to family violence. 
Nevertheless, we must still recognize that even these initiatives 
are not always enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me back to Bill C-223.  The bill identifies an 
additional type of assistance that can sometimes be offered.  It 
involves such measures as the relocation of the victims and the 
continuation of their lives under new identities, away and safe 
from their abusers.  It is a form of assistance similar to that 
currently offered under a process called New Identities For 
Victims of Life-Threatening Relationships.  Human Resources 
Development Canada co-ordinates this joint federal, provincial 
and territorial ad hoc initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was recognized by members from both sides of the House 
earlier in the debate on this bill, providing a new identity to 
victims of spousal violence is a measure of last resort. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons for this are clear.  Restarting lives in such a 
manner can involve considerable challenges and hardship. 
Therefore, it must be a measure of last resort.  We must be 
careful that the use of such processes does not place additional 
burdens on persons who are already victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me back to the issue of Bill C-223.  The witness 
protection program offers protection to persons who assist law 
enforcement.  It is very much a program with a specific law 
enforcement purpose.  It is typically used in matters of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been informed that the issue of spousal protection under 
the witness protection program is one of the options the current 
new identities working group which the government has set up will 
be examining.  However it is only one among a number of options. 
In fact, preliminary consultations with victims groups and those 
who work in the field indicate it might not be the best option. 
Other options, such as a separate more fully developed new 
identities initiative, are also being considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason I ask the House today in a non-partisan 
manner not to support Bill C-223.  During the time that this 
matter is being examined by a federal, provincial and territorial 
working group in consultation with victims representatives, we 
should not go forward with a bill that predetermines and imposes 
a single option.  We should allow for the possibility of a 
multitude of options.  This is especially the case if preliminary 
consultations have indicated that the option provided under this 
private member's bill is not necessarily the best option. 
Instead, we should let those involved in the working group devote 
their energies to considering the best way to build upon that 
which we already have in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spousal abuse is a serious issue.  Governments at all levels are 
addressing this issue and are looking for the best options to 
provide protection to those spouses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise today on behalf of my NDP colleagues to 
indicate that we support the referral of Bill C-223 to a 
committee.  I commend the hon. member for Prince George—Peace 
River for bringing forth a bill on a very important and vital 
subject for the well-being of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Domestic violence and spousal abuse is a very serious problem. 
My wife and I have taken in a number of foster children. I can 
recall a situation involving one young girl we were looking 
after.  She was around 15 years old at that time.  I recall her 
talking about when she was younger that her parents would engage 
in domestic violence. Her father had an alcohol problem.  He 
would come home and beat his wife and sometimes the children if 
they were around.  She talked about having to gather together her 
siblings and flee into the woods in the darkness of the night to 
keep them safe while her father raged with violence against her 
mother.  It was a very sad situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the whole issue of domestic violence affects not 
only the spouses but also the family members.  We see children 
often being forced to take on adult responsibilities and share a 
kind of guilt which they should not have to in their young lives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide some background with respect to the 
bill. This bill was introduced during the first session of the 
36th parliament as Bill C-494 and died on the order paper as a 
result of prorogation in the fall of 1999.  The bill was 
subsequently reintroduced as Bill C-223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would amend the Witness Protection Program Act to 
extend the scope of the witness protection program to include 
persons whose lives are in danger because of acts committed by 
their spouse, former spouse, common law spouse or former common 
law spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Witness Protection Program Act was passed by parliament in 
1996.  Under the current act, spouses are only addressed in their 
role as witnesses against criminals.  There are no references to 
the possible need to protect persons who are victims of the 
violent actions of their own spouse or former spouse.  They are 
not covered under the definition of witness in the current act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Witness Protection Program Act provided a legislative base 
and a structure for decision making for the RCMP witness 
protection program.  Although it had been in existence since 1984 
as an administrative program, it did not have clear criteria or 
rules or an accountability structure.  Accountability is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act introduced a list of factors to be considered in 
deciding whether a person should be admitted to the program.  It 
defined protection as including relocation, accommodation and 
change of identity, as well as counselling and financial support. 
It provided for protection agreements to be entered into and 
specified their requirements.  The act established a criteria and 
process for terminating protection.  It also provided for 
agreements to be entered into with provinces and municipalities 
for which the RCMP provides policing so they could be a part of 
the national program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although they are not covered by the RCMP program, spouses who 
are in such danger that they must flee their surroundings and 
change their identities are not completely unprotected at the 
present time.  Two federal government departments, Human 
Resources Development Canada and Revenue Canada, administer a 
little known ad hoc process called new identities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the help of information from police, women's shelters and 
victims groups, the program helps desperate women in life 
threatening situations gain a new identity and relocate by 
providing them with a new social insurance number and ensuring 
continuity of federal social benefits. The program has no 
specific mandate and no separate funding so the assistance it can 
provide is not comprehensive. Bill C-223 would improve upon that 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there have been some concerns raised that more resources 
should be committed to women's shelters and front line policing 
rather than the type of initiative under Bill C-223, the NDP 
strongly believes that both are needed.  It is not one or the 
other.  We feel that both are needed and that every effort must 
be made to ensure the safety and security of the vulnerable in 
our communities.  As I indicated earlier, families are very 
vulnerable when it comes to domestic violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP support strengthening provisions of the Witness 
Protection Program Act to allow for greater protection of 
spouses.  We in the NDP support this legislation but at the same 
time we must make it clear that this is only a measure of last 
resort and that a substantial increase in resources for women's 
shelters and protective measures for victims and their families 
must remain the priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity 
to register my support for the private member's bill that has 
been introduced by my colleague from Prince George—Peace River. 
I commend him on his care for Canadian society in bringing 
forward this important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would allow protection under the same sort of 
provisions as those in the witness protection program for people 
whose lives or whose children's lives are threatened by a spouse 
or former spouse.  This is a very important piece of legislation 
because we know there are an increasing number of individuals in 
our society who have nowhere to turn for protection from the 
violence of a former spouse or intimate partner.  This is a sad 
commentary on our society but it would be an even sadder 
commentary if we as legislators turned a blind eye to the 
distress of these individuals, most of whom are women.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we as a society offer real and meaningful 
protection, protection with teeth, to people in these very 
difficult circumstances.  This bill would do that.  It sets out a 
common sense framework without a lot of red tape but with some 
clear criteria and some clear resources that would offer real and 
meaningful protection to Canadians in this kind of distress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly all of us in our circle of acquaintances through business 
or by being members of parliament have had people come to us or 
have talked to people who are in absolute terror and distress 
because they do not know how to protect themselves from a violent 
former partner.  There is nothing more tragic than that kind of 
distress and situation where people literally are vulnerable and 
have nowhere to turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to take up too much time in order to allow two 
other individuals to speak in support of the bill.  I did want 
the opportunity to put on record my own strong support for the 
bill.  It will be administered partly through Human Resources 
Development Canada and will build on the new identities program 
in that department.  This is a very positive step for Canadian 
society.  I urge all members of the House to support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to follow the lead of previous members 
who have spoken to this very practical and useful piece of 
legislation that is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 in essence broadens the mandate of the witness 
protection program to include abused spouses.  This is a very 
worthy and worthwhile endeavour. The sad thing is that it would 
not be necessary if the government were approaching this in a 
proper way with respect to some of the existing programs and 
legislation. Increased spending on policing, for example, to 
better protect spouses from domestic abuse coupled with tougher 
sanctions that might be handed down by judges would also 
accomplish much of what the hon. member is attempting to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly a need for greater funding and greater 
resources with respect to counselling programs for the abusive 
spouse as well as the victim.  There are programs such as New 
Leaf in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, where individuals like Bob 
Whitman and Ron Kelly work extremely closely to address the 
actual problems of individuals who have involved themselves in 
this violent behaviour. That type of proactive intervention is 
what is needed and what the government and all governments should 
be encouraged to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government however has not made a concrete 
commitment to allocate money to deal with and protect society 
from violent predators.  Although it has proudly stated its 
record with respect to the $810 million for policing and 
protection which sounds like a great deal of money, the reality 
is that money will be spread over three years. Sixty-two per cent 
of those dollars allocated will not be available until 2001-02. 
Therefore the bulk of the money is committed outside the 
government's current mandate.  This is a very arrogant and I 
would suggest deceptive tactic that breeds further cynicism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a responsible government, Bill C-223 would not be needed. 
Yet the government's sketchy record of protecting the public 
especially those most vulnerable in society has made legislation 
like this necessary.  The slow reaction time of the Department of 
Justice unfortunately is legendary.  The minister herself once 
described her department as the world's worst law firm.  That is 
a damning condemnation of her own department which she 
administers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently abused spouses, most often women, endure a living hell 
as they try to protect themselves and their children from the 
wrath of an abusive spouse.  There are many safe houses set up 
across the country.  Bryony House in Halifax and Tearmann House 
in New Glasgow perform an incredible service on shoestring 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims who move to these shelters do so to escape a very 
dangerous and volatile situation and relationship.  The problem 
is they cannot remain anonymous and eventually they may be found 
by their abusive spouse and face violence or even death. 
The government has not addressed this and I would suggest that 
Bill C-223 is very much a necessary and laudable piece of 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada supports the family 
and the protection afforded by this type of bill.  It is 
consistent with our support of law and order and the protection 
of society and of victim's rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester 
about another very worthwhile program that is alive and well in 
the country, Crime Stoppers.  Once again it is something that 
fosters greater participation between members of the community 
and police in an effort to address a very volatile society at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the amendments brought forth by this type of 
legislation to the witness protection program are very worthy. 
We agree that the hon. member has brought forward the legislation 
in a timely fashion.  It would broaden the mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also agree that Canada's anti-stalking laws can further be 
expanded as well.  I know that Senator Oliver in the other place 
continues to do extraordinary work to strengthen the laws related 
to stalking, section 264 of the criminal code, which is a very 
serious situation as well.  Other members have alluded to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still stronger laws to protect people and bring about a way to 
protect their individuality and identity when they are fleeing an 
abusive situation can be further buttressed by a commitment of 
resources from the government.  We must be wary of those who 
might attempt to use this program in an unlawful manner, for 
example to change identity to escape creditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 protects us against this as well because it has a 
very detailed list of criteria and factors that the witness 
protection program would have to consider before admitting a 
person into its umbrella of protection.  They have to display the 
need, that life is in danger, that there is danger of a 
psychological or physical injury, and that the situation is such 
that it would warrant the protection afforded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A current example is the new identities for humanitarian reasons 
type of legislation, an unofficial program that began in 1992 and 
works under the HRDC department.  Revenue Canada will not reveal 
the names of persons who conduct the program, but it ensures that 
their income tax history, child tax benefits of the victim, et 
cetera, follow them into their new lives without linking them to 
their past names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are programs that promote this type of protection.  The 
problem is that the criminal code cannot force an individual to 
testify against a spouse and eliminates potentially very 
incriminating and damning information that police and prosecutors 
need to obtain a conviction of a spousal abuser.  There is often 
a great deal of intimidation and threatening behaviour that 
follows.  A new and improved witness protection program could be 
mandated to protect crown witnesses and help with the furtherance 
of justice in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Prince George—Peace River for bringing 
forward the bill.  It very much furthers the interests of 
justice.  Forwarding the bill to the committee is a very 
worthwhile venture.  I applaud the efforts that he has made and 
those of members who have spoken in favour of it.  It is a very 
sound, common sense initiative.  It furthers the protection of 
victims in most severe cases of spousal abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary.  At the very least this debate has brought 
government attention to the lack of funding that has been 
afforded this problem and at best will bring about further debate 
that will address the problem.  The Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada wholeheartedly supports this initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Price George—Peace River for bringing 
forward the bill.  He brought forward not simply the initiative 
he has proposed to the House through his bill but generally the 
issue of domestic violence, which I am sure is of concern to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did write a monograph on the subject of domestic violence 
called “The Tragic Tolerance of Domestic Violence”.  I want to 
share with the House a couple of the facts I found in my research 
in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, members will know that the cycle of violence includes 
three phases:  the tension building phase, the explosive incident 
and the honeymoon phase.  Without getting into too much detail 
there is a cycle. 
It starts when things begin to deteriorate and then there is an 
incident, a battering or some other incident, qualifying as 
domestic assault.  Then there is the denial and then there is the 
make-up.  Then we have a cooling off period.  Then it comes 
around.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my research I found that the experts agree that the cycle of 
violence continues, a week later, a month later, a year later. 
It will continue to the point where its velocity increases.  The 
intensity increases.  In fact, the certainty of serious bodily 
harm and maybe even death becomes a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other consequences of domestic violence which I think 
are worth noting.  About 40% to 80% of children witness domestic 
violence, which is a very significant number of our children.  In 
52% of violent relationships in which children witness the 
violence, women feared for their lives, and in 61% of abusive 
relationships where a child is a witness, the violence was 
serious enough to result in the woman being injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children witnessing violence against their mothers experience 
similar emotional, health and behavioural problems as children 
who themselves are directly abused, which basically says that 
witnessing abuse is as bad as being abused.  It amplifies the 
fact again that it is not only the partners who are affected, it 
affects entire families, and it affects children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a Canada-wide study of abused women, women reported that 
their partners had abused their children physically 26% of the 
time, psychologically 48% of the time and sexually 7% of the 
time.  An estimated 30% to 40% of children who witness violence 
against their mother by a partner are also abused directly by the 
partner, whether or not he is the father.  Children who witness 
the violence are at risk of further violence, either as a 
perpetrator or as a victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence in the home is experienced by children, and in 
adulthood those children are more likely to become perpetrators 
of violence.  That is even more reason for us to take very 
seriously the need for attention to this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members might ask what the experts say about the reasons a woman 
might not leave an abusive relationship.  Here are some of the 
more common responses.  They hope that the relationship will get 
better.  They do not want to break up the family.  Her partner's 
abuse isolates her from her family and friends.  She fears for 
her own and her children's safety.  She depends on her partner's 
income.  She has lost her self-esteem because of her partner's 
abuse.  She has nowhere to go.  Her partner has threatened to 
harm her if she leaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the more common reasons someone would give for 
not wanting to leave a domestic situation of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my research I found that only 5% to 15% of cases of domestic 
violence are actually reported.  That is very significant.  If 
violence starts small and grows over time, the earlier it is 
dealt with the better.  I concluded that the most important thing 
would be to encourage the reporting of cases of domestic 
violence, because the people themselves, the partners, cannot 
solve the problem.  Both of them need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thought of laying a charge against an intimate partner is a 
very serious step, with potentially enormous consequences.  It 
could end the relationship or it could lead to more serious 
violence.  The evidence shows that the intensity of domestic 
violence increases after the breakup, not before.  That is when 
all is lost.  It is over.  That is when people really lose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise these points simply to say that I think this 
is an issue that should be talked about much more by the House. 
This is one opportunity.  I hope it inspires other members to 
raise initiatives which will bring to this House a matter which 
affects not only men and women, but children and society as a 
whole.  We are all affected by this and we should all be part of 
the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy of violence against spouses is a complex problem 
which has no simple solution.  It will take a comprehensive 
strategy of both preventive and remedial approaches, and it needs 
the active support of all concerned, both men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for bringing forward the bill.  I believe he 
has some support.  I am sure we can work out how to do this. 
Again, I thank all members for their support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty to advise the House 
that if the hon member for Prince George—Peace River speaks now 
he will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the outset of my closing remarks I 
thank colleagues from all the parties that participated in the 
debate throughout the three hours which began on November 26, 
1999.  This is the last 45 minutes of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I especially appreciate the comments made by my colleagues from 
the other opposition parties who indicated their support. They 
will be encouraging colleagues within their parties to support 
Bill C-223, recognizing that Private Members' Business votes are 
free votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am deeply saddened that government members who have spoken, 
with the exception of the hon. member for Mississauga South, have 
indicated that they will not be supporting this private member's 
bill.  The hon. member for Mississauga South said it all just a 
minute ago, in the sense that this is an incredibly complex and 
horrendous issue.  To only suggest to Canadians that it warrants 
some two hours and 45 minutes of debate in the Chamber is 
appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have hoped that all members in a very non-partisan and 
constructive way would have seen fit, when it comes to the vote 
on May 2, to support the legislation and send it to the justice 
committee.  Then we could hear directly from experts, victims and 
people who have worked in the industry of protecting people from 
domestic violence and spousal abuse and come up with a concrete 
plan of action on how to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting for a minute that Bill C-223 is the be-all 
and end-all.  It is far from it.  When I designed this piece of 
legislation it was with the understanding that if it were sent to 
committee it could be amended.  It could be improved upon by 
members of that committee following suggestions from witnesses. 
It was with the recognition that this is only one tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues from other parties and from my own party, 
the Canadian Alliance, spoke about the need for increased 
resources for law enforcement, the need for increased counselling 
and rehabilitation efforts, and the need for tougher deterrents 
for those who would ignore restraining orders and continue to 
stalk their former spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Liberal member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine 
spoke in support of the general thrust of the bill, she concluded 
her remarks by saying that she would not be supporting the 
legislation because of the existing ad hoc program that we have 
all recognized in our comments and that they are pursuing a 
multitude of options.  Somehow she thought that by supporting 
Bill C-223 it would limit the options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest just the opposite.  By sending this bill to 
committee we could open up a whole range of options.  Therefore, 
in the final minute of debate, I am calling on all members of the 
House over the course of the two week Easter break, an 
appropriate time of year, to go back to their ridings, consult 
with their supporters, and come back in a non-partisan way and 
consider supporting the legislation on May 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that tragically they will find, as I have found in my 
own riding, there are dozens and perhaps hundreds of people 
living in fear for their lives.  It does not just affect spouses. 
It does not just affect adults.  It affects children of all ages 
who live every day in fear for their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a tragedy it would be if members just turned their backs 
and said that we had to study it more and let the bureaucrats do 
what they could, without the support of members of parliament 
working together in a non-partisan way to help these people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to pursue the issue of Canadian soldiers wrongfully sent to 
Buchenwald concentration camp during the second world war. In my 
question to the minister just before Christmas I asked that the 
minister: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—ensure that those brave Canadian soldiers wrongfully sent to 
the Buchenwald concentration camp will finally receive a just 
settlement beyond the insulting pittance given a year ago.  Will 
the minister and his cabinet bring joy at Christmastime to the 
Buchenwald survivors? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very concerned that the minister chose to ignore that part 
of my question.  Perhaps I should not have been surprised. This 
Liberal government has gone out of its way to ignore these brave 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a letter I wrote on this topic, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said that in other countries compensation was 
paid for civilians, such as people working for the Red Cross and 
other similar wartime efforts I assume, who were sent to 
concentration camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue remains on the table.  The Canadian troops who 
suffered the horrors of living in Buchenwald deserve compensation 
and it is up to the Liberal government to ensure that 
compensation is delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appalling that the Liberal government tried to buy the 
silence of these veterans for about $1,000 each.  One of these 
veterans, a constituent of mine, William Gibson, made it clear 
that this so-called compensation was offensive.  This constituent 
who survived the horrors of the Buchenwald concentration camp 
sent the cheque back to the Liberal government with the word 
“refused” across the insulting payoff of $1,098. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These veterans were interned in the Nazi Buchenwald 
concentration camp instead of a prisoner of war camp where they 
should have been sent under the Geneva convention.  Other 
governments have had the ability to convince the German 
government to provide appropriate reparation.  Our government has 
failed itself and failed these brave Canadians miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the inability of the government to secure a 
just settlement for these Canadians.  Is it a matter of 
incompetence or is it simply that the government cares little for 
the plight of a small handful of 26 veterans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps even more insulting than the cheque to these Canadians 
were the words of the Minister of Veterans Affairs in his 
accompanying letter.  He said, “I am delighted to be able to 
close the chapter on this longstanding issue”.  Delighted 
indeed.  It is now over eight years since the plight of these 
veterans was discussed in the January 1991 report of the 
subcommittee on veterans affairs entitled “It's Almost Too 
Late”.  Over eight years later I should say it is almost too 
late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was raised again in committee in 1994 and in letters 
to the veterans affairs, defence and foreign affairs ministers in 
1997.  I have raised this issue time and time again for over a 
year now and the government still admits defeat where other 
governments have succeeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A letter from the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
my office admits failure with these words, “Canada has embarked 
on several démarches requesting prisoner of war compensation from 
Germany, but we have had no success”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with a comment my constituent made when addressing 
the Nova Scotia government committee on veterans affairs in 
February of this year: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been fighting for German compensation since 1945, but we 
haven't got it yet and I don't know if we will ever get it 
because I don't think there is anybody in Ottawa who has the 
intestinal fortitude to go after it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Liberal government to respond now to this issue.  I 
sincerely hope we will not be subject to a litany of what the 
Liberal government claims to have done about other issues.  Let 
us talk about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadian veterans deserve a government that will stand up 
for them and ensure they receive the compensation they are due 
from the German government.  Anything less is unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Halifax West 
actually raised two issues in his original question last 
December:  the compensation issue for the merchant navy and the 
question of compensation by Germany for Canadian airmen 
imprisoned at Buchenwald.  Although the member has chosen to 
focus his remarks tonight on the Buchenwald question, I would 
like to address both of his issues since I know he has a deep 
personal interest and a commitment to both matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report on the progress that has been made in 
recognizing the heroic contribution of the merchant navy to 
Canada's war effort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 1, 2000, the Minister of Veterans Affairs announced 
a tax free package for Canada's merchant navy veterans and their 
surviving spouses.  This package is compensation for post-war 
demobilization benefits provided by the armed forces but not the 
merchant navy veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Veterans Affairs has received more than 10,000 
applications for the merchant navy special benefit.  Today, close 
to 1,000 cheques have been issued to eligible merchant navy 
veterans or their surviving spouses.  These payments will be paid 
out in up to two disbursements, depending on length of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the tremendous effort and leadership of veterans 
organizations, they agreed upon compensation of $20,000 for 
service of more than 24 months, $10,000 for service between 6 and 
24 months, and $5,000 for service between 1 and 6 months or for 
less than 1 month if captured, killed or disabled.  An additional 
20% will be paid to any veterans receiving these benefits who 
spent time as a prisoner of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As expected, when processing the applications the department is 
finding that a percentage of these applications do not fall 
within the guidelines agreed upon with merchant navy and national 
veterans organizations.  For instance, some individuals served 
with the armed forces and so have already received benefits. Some 
were on vessels in coastal waters but do not meet the 
qualifications for war related services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reassure all merchant navy veterans and their families that 
the Government of Canada recognizes their valiant efforts on 
behalf of their country and that Veterans Affairs Canada is 
giving the merchant navy the special benefit and priority that it 
deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to address the issues of compensating Canadian airmen

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
recently I had the opportunity to pose a question during question 
period with regard to the issue of sudden infant death syndrome. 
It is a terminology and maybe a condition which mesmerizes people 
because we do not hear very much about it.  However we do hear 
about it from time to time in communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During much of the work I have done with regard to the healthy 
outcomes of children, one of the phrases that sticks in my mind 
about its impact was from the psychiatrist in chief at the sick 
kids hospital in Toronto.  She said that a secure, consistent 
attachment to an engaged, committed adult was one of the most 
significant indicators or preconditions for a healthy outcome of 
a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While doing some research on healthy outcomes of kids I came 
across a report by Dr. Christopher Ruhm from the University of 
North Carolina, produced in April 1998.  The paper was entitled 
“Parental Leave and Child Health”.  He studied 25 years of 
population data from nine European countries and found a 29% 
reduction in infant mortality where parental leave of at least 50 
weeks was taken.  I found this really fascinating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the study he went on to highlight the significant benefits of 
breast feeding as result of the longer parental leave which the 
government has now introduced in its budget.  In fact my Bill 
C-204 proposes to extend parental leave benefits to a full year. 
The report also talked about breast feeding and about the lower 
incidence of sudden infant death syndrome.  That is one of the 
reasons I wanted to raise the question again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be a pattern.  There appear to be linkages.  I 
am hoping by asking the question that maybe we could find out a 
bit more about what Health Canada is doing to investigate the 
trends and linkages between the healthy raising and nurturing of 
children in those vital formative years and the incidence of 
sudden infant death syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here tonight again to ask if the parliamentary secretary 
could please advise Canadians and the House about other things 
Health Canada is doing to examine sudden infant death syndrome. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, sudden infant death syndrome or 
SIDS, also known as crib death, refers to the sudden and 
unexpected death of an apparently healthy infant, usually less 
than one year of age, which remains unexplained even after a full 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the specific cause of SIDS remains unknown, several 
risk factors have been identified through scientific research, 
including the tummy and side sleeping positions and exposure to 
tobacco smoke before and after birth.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>SIDS is the leading cause of death in Canada for infants between 
one month and one year of age, touching the lives of three 
families in this country each week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada, through the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance 
System, collects and analyses infant mortality information. Since 
1980 the overall rate of SIDS deaths in Canada has steadily 
declined.  This decline in SIDS rates coincides with the 
identification of risk factors and public education regarding 
these factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Health Canada co-sponsored a consensus conference on 
SIDS with the Canadian Paediatric Society, the Canadian Institute 
of Child Health and the Canadian Foundation for the Study of 
Infant Deaths.  This resulted in the development of a joint 
consensus statement and public awareness strategy to reduce the 
incidence of SIDS in Canada.  The key messages are:  positioning 
infants on their back to sleep; avoiding exposure to 
environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy; protecting infants 
from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; avoiding too many 
clothes and covers on babies; and the promotion of breast 
feeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1999 Health Canada and its three partners launched 
“Back to Sleep”, a national public education campaign to raise 
awareness and provide information on how to reduce the risk of 
SIDS.  The campaign includes a joint consensus statement, a 
brochure, a poster and a TV public service announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is through research, education and promotion that the 
incidence of SIDS in Canada can be further reduced.
