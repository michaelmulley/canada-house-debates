	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-354, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
and the Young Offenders Act (capital punishment).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon. member 
for Yorkton-Melville for seconding my bill.
<P>
	On June 21, 1994 I introduced Bill C-265. On March 4, 1996 I 
introduced Bill C-218 and on May 14 it was granted just one hour 
of debate. Today I will try yet again.
<P>
	The government continues to ignore the opinion of the majority 
of Canadians on the issue of capital punishment for first degree 
murder. It refuses to hold a binding national referendum to let the 
people decide.
<P>
	This bill, were it to come to a true free vote, would be the next 
best thing if MPs were allowed to vote the view of their 
constituents, rather than their conscience or their party's position.
<P>
	In addition to reinstating the death penalty for adults convicted 
of first degree murder, the bill also imposes a range of stiffer 
minimum sentences for youths convicted of first degree murder. 
Too many Canadians have died at the hands of violent criminals 
who exhibit no remorse for their horrendous crimes. Those 
individuals will never be rehabilitated no matter how long they 
remain in prison. In my opinion, breathing is too good for the likes 
of Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo.

Labrador which removes the rights to denominational classes of

<P>
	The petitioners remind the House that in June 1996 the Prime 
Minister of Canada announced that he would work toward 
diverting the Sable Island gas pipeline to Quebec City. They state it 
is unacceptable for the Prime Minister to decide the destination of 
Nova Scotia natural gas without consulting Nova Scotians, that 
Nova Scotians assert their right to control the destination of Sable 
Island gas and demand that the federal government cease

<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to legislate the prohibition in 
Canada of the use, production, stockpiling, sale, trade and transfer 
of all anti-personnel land mines; to work for a international 
convention banning these activities; to substantially increase 
Canadian contributions to the UN fund for assistance in mine

Bellechasse on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for 
Calgary West on behalf of the Reform Party and the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Transcona on behalf of the New Democratic Party.
<P>
	As a result of these discussions I understand that there would be 
unanimous consent to make a number of additional amendments to 
Bill C-63 regarding the contents and availability of the list of 
electors and the minimum period for byelections.
<P>
	All parties and the table have complete sets of these 
amendments. I could read each one to the House or the House could 
take them as read. In any case, I am asking for unanimous consent:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House order that the bill be so amended without debate or division.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if there is a disposition to give 
unanimous consent to the motion. I will deal with the question of 
whether the amendments should be put on the record in a moment.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say, with respect 
to whether unanimous consent should be granted, that the NDP will 
give its unanimous consent but will do so reluctantly in the sense 
that this process has not been well executed. It is an obvious case of 
closure having been moved too soon. The process has been rushed 
and rushed in such a way that, given the way the speaking roster 
works here, we have not had a chance to participate in this debate 
and will not as a result of the process. That will continue to be the 
case, which is why I wanted to rise on this point of order, to say that 
we are happy to co-operate in improving the bill but we wish the 
process had been one in which we had more opportunity to 
participate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I take it that there is unanimous consent.
<P>
	The other question is whether it would be prudent to put the 
amendments on the record or whether, if it is a long, complicated 
list, we should just have them printed in <I>Hansard</I>. Is there a 
disposition to have them deemed read for the record?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe there would be a disposition 
to deem them as having been read. I think you would find that the 
hon. minister will lead the debate. In fact, the government House 
leader will be dealing with each amendment in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Then I take it that there is a disposition to 
deem the amendments as having been read into the record. Is that 
agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Agreed and so ordered by unanimous 
consent.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to rise to support third reading of this bill.
<P>
	In the light of the discussion which has just taken place, I would 
like to put on the record some information about the amendments 
which have just been agreed to. May I suggest that, if it is the will 
of the House, this could well be material which could be printed as 
an appendix to <I>Hansard</I> or as an appendix to the record of today's 
proceedings.
<P>
	In any event, I would like to provide the following information 
about the amendments which we have just been discussing.
<P>
	The first item I would like to address is the matter of obtaining 
date of birth information about electors. An elector will be asked to 
provide his or her date of birth by enumerators during the last 
enumeration. This information will be particularly helpful in 
identifying and matching electors where addresses change. 
However, the date of birth information would only appear on the 
register, that is to say the permanent voters list maintained by the 
chief electoral officer and not on the list prepared from the register. 
This means that political parties and candidates will not receive 
date of birth information.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Then there is the amendment about using gender information 
about voters. Elections Canada will continue to gather this 
information during the last enumeration, which I will be 
discussing, and during both the annual updating process and during 
the revision period of an election. This information will contribute 
to the accuracy of voter identification.
<P>
	Gender information, however, will not be shared with parties or 
candidates. It will be information retained internally by Elections 
Canada to be shared with poll clerks for elections and with 
provincial elections officials if their legislation requires this 
information.
<P>
	Then there is an amendment about sharing the preliminary voters 
lists with parties. The bill provides that parties would receive an 
updated voters list each October 15. However, we have agreed to an 
amendment which means that registered parties will receive a 
preliminary voters list after the last door to door enumeration, 
which I will be discussing in my speech. The list will be made 
available within 30 days after the chief electoral officer gives 
notice in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> that the information is complete. This 
is a transitional measure.
<P>
	Of course, if an election is called sooner, the list will be available 
five days after the writ is issued.
<P>
	Finally, there is an amendment we have agreed to about 
byelections. This amendment will mean that byelections can be 
held no sooner than 47 days after the writ for the byelection has 
been issued so that the minimum period for an election campaign 
under the present law will continue to be 47 days for byelections. 
This will give opposition parties more time to prepare to take part 
in the byelections and is in response to a concern in that regard 
which we have all agreed to deal with through this amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now, as I have just said, I am pleased to rise in support of the 
third reading of Bill C-63. I would first thank the members of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for their 
diligence and the relevance of their observations, because the 
amendments they proposed are very valuable, and I would like to 
discuss them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I also want to thank other members who have not taken part in 
the work of the committee, particularly members of the New 
Democratic Party, for their consideration of amendments which I 
have mentioned and other amendments which were incorporated 
into the bill and voted on during report stage.
<P>
	At its heart this bill modernizes key elements of our electoral 
system. We need a contemporary, cost efficient system that allows 
for intergovernmental co-operation and builds on the latest 
technologies. We need a system that is cost effective and yet at the 
same time helps ensure that the high voter turnout which has been 
typical of our federal elections continues to be the case. I think this 
is something important for the health of our democratic system of 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6713"> 6713 </A></B>
<P>
	I submit that the bill, particularly with the amendments which 
have been proposed during the committee process and those which 
we have agreed to today, will help us ensure the achievement of 
these objectives.
<P>
	The bill has four key elements. It provides for the shortening of 
the general electoral period from a minimum of 47 days to a 
minimum of 36 days, beginning with the next general election.
<P>
	Second, it provides for one last door to door enumeration to take 
place prior to the next election to provide both the preliminary 
voters list within five days of the call of the next election and also 
to provide the basis for a permanent electoral list based on a 
permanent register of electors.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	Third, the bill provides for the creation of a permanent register 
of electors intended to be used for the general election and all 
general elections after the next one.
<P>
	Finally, the bill proposes changes in voting hours which, through 
a procedure committee amendment, would establish a voting day 
schedule that responds to concerns on the part of many western 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize the considerable and necessary work 
that preceded the introduction of this bill. Over the course of 
several years, beginning with the work of the Royal Commission 
on Electoral Reform and Party Financing, otherwise known as the 
Lortie commission, and the work of the Standing Committee on 
Electoral Reform, many elements of this bill were explored.
<P>
	The Lortie commission conducted an extensive study of the 
voter registration system that benefited from much and varied 
input. This work was complemented by that of Elections Canada 
over several years, sometimes in conjunction with provincial 
counterparts and sometimes in conjunction with the procedure and 
House affairs committee or its predecessor. This has all been 
necessary work in the ongoing process of modernizing our 
electoral system and had to be completed before this bill could be 
introduced because it provided the foundation, the basis for this 
bill. The chief electoral officer and his staff had worked on the 
register project for some two years before this bill was introduced 
and during this two year period briefed the procedure and House 
affairs committee on several occasions.
<P>
	As I have noted there would be one final nationwide 
enumeration conducted prior to the next election using traditional 
door to door procedures. The timing of this enumeration means 
Canada could move to a shorter minimum campaign period, one of 
36 days, in time for the next election.
<P>
	The 1991 royal commission, the Lortie commission, expressed 
the view that Canadians would favour a  shortened electoral period. 
In the words of the commissioners, lengthy elections produced the 
most evident criticism among the intervenors. The merits of the 
shortened campaign I think we should know gained much editorial 
support in the days following the introduction of this bill.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer has stated it would be feasible to 
launch this last enumeration by April 1, 1997 and complete it 
within 21 to 25 days. After its completion, the final enumeration 
would be used to produce the preliminary list of electors for the 
next general election. Candidates would receive the preliminary 
list within five days of the issuance of the writs.
<P>
	As I have said, through an amendment, neither the campaign 
period lists nor the annual list for parties would identify the gender 
of voters. This information would be kept internal to Elections 
Canada and federal poll officials and provided, if required, to 
provincial elections officials.
<P>
	It is the quick availability of this preliminary list and future lists 
that makes it feasible to reduce the electoral period from a 
minimum of 47 days to a minimum of 36 days. I stress that even so, 
parties and candidates would have a week longer to campaign using 
the preliminary lists than is the case now with the minimum 47 day 
campaign.
<P>
	Through a committee amendment accepted by the House there 
will be more certainty as to when Canada moves to this shorter 
campaign calendar. The amendment provides that the chief 
electoral officer could not conduct the one last enumeration I have 
mentioned until April 1, 1997. This enumeration would take a total 
of 21 to 25 days. Once it is completed, the Prime Minister could 
take steps leading to the issuance of a writ for a general election 
based on the 36 day campaign. Of course an election could be 
called earlier but it would be under the current 47 day minimum 
calendar.
<P>
	A shortened campaign also means a change to the time frame 
within which parties must advise broadcasters of the hours and 
schedule for the advertising time they wish to purchase. Another 
committee amendment adopted by the House during report stage 
ensures parties will have a rolling window of up to 10 days after the 
writs are issued to file their advertising plans even though the 
minimum election period is reduced to 36 days. This change will be 
of obvious benefit both to political parties and to broadcasters.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	When we enter the next election period there will be another 
significant change because of an amendment made in committee 
which was adopted by this House during report stage. The schedule 
of voting hours will be revised to respond to the concerns of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6714"> 6714 </A></B>
<P>
western Canadians  about when the results of voting in the east are 
available in the west.
<P>
	The polls will close at different times across the country after a 
longer period for voting. The local times to close the polls would be 
8.30 p.m. in Newfoundland and in the remaining Atlantic 
provinces; 9.30 p.m. in Quebec and Ontario; 8.30 p.m. in Manitoba 
and Saskatchewan; 7.30 p.m. in Alberta and the Northwest 
Territories; and 7 p.m. in British Columbia and the Yukon. The 
voting day in each time zone would run for 12 hours. Canadians 
would have to be given three consecutive hours of time off from 
work to vote instead of four as it is at present.
<P>
	This amendment strikes a sensible and a practical balance on 
voting hours in a country that spans six time zones. The new hours 
minimize the inconvenience to voters and polling staff and reduce 
the prospect that British Columbians would still be voting when 
preliminary results from the east suggest the outcome of the 
general election.
<P>
	I wish to note that the permanent register of electors will begin to 
be built through the enumeration, the one last enumeration, 
conducted before the next election. Enumerators will ask electors 
to provide their full name, gender, address and to confirm they are 
18 years of age or older and are Canadian citizens.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my speech on second reading, after this 
enumeration, Elections Canada would continue its work with the 
provinces and territories to secure data to be used to build up the 
register and of course for the annual update. Elections Canada, and 
again I outlined this in an earlier stage of debate, would continue to 
work with Revenue Canada and Citizenship and Immigration 
Canada. This work would likely be completed by the late summer 
or early fall of 1997 which would allow the first annual distribution 
of the lists based on the permanent register of electors by October 
15.
<P>
	What are some other positive aspects of this bill? The permanent 
register of electors would be maintained and kept election ready by 
Elections Canada. It would keep the list current by drawing on 
certain federal and provincial data sources which as I have said I 
outlined in earlier stages of debate.
<P>
	Once the writs are issued for an election there will also be a more 
streamlined revision process during the electoral period to ensure 
that all Canadians have the opportunity to have their names on the 
voting lists and to be able to vote. Of course I am obviously talking 
about eligible Canadians. Enhanced revision would include 
targeted door to door enumeration in areas of known high mobility, 
the use of mail out, mail back revision cards, enhanced public 
information campaigns and conveniently located voter registration 
booths.
<P>
	The register project also supports the goal of improved 
federal-provincial co-operation and the reduction of overlap and 
duplication.
<P>
	As a result of an amendment made in committee again adopted 
in this House during report stage, the chief electoral officer will be 
able to use provincial lists both to build and maintain the federal 
register. Certain conditions would apply to the use of such lists to 
ensure the accuracy and quality of the federal register. The 
amendment allows the use of provincial lists for this purpose if the 
provincial lists are recent, completed within 12 months of the date 
of the last door to door federal enumeration called to build the 
register, and the provincial lists meet the requirements of the 
federal chief electoral officer for federal enumerations.
<P>
	This amendment likely means that the list of electors in Prince 
Edward Island and Alberta could be used next spring to build the 
federal register since I understand that in the view of the chief 
electoral officer they would likely meet these requirements. It 
would therefore not be necessary to have a federal door to door 
enumeration in these two provinces.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	I should note that public opinion research demonstrates that 
Canadians support the concept of a register and lists built upon it. 
They are particularly attracted to the register's convenience, cost 
savings and prospects for better federal-provincial co-operation in 
electoral administration.
<P>
	At this point I want to make some considerations about the 
register quite clear.
<P>
	The existence of a register of electors would not prevent a citizen 
from exercising his or her constitutionally protected right to vote.
<P>
	The bill respects electors' privacy and takes steps to ensure the 
confidentiality of their personal information by insisting on the 
active consent of a citizen for information about that person to be 
provided from federal taxation and citizenship sources. As well and 
as a result of an amendment made in committee, again adopted 
during report stage here in the House, the bill now obliges the chief 
electoral officer to change any voter information upon proper 
request from the voter.
<P>
	In addition the bill now states that information shared with a 
province can only be used by it for electoral purposes. This 
limitation would be stipulated in any information sharing 
agreement with a province. The proposed bill which we are now 
debating also makes it clear who would be entitled to receive 
copies of the list based on the permanent register of electors and 
that the list would have to be confined to electoral purposes as 
defined in the bill.
<P>
	I also want to say that another amendment which we have 
adopted and which was first made in committee would mean 
parties receive the updated register, or to put it another way, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6715"> 6715 </A></B>
<P>
lists based on the register by October 15 of each year rather than 
November 15 as originally foreseen.
<P>
	Elections Canada can update the register using the critical and 
most current voter information provided by Revenue Canada and 
other data suppliers before sharing lists based on the register with 
parties. For its part Revenue Canada will provide information 
based on the most recent income tax forms.
<P>
	The House will recall that I said at an earlier stage of debate that 
there would have to be a positive indication, that is a marking in a 
box on the income tax form, by electors that they are willing to 
have certain information from their income tax files shared with 
Elections Canada.
<P>
	I have also pointed out that there would be no interconnection of 
computers between Elections Canada and Revenue Canada and 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Instead, the data would have 
to be hand carried in the form of disks or tapes over to Elections 
Canada, a further protection with respect to the privacy of the voter.
<P>
	It is worth noting again that there has been considerable support 
for this bill by editorial writers. Generally editorialists in a number 
of cities across the country welcome the key elements of the bill, as 
well as the safeguards for the protection of personal information 
and cost savings inherent in the proposed changes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By way of conclusion, I would like to point out that Bill C-63 
will result in a number of major changes to our electoral system. It 
will enable us to modernize the system, improve intergovernmental 
co-operation, reduce the risk of overlap, realize considerable 
savings and further protect voters' rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me say a word about the savings to taxpayers. This bill if 
adopted would mean that there would be savings to taxpayers of 
some $30 million for each election once the lists based on a 
permanent register of electors were in use. Some $8 million of 
savings are included in this $30 million which are brought about by 
the shorter election period. Just having the shorter election period 
itself would save taxpayers some $8 million for each election.
<P>
	I conclude by asking for the approval of this bill in this House by 
way of third reading. It comes to us after considerable debate in 
committee with amendments which the government has been 
happy to recommend to the House for approval, as well as 
amendments that were made just at the last minute. I again thank 
all members of the House for their indulgence in allowing these 
changes to be made, which reflect further proposals which I think 
make this a better bill.
<P>
	This is a good bill in the interests of all Canadians and I again 
ask for its support on third reading.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. FranÃ§ois Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, 
for the last time, we will debate at third reading Bill C-63, an act to 
amend the Canada Elections Act, the Parliament of Canada Act and 
the Referendum Act.
<P>
	It is with great disappointment that the official opposition found 
itself caught in this spiral that kept winding faster and faster as time 
went by.
<P>
	My remarks will bear the stamp of civility while at the same 
time revealing a deep flaw, a major deficiency in the system for 
drafting and adopting electoral legislation.
<P>
	Before starting my speech, I want to thank the chief government 
whip, the hon. member for Stormont-Dundas, for his excellent 
work on this issue although he was pitched into his new position as 
the chief government whip at the last minute to participate in a 
debate whose direction I feel eluded him. So, none of what I am 
about to say is directed at him personally.
<P>
	However, I have been on the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs since the very beginning of this Parliament, in 
January 1994. At the time, the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs was chaired by our colleague, the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands, who is now the Deputy Chairman of 
Committees of the Whole.
<P>
	Over the weeks, months and years that the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs worked together, a relationship of 
trust was built that spread to every member of the committee. On 
many occasions, both the government and the opposition went the 
extra mile to achieve a consensus. Very seldom, since the 
beginning of the 35th Parliament, have we in the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs needed to take a vote. 
Generally, we would come to an agreement or, where unanimity 
was not possible, we would deal with matters at hand in such depth 
that the stakes were clear. No one came out feeling someone 
had-pardon the expression-pulled a fast one on them; all the ins 
and outs of the matter were on the table, and the way proceedings at 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs were 
rushed during the first session of the 35th Parliament was not 
justified.
<P>
	To show you how much things have changed, let me explain to 
you how things were done. You probably remember, because it was 
debated at such length in this House, Bill C-69 to amend the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. How was this bill 
developed in a non-partisan manner? And look how long it took.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6716"> 6716 </A></B>
<P>
	First, on March 17, 1994, the hon. Leader of the Government 
in the House of Commons tabled in this House an order of 
reference that was debated. The order of reference read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs be instructed to 
prepare and bring in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 68(5), respecting the 
system of readjusting the boundaries of electoral districts for the House of Commons 
by Electoral Boundaries Commissions, and, in preparing the said bill, the committee 
be instructed to consider, among other related matters, the general operation over the 
past thirty years of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, including:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a formula to cap or reduce the number of seats in the House of Commons;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) a review of the adequacy of the present method of selection of members of 
Electoral Boundary Commissions;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) a review of the rules governing and the powers and methods of proceeding of 
Electoral Boundary Commissions, including whether those Commissions ought to 
commence their work from the basis of making necessary alterations to the 
boundaries of existing electoral districts wherever possible;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) a review of the time and nature of the involvement of the public and the House of 
Commons in the work of Electoral Boundary Commissions;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the committee have the power to travel within Canada and to hear witnesses 
by teleconference; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the committee report no later than December 16, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	The order of reference proposed by the government House leader 
was adopted on Tuesday, April 19, 1994. This is an important date 
to remember. The Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs subsequently held meetings on the following dates in 1994: 
June 7, 9, 14 and 21; July 5, 6 and 7; September 27 and 29; October 
4, 20 and 25; and November 1, 3, 15, 17 and 22. Following this, the 
committee tabled in the House Bill C-69, which was read for the 
first time on February 16, 1995. Second reading took place on 
February 25, 1995, while third reading was on April 25, 1996. The 
Senate passed the bill on June 8, 1995.
<P>
	Taking into account only the process that took place in this 
House, a notice was given by the government House leader on 
March 17, 1994, and the bill finally passed third reading on April 
25, 1995, more than 13 months after the House was notified.
<P>
	The official opposition expected the same process. It expected 
the government to have the House pass an order of reference 
instructing the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to hold hearings and to prepare a bill on the establishment 
of a permanent register of electors for all of Canada.
<P>
	We did some preliminary work anticipating that such an order 
would come. We listened to the people from Elections Canada, who 
came to tell us about certain theories, certain possibilities with 
respect to drawing up a  permanent list and changing polling station 
hours in western Canada and the rest of the country.
<P>
	The last hearing we had, in fact, was on April 30, when 
Jean-Pierre Kingsley, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, came 
to make his last presentation and told us that he had to have 
legislation in place before the summer recess, before the end of 
June, so that it could be in effect for the next election. Thereafter, 
the official opposition was given no information whatsoever on 
developments.
<P>
	What happened, while we were waiting in vain for an order of 
reference from the government? We honestly believed that the 
government had simply abandoned the idea of drawing up a 
permanent list of voters in the short term. The next thing we 
learned came not from the chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, not through a government order in 
the House, but in the form of a telephone call I received in the 
afternoon of October 3 from GeneviÃ¨ve Rossier, a Radio-Canada 
journalist, asking me what I thought of the bill that was going to be 
tabled. Between April 30 and October 3, my information came 
from Radio-Canada. It is just a little frustrating for a 
parliamentarian to learn from Radio-Canada and CBC as well that a 
bill concerning the establishment of a voters list is going to be 
tabled.
<P>
	Radio-Canada's 11 o'clock evening news confirmed that Mrs. 
Rossier had been right on the mark, because her interview with Mr. 
Kingsley and with the Leader of the Government in the House 
made it clear that a bill was in the offing.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Subsequently, the bill was tabled here in the House, for referral 
to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs before 
second reading. In fact, it was to be rushed through this committee 
with undue haste, so much so that it was actually difficult to follow 
the debate.
<P>
	I submit that in a non-partisan matter that should have led to 
wide-ranging consultations across Canada on establishing a 
permanent list of electors, a fundamental amendment to the Canada 
Elections Act, we should have sought the broadest possible 
consensus.
<P>
	As this debate draws to a close, I repeat that if today's vote were 
to show that the government does not have substantial support 
among the opposition parties, this bill should simply be withdrawn. 
It would not make sense and in fact it would be risky to go into an 
election when a bill to amend the Canada Elections Act and the 
Referendum Act is passed by the only party that has a majority. I 
say this because the Canada Elections Act does not exist for the 
benefit of one party or all parties, although they are affected by this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6717"> 6717 </A></B>
<P>
legislation. This legislation is above all important to the voters we 
represent.
<P>
	The partisan approach to the consideration of this bill in 
committee, and all the murky circumstances around its tabling-I 
will get back to that in a minute-argue against the government 
going ahead if it does not enjoy substantial support from the 
opposition parties. The government and those who will be asked to 
take a second look at this bill will have to consider the following 
question: How was it passed?
<P>
	Of course, there are a number of factors that could explain, not 
excuse, the present situation. The first session of the 35th 
Parliament was prorogued. A new session started last March. All 
parliamentary secretaries were replaced, including the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands who was Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House. Here was 
a man of consensus, a team worker who had managed to make the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs a 
non-partisan committee. His successor had to take over the 
committee in circumstances he was probably not able to control 
entirely and with an agenda that was not his own. I am not pointing 
the finger at him, but when all of the parliamentary secretaries are 
changed from one day to the next, there are major side effects.
<P>
	The most important one is that the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs ended up with a chair who had no 
prior knowledge of the operations of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. He will learn in time, of course, but 
at a point when legislation involving the election process was being 
worked on by the members of that committee, there seems to have 
been no continuity in the chairmanship.
<P>
	This is a direct link. If I remember correctly-and I stand to be 
called to order if my information is not correct-procedure and 
House affairs is the only committee headed by a parliamentary 
secretary. He is linked directly to the minister responsible for 
election legislation. The parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader is linked directly with his minister, who ought 
normally to know where the government is headed in terms of the 
Elections Act.
<P>
	Another unfortunate event beyond our control, and one which 
may well explain part of the situation, is the illness of the hon. 
Leader of the Government in this House. Obviously, when a man of 
this calibre, with all of his wealth of knowledge of this institution, 
has to take time off to recuperate and get back on his feet, the 
cabinet is missing a key element. We have all noted the effects the 
absence of the hon. member for Windsor West has had on the 
government. Far be it from me to criticize his behaviour in any 
way, but it is a factor to be considered. I quickly and carefully 
looked at the events that could have affected the consideration of 
this bill and how it was dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The consensus I spoke of earlier was at the time-and I refer to 
last spring-that we would have an order of reference to enable the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to draft a bill.
<P>
	This would involve the committee's hearing witnesses; asking 
them questions; hearing people in videoconferences; doing 
simulations involving, for example, the opening of polls; meeting 
people from British Columbia to ask them what this means to them; 
having the broadest possible discussions so as to have the 
information needed, perhaps not for a consensus, but to know what 
is in the bill so that each member of the committee can say why a 
given comma is where it is.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
prepared 23 drafts of Bill C-69. Twenty-three drafts were 
produced; the three parties were present. The Liberal Party, the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party were there for each of the 23 
drafts. The changes made in the formulation of Bill C-69 were at 
the request of one or the other of the parties. Some even felt that we 
had taken too long. There is no such thing as too much time when 
one wants to do a good job. We produced an excellent bill that was 
both well drafted and easy to understand.
<P>
	The official opposition voted against the bill, but knowing what 
was in it. We voted against it for one main reason: it did not retain 
as a criterion a 25 per cent minimum representation for Quebec. In 
fact, Bill C-69 should be reintroduced to be passed again so that it 
could apply to a subsequent Parliament. As for the rest, we know 
the bill inside out since all the parties have worked on it for more 
than a year.
<P>
	For reasons best known to themselves, Reformers also voted 
against the bill. It was easy for them to speak to the bill since they 
were already familiar with its content.
<P>
	Today, it is quite another story. Not only did the committee not 
develop the bill, not only was it obviously instructed to go full 
steam ahead, but we now find ourselves at the last minute with 
amendments to be tabled.
<P>
	Perhaps some of this can be explained by the fact that Elections 
Canada resigned-this is an interesting slip of the tongue. It did not 
resign, its offices were moved from Telesat Court to Slater Street. 
Also, from time to time, they are seen in the Liberal Party's lobby, 
which we find disturbing.
<P>
	Elections Canada's attitude on this issue is bizarre. I mentioned 
earlier that Mr. Kingsley had appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs on April 30. In his 
testimony, he said that, if we wanted to establish a permanent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6718"> 6718 </A></B>
<P>
voters list, we should do so before the summer recess, which was 
not done.
<P>
	The question I asked myself then and still ask myself now is: Did 
Elections Canada lose faith in the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs and stop dealing with this committee, 
which is responsible for electoral issues, preferring to go directly to 
the government, or did the reverse happen? Is it the government 
that lost faith in the committee, because it was not proceeding 
quickly enough and thus decided to rely on Elections Canada? We 
still do not know.
<P>
	Given the nature of the situation, there is an element of doubt. 
Some trust will have to be re-established, because it was destroyed. 
Members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs have a right to wonder whether Elections Canada played a 
double role.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Since we did not get answers, because the answers provided by 
Elections Canada officials who testified before the committee were 
vague in many respects, we have reasons to believe that the 
situation was foggy, to say the least, as regards relations between 
Elections Canada and the government's legislative body, that is to 
say, us, and its executive branch, which is the cabinet. Indeed, all 
these questions remain.
<P>
	I do hope, and I am optimistic given the quality of the people 
working for Elections Canada, that these bridges can be rebuilt. 
However, I ask Elections Canada officials to be very cautious when 
they have to deal with both the legislative and the executive 
powers. The principle that no one can serve two masters at the 
same time is even more important in the case of legislation such as 
the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act.
<P>
	These were our observations on the form. Let us now look at the 
content as such. First, we are told, as regards the establishment of a 
permanent voters list, that the bill is essential because it will allow 
us to create such a list. I believe all the members of this House who 
spoke on the issue support the principle of a permanent voters list 
and a shorter election campaign that would last 36 days instead of 
47.
<P>
	I encountered very little opposition to the principle from any 
party, but then there is a second question: When will the permanent 
list of voters be ready? The list the government is talking about will 
not be ready for the next election, and will not be used to elect the 
301 members of the 36th Parliament. Barring an early election, in 
the case of a minority government, that list will be ready for the 
election of the 37th Parliament, a good 6 or 7 years from now. This 
is the bill we are debating under emergency procedures, and with 
time allocation yesterday, without in-depth debate by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, and also without 
in-depth debate during consideration at report stage yesterday, and 
at second reading, not that there actually was one, and today, again 
under time allocation, at third reading.
<P>
	Why rush through legislation that will be used only 6 or 7 years 
from now? That is the real question. The question is not whether or 
not we want a permanent list. Of course we do. But not at any cost, 
and certainly not in such a headlong rush.
<P>
	They could very well have waited and gone with the principle 
that the next election campaign would operate under the existing 
legislation, but that the enumeration for the next election would be 
the last door-to-door enumeration, that the data gathered for the 
election of the next Parliament would form the basis of a 
permanent list of voters, that would then be used in 6 or 7 years' 
time to elect the 37th Parliament. That was the only amendment we 
really needed: authorize Canada's chief electoral officer to use the 
next enumeration done during an election campaign, and after the 
writs are issued, authorize him to use this list as the basis for 
drawing up his permanent list of voters.
<P>
	Instead, we have a bill with a multitude of provisions: it tries to 
cover everything and falls miserably short. Consequently, we find 
ourselves faced with a bill most members of this House are not 
very familiar with, since we have not had the time to go into what it 
is really all about, all of its objectives, or how it intends to attain 
them, but I will address a few points. In principle, yes, a permanent 
electors list, because the tools are there, the computer possibilities 
are there, the data banks are there to establish one.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	We are no longer in the horse and buggy age, we are in the age of 
the Internet, with easily accessible data banks on voters. Let a 
permanent list be drawn up, then, but not in the way Bill C-63 
proposes.
<P>
	Second, we have raised the question of the terminology used in 
Bill C-63, the fact that Bill C-63 and the Elections Act in general 
speak of ``<I>rÃ©sidence ordinaire</I>'' or ``main residence'', as the 
qualification for voting in a given riding.
<P>
	This concept of ``main residence'' is a concept of common law. 
It is not a concept in Quebec civil law. I respect this notion in 
common law. Its application to the provinces operating under 
common law is most understandable, but as far as Quebec is 
concerned, where we have had a codification of our French legal 
customs since 1866, the concept of ``main residence'' is not an 
acceptable one. In Quebec, the concept of ``domicile'' is what must 
be used.
<P>
	Am I surprised by this? Yes and no. Let us recall that on 
November 29, 1995, the Right Hon. Prime Minister tabled a 
resolution before this House concerning recognition of Quebec as a 
distinct society.
<P>
	What does that motion say?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6719"> 6719 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the people of Quebec have expressed the desire for recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the House recognize that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) the House encourage all components of the legislative and executive branches 
of government to take note of this recognition and be guided in their conduct 
accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
And the motion was passed by the Liberal majority in this House.
<P>
	There is an order from the House encouraging ``all components 
of the legislative and executive branches of government to take 
note of this recognition'' of the distinct society. It is also an order to 
law editors to take note that there is a society based on the French 
civil code in Canada and that society is in Quebec. When our law 
editors write a text in which they use the terms ``main residence'' 
or ``rÃ©sidence ordinaire'', they are in fact infringing on an order of 
the House instructing them to take note of the fact that Quebec is a 
distinct society.
<P>
	During the debate on November 29, 1995, we said that the 
government was just paying lip service to this concept when it said 
it would recognize the distinct society. Today we have proof 
positive. Even the law clerks in the Privy Council and at the 
Department of Justice failed to take into consideration the concept 
of ``domicile'' which is used in Quebec in accordance with the civil 
code and goes back to 1866, Quebec having legislative authority in 
this area pursuant to sub-section 92(13) of the <I>British North 
America Act, 1867</I>. This power is not recent. It has been around 
since well before November 29, 1995. In fact, it goes back to well 
before 1876, because it was in the custom of Paris which we 
codified in 1866.
<P>
	That being said, we had no illusions on November 29, when the 
government rushed in with a motion recognizing Quebec as a 
distinct society. The hon. member for Calgary West raised a few 
questions yesterday about this distinct society. Perhaps I could take 
a few minutes to explain what distinct society means, because 
everyone talks about distinct society but is not necessarily referring 
to the same thing.
<P>
	There is the distinct society of November 29, 1995, which means 
nothing at all. There is the distinct society of Charlottetown, which 
is equally meaningless. And there was the distinct society of 
Meech Lake, remember, the one that was supposed to mean 
something but was never ratified because two legislatures, 
Manitoba and Newfoundland, refused to give their consent.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	What was the meaning of distinct society in the Meech Lake 
accord? It meant that Canada's Constitution would  have a section 
with priority over sections 91 and 92, essentially, the two sections 
dealing with the distribution of powers between the provinces and 
the federal government.
<P>
	In other words, one section would be above these two and would 
indicate to the courts that they were to interpret sections 91 and 92 
of the Canadian Constitution in light of the fact that Quebec must, 
in order to meet its objectives, have more powers than the other 
provinces.
<P>
	That is the distinct society in the Meech Lake accord. It was not 
the November 29 one, nor the Charlottetown one, it was the Meech 
Lake one. I am sure the hon. member for Calgary West, even 
though he did not share the intentions we had at the time for the 
distinct society, understood very well, since he and his colleagues 
explained the meaning of distinct society at the time quite well to 
their electors in western Canada: a section establishing a special 
status and entirely distinct and different powers for Quebec.
<P>
	Even that was denied. Two legislatures abstained from ratifying 
it. Even the 1987 Meech Lake accord was rejected. That was a pity.
<P>
	On the other hand, it made it possible to get at the heart of the 
issue. Like the present bill, the Meech Lake accord was concluded 
behind closed doors. People were not consulted in their 
communities pretty much throughout the country. It was an 
agreement between 11 first ministers who tried to have their 
legislatures ratify, without public consultation, without a 
referendum, the new system of law wanted for Canada.
<P>
	Since then, it has somehow become customary, in constitutional 
affairs, to consider referenda as the norm in Canada. We 
experienced it in Charlottetown, we experienced it in Quebec last 
October 30, and we will experience it again one day on the same 
issue, in circumstances which, this time, should be more 
favourable.
<P>
	This bill goes further than the Meech Lake accord, because it is 
important to recall what happened in Meech Lake. The Bloc 
Quebecois, the official opposition, is the result of the failure of the 
Meech Lake accord. If the Meech Lake accord had been ratified by 
Manitoba and by the Newfoundland Legislative Assembly, we 
would not be here today. We are the result of the failure of the 
Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Mr. Bouchard, left the 
government following the failure of the Meech Lake accord, 
because the hon. member for Sherbrooke, who still sits in this 
House, wanted to water it down. It was at that moment. We came 
very close to an agreement which, it seems, would have been 
enough for a majority of Quebecers at the time. This would not 
have been the case for several members of the Bloc who, because 
of their sovereignist convictions, felt that the accord did not go far 
enough, but a magic bond was formed at that time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6720"> 6720 </A></B>
<P>
	When the Meech Lake accord failed, Quebecers of all political 
stripes-members of the Liberal Party, the Parti Quebecois and 
other, less representative political movements-rallied behind the 
notion of distinct society in the Meech Lake accord, a notion that 
no one defends any more.
<P>
	The bill mentions the use of some lists of electors. So, the Chief 
Electoral Officer of Canada will be allowed to hold an 
enumeration. This will probably take place next April if the bill is 
passed by the House and the Senate. For approximately three 
weeks, the Chief Electoral Officer may send people door to door to 
do an enumeration. In some provinces, he may also make 
arrangements with provincial electoral officers. This will certainly 
be the case in Alberta and Prince Edward Island, where programs 
and lists have been established with the help of Elections Canada as 
part of a joint project with the provinces.
<P>
	As for British Columbia and Quebec, since we represent the 
people of Quebec, Quebec's lists will neither be used nor usable. 
One of the amendments put forward in committee, without 
specifically naming any province, excludes the use of Quebec's 
permanent list for the purposes of Bill C-63. This list will be 
available as of next May 1, that is, in the days following the end of 
the Chief Electoral Officer's mandate. Why? Because a little 
technical, harmless-looking amendment says that a provincial list 
may be used provided the door-to-door enumeration was conducted 
in the previous 12 months. In Quebec, however, the enumeration 
used to establish a permanent list was done in September 1995, 
whereas the list itself will be ready and completely up-to-date May 
1. Since these two events are more than 12 months apart, the Chief 
Electoral Officer of Canada cannot use the list of electors.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	And yet the list will be established using taxpayers' money, 
those same taxpayers who paid for the establishment of the 
permanent list in Quebec and for the expertise of those who 
established it, and they will have to watch as enumerators do it all 
over again, when we could have had just one list using the same 
data base. We have only to redistribute voters according to the 
proper ridings. This is feasible; Quebec does it for municipal 
elections where districts are different. We have only to exchange 
information and communicate, and we will be able to use Quebec's 
list.
<P>
	Savings would exceed $15 to $20 million; we are not talking 
about $10,000. Or even the cost to reprint an amended bill. Savings 
would be significant. At a time when everybody is asked to tighten 
their belt, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada is not allowed to 
use Quebec's electoral list, or British Columbia's for that matter.
<P>
	My colleagues will raise other points. For my part, I am going to 
deal with the issue of polling hours. Bill C-63 contains clauses
<P>
providing for the staggering of polling hours across Canada. As a 
result, polling stations in the east will stay open later. For instance, 
in Ottawa, polling stations will stay open until 9.30 p.m., whereas 
in British Columbia they will stay open until 7 p.m.
<P>
	There has been no trial run. What appears in Bill C-63 has not 
even been submitted by Elections Canada to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs as a working 
assumption. They pulled this out of a hat and this is the rabbit we 
got. The trick was that we did not know.
<P>
	Yesterday, during debate, I listened to my colleagues from 
central Canada who, much more than I, will be affected by the 
change, and the closing of polls at nine thirty did not seem to 
represent a major change for them; for British Columbia however, 
closing the polls at seven means a very major change. Yesterday, 
the members for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley and 
Saanich-Gulf Islands mentioned all the drawbacks this measure 
could cause.
<P>
	The member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley said that 
many constituents from the town of Surrey and the vicinity, who 
work in Vancouver and finish working at five or five thirty, will not 
make it back to their riding in time to vote if the polls close at 
seven. That is a serious problem.
<P>
	I think we should put aside the section on the polling hours and, 
since there is no need to hurry, the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs should study Bill C-307 presented by 
the member for Vancouver East and hear witnesses, like the people 
from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Atlantic 
region, to find out what they think.
<P>
	How will that measure be applied in real life? Will we have to 
allow advance voting for 10,000 people in each riding? This is of 
serious concern to us. We ask the government to reconsider that 
provision and to allow Bill C-307 to be studied further since we 
have sufficient time to deal with this before the start of the next 
election campaign.
<P>
	The last point also concerns the polling hours. Not only are we 
reducing the number of hours for the polls, we are also reducing 
from 4 to 3 the minimum number of hours that employers will have 
to give their employees for the vote.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	If we remove the busiest hours, what we could call the golden 
hours of polling, we will have problems, because most people do 
not vote in the morning, at lunch time or early in the afternoon, but 
right after work. Yet, what we are saying to the people in Surrey, 
Langley, Vancouver, Squamish, and even in Calgary and 
Edmonton, Alberta is: ``You will have to vote much earlier, or else 
you will not have time to go to the polling station''. What is the 
voter 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6721"> 6721 </A></B>
<P>
going to do? What are members of electoral  organizations going to 
do? They will have to work like mad to let people vote in advanced 
polls, they will be pulling their hair out on election day, because 
they will not have enough time.
<P>
	What I am saying is that we did not think long enough about the 
opening hours of polling stations and I believe we would be better 
off keeping the present system for one more election rather than 
rushing into something that will make people who are unable to 
take time off work feel disenfranchised. We are trying to deal with 
a problem, but coming up with a cure which is worse than the 
disease.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising today at third reading of Bill C-63, an act to amend the 
Canada Elections Act, the Referendum Act and the Parliament of 
Canada Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In speaking on behalf of the Reform Party, I intend to oppose this 
bill that imposes changes to the federal elections act without the 
consent of the opposition parties. These changes are not necessary 
and they are also dangerous to the operation of Canadian 
democracy.
<P>
	I also want to note that, in the case of Quebec, it has been 
decided not to use the data in Quebec's permanent list of electors to 
establish the computerized federal register. Instead, a last door to 
door enumeration will take place next spring in Quebec and 
elsewhere, according to a decision resulting from unfortunate and 
costly choices made by the government in this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In laying out the Reform position I would like to note that three 
major parts, three major changes or major initiatives are 
undertaken in this legislation. First is the establishment of a 
permanent register of electors. Second is the establishment of a 
36-day calendar rather than the present 47-day calendar for the the 
holding of federal election campaigns. Both of these changes are to 
be implemented at the time of the next election by way of a 
pre-election enumeration. Finally, a clause in this bill staggers 
voting hours across the country.
<P>
	All three of these changes have been supported in principle by 
the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois and other political parties. 
The problem is the method of implementation chosen which 
particularly in the case of the permanent voters' list and the 36-day 
campaign will prove to be premature and costly in the way they are 
being implemented. In the case of staggered voting hours, that is 
being done in a way that requires much broader consultation and 
consensus to be acceptable to western Canadians.
<P>
	I should note, in making this observation, that broadly speaking 
we would support these initiatives if we could come to some kind 
of agreement. I note there are a number of issues not covered in this 
legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party has favoured for a number of years initiatives 
which would result in fixed election dates in the country within the 
context of a parliamentary system, allowing for the provision of a 
normal time period for the holding of an election which could be 
violated in exceptional circumstances but not normally. We have 
supported initiatives that would remove federal political parties 
from the various subsidies and tax concessions that they now 
receive. This would get federal political parties out of the tax 
trough.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	These changes are not incorporated in the bill. Neither are 
similar concerns which have been raised by the Bloc Quebecois 
and go in a completely different direction. For years the Bloc 
Quebecois has favoured the public subsidization of political parties 
and would like to see various provisions of Quebec electoral law 
implemented at the federal level. These would control the spending 
and money raising of political parties. As well, the Bloc Quebecois 
favours restrictions on third party advertising, or the gag law, 
which the Reform Party opposes and which has been struck down 
in court.
<P>
	As well, both the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois differ 
with the government on fundamental issues of representation. For 
example, the Bloc Quebecois favours a 25 per cent minimum 
provision of Commons seats for Quebec. In our case, we support 
Senate reform, a triple E Senate in particular, and regional 
representation.
<P>
	None of those things are found in the bill. Obviously there is no 
consensus on them. I mention them because they are important 
items and we would like the government and the procedure and 
House affairs committee to study them. I also mention them to 
make it clear that, in spite of our very different approaches and 
opinions on these very contentious issues, they are not the reason 
we lack unanimous agreement for the bill.
<P>
	It would be irresponsible for the Reform Party or the Bloc to 
hold up positive changes to federal election law because some 
other things are not in the bill. They did not have all party support. 
We certainly have not done that and we do not intend to do it.
<P>
	That is not why we object to this legislation. We object to this 
legislation because of its substantive contents. In our view the 
principles in the bill are not being properly or well implemented. 
Just as important, the process followed in developing the bill has 
been terribly flawed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse laid out those concerns in 
great detail and at length, and I support almost all of what he said in 
that regard. My colleague from the New Democratic Party, the hon. 
member for  Winnipeg Transcona, noted that while we did reach all 
party agreement on some amendments, it should be noted that these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6722"> 6722 </A></B>
<P>
amendments were introduced not only after report stage, but after 
the application of time allocation on debate, both at report stage 
and at third reading.
<P>
	This bill was presented only a month ago. This is the third day it 
has been debated in the House. Yet after the first day of full debate 
after its return from committee, the government implemented time 
allocation. In my view, the procedure of using time allocation for 
electoral law, doing it quickly and without the consent of the other 
political parties, is the kind of dangerous application of electoral 
practices that we are more likely to find in third world countries.
<P>
	As I have repeatedly said throughout this discussion, that 
process was completely unnecessary. Every indication that we have 
had during the debate, in the committee hearings and in the House, 
has been that with further discussion we would reach an all party 
consensus on virtually all of the items in the legislation, yet we 
have ended up rushing the process. Some positive amendments 
have been made in the process, but they were made in a very 
scattered and irregular manner.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse also mentioned the fact that 
before the bill was tabled we found out about it through the media. 
That was also an irregularity which, in our view, should not have 
occurred. I will have time to speak to that at greater length later in 
my speech.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer consulted the committee on 
preliminary legislation in April of this year. The government 
waited from April until October before acting. When it finally 
acted it presented a bill that was different in some critical ways 
from the principles which had all party agreement in April. That 
was completely unnecessary and completely irregular.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I observed something different than the hon. member for 
Bellechasse. He observed that the government did not follow such 
a practice in the case of the previous electoral legislation, Bill 
C-69. I do not entirely agree with him on that count. The 
government has demonstrated a tendency to act unilaterally on 
election law before.
<P>
	Let me disagree with him in this regard. It is true that in the case 
of Bill C-69, unlike this legislation, we did study that legislation 
for a substantial period of time. We looked at it intensively and we 
came to all party agreement on most of the particulars of the 
legislation.
<P>
	However, the principal purpose and concern of that bill was the 
scrapping of the electoral boundaries process so that it would not 
be in place for the 1997 election. That was our very fundamental 
objection to that legislation. We would have been perfectly 
prepared to approve it if it would have gone through after the 
current  redistribution had been completed. We all know that 
ultimately the bill never passed and the redistribution has been 
completed. That was the reason we opposed the legislation. It was a 
part of the bill and virtually all of the opposition parties in both 
Houses of Parliament opposed it for that reason.
<P>
	It is important that when the bill ultimately failed, the 
government never passed the things on which we all agreed. That 
says a lot. We developed a new process that would have been an 
improvement. Ninety-five per cent of the bill ultimately could have 
been passed in the House and in the Senate. Yet once the 
government failed to get the one thing it did not have all party 
agreement on it chose not to proceed with the bill at all. This says a 
lot about its practices on previous election legislation.
<P>
	I have so far not said what the hon. member for Bellechasse has 
said. In spite of what has occurred in the past six 
months-especially this past month-we have worked well with 
individual members of the government. I acknowledge the work of 
the chief government whip, the member for Stormont-Dundas, 
and the hon. member for Fundy-Royal, the chairman of the 
committee, and other members of the government staff who have 
worked to try to facilitate discussion and agreement on individual 
items. We acknowledge the importance of this work.
<P>
	Nevertheless we have been operating within a terribly 
constricted timetable, a process that has not allowed us to come to a 
consensus. It was unnecessary because all of this could have been 
done months ago.
<P>
	What remains in this legislation after amendment are two basic 
substantive problems which I will address. The two major 
problems with this legislation as it is now being passed are, first, 
the specific proposal to stagger voting hours for the next federal 
election, and second, the proposal to implement the new register 
and shortened electoral period through a spring enumeration which 
will be very costly.
<P>
	First, the staggered voting hours were not part of this bill when it 
went to committee before second reading. That is important to 
mention. Not only has this bill been rushed, but the provision 
which the Reform Party now objects to most strenuously was not 
even included in this bill when it was tabled.
<P>
	That provision came from private member's Bill C-307, tabled 
by the hon. member for Vancouver East, which was passed by this 
House some days after Bill C-63 was sent to the procedure and 
House affairs committee.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-307, which dealt with staggered voting hours, was passed 
by the House by unanimous agreement only on the grounds that the 
issues in it would be studied and we would arrive at a consensus on 
the specific proposal to be implemented. It is important to note that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6723"> 6723 </A></B>
<P>
the  proposal in Bill C-307 and the proposal in Bill C-63 are not the 
same proposal.
<P>
	Two basic reasons were given for wanting to alter periods of 
voting across the country. First was the problem of western 
alienation. Westerners see the government being chosen before the 
polls have actually closed in their ridings. Second was the fact that 
western Canadians through modern communications techniques, 
particularly the Internet, may increasingly know about the results 
before they vote.
<P>
	On the first question it is important to remind the House that the 
Reform Party rejects staggered voting hours as a serious solution to 
the problem of western alienation. It is true, Mr. Speaker, and you 
know this, that westerners say that the government is elected before 
our votes are even counted.
<P>
	However, only an extremely naive person or an easterner would 
say that changing the order of counting the votes is a solution to 
this problem. Westerners are smart enough to realize that even if 
we counted the votes in the completely opposite order, 
governments could still be chosen without any support whatsoever 
from western Canada.
<P>
	That is very fundamental. It will probably happen again in the 
next election. It will happen not because of the order the votes are 
counted, it will happen because of the functioning of the 
parliamentary system. Until the government is prepared to study 
that issue seriously, we will not arrive at a solution to western 
alienation or the alienation that exists in other parts of the country.
<P>
	This is not a solution to that problem. Reform has never 
suggested it is so we reject it out of hand. However, Reform did 
accept looking at the problem that people may increasingly know 
the results in other parts of the country before they vote. This may 
be dangerous in some way to democracy and alter behaviour or 
affect the results.
<P>
	The Reform Party said it was willing to study that issue. It is 
important to realize, and anybody who looks at the transcripts of 
the committee will see that no convincing evidence was provided 
to the committee that this is creating a serious problem in the 
functioning of our democracy.
<P>
	Specifically, I asked the various witnesses whether there was any 
documented evidence or any serious academic study on whether 
knowing the results in other parts of the country had either of two 
effects: caused people not to vote or it caused them to vote 
differently than they would vote otherwise. There is precious little 
evidence that either of these things are true.
<P>
	The only evidence that was presented in committee was a remark 
by the chief electoral officer that some studies in the United States 
indicate that western Americans, knowing the results already from 
the east, might not turn out at the voting stations in the western  
United States, which may diminish voting by about 3 per cent.
<P>
	Three per cent is not large but it is important to realize that the 
United States has no legal blackout. Information on electoral 
results flows freely across the country. That environment is very 
different from ours where we still have a blackout on mainstream 
media and have very effective control over the flow of information. 
I believe the impact would be even less. In the United States, 
without those things, the impact is only 3 per cent. Here it must be 
substantially less.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	As I say, there is no indication today that this is causing a serious 
problem in terms of how people vote or whether they vote but it 
could in the future. This tells us that we should be very cautious 
before playing around with the rules of the game to fix this 
problem.
<P>
	The discussion in committee focused on four different elements 
of a solution. Only one of them was on staggering hours. Another 
was delaying the vote count in areas of eastern Canada. Another 
was eliminating the blackout provision in the Atlantic provinces 
because obviously Atlantic Canada cannot elect the national 
government, and possibly allowing the count to proceed in eastern 
Canada at least a half hour before the close of the polls in the west 
because of the delay in results coming out even once the counting 
started. Those were the four elements that the committee studied as 
a way of finding solutions to the problem.
<P>
	It is important to note that I felt, and possibly other members of 
the committee would agree, the committee discussion indicated 
that some combination of these solutions would be the way to 
proceed. In fact on three of those items, staggering the hours, 
delaying the count and eliminating the Atlantic Canada blackout, 
there seemed to be a fair degree of consensus that these were 
possibilities. On the fourth issue, allowing the count to actually 
proceed a half hour earlier in Ontario and Quebec, it should be 
noted that the member for Vancouver East herself, the sponsor of 
the bill, rejected that as a possible solution.
<P>
	The solution proposed by the government without the support of 
the opposition parties is of a completely different nature than the 
solution which was discussed during the hearings. The government 
refused to put in delays to the count, did not eliminate the blackout 
and in fact did provide for the count to begin a half hour earlier in 
central Canada.
<P>
	As well the government provided two other elements that had 
not previously been raised in our discussions. One was the closure 
of the polls at 7.30 in the province of Alberta, which is now in this 
bill. The element that we had the most concern about, the early 
closure of the polls in British Columbia, is now augmented by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6724"> 6724 </A></B>
<P>
early closure of the polls in Alberta as well, an option which was 
never discussed in committee.
<P>
	Also, it is an anomaly that the closure of the polls and the 
counting under the government proposal will now proceed even 
earlier in Atlantic Canada than it would have before. The polls will 
now close up to two and a half hours earlier in Newfoundland than 
they will in Quebec and Ontario. This was not part of any solution 
the committee looked at.
<P>
	Let me put all of this detail in perspective. The bottom line is 
that the solution to this problem will be based entirely on 
staggering the hours. The staggering of the hours will occur in such 
a way that the polls will close at seven o'clock in British Columbia 
and at 7.30 in Alberta.
<P>
	According to the government, the solution to the problem of 
westerners being alienated and also the vote of westerners 
somehow being affected or devalued because results are being 
counted already in the east is to cut out prime voting hours in 
British Columbia and Alberta. In other words, the west will pay for 
the solution to the problems of the electoral system. This is not a 
solution for western Canadians; this is trying to solve the west as a 
problem rather than the problem itself.
<P>
	This should not proceed without all-party agreement, not just 
because we lack consensus but because the vast majority of the 
members of this House representing British Columbia and Alberta 
will be the very people opposing this legislation. That should raise 
suspicions in everyone's mind.
<P>
	People will be very upset when they realize the implications of 
this. I will say to them, a little bit tongue and cheek, to make sure 
the government pays for this decision at the polls, if they can get 
there, and that is an important if.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Let me move on to our second major concern with this bill. The 
implementation of the permanent register and the shorter electoral 
period is to occur through a pre-election enumeration to be held in 
the spring.
<P>
	In April when the chief electoral officer came to the committee, 
he outlined two different scenarios under which we could achieve a 
36 day period and a permanent register. One was to simply proceed 
with the next election in the way we have always proceeded: use 
the 47 day calendar, have the enumeration and then have the 
enumeration serve as the basis for the permanent register. That 
would obviously be the simplest solution in technical terms. 
Another was to have a pre-election enumeration. However, he said 
at the time that a pre-election enumeration would require a lead 
time of one year. He said that in order to implement it for a fall 
1997 election, the legislative changes had to be in place by the 
summer of 1996.
<P>
	That is easy to work out. We are obviously now implementing 
these changes six months later than was proposed, to be 
implemented four months earlier than was proposed. How is it that 
we can we proceed in that manner? We can proceed by dramatically 
increasing the costs of the process. In our view, this defeats the 
entire purpose of the legislation. The entire purpose has been to 
reduce electoral costs.
<P>
	The assumption has been that a permanent electoral list and the 
revision of the list through access to various data sources at the 
federal and provincial levels will prove to be less costly in the long 
run than a door to door enumeration. This is not only because a 
permanent register is less costly, not only because we do not have 
to create a list every single time, but also because the list can be 
shared by all levels of government: federal, provincial, regional, 
municipal, and school boards.
<P>
	However, what we have done here is to ensure that we create the 
list in a way that is unnecessarily expensive. Let me be very 
specific about that. Not only are we doing it outside the electoral 
period which makes it more expensive, but because we are doing it 
on an accelerated timetable, we minimize our ability to use lists 
that have already been created in other parts of the country.
<P>
	In committee we did make a positive change. We got a change 
through that would require the chief electoral officer to use lists 
where an enumeration has been conducted within the past year. 
That would mean that in the case of Alberta which has 26 federal 
ridings and Prince Edward Island which has four federal ridings we 
will not need to do an enumeration.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer feels that those lists can still be 
implemented in time for the spring and it will save us money. That 
is 30 ridings out of 301, or only about 10 per cent. Our hope had 
been that by further delaying the implementation, we would be able 
to capture enumerations and permanent voters lists created in other 
parts of the country.
<P>
	British Columbia has a permanent voters register and we are told 
that Quebec's register will be ready by May 1. These are the second 
and third largest provinces in the country. Were we to capture these 
two provinces in our efforts, as well as a few others such as the 
Yukon, we would have been able to forgo a door to door 
enumeration in one-half of the country. It is important to note that 
this is the major additional cost we are applying to the next 
election.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer believes that by proceeding in this 
manner we will be able to save $30 million in future elections, not 
in the one coming up, but in future elections. It is important to note 
that those savings are as yet unrealized. They are in the future and 
there could be complications. Frankly I would take those as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6725"> 6725 </A></B>
<P>
maximum figures. Let us assume we have a maximum savings of 
$30 million. We have already seen in British Columbia  that its 
permanent list has proven to be somewhat more expensive than was 
thought.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	What is certain is that because of the process followed by this 
government, the next election will cost $41 million more. That cost 
will occur primarily because we are doing a door to door 
enumeration virtually across the country, except for Alberta and 
Prince Edward Island, outside of the campaign period. That is a 
cost of nearly $80 million.
<P>
	Making every effort to ensure that we could get Quebec, British 
Columbia and others into this process before the next federal 
election or before a door to door enumeration is critical to being 
able to realize real cost savings immediately. However the 
government has chosen not to do that.
<P>
	We tabled an amendment yesterday that would have put back the 
clock not 12 months as the government had originally indicated, 
but only four months. We put in an amendment to move the clock 
back just four months and the government rejected it. The 
government has tabled a positive amendment that will give us some 
certainty as to when this can be implemented and that in effect is 
not until the end of April.
<P>
	By rejecting an amendment to implement this in the fall and by 
insisting through time allocation and a rush study of this bill that 
this be implemented by May 1, we have the unprecedented case of 
a government showing its electoral timetable to the public. For that 
I am grateful. It will make it much easier for our party to plan the 
next election. It is very clear to everybody now that the government 
has created a situation where, barring some kind of PR catastrophe, 
it will call an election in early May and will have it in mid-June. 
That is getting to be a fairly obvious option given what the 
government has done with this bill.
<P>
	As I say, the government could have delayed it. In the process of 
delaying it, the government could have made the entire process less 
expensive. It is important to add that the government could have 
shortened the electoral period anyway for the next election even 
without proceeding in this manner.
<P>
	The Lortie commission said on page 123 of volume two its 
report, and this is important: ``Shorter federal election campaigns 
do not necessarily depend on introducing a register of voters. A 
shorter election campaign is feasible even if the current 
enumeration process is retained. That said, it is improbable that the 
campaign could be shortened much beyond 40 days''. According to 
the Lortie commission, we could have shortened the electoral 
period for the next campaign from 47 to 40 days without doing a 
pre-election enumeration and without imposing the additional costs 
on taxpayers that are going to be imposed.
<P>
	The government is proceeding with this for reasons that are 
obvious only to itself and which are expensive to the taxpayers and 
ultimately it perceives as in its own interest. Otherwise the 
government would have reached an agreement with the opposition 
parties on how to proceed. That said, I will add that in this specific 
instance exactly how it is implementing this, the government did 
make some concessions to the opposition parties that are worth 
noting.
<P>
	First, the government did provide through amendment at 
committee a specific timetable as to when the bill can be 
implemented. It did say that the enumeration process and most of 
the sections of the bill would become effective April 1 for a 30 day 
enumeration campaign, making an election call possible under the 
new calendar effectively at the end of April. The government did 
do that. It put time lines on various sections of the bill.
<P>
	The government and all parties also agreed to a motion this 
morning. It additionally would provide the opposition parties with 
a one-time provision of the electoral list as soon as that 
enumeration is completed and it is feasible to transmit the results 
of the permanent register to the party.
<P>
	Those two changes do provide some degree of certainty. We said 
that this is an important issue, that we already know we are going to 
be surprised with the date so do not surprise us as well with how the 
timetable is going to be implemented. The government did do that. 
That does not change our fundamental objection that this should be 
done in a way that minimizes costs and sticks to a timetable closer 
to the original consultations it had with the opposition parties in 
April. However, as I say, it chose for its own reasons to proceed in a 
different manner.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Those are our two major objections. There were a number of 
other areas to which we objected in this legislation. However, in the 
course of studying the bill, both in committee and in the House, 
some improvements have been made. Let me complete my remarks 
by going through some of the other provisions of the legislation 
which are deficient or which have been improved. As I say, these 
provisions are less important but not by any means unimportant 
items.
<P>
	With respect to byelections, one of the specific concerns which 
the Reform Party has had with this bill has been the provision to 
call snap byelections. I have said this repeatedly, but already in this 
Parliament the government has appointed people to patronage 
positions or to the Senate in order to open up a safe riding for a 
snap byelection. In the dead of winter, just after Christmas of last 
year, that occurred. Our concern was that by shortening the 
electoral period from 47 days to 36 days this process would be 
further abused.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6726"> 6726 </A></B>
<P>
	We called for the creation of a 30 day cooling off period. In other 
words, the government could not call a byelection for at least 30 
days after a vacancy in the House of Commons occurred. The 
government has provided today, through an amendment, an 11 day 
cooling off period, which at least provides us with the status quo. It 
provides us with, in effect, a minimum 47 day election campaign 
because there will have to be 11 days before the election is called 
and then 36 days for the campaign itself. That is an important 
amendment which was brought in by the government this morning. 
Perhaps it is not as long a period as we wanted, but we are grateful 
that we could come to an all party agreement on it.
<P>
	However, it did not address a second concern which we raised, 
which could have been addressed at the same time, the problem of 
byelections simply not being held at all. Under the Parliament of 
Canada Act the government must call an election with 180 days of 
the occurrence of a vacancy. It is important to note that the election 
does not have to be held in any particular time period. It has been 
common in recent years for governments to put off late term 
byelections. We know that when we get near the end of a term seats 
open up for all kinds of reasons, retiring MPs are appointed or seek 
other work or whatever. We know that seats become vacant. What 
has happened in the recent past is that governments have decided to 
leave the seats vacant almost indefinitely, putting the date of a 
byelection well past the next general election. That could have been 
addressed in this legislation, but the government chose not to.
<P>
	I only have a short time left, so I am going to go quickly through 
some of the other things I wanted to draw to the attention of the 
House.
<P>
	The government did remove the automatic publication of gender 
on voters lists. That is something which we had asked for. That was 
done today. The government has added the date of birth as a 
mandatory requirement, collected for the register, as the Bloc 
Quebecois demanded. That was an item which we also supported. 
However, the government did not agree to delete the automatic 
provision of the electoral list to political parties annually, as 
provided for in this act. That is important. We objected to that and 
we believe the government should have removed the provision.
<P>
	I would point out what the privacy commissioner said. We agree 
with him wholeheartedly: ``Annual disclosures of the list appears 
excessive in light of the list's express purpose of conducting 
elections or referenda. Given that no jurisdiction conducts annual 
elections, this frequent a disclosure seems more suited to repeated 
canvassing by political parties, not to the election itself''. As I say, 
that is a deficiency of the legislation which we had hoped to 
correct.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	There are other points I could go on about, a number of more 
minor matters where there has been some improvement; for
<P>
example, the elimination of revising officers, the decision to 
shorten time off work that employers must provide from four hours 
to three hours. There has been a number of other improvements we 
can point to but in the big picture this legislation remains flawed.
<P>
	It is flawed because we have followed a process that was rushed, 
undemocratic and unnecessary. With further discussion we would 
have reached a bill that not only was agreed to by all parties but that 
was much better for the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Are there no questions and 
comments?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is this a point 
of order?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Yes, Madam Speaker. Are 
there no questions and comments?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Not for the 
first three speakers on this motion. We are now going into debate, 
to be followed from now on with questions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act and the Referendum Act. I will share my time with 
my colleague for Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	I am glad to see that several amendments are being considered to 
make elections less expensive and fairer to all. Elections can be 
very tiring and any improvement is welcome.
<P>
	However, although a permanent voters list can be more practical 
and a less expensive way of having voters on file, I am concerned 
about the difficulty in keeping it up to date. In some areas of 
Vancouver East people are very transient and that may cause a 
problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Still, the permanent list is certainly more practical and it 
eliminates the need to hold enumerations for each election, while 
allowing for a reduction of the electoral period from the current 47 
days to a minimum of 36 days. Besides saving $30 million, the 
government will also give candidates less time to campaign. I think 
this change will be appreciated both by the candidate and the voter. 
These advantages are by far superior to the disadvantages and, as 
we know, nothing is perfect.
<P>
	However, the part of the bill that is the most interesting to me is 
clause 44.1 dealing with the closing of polling stations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6727"> 6727 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I presented a private member's bill in June, Bill C-307. It asked 
for the closing of all polling stations at the same time. I would like 
to thank the government and all my colleagues for supporting the 
concept in principle and making it more workable across the 
country. It is true that in this big country of ours there is little 
flexibility due to the many time zones we have to live with. We 
cannot disrupt the lives of people in one part of the country to make 
it easier in another part of the country. The only other possibility 
would be to make all of Canada one time zone, but I do not believe 
this would receive much support.
<P>
	These changes are extremely important for B.C. As I have 
indicated in my debate, in spite of comments made by some 
colleagues of mine to the effect that it is just a question of 
perception, this is not a question of perception. It is a question of 
reality and of feeling unimportant in one of the most important 
democratic exercises of any country, the election of a new 
government.
<P>
	We know that numbers are in the east for the time being and that 
the decision will still be made in the east of the country, but at least 
we in the west will not know of such a result before we finish 
voting so the next election will be able to count.
<P>
	Let me assure all my colleagues who talk about perception that 
in B.C. I receive many positive comments with regard to these 
changes. There is also a lot of support on the part of the media.
<P>
	As indicated in committee, I do support the need not to change 
voting hours too drastically in the Atlantic provinces. I believe it is 
acceptable because the seats in that area number 32 as opposed to 
34 in B.C., which will not completely disrupt the final results.
<P>
	What is crucial is not to know the results in Ontario and Quebec 
before we close the polls in British Columbia. The difference in 
closing times of half an hour became an acceptable compromise. In 
fact, it will at least take half an hour to start counting the ballots 
and at that time polls in B.C. will be closed.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	We noticed the same problem during the recent U.S. elections. 
One of my colleagues has said that there is a blackout in Canada 
but there is no blackout in the United States. I do not know how we 
can believe in blackouts nowadays with the technology we have in 
place.
<P>
	As for the hours of voting time B.C. will lose in the evening, it is 
amply made up by two additional hours in the morning, which will 
give many a chance to vote before going to work.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by thanking all of those who understood 
the need to change the closing time of polling stations and for 
accepting my further request to extend the hours to 12 from 11, 
because this will make the situation more equal for all Canadians 
and will help promote unity in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ind.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wish to address an issue in my hon colleague's comments which is 
very credible. She said that one of the most important democratic 
exercises of our country is our elections. My comment rises out of 
a concern of a constituent, Reverend Rude, who was serving 
outside Canada with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in El 
Salvador. We are looking here at expanding the democratic rights 
of all Canadians in terms of their eligibility to vote.
<P>
	In section 51 of schedule II, section 1(c), if we could amend that 
aspect of the bill to include missionaries as a designation, it would 
give them the opportunity to vote. Right now they are not permitted 
to vote if they live outside Canada for more than five years. I am 
not sure if the hon. member has a comment she might wish to make 
on that oversight on the part of the government. It really does 
disenfranchise thousands of missionaries who serve Canadians and 
others abroad so well.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on that and whether 
she would be willing to promote and amend section (c) to also 
include missionaries overseas.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague.
<P>
	This is definitely not included in the bill. I would like to see it 
included. I have also tabled another amendment to the electoral act 
having to do with people in hospitals. That is another issue that is 
not included in the bill. I do not know how much time we have to 
change these things. I do not think it is possible right not but we 
surely should work on it.
<P>
	My private member's Bill C-308 pertains to making sure that 
people in hospitals get to vote. At that time we can probably 
address missionaries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
rise in support of this bill, an act to amend the Canada Elections 
Act and the Referendum Act. I hope I will be allowed to put into 
perspective the addresses from two colleagues from the other side 
whom I respect very much for their work on constitutional matters, 
the hon. member for Bellechasse and the hon. member for Calgary 
West.
<P>
	I am a little surprised to hear suggestions that this bill has been 
rushed through or that not adequate time has been allowed for 
consideration.
<P>
	I am reminded of the experience of Lord Eldon who was lord 
chancellor for 21 years, broken by several periods only when his 
party was in opposition. He began sitting on a case at the beginning 
of his tenure and it was still there 21 years later.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6728"> 6728 </A></B>
<P>
	I sat on the committee on procedure and House affairs and I 
remember considering this bill. Then I was moved on to another 
office and I ceased to be a member of that committee. I returned 
as a guest two weeks ago when the bill of the hon. member for 
Vancouver East was being considered.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What we see here is not undue and indecent haste but what Mr. 
Justice Frankfurter of the United States Supreme Court has called 
moving with all deliberate speed. This is a relatively modest 
measure which covers the two issues.
<P>
	On the establishment of a permanent register, I would have 
thought there was no room for doubt or argument. Anybody who 
has experienced permanent registers in other democratic countries 
comparable to our own will know that it operates easily and 
effectively. Changes can be made easily enough. It is a much better 
system than the ad hoc arrangement we go through every time we 
have an election.
<P>
	The second issue covered is the shortening of the election 
campaign period. The minimum period which has been shortened 
from 47 days to 36 days is surely a self-evident proposition. I say 
this simply because we do not have, in contrast to other 
constitutions, much in the way of a statement in our Constitution of 
the necessary and vital elements in the constitutional processes, 
that is, on the system of elections and the system of political 
parties.
<P>
	As a result of the civil war amendments, the 13th, 14th and 15th 
amendments were adopted into the United States constitution. This 
has given rise not only to federal legislation in the implementation 
of those constitutional amendments, but also to a a massive system 
of court based jurisprudence, a development on a step by step basis 
of principles of law fleshing out the large motor principles of the 
constitution.
<P>
	It is a fact that the paradigm of modern constitutions, Germany, 
has been borrowed by the new Russian constitution, the new 
Republic of South Africa constitution and indeed has been 
borrowed around the world. The original West German constitution 
of 1949 has detailed provisions on the constitutional processes, 
electoral processes, parties and again a very substantial system of 
court jurisprudence.
<P>
	By way of comparison, our Constitution only has the section on 
democratic rights in section three of the charter of rights. I suppose 
we could also include the preamble to the original Constitution 
Act, 1867, a designation too particularistic today, a constitution 
similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom but which was 
used by the Supreme Court of Canada in one of its most 
imaginative judgments, the Alberta press case, to develop a 
constitutional system of civil liberties before  we had a charter of 
rights or even the statutory bill of rights which was Mr. 
Diefenbaker's later bill.
<P>
	I am suggesting that this is a measure which perhaps has taken 
more time than it has needed, I would have said an undue amount 
of time for the matters covered. However it is an important first 
step and we welcome it on that basis. It is inevitable that the courts 
will build on this. They have already begun to so do on a somewhat 
piecemeal basis in two decisions, one in which I participated as an 
expert adviser to the court and another more recent case before the 
Supreme Court of Alberta, which have entered into general 
jurisprudence in so far as neither the first one nor the second one 
were appealed by the Attorney General of Canada.
<P>
	I anticipate that we will develop as vital to the political processes 
what U.S. Chief Justice Stone called the constituent processes, the 
starting point of any constitutional system of government. We will 
develop more legislation in this field. We will have more work 
before more committees. As Jeremy Bentham has reminded us, we 
will develop to a very considerable extent the concept of judge and 
company, of legislators and courts working together to develop in 
the interstices of specific cases and with regard to specific 
problems as they arise, new and growing principles of 
constitutional law on elections.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	It is on that basis we should approach the deliberation of this 
particular amendment. I welcome in that sense the constructive 
contribution made by my colleague the member for Vancouver 
East, who against all odds moved to redress what is a matter of 
considerable grievance to citizens in western Canada and one 
knows also to those in the western United States.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to my colleague, the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra, who said he did not think this bill was being 
rushed through. I for one think it is. I think we do not have enough 
time to consider it fully. We are under great pressure to pass this 
bill forthwith or almost. That is undemocratic, especially when the 
opposition cannot express its views on legislation as important as 
this one.
<P>
	I travelled in Latin America and I regularly meet people from 
foreign countries. They are very interested in the Canadian 
electoral system. They want their countries to have more 
democratic, more transparent election legislation.
<P>
	While Canada has a democratic system, we could go one step 
further by having in our legislation provisions similar to those 
found in Quebec's legislation for example. In Quebec, only 
individual voters are allowed to finance electoral campaigns, not 
corporations and big companies as is currently the case in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6729"> 6729 </A></B>
<P>
	There is another problem I would like to put to the hon. member 
for Vancouver Quadra. Returning officers are appointed by the 
government. These people play a key role in an election. In 
Quebec, they are appointed by the Quebec director general of 
elections. Why not have a similar provision saying that, in Canada, 
returning officers shall be appointed by the Chief Electoral Officer 
of Canada in an objective and impartial fashion, on the basis of 
a competition, instead of on a patronage basis as is currently the 
case?
<P>
	In almost every riding in Quebec, friends of the old Conservative 
regime were replaced with Liberals or friends of the Liberal Party. 
That is undemocratic, and something should be done about it. 
Returning officers should be appointed by the Chief Electoral 
Officer of Canada on the basis of an open competition. That is my 
question to the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Bourassa for his comments, which were, as usual, 
well-documented, This man truly understands the constitutional 
process. I respect his knowledge.
<P>
	When I expressed surprise that this bill had been rushed through, 
I was referring to the proceedings of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. Lengthy, in-depth studies were done 
in this committee, of which I was a member for two years. For 
these reasons, I will limit my comments to the committee.
<P>
	Concerning the appointment of officials to supervise the voting, 
some changes could surely be made. As I made recommendations 
myself, I will point out that I was asked for very specific 
information about experience, expertise, technical training, etc. I 
am satisfied with the process as it stands, but I will take the hon. 
member's proposals under consideration.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I also 
wish to address Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada Elections 
Act.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Bellechasse, I too am surprised by the 
government's haste in pushing through this reform, and also by the 
fact that it overlooked many aspects which should have been 
reviewed to improve the democratic process, as the hon. member 
for Bourassa pointed out earlier. The government should also have 
made sure that, short of obtaining the unanimous consent of the 
House, it at least allowed members to take part in a full debate on 
the issue. Instead, we had barely started discussing the reform 
when the government decided to invoke time allocation. Such an 
attitude is indicative of the government's utter lack of respect, 
something that is the Liberal Party's trademark. Historically, if 
there is any group that has shown no respect for the House 
throughout Canada, it is this party.
<P>
	In the last one hundred years or so, the Liberals have, thanks to 
all sorts of schemes, managed to be in office for close to 75 years. 
This is to say they will do anything, showing no respect for the 
House, to hang on to power.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Bellechasse mentioned this morning, 
they had no respect for the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs. The committee, which is generally free of any 
partisan attitudes, which reaches a consensus 99 per cent of the 
time, and which could have played a central role in this review 
designed to improve the elections act was utterly ignored, along 
with its Liberal, Reform and Bloc members. Yet the committee had 
reached consensus on several issues in anticipation of a possible 
reform. But no, the Liberals, as always, had no respect for the 
committee and utterly ignored it.
<P>
	They show no respect either for their own platform, as there was 
a clear commitment in the red book for an in depth reform of the 
Elections Act with a view, for example, to restricting big 
corporations' influence, as was mentioned by my colleague from 
Bourassa.
<P>
	They had told us that we would think it over together, that 
members would have their say about it. Why did we not have a 
special debate on this, as we had one a year ago on the issue of our 
armed forces' role in peacekeeping missions? Democracy itself is 
at stake here, but we did not even have a special debate on this, to 
hear the views of all the members. No, they utterly ignored the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	They disregarded their own platform. This has always been 
typical of the Liberal Party: say one thing during the campaign, and 
another once in power. They have always broken their 
commitments; that does not surprise me.
<P>
	But they did not show any respect here for their own statements 
in the House, especially their famous statement on distinct society. 
They said, with every intention of following through, that they 
would have a resolution passed recognizing distinct society 
without, however, entrenching it in the Constitution. One year 
later-I think it was passed on November 29 of last year-if that 
resolution had any meaning for the Liberals, they would have taken 
time to reflect on this reform of the Elections Act and find out that 
in Quebec our legal institutions operate under French law whereas 
in the rest of Canada they operate under common law.
<P>
	Now, the way ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are defined is 
completely different. They could have included both definitions. 
That is what we suggested, but it was rejected, because the 
statement on distinct society was only smoke and mirrors. So they 
have no respect for their own resolution.
<P>
	It has no respect for the other parties' arguments. I am not 
necessarily thinking here of arguments of the Bloc,  but of those of 
the Reform Party concerning byelections. That party suggested 
that, instead of the 36 days provided for general elections, we 
should keep the 47 day period for byelections to prevent the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6730"> 6730 </A></B>
<P>
occasional dirty trick, like the one pulled by the Deputy Prime 
Minister. With a short period of 36 days, opposition parties are at a 
clear disadvantage. This also shows no respect for the opposition 
parties.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party also has no respect for Quebec, for the way 
things are done in Quebec, since this province already has a 
permanent list. Quebec offered to let the federal government use its 
list, on a shared cost basis. The chief electoral officer in Quebec 
figures this could save between $15 and $20 million. But no, this is 
coming from Quebec, and the Liberal Party of Canada will have 
none of it. The Liberals want to have their own enumeration. They 
will duplicate the process Quebec has just been through, because it 
is going to have its permanent list by May 1. Quebec has suggested 
both levels of government use the same list, share the costs, and 
thus make huge savings of some $15 to $20 million. This offer was 
rejected.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has no respect for everything that is being 
done in the provinces, especially in Quebec. Nor does it have any 
respect for the democratic electoral process, as evidenced by the 
patronage appointments of Liberal hacks. Ninety-five per cent of 
new returning officers are Liberal organizers who have been asked 
to prepare the federal elections based on the needs of the Liberal 
Party. That is the way the party has always done things.
<P>
	So, it has absolutely no respect for its own platform, no respect 
for parliamentary tradition, no respect for the provinces, no respect 
when it comes to appointing returning officers, no respect for the 
proposals brought forward by other parties and no respect for its 
own statements.
<P>
	At this point I would ask the unanimous consent of the House to 
keep talking indefinitely. Do I have unanimous consent, Madam 
Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member has asked for the unanimous consent of the House to keep 
talking indefinitely. Does the hon. member have the unanimous 
consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry, but 
the hon. member does not have unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, you should have asked the 
clerks. I think you reiterated the question to allow the government
<P>
party to voice its opposition. I am surprised to see how this 
assembly is suddenly interested in my speech.
<P>
	What is most surprising in this reform is to see-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> I want to greet the chief whip who is coming 
into the House. I think he was quite right to get out his whip. His 
troops had deserted him, I believe. As he could not find them, he is 
here alone. But I can understand them.
<P>
	I can understand their wanting to hide and to refrain from 
speaking on such a meaningless bill, a bill which does not in any 
way conform to their own platform or serve democracy in Canada 
and Quebec.
<P>
	No doubt what annoys my Liberal colleagues the most is to see 
that there is nothing in this bill to reform of political party 
financing so as to achieve a greater transparency and improve 
democracy.
<P>
	Speaking of political party financing, in the last election, all 
political parties promised to review this issue because it was 
determined that there is still too much hidden influence on the 
government's legislative agenda because of party financing. All 
parties agreed on that. The Liberal Party said so during the election 
but, typically, its members now say otherwise. That is just like the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	Just one party not only said that it would talk about party 
financing after the election but actually acted accordingly before 
the election by financing its activities in a manner different from 
what the other parties in this House did, refusing all contributions 
from people who do not have the right to vote, as has been the case 
in Quebec since 1977.
<P>
	What can we say about the financing of political parties in this 
House? Well, there has been an improvement in the last 15 years. 
Previously, 80 per cent of corporations and big unions controlled 
political parties through party financing.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Thanks to the tax credit introduced about fifteen years ago, we 
have seen a constant increase in the public's involvement in party 
financing. In fact, we can now say that only 40 per cent of the 
major parties' revenues come from corporations. However, even 
with only 40 per cent, there is always a possibility of conflict of 
interest because any corporation donating $50,000 to a political 
party will probably engage in lobbying during the following 
parliamentary session.
<P>
	Let us look only at the charges made against senators and 
members of the House of Commons in the last 10 years, 
particularly the behaviour of certain ministers in this House since 
the 1993 election. For example, less than two months after being 
elected, the Minister of Canadian Heritage invited 20 people to a 
$2,000
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6731"> 6731 </A></B>
<P>
private cocktail, for a total of $40,000. A few months later, she 
awarded discretionary contracts out of the budget of the Canadian 
heritage department, using our tax money, to these people who had 
contributed $2,000 to her election campaign. Now this was a matter 
serious enough to ask for her immediate resignation. What did the 
Prime Minister do? He applauded the Minister, unlike the previous 
Prime Minister who, at least, had the decency to ask for their 
resignation in such cases.
<P>
	Then, the former Minister of National Defence awarded a 
$75,000 phoney discretionary research contract to the treasurer of 
his riding's Liberal organization. Why did this minister award such 
a contract if not to recover some of that money for his own 
election? One has to wonder.
<P>
	Let us talk about other ministers, including the Prime Minister, 
who travels all over Canada, and about receptions at $350 or $500 a 
plate-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> They can cost $1,200 a plate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> My colleague, the member for Trois-RiviÃ¨res, 
who knows all about political party financing and who gets his 
financing through the sale of membership cards and small 
donations from people in his riding to maintain his freedom of 
action-democratic behaviour that does him credit-says that 
these receptions can cost as much as $1,200 a plate.
<P>
	Do you not think that the 600 or 700 guests who paid $1,200 a 
plate to hear the Prime Minister and the corporations that bought 
10, 15, 20, 30 or 100 tickets could greatly influence the government 
agenda afterwards? We understand why they do not want to give 
family trusts a closer look.
<P>
	Let us recall what openness is all about. I would like to quote 
from statements I made on the subject when I moved a motion in 
favour of public funding for all political parties.
<P>
	At that time, I said that, under section 121 of the Criminal Code, 
donations aimed at obtaining special privileges are illegal in 
Canada. In fact, that section is directed at those who give money to 
political parties with the specific aim of getting government 
contracts. Subsection 121(2) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Every one commits an offence who, in order to obtain or retain a contract with 
the government, or as a term of any such contract, whether express or implied, 
directly or indirectly subscribes or gives, or agrees to subscribe or give, to any 
person any valuable consideration: (a) for the purpose of promoting the election of a 
candidate or a class or party of candidates to Parliament or the legislature of a 
province; or (b) with intent to influence or affect in any way the result of an election 
conducted for the purpose of electing persons to serve in Parliament or the 
legislature of a province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is clear that, as far as openness is concerned, the Criminal 
Code is very demanding of members of Parliament. But, from all 
appearances, the Liberal government is not ready to abide by the 
spirit of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers demand total openness from their 
elected representatives. Greed is probably very human, but it is 
incompatible with the political ideal of common good. In this 
regard, the role of government is to discourage any political 
practice allowing public office holders to use their positions for 
personal gain.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	That is something the government should reflect on and include 
in this electoral reform.
<P>
	Whether in cases of lobbying, patronage or conflict of interest, 
we have often been informed by the media that people had sought 
to influence those in charge of the public purse to gain a personal 
advantage for themselves or for the people they represent. Money 
is generally the main factor in these situations. As long as a large 
percentage of political party funding will come from corporate or 
union sources, ordinary Canadians will have every reason to 
wonder who we serve.
<P>
	Can the worker from my riding who barely earns $15,000 a year 
seriously believe that an engineering firm, a large bank or a 
businessman will donate $50,000 to a political party without 
hoping to get a return on their investment? Can he seriously think 
that he will carry as much weight as this engineering firm in the 
decision making process? One simply has to ask the question to 
know the answer.
<P>
	Corporate entities are always created for a specific purpose: 
for-profit organizations are there to make profits; non-profit 
organizations have very specific objectives; and unions are there to 
promote the interests of their members in the workplace.
<P>
	When these organizations fund a political party, they stray 
considerably from the purposes for which they were originally 
created under federal or provincial laws. Those who refuse to see 
that these donations are not completely unselfish are really hiding 
their heads in the sand.
<P>
	And how about the big fundraisers? Smoke and mirrors is often 
the answer. Good contacts in the business community eventually 
provide access to the holy of holies or may open the door to 
financial benefit.
<P>
	Public funding of political parties would send a clear message of 
transparency and would show unequivocally that companies, 
unions and major financial backers no longer have an excessive 
amount of influence on the decision making process. This notion of 
transparency should have been included in this electoral reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6732"> 6732 </A></B>
<P>
	Democratically speaking, as well, if there were public funding, 
if only those entitled to vote were allowed to contribute to a 
political party, thus eliminating any corporations, unions or 
non-profit organizations, we would take a large step towards better 
democracy. Not only is public funding an initiative linked to 
transparency, but it is also a message of democracy from the 
voters.
<P>
	Companies, associations and unions do not vote. There is 
therefore no reason why these organizations should play a 
preponderant role in our electoral and political system by funding 
more than 25 per cent of the activities of Canadian political parties. 
In certain parties, it is over 40 per cent.
<P>
	Public funding is also a question of democracy. Voters are the 
ones who should control our electoral system, who are the very 
foundation of our democracy. This control must be exercised at all 
stages of the democratic process, requiring real participation by the 
public, but also requiring a decentralization of structures and 
decision making within political parties.
<P>
	Obviously it is easier for party fundraisers to obtain one $5,000 
contribution than many $50 contributions, but the fact that it is 
easier, not to say lazier, results in very centralized parties, where 
ordinary members feel out of place. By giving in to laziness, 
political parties are agreeing to serve corporate contributors, thus 
abandoning thousands of Canadians and Quebecers who have 
contributed, who have wanted to join their party, but who no longer 
have any influence.
<P>
	Large donations make things simpler, but certainly less 
democratic. When, year after year, a political party makes a point 
of seeking contributions from voters, it shows that it needs them 
and commits itself to getting to know them and to consulting them 
on its major policies. The party membership is therefore given a 
much more important role and does not just work on winning an 
election every four years, with the result that democracy is 
exercised on an ongoing basis within each of the parties.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Through public funding, a contributor acquires an increased 
sense of belonging to his party, that can only increase with the 
democratic vigour of a society. The great virtue of public funding is 
that it forces political parties to increase decentralization of their 
structure, to return to their roots and to promote genuine interaction 
between the leaders and the membership. It is for these reasons that 
public funding should have been included in this electoral reform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak.
<P>
	The hon. member made a comment with regard to who should be 
able to make a contribution and who should not. He indicated that 
those who vote could make a contribution and those who do not 
vote should not be able under the legislation to make a contribution 
to a political party or a candidate in a respective election.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to clarify that point. I do not think 
he was saying to us, although it sounded that way, that a person 
would have to vote in order to qualify to make a contribution. I do 
not think that was the intent of the hon. member. If it was, I would 
feel rather disappointed because it would take away a certain 
freedom from individuals. If one wishes to vote, okay. If not, no.
<P>
	If there were a distinction between corporate entities and 
individuals, that would be something different.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon: </B>Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
giving me the opportunity to clarify. It seemed obvious to me. 
Everyone is entitled to vote, and there is no question of paying for 
the right to vote; I never said such a thing.
<P>
	In order to have a more viable democracy, I said that the political 
parties should be funded only by those who are entitled to vote. I 
never referred to paying for the right to vote.
<P>
	I said that companies ought not to have the right to contribute to 
a political party, nor corporations, nor unions, nor not for profit 
organizations, only individuals who are entitled to vote, in other 
words I am eliminating corporate entities. In Quebec, companies, 
unions and not for profit organizations have not been allowed to 
contribute to a political party since 1977, only individuals who are 
entitled to vote. The ordinary citizen can contribute. This greatly 
improves democracy, while at the same time greatly reducing the 
influence of corporations, who have been heavy contributors to a 
political party, over that party once it is elected.
<P>
	The provincial Liberals and the Parti Quebecois get their funding 
in this way, and the Bloc Quebecois sitting here in this House was 
also funded in this way in the last election, in 1993. It refused all 
contributions from companies, labour unions or not for profit 
organizations, accepting them only from individuals entitled to 
vote. This is how it is funded every year.
<P>
	Our fundraising campaign this year met its $1 million objective 
in six months; last year, during the referendum, the objective was 
$1.8 million. The list of contributors is made known, and only 
individuals with the right to vote are allowed to contribute to the 
party.
<P>
	This is the reform we are suggesting, and we think that the 
government ought to have included it in its bill. This would have 
made a major contribution to cleaning up politics. The government 
would not then have had the problem of ministers in conflict of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6733"> 6733 </A></B>
<P>
interest, as we have just experienced with three different ministers 
here, and with a number of ministers during the Conservative days.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to pose a question to the member because of his 
longstanding experience as a politician. I want to make it perfectly 
clear that this is not a trick question. I want some input from a 
person who has been involved in the political process for a long 
time.
<P>
	One concern I have as a member from British Columbia is what 
the Liberals have done in terms or responding to a perception, 
thereby creating more of a problem than there was in the first place. 
In fact, there was no problem. That is with respect to the fact that in 
Alberta, in the mountain time zone at least, the polls will be closing 
at 7.30 p.m., and in the Pacific time zone they will be closing at 7 
p.m.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The major concern I have is the government responded to the 
member for Vancouver East and some of the things that have been 
popular in the press about the fact that people in western Canada 
are concerned that the vote is all over before they even start to 
count their ballots, which of course is nothing but a problem of 
perception. In trying to resolve this problem of perception, they are 
now going to be closing the polls in a metropolitan Vancouver, 
where many people are travelling for an hour or an hour and a half 
from work, arriving home at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. before getting out to 
vote.
<P>
	This member has been a politician for an extended period of 
time. Would he agree with me that what is going to happen, 
particularly in Vancouver, is people who are working for candidates 
and who have the ability to telephone people to try to get them out, 
this is going to be a severe detriment and problem for many of the 
people involved in the political process? It is going to be a different 
situation in politics in Vancouver than it will be in Toronto or 
Montreal because of that time change. It is a very unfair change. I 
wonder if the member would care to comment on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to say to the hon. 
member that I fully share his concerns. I believe that the first aim 
of any electoral reform should be to make voting more accessible. 
If we shorten the opening hours of polling stations in Vancouver or 
in British Columbia, democracy will suffer.
<P>
	Workers who work fixed hours and who have to check in and out 
will not have enough time to vote while others who can more easily 
leave work will be able to vote. There is an injustice in terms of 
accessibility. I believe,  like you, that voting accessibility is more 
important than knowing election results in another province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to start by congratulating the hon. member for Richelieu on his 
excellent speech, especially the part on political party funding and 
his criticism of contributions made by large corporations to the 
traditional parties, including the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I have a few figures, some examples of the incredible amounts 
contributed to the Liberal Party of Canada during the 1993 election 
campaign by companies such as Canadian Airlines, $9,000; 
Canadian Pacific, $64,000; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 
$86,000; General Electric, $14,000; Bombardier, $45,000; Eaton's, 
$15,000; Molson, $53,000; Bank of Nova Scotia, $76,000; 
Canadian Bankers Association, $14,600; B.C. Inc., $52,000. 
Incredible, the amounts that were given to the Liberal Party in 1993 
in the middle of an election campaign. How can a government look 
after the interests of the average individual when it is financed by 
Canada's large corporations? Would the hon. member for Richelieu 
care to comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, I am glad the hon. member 
asked this question. When I looked at political party funding for the 
1993 election, I found that corporations like those you just 
mentioned, and others, such as Burns Fry, Onex Corporation, 
Molson, Rogers, CanWest Global, Unitel, and drug companies, 
such as Frosst, Apotex and Magna International, were the main 
contributors to Liberal Party coffers.
<P>
	The major contributions you mentioned involved 24 ministers, 
including the Deputy Prime Minister, and six parliamentary 
secretaries who are sitting on the government benches. There are 
many conclusions we can draw from this.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to speak on Bill C-63, a bill 
which can save taxpayers as much as $30 million per federal 
election.
<P>
	Changes to the Canada Elections Act cannot be approached 
haphazardly. The implications are great and the subject matter is 
indeed critical.
<P>
	This piece of legislation follows the report of the Royal 
Commission on Electoral Reform, the Lortie commission, and the 
recommendations of Canada's chief electoral officer. Extensive 
consultation has taken place with opposition parties and by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	Bill C-63 signifies a step forward for our electoral system. It 
takes advantage of modern information technology and, more 
important, it makes sense.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6734"> 6734 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill proposes the establishment of a permanent voters list, 
an automated register of Canadians qualified as electors. This 
permanent automated list would eliminate the need for outdated 
door to door enumeration. The register will be updated from 
existing federal, provincial and territorial data resources. This 
limited personal information will be used only with the consent 
of the electors involved. The federal statute governing privacy will 
apply and the transfer of data will be strictly regulated.
<P>
	The information in the register of electors would be used solely 
for electoral purposes. Automation of the list will allow more time 
for electors to make revisions. If an elector's name or address is 
incorrect on the preliminary list or has been omitted, he or she will 
have 4 additional days to have the information corrected; 28 days 
rather than 24. Updating information will be easier. Providing an 
elector can prove his or her identity, some changes could in fact be 
made by phone.
<P>
	The creation of a permanent register of electors will allow the 
current 47 day minimum election period to be shortened to 36 days. 
This shortening of the campaign period also responds to a call from 
Canadians who feel that 47 days is extravagant. The shorter 
minimum 36 day election calendar will involve major changes to 
the current 47 day calendar.
<P>
	Spending limits and the preliminary list of electors will be 
available earlier. They will now be available to candidates on the 
31st day before polling day.
<P>
	As I have indicated, electors will have more time available for 
revision; 28 days rather than the existing 24. Electors will receive 
voting information earlier. Electors will receive a mailed notice 
confirming the dates and locations of the advance and regular polls 
by the 24th day before polling day. This way is much safer than the 
old system. Under the current 47 day calendar notices are left at the 
door by enumerators.
<P>
	These changes make perfect sense to me and they are going to 
save Canadian taxpayers money. Door to door enumeration for 
each election is time consuming and expensive. Up to 110,000 
enumerators have to be hired and trained and their work monitored. 
Costs are incurred at the federal level and by the provinces, the 
territories, the municipalities and the school boards which conduct 
enumerations. The fact is, door to door enumeration is the single 
most costly part of an election for taxpayers.
<P>
	The single most costly part of the last election for the Tories was 
stating that federal elections are neither the time nor the place for 
debating public policy. Their most costly mistake, one which both 
they and the Reform Party seem destined to make again, was 
underestimating the Canadian public's concern about its country's 
future, its understanding of the issues of the day and its ability to 
make rational decisions.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	One need only look at the Reform Party's false start program to 
see that this is true. The Reform approach to the economy could 
actually jeopardize the achievement of a balanced budget in the 
near future, increase fiscal uncertainty and stall investment and job 
creation. This sketchy plan is in marked contrast to the measured, 
proven Liberal government's two-track approach which is already 
achieving outstanding success.
<P>
	Under the Liberal government, Canada has the lowest interest 
rates since the 1950s. That is making a real difference to real 
people. Someone renewing a one-year mortgage of $100,000 will 
save over $3,000 annually. Let us be honest, job creation is not and 
never has been part of the Reform Party's plan. It is only now 
starting to realize that jobs are the top priority for Canadians. Its 
platform has no credibility. It just does not add up.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposes to increase transfers for health and 
education by $4 billion, allocate $10 billion to repaying the debt 
and cut taxes by $12 billion. How, one may ask? That is an 
excellent question and one that Canadian voters will ask come 
election time. The problem is that the Reform Party cannot answer 
it.
<P>
	What we know is that the Reform proposal will make the tax 
system less fair, benefiting the wealthy at the expense of those less 
fortunate. Liberals believe that any changes should be targeted and 
benefit those in need. The Canadian people know this. This is 
exactly how this country was built.
<P>
	I am not going to discredit every idea or proposal made in the 
false start document. Quite frankly, I think our time can be better 
spent doing other things-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Like talking about the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> -for example justice. Someone unfamiliar 
with Canada who looked through <I>Hansard</I> reading only Reform 
Party statements about crime, he or she would think we live in one 
of the most violent countries in the history of civilization. 
However, we do not.
<P>
	The fact is that the crime rate fell last year as it has for the past 
four years. The government took a comprehensive approach to 
crime and justice and it is paying off. However, those facts seem to 
elude our friends across the away. After promising to do politics 
differently, they have resorted to extremism, hot button politics. 
Canadians are smarter than that.
<P>
	Then there are the Tories. Some people ask: Where are they? 
They are here. One would think that after the 1993 election the 
Tories would have realized they are not in tune with the wants and 
needs of Canadians, but it is not so. They just carry on doing what 
they do best, looking after their friends at the expense of others. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6735"> 6735 </A></B>
<P>
The two tiered health care system, an end to new seniors' benefits 
are the type of approach the Tories plan to take.
<P>
	Bill C-63 reflects the realities of today. Technology has helped 
us streamline the electoral process. It will result in savings of $130 
million over the next six elections. Also, Canadians today are 
informed about the issues that affect them. They have the right and 
ability to express their views and, in my mind, during an election 
campaign it is the best possible time to do so. When they look at the 
record of the government I know which way this country is going in 
the next election.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member who just spoke. I agree we could save 
$120 million or $130 million, but the maximum could have been 
higher.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The government could have saved $150 million, in other words, 
an additional $20 million or $30 million, if it had agreed to use 
electoral lists prepared in the province of Quebec, for instance. 
This list, which is quite recent, does not meet the 12-month criteria 
but only just.
<P>
	So why do the Liberals not stop their nitpicking and adopt the 
electoral list that has just been drawn up? This list is pretty recent, 
in fact so recent it would be impossible to have one more up to date 
because it takes so long to compile the data.
<P>
	My question is the following. Is it not just to give Liberal 
organizers in the ridings a chance to go door to door and fill in the 
list at 75 cents or $1 a shot, so that the legislation will be used as an 
excuse to give more money to the friends of the Liberal Party in 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Madam Speaker, it may be the impression of 
the hon. member that this is some kind of cynical political ploy. It 
is not. Quite frankly, when we are looking at savings of $30 million 
per election the Canadian taxpayers who, after all, pay for these 
elections would applaud this move by the federal government.
<P>
	May I add that in all of the discussions I have had in and outside 
my riding in the province of Ontario and with members of the 
Quebec community that people are quite happy we are introducing 
automation, that we are introducing technology in the election 
campaign, that we are saving the type of money we are. Over one 
hundred million dollars is quite a few dollars to save.
<P>
	Given the fact that Canadians want more and greater 
accountability for every tax dollar that is invested, whether it is in 
the electoral process or government programs we will find that this 
bill has widespread support from British Columbia to 
Newfoundland. The issue of automation and technology is 
something about which I am personally quite pleased.
<P>
	The creation of a permanent voters' list is something that I 
personally advocated back in 1990 when I was making my 
contribution as a member of Parliament. I say  this with a bit of 
experience, representing an area with 260,000 people. A permanent 
voters' list certainly would have benefited myself and the electoral 
process back in 1988 when I ran for the first time. The people of 
York North will in large measure support the initiatives that I stated 
in this bill and that the government has clearly outlined in the 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak on Bill C-63, 
an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act, 
in particular as it pertains to three elements. I would like to address 
establishing a permanent electoral list, implementing a shorter 
campaign period and staggering the voting hours across the 
country.
<P>
	The first element of the bill deals with the question of a 
permanent electoral list. I believe that such a list will be better for 
Canadians because it will eliminate the recurring need to have 
approximately 100,000 enumerators going door to door and it will 
save hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
	Just as important is the fact that by having a permanent list, one 
that we can all work with as members of Parliament, will include 
Canadians better in the political process and will provide the 
opportunity for us as members of Parliament to communicate 
better with our constituents not only during an election campaign 
but between elections.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	For example, I can see the opportunity to keep track of all the 
correspondence, to identify areas of interest and really build an 
informed database that will allow us to seek the opinions of our 
constituents. It will allow us to provide the education and 
information to our constituents on various issues of the day. It will 
be much more reliable as a database than what is currently 
available to us.
<P>
	What makes this even more important is that we are moving 
toward new technologies. I am sure as members of Parliament we 
are all going to be faced with more and more interventions from 
constituents who have access to technology like the Internet. 
People will use various types of mechanisms to contact a member 
of Parliament which is important. That makes it more important for 
us to ensure we can get to the people who do not have access to 
those technologies which is one of the things a permanent list 
would accomplish.
<P>
	A permanent list will make it easier for us to keep track of 
information. It will make it easier for constituents to access the list, 
for example, younger Canadians who are moving a lot, people who 
live in rooming houses, people who live in places such that the 
current system does not accommodate them. Having gone through 
many elections, not necessarily as a candidate but at the poll level, 
there are always problems getting people on the lists. The
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6736"> 6736 </A></B>
<P>
permanent register brings a lot more certainty to the process, a lot 
more consistency, and is much more democratic.
<P>
	There is a second important element of the bill. We are going to 
have a shorter campaign period. This is good public policy for two 
reasons. First, a shorter campaign period de-emphasizes the 
importance of spending on the campaign itself. The issue of money, 
of the ability to raise it, of the ability to conduct an elaborate 
campaign will be less important. Obviously if there is less time, the 
advantage of financially well-heeled candidates will diminish, 
which is good for democracy.
<P>
	The shorter campaign period also de-emphasizes the impact of 
the campaign itself. What we are talking about now is having a 
choice made by constituents that may be measured a little more by 
the performance of the candidates, the government or the party 
over a longer period of time. There will be de-emphasis of the 
campaign and emphasis on one's community record. There will be 
emphasis on the performance, good or bad, of the government. 
Those may be more important considerations for electors to apply.
<P>
	If we de-emphasize the campaign by making it shorter, there will 
be a greater tendency for people to vote on broader issues. We all 
know that during the course of a campaign the measures that are 
applied have to do with a candidate's ability to function in front of 
a television camera or their ability to speak before the public. 
Members of Parliament also know that those abilities are not nearly 
as important as one's ability to get the job done. It is important that 
we be measured as candidates in those terms and not necessarily on 
the basis of the others I mentioned.
<P>
	The third element is the staggered voting hours across the 
country which is only fair. Then the outcomes of the election will 
not be known in the west prior to people voting. It is a good 
proposal that brings a greater sense of inclusion to all parts of 
Canada.
<P>
	There is a great sense of alienation, whether geographic, 
socioeconomic or gender based. Whatever the source of alienation 
it is obviously something that governments, political parties and 
this institution should be constantly trying to improve on. I see this 
provision as a fundamental response to the tenet that Canadians 
must feel the system works. If you are voting when you know full 
well that a government has already been formed, you may not 
believe the system works. I would find it personally offensive.
<P>
	With the new rules in place the voting will be staggered. This 
will allow voting to occur in a way that lends itself more to 
everybody feeling included. I welcome the fact that those 
amendments were made in a fashion that would also be sensitive to 
the fact that no one in Atlantic Canada would want to be voting at 
midnight. A reasonable accommodation has occurred.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I also pay tribute to the member for Vancouver East for her many 
interventions. As a hardworking member of Parliament she 
deserves to be acknowledged for her efforts in this regard.
<P>
	It is important to deal with the question of alienation and making 
our constituents feel included in the process. In my case over the 
past three years I have held a number of public policy forums, the 
18th of which was held last Sunday. These are pretty elaborate 
affairs where people in the constituency have an opportunity to 
debate the issues of the day. A week ago we discussed the 
upcoming budget. I was given direction by my constituents as to 
how I should approach any opportunity I may have to influence the 
outcome of the budget.
<P>
	The types of reforms we are talking about today are consistent 
with that inclusion for the reasons I mentioned. I know it is difficult 
for all of us because we are constantly caught up in the crisis of the 
day in this place. From time to time we all let our guard down or we 
become a little less conscious of the need to consult. Again we have 
to be reminded on occasion.
<P>
	There have been other attempts at electoral reforms in the last 
couple of years and not all were as positive for the country. The 
boundary redistribution which is coming into effect was poorly 
thought out.
<P>
	I presented a motion on July 12 last year to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs objecting to the 
provisions of the report as it related to New Brunswick. The 
commission failed to respect the community of interest by dividing 
the greater Fredericton area into urban and rural ridings.
<P>
	The area that surrounds Fredericton is now lost to another riding, 
a wonderful riding that I am sure you, Madam Speaker, will well 
represent long into the future. However, there is no logical 
connection with the Saint John River valley as has been determined 
by the redistribution system.
<P>
	The outlying regions of Fredericton feel a strong attachment to 
that city. They receive all their federal services from that city. It 
was not a useful exercise to detach them from their logical place. It 
does not lend anything to our desire to have people feel included 
and to have some sense of continuity in the political process, 
regardless of which political party those constituents support. I 
believe it was an honest attempt at improving the boundaries, but it 
failed miserably in that measure.
<P>
	I very much support not only the idea behind Bill C-63, but also 
how it will implement those ideas. We need to do everything we 
can to enhance our ability as members of Parliament to establish an 
honest daily relationship with all our constituents. A permanent list 
will allow that to happen. Minimizing the campaign makes us more 
accountable for our activities between elections. It also minimizes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6737"> 6737 </A></B>
<P>
the impact of money on the outcome. Of course by having a 
permanent list it will save Canadians millions of dollars.
<P>
	With that, I encourage all members of the House to support the 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the two previous speakers. One thing that was 
very evident is that an election is obviously looming. The reason I 
say that is twofold. One is because of the increased rhetoric from 
the other side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Oh, come on. That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Now the rhetoric is 
really increasing. They are trying to drown out my intervention.
<P>
	Anytime members opposite attack the Reform Party's fresh start 
program, we know they must be in trouble with it. Otherwise they 
would not give all that time in the House of Commons to draw it to 
the attention of the Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	The government is saying this bill is going to save taxpayers a 
lot of money in having a permanent electors list. If the government 
is really interested in saving taxpayers money as it says it is, why 
then would it not have put into this bill a repeal of the election 
rebates that are granted to all parties and candidates who run in 
elections?
<P>
	If the government wants to save money, it should quit rebating 
the election expenses. This would be one way the government 
could save millions upon millions of dollars and yet it does not 
want to do it. Why? Certainly this has been part of the Reform 
Party's platform since the party was formed some nine years ago. If 
Reform were the government that is one of the changes we would 
make. If the government is interested in saving money, why would 
it not do that?
<P>
	Also, if this is such a terrific piece of legislation, why is the 
government afraid to debate it? Why did it have to bring in time 
allocation and force this legislation through in a very short period 
of time? If it is a good piece of legislation and if it was so clearly 
though out as previous speakers have said, why are so many 
amendments being brought forward?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member noted that because of comments made by 
members on this side of the House that obviously an election is 
looming. I would suggest that we knew an election was looming 
because all the Reformers are quitting. Clearly it is a matter that 
they know full well it is better to get out now than to be asked to get 
out later.
<P>
	Saving money is very important. I appreciate the question 
because it distinguishes between us very well. The reason there is 
public money involved in the political  process is to diminish the 
importance of private money in the political process. It is that 
simple. A poor person who seeks office does not have the kind of 
money to put together and run a campaign. Consequently the public 
interest is served by public participation in financing elections. It is 
that simple. Clearly that is the difference between us.
<P>
	Finally, I have to acknowledge the irony of what the hon. 
member is saying. In one paragraph the hon. member is asking why 
would we not want to have more debate and at the same time he is 
asking if this is such a good piece of legislation, why all the 
amendments? Clearly those are two completely inconsistent 
observations but I am not surprised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to follow up on the theme raised by my colleague that 
there must be an election imminent. The way those members are 
talking, they are so afraid of our fresh start program.
<P>
	The member just before mentioned how wonderfully low the 
interest rates are and how anybody borrowing money on a 
mortgage now can save so much money. That is exactly Liberal 
think: you have to borrow money in order to get a benefit. Is that 
not wonderful? What if people do not want to borrow money? They 
are stuck with the high taxes. In fact if you borrow $200,000 you 
will get the same benefit as Reform's tax reductions.
<P>
	It is Liberal think to say that low interest rates are a fantastic 
benefit. They are only a benefit if you borrow money. It is totally 
ridiculous. How can the hon. member justify that sort of approach 
where it is a benefit to borrow money instead of to reduce taxes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will use the opportunity to answer the previous speaker's question 
because he was wondering why we did not engage in more debate. 
The answer is because of the quality of debate just offered by this 
questioner. I did not mention a fresh start. I did not mention interest 
rates. I did not mention any of those things. Clearly it is good 
evidence as to why we can exhaust this debate as quickly as we 
will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
dividing my time with the member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	A number of the issues on Bill C-63 have been addressed by my 
colleague from Calgary West in terms of the specifics and where 
the Reform Party stands. I want to take on one comment that my 
colleague made in his remarks. He said that this bill which is 
supposedly to deal with some of the alienation in the west is not the 
solution to that alienation and the concerns that we have in western 
Canada. For example, changing the polling hours so that we do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6738"> 6738 </A></B>
<P>
know the results of the vote in  Ontario, Quebec and the maritimes 
does not satisfy western Canada in terms of alienation.
<P>
	Many of the Reform members who stand in this House are here 
because of the longstanding problems we have had with those in 
central Canada who do not have ears to listen to our problems. We 
are here to try to set those issues clearly before this assembly. For 
years the Tories and the Liberals have been on this side and then on 
that side of the House, but their ears have remained completely 
deaf to the issues of western Canada. The many times they have 
patronized us out in the west they have done it with little things 
which they throw out on the table.
<P>
	Bill C-63 is just another one of those things. The government has 
changed the voting hours. There are 12 hours in which to vote and 
the government has tried to adjust it so that we cannot find out 
through today's technology how people voted in other places. And 
we are supposed to be satisfied with that and say how wonderful.
<P>
	Other patronizing things have happened in this House as well 
which are just as unacceptable. There is crime in this country. 
There are youth who are committing adult crimes and this is totally 
unacceptable. I hear people across the way, including the member 
for York North, talk about the fresh start program of Reformers not 
having credibility. We have spent three and a half years in this 
assembly and the Liberal government has not dealt with the issue 
of crime.
<P>
	What has the government done? There has been nothing to deal 
with the issue of crime but to register the guns of the innocent 
people of Canada. That is what the government has done. A big bill 
and a lot of fanfare and it is a bill the government cannot even 
implement for Canadians. That is what the government has given to 
Canadians.
<P>
	It is not only the issue of crime but also other problems this 
country has. Reformers presented to this House an option for unity 
that if Quebec is to stay, should we not decentralize some powers. 
The government says things are good enough the way they are, that 
if it gives good government they should be satisfied. It is not 
resolving the matter. It continues. Western Canadian alienation 
continues. These little titbits get rolled out on the floor and the 
government thinks we should be satisfied, not only in Quebec but 
out in the west and that we should keep quiet.
<P>
	It is just not good enough. We see it symbolized in the intent of 
this elections act which is before us today. The government has to 
do better.
<P>
	The hon. member for North York spoke a few moments ago on 
this bill. He talked about budgeting and numbers and so on. There 
was a group of individuals representing the Liberal Party which sat 
for eight years on this side of the House. That group had eight years 
to do some work, eight years to prepare for government.
<P>
	We came back for the session in 1994-95 and there was no 
legislation. We got a zero budget which had no indication or 
direction, no deficit reduction when Canadians were screaming for 
deficit reduction. We had to wait a whole fiscal year before the 
government woke up to what was needed in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Today the Reform Party has presented to Canadians a credible 
option so that when it is government it can walk into government 
and deal with it. If the Liberals had that kind of thought in mind we 
would have had a better government. We would not have a deficit 
of $27 billion today; we would have been closer to the $17 billion 
the Minister of Finance has targeted for another year.
<P>
	This government always puts out things for symbolic reasons to 
try to fool the people of Canada, rather than doing something which 
has substance. That is the case with the bill which is before us at 
this time.
<P>
	What should have happened in this term of office? It is time for 
the government to recognize that the regions of the country, 
western Canada and even Quebec, should have better 
representation. It is time for it to recognize that senators should be 
elected rather than put in the other House by patronage 
appointments. There have been at least two senators appointed 
during the 35th Parliament. They have been sent up to the other 
House and are in that Liberal haven of milk and honey until the age 
of 75. What a giveaway of public money. There is no 
accountability.
<P>
	That would have been something of substance which would have 
helped western Canada, rather than the amendment that gave us 
different polling hours. There should be an elected Senate, an 
effective Senate and one which has equal representation. That 
would bring something better to the Canadian scenario than what 
we have before us at the moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to make a brief comment with respect to my 
colleague's remarks.
<P>
	I would point out to him that the proposal of his party to 
decentralize government in this country as a means of solving our 
unity problems has obviously been rejected by the majority of 
Canadians, as is witnessed by where the party stands in the polls. 
The majority of Canadians realize that if the country has a weak 
central government we will be playing into the hands of the 
separatists, both the separatists in Quebec and the separatists in 
western Canada.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians are wiser than the Reform Party, which 
is reflected in where it stands in the polls.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
give a quick response to that utterance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6739"> 6739 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian people are mature and responsible. Provinces are 
responsible entities in this country. They have shown that they can 
manage their public affairs and their fiscal affairs much better than 
the federal government, which is so centralized. Who has the big 
debt in the country which amounts to $600 billion? Who has the 
deficit in the country? The federal Liberal government. Who has 
looked after the deficit and debt in this country? Eight of the 
provinces. When will the federal government, the Minister of 
Finance, the Prime Minister and the member who has just spoken 
stand to say they have a balanced budget, which eight of the 
provinces have?
<P>
	When they have fiscal and social policies which are reflective of 
the Canadian people then the member can say what he has said. 
Under the circumstances today, the Liberal federal government has 
no credibility to be the guardian of the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I followed the comments of the hon. member who said 
that during the last three and a half years the Reform Party 
provided good leadership in the House. If that is the case, why is 
the Reform Party standing at 11 per cent in the national polls? It is 
sinking in Alberta and in the rest of the west.
<P>
	What would the hon. member suggest we do, go back to the old 
system where the rich and powerful control the House? Or does he 
want to adopt our revision of the Canada Elections Act so it will be 
open to each and every citizen in this land, no matter where they 
come from, on an equal basis?
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, in the period 1984 
to 1993 the Tories led this country. They had majority governments 
and could take legislation or fiscal policy in any direction they 
wanted. They were high in the polls. The new leader, Kim 
Campbell, was infallible. They had answers to a thousand 
questions. However, when the worm turned and the Canadian 
people saw through the facade, the Tory government ended up with 
two people in the back row and not even a recognized party.
<P>
	Therefore the hon. member had better remember the lessons of 
this House. Those who are irresponsible, those who continue to put 
this country into debt and those who try to fool the Canadian people 
will end up as a minority party, unrecognized in this House as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would first like to say that we have some good representation 
coming from western Canada. Certainly the member for Vancouver 
East is one of those people. She has worked long and hard on the 
issue.
<P>
	In terms of western alienation, I really have to take exception to 
the member for Lethbridge. Let us not forget that the member for 
Lethbridge, before coming to this House, was a member of a 
Progressive Conservative cabinet. While that member waxes 
eloquently in this House about all the evils of big government, let 
me tell him that since he has been in this House collecting a salary 
as a member of Parliament, he has also collected a pension of 
somewhere around $200,000 from the taxpayers in the province of 
Alberta.
<P>
	All I can say to the member for Lethbridge is shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, as always, the 
hon. member's mathematics is as inaccurate and unaccountable as 
the budget of the Liberal government.
<P>
	The hon. member did not tell my constituents back home that I 
have given them over $30,000 in donations out of my salary to a 
variety of things. Did he do that? Did this hon. member refuse to 
take a federal pension? Did this hon. member tell Canadians and 
his constituents he will not take a federal pension which will most 
likely put a million dollars in his pocket? No, he did not. Did he tell 
Canadians that 50 Reform members of Parliament have said they 
will not take a federal pension which will most likely save 
Canadians $50 million? Well, he should.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is interesting how this debate has evolved today. It is kind of like 
ever expanding circles. We start on one subject and pretty soon 
away we go. It is kind of fun here today to see the Liberals squirm 
as we talk a bit about western alienation and not just western 
alienation but about changes that are necessary to the democratic 
process, the electoral system and the parliamentary system in order 
to make this place accountable to the Canadian voters, the people 
who actually sent us here, and to make the parties more responsible 
to the people whose vote they are trying to woo.
<P>
	What it comes down to of course is the basic supposition when it 
comes to elections in Parliament of whose chair is this anyway. I 
am not going to hold up the chair and use it as a prop but that is the 
basic question. Does this chair belong to a political party or does it 
belong to the people in the riding?
<P>
	The basic question the Liberals should be asking is how can we 
ensure that this chair represents the views of the people, in my case 
those of Fraser Valley East. I would put forward the proposition 
that what has brought this House into such a low level of 
self-esteem and such a low level of public opinion is the fact that 
people who get elected to this place think they own this chair and if 
they do not own it then the political party that they are apart of 
owns it. Until they get that straight they are not going to be able to 
put to rest the fears of the Canadian people that this place is not 
representative of the Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Why when we talk about western alienation and when I try to 
convince and talk to the minister in charge of our national unity 
portfolio that distinct society is driving  the country apart instead of 
bringing the country together, he stands there and says he will go 
on a tour of this country again and convince western Canadians that 
they have to take this distinct society? He said in B.C. that they 
should just give a bit more and accept it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6740"> 6740 </A></B>
<P>
	It is no wonder they cannot get it straight over there about what 
the purpose of this place is and the purpose of representative 
government.
<P>
	The purpose is to find those things that we have in common 
which draw us together, not to emphasize the differences of 
Canadians. I hear them say that we need to recognize the distinct 
society clause because it will put to rest the national unity crisis. 
This is the government that came within 50,000 votes of losing the 
country, the government that had no game plan, no plan (a) or (b), 
no plan at all to address the Quebec issue. Instead, it rolled along 
saying ``we think it is okay and if we just push this distinct society 
thing down somebody's throat, somehow that will bring the 
country together''.
<P>
	The Liberals are not listening and they are not learning. They 
have yet to understand the principle at stake here. The principle is 
that the chair I sit in does not belong to the Reform Party; it belongs 
to the people of Fraser Valley East. And when I stand and speak on 
their behalf, I expect the government to listen and I expect the 
people to listen. If I am not doing my job, then I have not done it as 
I understand democratic representation.
<P>
	There will be more about this after question period because I am 
not finished with these guys yet.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over 17 per 
cent unemployment among our youth ages 15 to 24 is a waste of 
Canada's precious resources.
<P>
	Idle time in one's prime income earning years will negatively 
impact financial security for the individual and is a waste of 
potential energy for the nation as a whole. Couple this with the fact 
that representatives of our high tech companies tell us time and 
time again that they cannot find suitable entry level qualified 
applicants. Some say they need to hire outside of our country to fill 
these challenging and high paying jobs.
<P>
	We have an enormous mismatch between places of work and 
places of education. Our government has recognized the 
importance of improving entry level skills by initiating a youth 
internship program, a program I am happy to say is active in 
schools in my riding. We also have Youth Services Canada and we 
have doubled the funding for summer employment programs.
<P>
	It will be important for all levels of government as well as 
businesses to work together in finding intuitive solutions to what 
has become a tremendous detriment for our youth and our nation as 
well.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the former head 
of the B.C. Science Council, Haig Farris, has dismissed the federal 
government's $30 million investment in Ballard Power Systems as 
political fertilizer that fails to deal with the real problems facing 
junior technology firms.
<P>
	Those problems, he said, include a tax regime that makes it 
difficult if not impossible for young technology firms to attract 
capital to finance growth, making salaries less attractive than those 
in the U.S. Additionally, Farris said, Canadian immigration 
policies make it difficult to recruit top people to manage and grow 
advanced technology firms. He said the federal loan was political: 
``The government was just under so much heat to do something out 
west after giving that money to Bombardier.'' That is not the 
solution.
<P>
	British Columbians and Canadians interested in developing the 
high technology sector need a tax regime sensitive to their special 
needs. Such a tax regime would make better use of taxpayers 
dollars than the present system of politically motivated giveaways 
that attempts to play one region of the country off against another.

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Tony Towstey and Tri Media 
Productions of Saskatoon.
<P>
	Thanks to Tony's determination, corporate communication skills 
and a lot of hard work, Saskatoon can now boast its first ever 
feature film to be shot entirely in the city. The movie is called 
``Dead End''. While that may be a good title for the film it is a poor 
description of many positive spin-offs its production means to 
Saskatoon.

Production will increase business for Saskatoon's hotels, 
restaurants and support industries. Local people will be employed 
on both sides of the camera developing a talent pool for future 
projects.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week, the justice and judicial affairs committee heard 
stakeholders from every region of Canada as it toured the country. 
The purpose of its tour was to gather ideas about what changes 
should be included in the bill to amend the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois applauds this clear shift toward diversion 
programs. I do hope the minister will recognize that providing 
young people with rehabilitation opportunities is a key objective 
and that a justice system that tries to keep our youth out of prison 
really is the way of the future.
<P>
	The people of Quebec are proud to see that Quebec's initiative in 
the administration of justice for young offenders has become an 
example that provinces and organizations in Canada have chosen to 
follow.

Mr. Speaker, last week I was at a press conference in the riding of 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton for the launch of a community-wide 
initiative to make Brampton ``the safest city in Canada''.
<P>
	This announcement was made possible in no small part thanks to 
this Liberal government's willingness to keep its safe homes, safe 
streets red book commitments.
<P>
	In July 1994, for instance, it established the National Crime 
Prevention Council, a body that works to unify crime prevention 
efforts across Canada. Organizations to be encouraged on the 
campaign include the Brampton Crime Prevention Association, 
Peel Regional Police, Bramalea Police Advisory Committee, 
Brampton Transit, Northern Telecom, Springdale Developments, 
Bramalea Jaycees, Block Parents, the Downtown Business 
Improvement Association, Business Crime Watch, Neighbourhood

	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to 
share a few memories of a long serving elected politician, Mr. 
Clarke Rollins, who passed away on November 25.
<P>
	Clarke Rollins was born on December 14, 1911 at Coe Hill in the 
county of Hastings where he grew up, was educated, married and 
raised his three children with his wife Beverley (Hurley) Rollins. 
Mr. Rollins began his political career at the municipal level where 
he served eight years as the reeve of the Township of Wollaston 
before becoming warden in 1950.
<P>
	In 1959 Mr. Rollins was first elected to the Ontario legislature, 
remaining through five subsequent elections. Mr. Rollins was the 
self-described country member. Throughout his career he focused 
on the grassroots issues of importance to the people he served.
<P>
	Mr. Rollins shared his insights and wisdoms with me when I 
tossed my hat into the ring in 1993. I am grateful for the kind 
advice and the hand of friendship he extended to a novice in the 
political arena.
<P>
	I will remember the warm man who sincerely cared for the 
people of Hastings-Peterborough. I extend my sincere sympathy to 
Mrs. Rollins and family.

	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last Friday, during Oral Question Period, the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean stated, and I quote: ``This may well be question period, 
but it is certainly not answer period''.
<P>
	The reaction of several of the ministers and members opposite 
who were in the House at the time was to reply: ``You have been in 
Ottawa for three years but never realized that until today?''
<P>
	The purpose of Oral Question Period is to request information 
from the government and make it account for its actions before the 
House of Commons. It is an important way of controlling 
democracy in Canada.
<P>
	When I hear certain ministers boasting about not participating in 
this democratic process and making a mockery of it, I feel deceived 
by and disappointed in a government that respects neither the laws 
and principles of democracy nor, for that matter, the people of 
Canada and Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the lack of 
interest the Liberal government shows toward Toronto is a constant 
source of amazement to me. Recently the intergovernmental affairs 
committee of metro council held a meeting to discuss federal issues 
in the greater Toronto area.
<P>
	There are 36 members of Parliament in the GTA, all Liberals. 
They were all invited to the meeting but only two showed up. The 
House was not sitting that week, so lack of attendance was not the 
result of these members being in Ottawa.
<P>
	One can only assume that the dismal representation was a result 
of the Liberal government's indifference to Canada's largest city. 
Even their own supporters are annoyed by the Liberals' taking 
Toronto for granted. ``I'm really amazed'', said metro councillor 
Anne Johnston, ``I'm saying publicly as a sometime Liberal how 
shocked I am about the lack of attention paid to Toronto''.
<P>
	This disinterest is not limited to the GTA members of 
Parliament. The Prime Minister, with 36 Toronto MPs to choose 
from, opted to have the hon. member for Windsor West as the 
minister responsible for the GTA. Surely there is at least one 
member from Toronto who could fill the job, or was no one 
interested?

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the Sierra Club and Energy Probe for 
taking the government to task and to court for the way the 
government exempted the sale of the CANDU nuclear reactor to 
China from all its environmental assessment procedures. The 
government has shown a certain form of arrogance and even 
authoritarianism in exempting this project from environmental 
assessment.
<P>
	We have come a long way since the Brundtland commission 
when governments of the day continually talked about how they 
were going to assess everything for environmental consequences. 
Recently we have seen rail abandonments and all kinds of other 
policies being implemented without environmental assessment, but 
this is the straw that breaks the camel's back.
<P>
	We have a government that has exempted this project and by so 
doing has set a terrible precedent. We can only wish that the Sierra 
Club and Energy Probe succeed in taking this government 
successfully to court and in having this decision overturned.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to pay tribute to the 
Kitchener-Waterloo Khaki Club of Wellesley, Ontario, co-sponsors 
of the 1997 world horseshoe pitching tournament.
<P>
	For the first time in 79 years the World Horseshoe 
Championships will be held in a location outside the United States. 
Organizers predict that some 1,500 Canadian players will join 
thousands of competitors from around the world at the 
Kitchener-Waterloo Khaki Club and the Kitchener Memorial 
Auditorium from July 12-27, 1997. At the same time, estimates 
suggest this tournament will have a positive financial effect in the

Canadian Hemophilia Society has named November hemophilia 
month. Approximately 2,400 Canadians are affected by this 
inherited condition which is characterized by a failure in the body's 
blood clotting mechanisms.
<P>
	The Canadian Hemophilia Society is dedicated to providing 
persons with hemophilia and other inherited bleeding disorders 
with information and support. The society also raises funds for 
research to find a cure and provide more effective treatment.
<P>
	A number of my constituents suffer from hemophilia. The 
challenges they face are considerable. They are member of a 
community which must deal with three chronic disorders: 
hemophilia itself, hemophiliacs infected with HIV and 
hemophiliacs with hepatitis C.
<P>
	The Canadian Hemophilia Society is performing a vital service 
by providing sufferers of this condition with support and education. 
The federal government has an important role to play. We can ease 
the suffering of hemophiliacs by ensuring that we are responsive to 
their needs, by actively seeking their input on government policy 
and by making it a priority to deal with issues they identify as being 
of greatest concern.
<P>
	Please join me in congratulating the Canadian Hemophilia 
Society for its work and in wishing the organization a successful 
campaign during hemophilia month.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general has just released another report 
crammed full of extravagant expenditures, expenditures that are 
the result of federal mismanagement. In fact, more than $2.5 
billion in needless expenditures are itemized in the auditor 
general's report for 1996 alone.
<P>
	Does the President of Treasury Board realize that, if he had done 
his job properly, if the government had managed the taxpayers' 
money properly, it would have saved almost half the money it 
swiped from the UI fund surplus?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
myself met with the auditor general yesterday morning for a 
briefing on his report.
<P>
	He pointed out to me once again that his report was essentially 
positive and optimistic. He also indicated that for the first time he 
could say there was improvement in nearly every area. Perhaps it is 
coming about a bit more slowly than he would have liked, but the 
situation is improving.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, that is the problem we run into with this government. 
Blinded by his own arrogance, it is impossible for the President of 
Treasury Board to admit his errors with humility. He simply cannot 
do it. Two billion and a half is nothing to sneeze at.
<P>
	The auditor general has estimated that the government could 
have saved up to $1.25 billion just by managing its stocks better. 
How can the President of Treasury Board be boasting about putting 
public finances in order, when his neglecting to do an item-by-item 
examination of government expenditures has resulted, for Public 
Works and Government Services alone, in losses amounting to 
$1.25 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is 
certain that there is always room for improvement in all questions 
relating to management, whether in the private sector or in 
government. However, the federal government has implemented 
two years ago a comprehensive program review which the auditor 
general found to be excellent.
<P>
	Yes, there are problems with certain aspects of our management. 
In order to give a clearer picture of the tone of the auditor general's 
report, in the very area referred to by the leader of the opposition, 
stock management, here is what the auditor general said in his 
report: ``We are encouraged by initiatives taken by the departments 
and currently in place. Major efforts are now under way in some 
organizations which have reviewed and simplified their policies 
and now have a clearer definition of their role, their responsibilities 
and their expenditures. We draw particular attention to the efforts 
made to capitalize many items which were previously incorrectly 
recorded under stock management''.

<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, I used to be a teacher, and I have had students like the 
minister, who justified getting 6 per cent on an exam by saying that 
they had improved a great deal since last time, when they got zero. 
That is not good enough.
<P>
	It is not good enough because, while the government is claiming 
to have done this exercise with great conscientiousness, a great 
deal of work, at the same time the Minister of National Defence, 
and former Minister of Human Resources, was cutting benefits to 
all of Canada's unemployed. While he was making those cuts, the 
President of Treasury Board was calmly examining expenditures, 
and another $2.5 billion were wasted.
<P>
	The government has overspent the information technologies 
budget by $300 million. How can the President of Treasury Board, 
who is responsible for good government administration, justify 
such a terrible performance in his own department, having gone 
more than 30 per cent over budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. Leader of the Opposition refers to one area, information 
technology, which is currently being developed and which is rife 
with problems for all governments, whatever the country, here or in 
the United States.
<P>
	At this time we are busy trying to fine tune information systems 
so as to decrease the cost overages which sometimes occur.
<P>
	In order to place the words of the Leader of the Opposition in 
proper perspective I refer you to what the auditor general had to 
say: ``Our office-the office of the auditor general-supports the 
use of information technologies in order to control costs and 
improve services, and we endorse the efforts of the Treasury Board 
Secretariat to develop an improved framework for managing 
information and technology projects''.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	This morning, the auditor general discussed environmental 
issues. Regarding the 5,000 contaminated federal sites, the auditor 
general expressed his concern about the fact that the government 
was still unable to assess the health, safety and environmental risks 
and costs.
<P>
	Considering that according to certain preliminary estimates, cost 
would total $2 billion, not including the  cost related to radioactive 
waste, and also considering that the public's health is at stake, 
when will the Deputy Prime Minister see to it that her government 
proceeds with the assessment requested by the auditor general?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
auditor general made it clear, in referring to contamination 
problems which depend a lot on modern technology, that he wanted 
us to make a more exhaustive list of contaminated sites and the 
costs involved in cleaning up those sites.
<P>
	That is exactly what we are doing now. Many departments have 
already started to compile these lists. It is sometimes very difficult 
to estimate the costs, but we are now setting up the requisite lists, 
with a description of the sites and estimates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take advantage of the government's mellow mood to talk 
about radioactive waste. For five years, the auditor general has 
accused Atomic Energy of Canada Limited of failing to declare its 
environmental liabilities in its financial statements. And for five 
years, AECL has ignored repeated requests by the auditor general.
<P>
	Is the Deputy Prime Minister prepared to promise, on behalf of 
the government, that she will urge AECL to act quickly on the 
repeated requests of the auditor general that AECL declare its 
environmental liabilities in its financial statements?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	Let me assure him that AECL takes the comments of the auditor 
general as it relates to radioactive waste very seriously. A few 
weeks ago I met with the auditor general. I have discussed his 
concerns with my colleague, the Minister of Finance, and working 
together we are going to provide a solution to this problem in the

Canadian Airlines most of the way.
<P>
	Surely it is important to this House that Canadian Airlines not 
only survives but that it is prosperous for the benefit of its workers, 
its investors and the travelling public.
<P>
	We are all well aware that the Canadian government's balance 
sheet is worse than Canadian's, but one constructive thing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6746"> 6746 </A></B>
<P>
federal government can do to help is to ensure that Canadian 
Airlines operates on a level playing field both at home and abroad.
<P>
	Reform Party says no to government bailouts but we say no to 
federal government inaction.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. What is this 
government doing to ensure a level playing field for Canadian 
Airlines International at home and abroad?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is saying the same 
line it has been saying for the last month. Canadian Airlines has to 
restructure in order to get on firm ground, in order to become a 
profitable company, in order to maximize its opportunities in this 
deregulated industry, in order to succeed. Quite frankly the 
government is not going to go there with a cheque.
<P>
	The minister is there now facilitating discussions, doing 
everything he can, along with the Ministry of Transport, to see 
Canadian become a strong airline, along with Air Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assume that in that answer somewhere the government is 
in favour of a level playing field for Canadian at home and abroad. 
It is one of the things it can do.
<P>
	We are wondering if there is not something the government can 
do in a practical sense to work out that commitment. One of the 
best ways for the federal government to make Canadian carriers 
more competitive is to cut the federal tax on fuel which costs them 
about $95 million a year, $32 million for Canadian alone.
<P>
	The transportation minister said on Friday that he was open to 
lowering the federal tax on fuel and that he had had discussions 
with the Minister of Finance about it.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will he lower the 
federal tax on aviation fuel and if so, by how much?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport has 
indicated that everything except deregulation is on the table. Once 
Canadian Airlines has restructured, he will come together with the 
company and the Canadian employees who work for the six unions, 
once they have become stable, and consider any request that 
Canadian Airlines has to make.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> As the 
member mentions, Canadian Airlines has put several restructuring 
proposals on the table and four of its six unions are now on side. 
Two of the largest unions, as the member knows, the CAW and 
CUPE, still have some concerns, and that is fine. What concerns us 
is that so far they have made no commitment to let their 
membership vote on the company's proposals.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Not just 16,000 jobs are at stake, but the security of 16,000 
families with homes and mortgages and bills to pay. Canadian 
employees should have every right to have a say directly in a vote 
on their own future.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Labour. Will the government 
guarantee that every employee of Canadian will be able to vote on 
the company's restructuring proposals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to add to the hon. 
member's comments because they are most welcome.
<P>
	The minister said yesterday while he was in Richmond that great 
contributions were made by the workforce at Canadian. They are 
great people and they run a good airline. The trouble is the airline is 
not profitable. It lost $1.2 billion over the last 10 years.
<P>
	The addition I would like to make to the hon. member's question 
is that the leadership of the Canadian Auto Workers and CUPE 
have forgotten that it is not just the employees at Canadian Airlines 
who are taxpayers. The government also has a responsibility to 
look after the interests of all Canadian taxpayers: in my riding, the 
member's riding and every riding in the country. It has to ensure 
that their investment is looked after and that they are protected as 
well.
<P>
	That is why we are encouraged and looking forward to the 
restructuring plan of Canadian. In that way the Canadian taxpayers 
are looked after as well as the 16,500 employees of Canadian of 
whom the hon. member speaks.

<P>
	Yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister stated in this House that 
her government was legally obliged to withhold the documents 
sought by the Krever commission. Section 39 of the Canada 
Evidence Act sets out no such obligation. Her own minister of 
justice in fact said it was possible to obtain documents from the 
years 1980 to 1984 under a special procedure, which involves 
applying to the Prime Minister of the time, namely, Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau and John Turner.
<P>
	Is the Deputy Prime Minister prepared to undertake all the steps 
necessary to obtain the required authorizations to finally provide 
the documents to the Krever commission? In other words, is she

said that the government has a responsibility to the taxpayers. 
Canadian Airlines is a taxpayer and so are its employees.
<P>
	The government extracts $95 million a year in federal fuel taxes 
from Canadian aviation companies, an input tax that was supposed 
to be taken away when the goods and services tax was introduced.

circumvent or just forget all about the real problem at Canadian 
Airlines.
<P>
	Canadian Airlines is not making a profit. Canadian Airlines has 
to restructure. The people of Canada had to adjust to tough 
economic conditions by restructuring. Canadian Airlines has to do 
the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr.

but there should be some light at the end of the tunnel. There 
should not be a government waiting there with their tax barrel to 
fill it back up again at aviation's expense.

	Since the hon. member, in answer to a previous question, stated 
that he believes that all Canadian's employees should be entitled to 
vote, what exactly is the government doing to ensure that will 
happen?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

to await a request from the Government of Quebec. However, in 
1995, the National Assembly of Quebec passed a bill in this regard 
and, on February 27, the Quebec justice minister did indeed make 
an official request in this regard in a letter to his federal 
counterpart.
<P>

official request from the Quebec minister of justice in this regard? 
Is the minister telling tales, or does he not know what is going on?

	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, the record will have to show for the first 
time, as my hon. friends know, I was in error. The fact is I did 
receive a letter from the minister in Quebec. He made that request. 
I have been reminded that legislation has been passed and a request

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans,

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
infrastructure program was supposed to pave roads, build bridges 
and improve sewer systems. Instead $700 million was spent on 
cultural and recreational facilities. Taxpayers built ski resorts and 
golf courses while potholes expanded, bridges crumbled and 
sewers leaked.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals campaigned on the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs for 
all Canadians. At first they said 100,000 new jobs, then they said 
100,000 new temporary jobs and then they said just 100,000 
temporary jobs most of which we already have.
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. Since 
unemployment is back to 10 per cent and the infrastructure 
program has achieved so little, will the minister guarantee that 
there will be no infrastructure sequel, a program that has ended up 
costing so much for so little?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
infrastructure project has met with a series of successes. The 
auditor general mentioned some of them in his report.
<P>
	When we are spending $6 billion on thousands and thousands of 
projects, it is inevitable that some projects will have been badly 
chosen and some of the management may have been wrong. 
Compared to the private sector, I am sure that the government did 
well. That will be seen if one asks any municipality in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we know 
the golf course did well but we cannot all get on to the same golf 
course. That is the problem. All Canadians need to benefit from 
government programs. A tax cut would have been a much better 
long term solution. A tax cut would have put money in the hands of 
every Canadian rather than in the hands of a few golfers and a few 
skiers. We need a fresh start.
<P>
	If the President of the Treasury Board wants real jobs, 
well-producing, tax paying and family enhancing jobs, which are 
what Canadians also want, will he admit that a tax cut would have 
been far better than any infrastructure program, past, present or 
future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. 
The reason is that all these infrastructure projects were there to 
create construction jobs at a time when the rate of unemployment 
in that field was close to 20 per cent.
<P>
	I also have a list which indicates that in the riding of St. Albert, 
which happens to be the riding of the member, 41 projects have

income tax hike each and every year that the government has been

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know it has been so wonderful having us in office that it seems like 
we have been here a lot longer but we have only been in office since 
1993. In fact, the inflation creep to which the hon. member refers 
was put in place by the previous government in 1985.
<P>
	If we look at the increase in revenues anticipated between 
1993-94 when we took office and 1997-98 of some $23 billion, $17 
billion of that is due to increased economic activity. Over $2.2 
billion is due to the closing of loopholes, the vast majority of which 
the hon. member and his party would like to see stay in place, but 
we closed them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is

	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Unlike the finance minister, Reform recognizes 
the unfairness of this inflation tax. That is why we have decided to

for this back door tax hike.
<P>
	Will the finance minister admit in the face of all the evidence 
that the government has indeed raised taxes every year since it has 
been in power? Will he continue to push for the deindexation of 
income tax, a decision that will cost taxpayers hundreds of dollars a 
year in new taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would suggest the hon. member go back and look at what 
Reformers suggested. The main focus of their tax reduction was the 
elimination of the higher income surtax. It had nothing to do with 
helping people at the lower end of the income scale.
<P>
	What Reformers are really talking about is a massive tax 
increase to be imposed by the provinces. They would eliminate 
equalization payments in Saskatchewan and in Nova Scotia. They 
would increase health care costs by cutting three and a half to four 
billion dollars out of the Canada health and social transfer. What 
they would really do is bring in a short term tax decrease now 
which would impose a massive tax increase on the next generation, 
and that is simply immoral.

<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Justice told us that there was a way the

us yesterday is that the Privy Council, on the one hand, was not 
bound by section 39 to prevent the release of the documents in 
question and that, on the other hand, it had to obtain the consent of 
then Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau and John Turner.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Minister of Justice, who seems to know about 
these matters, if he stands by his statement and if indeed the Krever 
commission could gain access to these documents, should the

section 39 and asking Pierre Elliott Trudeau and John Turner for 
their consent.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

custodian of those documents is the Clerk of the Privy Council.
<P>
	The only way those documents can be released, and this has 
happened on rare occasions in the past, is with the agreement of the 
former prime ministers and the current government. The former 
prime ministers are former Prime Minister Mulroney and former 
Prime Minister Trudeau. The procedure requires the consent of

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	The minister wants Canadians to believe he stands for protecting 
the environment but Canadians are rather concerned with the sale 
of the Candu reactors to China because no environmental 
assessment has been done. It even looks like the government is 
going to get sued on this point.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why a project of this nature that is 
funded by the government and is carried out by federal authority 
does not need a federal environmental assessment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question was answered previously by the Minister for 
International Trade.
<P>
	To further elaborate for the hon. member, I would like to point 
out that the sale of the Candu reactors is being financed by crown 
corporations outside Canada. We have no intention under those 
rules, under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, to 
require that the Canadian rules be applied in other countries.
<P>
	We know that the Candu itself is a safe reactor. It has been tested 
in our own concerns. China itself has signed all of the proper 
international safeguards and has done its own assessment. When 
we sell abroad we abide by the rules abroad. That is the basis by 
which we recognize the whole question of extraterritoriality. We do 
not want to apply that to other countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on November 7 the environment minister tabled orders in 
council for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act so federal 
projects outside Canada are subject to an environmental review, 
except crown corporations, despite a Liberal promise to promote 
sustainable development throughout the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6751"> 6751 </A></B>
<P>
	Will the minister explain why he purposely did not go the 
distance to table the necessary regulations to make crown 
corporations like Atomic Energy of Canada subject to 
environmental assessments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is nothing like the enthusiasm of newfound converts. 
I recall quite distinctly not so long ago that the member along with 
all members of his party voted against the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. Now he is claiming it as being sacred and 
sacrosanct. They cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	I would point out for the member's education and edification 
that under the new regulations there are requirements for screening 
to take place for outside projects that can be triggered by the 
minister responsible. We are ensuring that there is a process in 
place.
<P>
	The hon. member might want to go back to his own members 
with the same enthusiasm to support proper Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act procedures in Canada.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Last week the minister announced changes to the Income Tax 
Act to prevent the use of certain tax shelters. These shelters have 
been used by the foreign film industry in British Columbia to raise 
funds for productions in my province.
<P>
	Did the minister take into account the adverse effects these 
changes will have on the film industry in B.C.?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> The answer to 
the question is yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I certainly do understand the interest and the concern of the hon. 
member in posing this question. Foreign films are produced in 
Canada for a variety of reasons including the expertise and 
efficiency of Canadian production crews and more favourable 
production costs.
<P>
	The changes we have brought about obviously do not change 
these fundamental factors. They simply make sure that those 
applying for the shelters match their expenses with their revenues. 
As the hon. member understands, these tax incentives are for public 
policy purposes and what we want to do is make sure that there is 
no leakage.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The measures in the employment insurance reform that will have 
the most serious impact on the unemployed are going to be 
implemented in early January. However, not only are the 
regulations required to implement the act not ready, but there is 
also every indication that employment centre personnel, officers 
and managers will not get any training or guidelines before the act 
comes into effect.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us when the regulations required to 
implement the new part of the employment insurance legislation 
will be ready and available?
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I recently looked at this issue 
and I thank the hon. member for Mercier for her interest in it. I 
looked, among other things, at some interpretation documents 
concerning the act that will ensure everyone can properly inform 
beneficiaries in the coming weeks, since we are, of course, 
perfectly aware of the importance of the new interpretation.
<P>
	These documents are being prepared. They are already 
circulating in a number of employment centres.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we now know 
that there is a procedure under the Canada Evidence Act to get at 
these secret documents that the government is hiding. In fact, a 
prominent Osgoode law professor, Peter W. Hogg, says: ``It is a 
matter of a competing balance of public interest''. The public 
interest in this case is the health of blood infected Canadians; the 
government interest, secrecy on bad decisions.
<P>
	Which minister will stand up today to defend government 
secrecy over public safety?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand why

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
hate to add to the troubles of the Minister of Health, whose 
reputation as a progressive Liberal is already under a cloud of 
smoke.
<P>
	I want to ask the Minister of Health whether he expects, or is 
working on the Minister of Finance in order to obtain, or whatever 
may be the case in Liberal circles, in order that another Liberal 
promise might be kept.  Seventy-four per cent of Canadians would 
like them to keep the promise to do something about reducing the 
patent protection of drugs in order to bring down the cost of drugs 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6752"> 6752 </A></B>
<P>
and save our health care system. That was a Liberal promise. It is 
one of the problems with our health care system. When is the 
Minister of Health going to act on that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member will be aware that the Patent Act comes under the 
jurisdiction of the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The hon. member should be aware that under the provisions of 
the Patent Act and particularly the Patented Medicines Review 
Board the companies which are responsible thereto have lived up to 
their commitments in terms of keeping the price below the CPI. 
They have also lived up to their commitments with regard to the 
moneys they had earmarked for the purposes of research in this 
country. So on those two points they have lived up to their 
commitments.
<P>
	However, the hon. member is correct that drug pricing in this 
country is all too high in many jurisdictions and I hope that we can 
co-operate with the provinces, including the province of 
Saskatchewan, where they might delegate the powers to the 
Patented Medicines Review Board so that we might have a full 
study of pricing both for generic and brand names in this country.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAELECTIONSACT">CANADA ELECTIONS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-63, 
an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act, 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are on debate and the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East has the floor. According to our records, he has 
approximately seven minutes left and five minutes questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we broke for question period-the aptly named question 
period, not answer period, because of course, as usual, there were 
no answers-I was in the middle of explaining to the government 
side exactly what  was wrong with the democratic system as we 
have it today.
<P>
	We are debating something today that deals with Parliament, 
referendums and elections. However, whenever one talks 
referendum to these Liberal government members, their eyes just 
roll back in their heads, they take another rum toddy and go to 
sleep. They do not want to talk about referendums. Referendums 
are somehow poisonous and anathema to this group but I do not 
know why.
<P>
	When we talk about electoral reforms along the notion of the 
private member's bill by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister which concerns fixed election dates, 
the Liberals' eyes roll back in their heads. I do not know what they 
fear. Maybe they fear that some sort of tremor might run through 
the electorate, that they would actually know when to plan for an 
election and they will not consider it.
<P>
	We talk about things like the process we have come through to 
get to this stage today, where we are talking about an elections act 
that should have been brought about with consensus building and 
co-operation of all parties, opposition and government side, and by 
taking ample time to consult Canadians. Instead we find a 
government that has had Mr. Kingsley's report since April and 
instead of bringing it to Parliament or bringing it to committee we 
find it is invoking time allocation so that we are not allowed to 
debate it.
<P>
	Not only that, but it is being pushed through with such haste that 
today the government is back again asking for unanimous consent 
to amend what we passed yesterday because there is not enough 
time to get it into the regular process for the amendments to even 
be debated in the House.
<P>
	What a sad sack way of trying to bring all-party consensus and 
all-party co-operation to a bill. Ram it through, ask for 
amendments after the fact, limit debate, do not let parliamentarians 
talk about it and do not even let Canadians comment on it through 
the committee or the parliamentary system. That is a shame.
<P>
	As has been noted earlier, there have been some improvements 
to this bill in the amendments. We asked for a 30 day cooling off 
period before a byelection can be held and we got 11 days. I guess 
that is something. It is 11 more than what was in the original bill.
<P>
	The other part of this bill that we have trouble with, the part that 
is again not acceptable and was not even part of the original bill, 
has to do with the staggered voting hours. The government feels 
somehow that by getting British Columbians to finish their voting 
by 7 p.m. that will solve the feeling in B.C. of western alienation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6753"> 6753 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	As usual, the government thinks that as long as we keep 
everything the same for Quebec and Ontario voters and adjust the 
schedule of the voters in Atlantic Canada and the west that 
everything is fair. I guess it is fair to the government, but it does not 
address the real issue, which is fair voting hours. We put forward 
several proposals with respect to that issue, none of which is in the 
bill. They were not even in private member's Bill C-307, standing 
in the name of the hon. member for Vancouver East. I do not know 
from where this concoction came. I guess it came from Manila in a 
long distance phone call. It is a lousy way to put together a bill.
<P>
	If some of the greater questions of parliamentary reform, 
elections reform, the funding of political parties, the timing of 
elections and the timing of byelections so that people are not left 
unrepresented had been addressed in a serious way it would have 
been much easier to support the bill.
<P>
	There are some measures of the bill which we like. A permanent 
voters list is a good idea. If the government had listened to our 
amendment and put it off until August instead of April, it could 
have saved tens of millions of dollars. Instead the list must be 
completed by April, which means an extra enumeration, out of 
sync, which will cost much more money. That is too bad.
<P>
	If the government had listened to our byelection proposals it 
would have been much fairer to opposition parties and to the people 
in those ridings who would have had to wait a maximum of six 
months before their next member of Parliament was elected to 
represent them.
<P>
	If the government had listened in times past to our calls for a 
fixed election date so that no advantage is given to the party which 
forms the government, again, that would have had huge grassroots 
support. Instead we have a bill which is like a halfway step across a 
chasm. It looks good but it is too bad that the government did not 
grab this opportunity, which may be its last before the next 
election, to address some of the serious problems which Canadians 
want addressed in the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member for Fraser Valley East with 
great interest. I know he thinks carefully about the future of Canada 
and that the future of Canada is very close to his heart.
<P>
	I have sat on this side of the House, surrounded by members of 
the Bloc Quebecois, for nearly a year and I have come to realize 
that many of the members of the Bloc Quebecois are not exactly 
separatists but are better described as sovereignists. Their vision of 
the future for Canada is with the provinces having independent 
powers, short of a shared passport and a shared currency. They 
want the central government to be reduced to the point  where it is 
as weak as possible relative to the provincial governments.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Fraser Valley East what is the 
difference between his vision of Canada and the sovereignist vision 
of the Bloc Quebecois. Is it not true that the Reform Party wants to 
diminish the role of Ottawa in the daily life of Canadians and make 
the provinces all powerful? The provinces could be like British 
Columbia, which has a new NDP government that did not tell the 
truth. It does not necessarily follow that we can be guaranteed as 
Canadians that provincial governments always will be the better 
form of government in this country.
<P>
	What is the difference between his position as a Reformer, 
insisting that Ottawa be diminished as much as possible, to nothing 
more than an institution that looks after trade and passports, giving 
all the power to the provinces, and that of the Bloc Quebecois? 
What is the difference between Mr. Manning and Mr. Bouchard, if I 
may ask?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member said ``Mr. Manning''. I presume 
this is the man who sits in our House and is the leader of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose I have three or four minutes 
to answer this question. I could go on for 35 minutes about the 
differences between Mr. Bouchard and the leader of the third party.
<P>
	I could go on for the same length of time about the similarities or 
some of the similar aims of the Liberal Party and the separatist 
party. I could talk about the way they want to carve Canada into 
two separate blocs. We are going to have the distinct society of 
Quebec and then the rest.
<P>
	I could talk about the fact that when it comes to the welfare 
system in British Columbia there is a residency requirement. The 
Liberal government levied a $30 million fine. The Quebec 
government has a different standard for tuition for university 
students outside of their province and what does the Liberal 
government say? Oh well, Quebecers will be Quebecers. We must 
live with it. In other words, the Liberals seem to think it is okay to 
treat Quebec separately and different, give them some kind of 
special treatment, but that is not the big issue.
<P>
	What is the big issue? If the answer to keeping Canada together 
is to spend a lot, intrude into provincial territory and force 
programs on the provincial governments whether they like it or not, 
or if the answer is to treat one province differently than the other, or 
when a crisis comes throw money at it, for example Bombardier, 
but we will not worry about Canadian Airlines, then I suppose 
Canada would be a unified country that is solidly together and 
looking to Ottawa for great leadership.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6754"> 6754 </A></B>
<P>
	What has happened over the last 25 years? We have a $600 
billion debt. We have an intrusive federal government. We cannot 
now even get agreement on a national day care plan. Why? 
Because no province trusts the federal government any more. They 
say the federal government will start the program, yank the 
funding and they will be left holding the bag.
<P>
	Now the provinces do not trust the federal government because it 
is not able to carry through with its financing, because it will not 
carry through with its promises to the point where the provinces, 
not just Quebec, but all the provinces are saying if this is 
federalism, if this is the answer then why on earth should they keep 
throwing money at Ottawa?
<P>
	The Reform's vision of Canada is of a country which restricts its 
role in certain areas. Would it not be great for the federal 
government to do eight or ten functions really well? Would it not be 
great to have unanimity among the provinces and the Canadian 
public to say: ``Do you think you should have an overriding role for 
the environment?'' Yes, because environmental concerns cross 
provincial borders.
<P>
	I would rather leave the promotion of culture to the Quebecois or 
the people in British Columbia as they see fit. The minister of 
culture here does not even know what culture is. If you ask her to 
define culture she does not even know what Canadian culture is.
<P>
	What the hon. member is saying about separatism of course is 
nonsense. The way to hold the country together is to do fewer 
things, do them well, pay your way, do not ask your grandchildren 
to pay your debts and keep the country together by doing the 
necessary things well rather than doing many things poorly.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Will the hon. member for Parkdale-High Park be 
speaking 20 minutes or will he be sharing his time with another 
member?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
shall be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Cumberland-Colchester.
<P>
	I shall keep my remarks brief because two parliamentary 
standing committees are waiting for my presence there also.
<P>
	I am pleased that I have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-63, an 
act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act. 
This bill is greatly needed as it modernizes and improves the 
efficiency of our electoral administration. I am very pleased that 
this bill has been brought forward as I have believed for quite some 
time that it was necessary because of our inefficient enumeration 
process.
<P>
	During every election we hear horror stories of residents of 
entire streets and whole apartment buildings not being enumerated. 
Many voters are omitted because they are travelling or working 
odd shifts during the  enumeration period. Yet other voters are not 
enumerated because of language barriers or because they simply do 
not want to open their doors due to security concerns. It is sad but 
many people are afraid to open their doors when they are knocked 
on late in the evening. As a result they do not get enumerated. 
Others do not discover the omission of their names until they arrive 
at the polls on election day.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	That is why on December 13, 1988, after the election, I urged 
Parliament to approve the following recommendations: first, to 
develop a registration process to establish permanent voters lists; 
second, to approve election day voter's registration in urban areas, 
the same right that is given to rural voters. Implementation of the 
latter recommendation has prevented discrimination against urban 
voters and guarantees Canadian voters their citizenship rights. It is 
our duty as parliamentarians to make it easier for citizens to vote, 
not to place obstacles in their way. Bill C-63 does just that.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that through Bill C-63 a permanent voters 
register will be created. That will solve many of the problems I 
mentioned. The bill will pave the way to a 1997 election campaign 
based on 36 days as opposed to the current 47 days. This is an 
excellent move for it will save the federal government and the 
Canadian taxpayers a sum of $30 million per federal election.
<P>
	The shortened election period will generate approximately $8 
million of the $30 million savings to the Canadian taxpayers for 
each federal election. By having the permanent register with a 
shortened election period we can expect significant cost savings. 
Another benefit that results from this bill is that the permanent 
register can be shared with provinces, municipalities and school 
boards for their elections which would generate even more savings 
for Canadians.
<P>
	Sharing and pooling resources makes a lot of sense. The 
permanent register of voters will be updated using data from 
Revenue Canada, lists of new Canadian citizens from Citizenship 
and Immigration Canada and from provincial and territorial motor 
vehicle and vital statistics data.
<P>
	It is worth noting, as the bill states, that the register will be 
established from information collected by enumeration, but will be 
held outside the electoral period. Between electoral events these 
lists will be updated. No longer will Canadians be left off voters 
lists because of the short enumeration period and the obstacles I 
described earlier.
<P>
	Bill C-63 is very convenient. When an election is called the 
preliminary lists will be distributed within five days of the issuing 
of the writs. Election expense limits will be available 31 days 
before polling day as opposed to the 24 days under the current 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6755"> 6755 </A></B>
<P>
legislation. This will allow the  candidate to assess earlier what his 
or her expense limits are.
<P>
	The objects of Bill C-63 and the amendments are very clear: to 
make our electoral administration more practical and efficient. As 
someone who has campaigned as a Liberal candidate in five 
elections, winning four and losing one, I applaud the government 
for this bill and I am certain that Canadians will support it as well. I 
am pleased we will have good support from the opposition parties 
on this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was pleased 
to hear the wise and tested comments of the hon. member for 
Parkdale-High Park. I recall one of his first campaigns when I 
was barely in high school. Of course he was successful. As he 
indicated, he has seen many elections in the past.
<P>
	Could the hon. member provide a few other illustrations of how 
he believes a permanent voters' list might be able to assist us in not 
only realizing economies of scale as far as the federal and 
provincial governments working together but also in confirming at 
least for the voters that they can make their minds up in 37 days? 
They do not need 47 days. Perhaps the hon. member would like to 
provide some greater wisdom to the House of Commons of his own 
experiences, notwithstanding, of course, yours, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> I appreciate that question. My advice to Canadians 
would be that the day they become old enough to vote is the day to 
start taking an interest in the established parties. I advise young 
students who reach voting age that they do not have to vote for me 
because I am running as the Liberal candidate. My advice is to 
study all the parties and get involved, join the local association, be 
it the Parkdale-High Park association, be it the Conservative 
association, the New Democratic Party association, the Green 
Party, or the Reform Party. They should get involved early, study 
what each party stands for and then see if the ideology, the 
philosophy, the vision of that party meets what their vision is for 
Canada.
<P>
	The people sitting in the House do not put all of this energy into 
getting elected for ourselves. We are building a future country for 
our children, their children, their grandchildren and so on. It is 
people like former Prime Minister Laurier who had such visions, 
Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson who had such visions. Our 
present Prime Minister has such a vision for the future of Canada. 
This is why he is travelling abroad as Team Canada.
<P>
	I advise the young people not to wait for the writ to be called, 
and not to wait to be enumerated. They should have their minds 
already made up. Then when the writ is called, I think that is when 
they should attend all  candidates meetings. That is where they can 
study the literature.
<P>
	I do not think they need more than a month to decide, to be able 
to say that yes, that is the party, that is the candidate that they are 
going to vote for.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to support Bill 
C-63, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act. The bottom line is 
that this legislation is good news for taxpayers. It is good news 
because it will make election campaigns shorter and simpler and it 
will save Canadians money.
<P>
	The purpose of this legislation is to establish a permanent voters' 
list. This list will be used for federal general elections, byelections, 
referendums, municipal and provincial elections, even school 
board elections and will eliminate the need for door to door 
enumeration.
<P>
	Above all, it reduces overlap and duplication. For many years 
there has been considerable interest and support for the idea of a 
permanent voters' list. Indeed, a great deal of research has gone 
into determining the best system to bring Canada in line with other 
Commonwealth countries.
<P>
	As Patrick Boyer writes in ``Election Law in Canada,'' no other 
country has a system where the lists of voters are prepared afresh 
on a systematic basic and so close to the time of voting as does 
Canada. While it is true that our current system produces extremely 
accurate voters' lists it is also the most expensive component of the 
election process.
<P>
	There would be one last enumeration done in the spring of 1997. 
Currently in most provinces all three levels of government spend 
resources compiling their own voters' lists. This results in 
considerable duplication and expense. In these times of economic 
responsibility and fiscal restraint all levels of government must 
learn to work together on behalf of the Canadian taxpayer and there 
is only one. We must produce legislation and policies that are both 
cost efficient and effective.
<P>
	That is what Bill C-63 is all about. It is in the spirit of restraint 
and responsibility that election officials from across the country 
have expressed a willingness to explore options and possibilities 
for establishing this permanent and shared voters' list. The 
province of British Columbia has successfully employed a 
permanent and shared voters' list since 1946 and several other 
provinces are currently working on establishing similar registers of 
data.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Establishing a permanent voters list will reduce the cost of an 
election by eliminating door to door enumeration and also by 
shortening the time of the election campaign. Door to door 
enumeration is the single largest cost of an electoral event. It is 
extremely labour intensive and must be completed within a very 
demanding short time frame. In addition, the public is often 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6756"> 6756 </A></B>
<P>
inconvenienced by enumeration, particularly when the same 
information is being sought by several levels of government.
<P>
	The realities of the 1990s dictate that fewer people are at home 
during the daytime, forcing enumerators to make their rounds in 
the evening. Given that much of this work is done on foot, this 
raises security concerns for enumerators and makes residents more 
reluctant to participate. A permanent voters list would also help to 
ensure the inclusion of people who are not at home during the 
enumeration period and on election day.
<P>
	While some concerns have been raised that a permanent voters 
register would eliminate thousands of jobs for enumerators at 
election time, it is important to realize that other more permanent 
jobs would be created at the registry offices across the country.
<P>
	Concerns have also been voiced about the privacy and 
confidentiality of the list and the information it will contain. 
Canadians need not worry. The permanent register will only 
contain the elector's name, mailing address, municipal address, 
electoral district, gender and date of birth, all of which will be 
updated using existing federal and provincial data sources. There 
will be legislative and administrative safeguards to guarantee that 
the list can only be used for electoral purposes. In addition, 
individuals with privacy concerns will be able to opt out of the 
permanent list.
<P>
	The most important advantage of a permanent voters list is 
undeniably the money it will save Canadian taxpayers. Indeed, the 
projected cost savings to the federal government will total $30 
million per electoral event by eliminating the need for door to door 
enumeration.
<P>
	Bill C-63 will also allow the election period to be shortened from 
47 days to a more efficient time of 36 days. A shorter campaign 
will still allow voters an opportunity to get to know the candidates 
and their policies. At the same time, it will eliminate time for 
campaign rhetoric. How often have we heard the public say enough 
is enough, get on with the vote. Candidates will have to be effective 
and efficient in their use of campaign time which is exactly how it 
should be. The shorter campaign period will save the government 
and taxpayers an additional $8 million per election.
<P>
	There is widespread support for this initiative across the country. 
In fact, a survey conducted by Elections Canada in 1996 found that 
over 90 per cent of Canadians responded and supported the idea of 
a permanent register. Representatives from three recognized parties 
in this House have indicated their support in principle for Bill 
C-63.
<P>
	While our current method of enumeration is highly accurate, the 
cost of the system in terms of financial and  human resources is too 
high to be maintained. That is why this government is looking 
ahead and planning for the future of the democratic process. Now is 
the time to implement a more effective and more efficient system, 
one that is keeping pace with technology and with other 
Commonwealth countries and one that will save taxpayers almost 
$40 million in the next election alone.
<P>
	For these reasons, I urge all hon. members in this House to join 
with me in supporting Bill C-63 and supporting these cost saving 
and efficient measures that will guarantee engendering taxpayers' 
support in the democratic process.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to point out to my colleague across the way that, after all she 
has said about this bill, I think she has left out the most important 
part. For us, the most important part is the funding of political 
parties. The bill is silent on this topic. You have, of course, been 
aware of the Bloc Quebecois's position from the beginning.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has always fiercely defended the principle 
by which political parties must get their funding from individual 
contributions. The bill before us today does not spell this out.
<P>
	In addition, the political funding of the Bloc Quebecois is not 
determined by this legislation, but by the legislation governing 
political parties in Quebec. Accordingly, funding may come only 
from voters, the only ones entitled to make political contributions.
<P>
	Thus, having established this principle, we are not at the mercy 
of organizations and corporations that could, by making very large 
contributions to campaign funds, blackmail, as it were, those 
holding power.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague why she did not make the point 
to her caucus that her party should add a funding policy to the 
Canada Elections Act that would limit contributions to voters 
alone?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question of the 
hon. Bloc Quebecois member.
<P>
	It is a very interesting topic of discussion, as to who should 
contribute or could contribute to the democratic process and what 
kind of credit they should receive. Under the current system it is a 
tax credit which goes to any individual. By no means would we 
obstruct anyone from donating to the political process, to the 
democratic process of this country.
<P>
	We take pride in having one of the freest and greatest democratic 
countries in the world. That is evident by the fact that we have a 
separatist opposition party requesting a change today. There is 
probably not another country in  the world which would have as its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6757"> 6757 </A></B>
<P>
official opposition a separatist party attempting to pull the country 
apart.
<P>
	I feel confident that the Canadian taxpayers choose freely how, 
when and who might give to the political process through the credit 
taxation system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member took great pains to stress the money which would be saved 
by this bill and I am sure we are all very happy about that.
<P>
	There is also a new technology which would enable us to save a 
lot of money and there was no mention of it in the bill. That is the 
use of electronic touch-tone voting. Introducing that technology or 
making it possible for Elections Canada to do it would make it very 
convenient for the elderly, the disabled and other people who might 
have difficulty getting to the polls. It would also potentially save 
enormous amounts of money.
<P>
	Even though it is not in the bill, would the member indicate if 
she would support Elections Canada moving toward electronic 
voting as one method of voting?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member of the Reform 
Party brings up a very valid and important point.
<P>
	The province of Nova Scotia used electronic voting in a 
leadership campaign a few years ago. That was one of the times it 
was used and it was very successful when the technology was 
initiated. It is something we could look at.
<P>
	This is the first step in electoral reform in the elections act. It is 
the beginning step. I am sure with technology improvements and 
the rapid pace of change that we will be forward looking in 
addressing any amendments which might be brought forward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
inform you that I will share my speaking time with the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup.
<P>
	Amending the Canada Elections Act is an exercise which, in my 
opinion, should be taken seriously. It means the entire legislation 
should be reviewed. It is not a matter of adding a few things here 
and there which do nothing to improve the legislation.
<P>
	I noticed that members opposite did not consider this legislation 
to be very important. The only thing that seems important to them 
is to pass this bill as quickly as possible, to rush it through 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian public wants electoral legislation that is clear and 
transparent. The public has the right to be well informed. However, 
the government does not seem willing to pass legislation that 
would guarantee Canadians the dice are not loaded.
<P>
	This bill has certain weaknesses. It completely overlooks the fact 
that campaign spending should be strictly controlled. By keeping 
spending to a minimum, more citizens will be given a chance to 
express their views in a given party. Everyone will be on the same 
footing. There will be a level playing field. Consider Quebec's 
legislation on political party financing, adopted by the LÃ©vesque 
government in 1977. I truly believe that since that time, and this 
has been proven, the public is satisfied with the situation. Quebec 
legislation provides that only individual voters may help finance 
political parties.
<P>
	The Canadian legislation, including the bill before us today, is 
far more flexible. Businesses and unions have the right to finance 
political parties. Now seriously, has anyone ever seen a business or 
a company vote? Never.
<P>
	Another question that comes to mind is this: Why were 
companies and businesses given the right to finance a political 
party? The answer is obvious. These companies and businesses use 
their contributions to try and influence the government.
<P>
	If a business gives several thousand dollars to a political party 
and this party forms the government, the business can expect the 
government to return the favour. These are the businesses where 
the government will find its friends, and often, these friends are 
appointed to positions in various commissions.
<P>
	In other words, the present way political parties are financed 
encourages lobbying. When we say lobbying, we are getting pretty 
close to nepotism and patronage. Legislation that is clear should 
emphasize the fact that only voters have the right to finance 
political parties.
<P>
	What about these big fundraising dinners? In 1993, a few days 
before the election, there were banquets at $1,000 and $3,000 per 
plate.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Who in Canada can afford such an expense, except the 
well-to-do, who arrange for their company to pick up the tab. I 
think, therefore, that a bill like the one before us must restrict the 
funding of political parties to voters. It must reflect democracy, and 
thus equal opportunities for all. In this bill, democracy takes a 
beating.
<P>
	Next, the bill proposes a permanent register of electors. I do not 
think this is a bad idea, except that all the necessary information 
has to be provided in order to further democracy. The list must 
ensure that elections personnel are able to identify voters. If they 
cannot, we could face problems that might topple power on one 
side or the other.
<P>
	For example, if the list does not include the date of birth, a 
person of dubious intentions could represent himself as another 
individual and deny that person the right to vote. The date of birth 
is essential to the permanent list. It is vital in helping electoral 
personnel  identify people more easily. In the old days, we used to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6758"> 6758 </A></B>
<P>
talk about floating voters, where, for example, people would vote 
using the names of the dead. We have to take every precaution to 
avoid taking a step backwards.
<P>
	Another factor involves registering a person's gender. It may not 
appear necessary to everyone, but I consider it very important. You 
will understand that in a riding like mine it may be necessary. Just 
think about the name ``Tremblay'' in my riding. Add to this first 
names that are as common for women as they are for men, such as 
Claude, Dominique, Camille or Michel, and it becomes impossible 
for returning officers to certify that the person before them is 
indeed the one whose name is on the list. Nowadays, ill-intentioned 
people can still do aggravating things to voters. Therefore, it is 
necessary to take into account all these details when making up a 
permanent voters list.
<P>
	I agree that the current act must be amended, but not in haste as 
the government seems intent on doing. An election act affects all 
citizens, regardless of who they are. Will the government have 
time, before the next election, to properly inform all voters about 
this permanent list?
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	If the bill before us is passed, it should not apply to the next 
election. Why? Because voters need to know their rights.
<P>
	Another issue which is not dealt with in the bill is the possibility 
of legislating a set date for an election. I can tell you that such a 
measure would save a lot of money and speculation.
<P>
	In the United States, for example, everyone knows what to 
expect. In Canada, it is still not the case. Two and half years into a 
mandate, people already start wondering whether an election will 
be held in the fall or the spring. And so on.
<P>
	A lot of energy could instead be devoted to reviewing many bills 
that we currently do not have time to look at. This period is viewed 
much more as a pre-election time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I am sorry, but your 10 
minutes are up. I now recognize the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul CrÃªte (Kamouraska-RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can understand that, with the upcoming changes to the 
electoral map, which will mean that the TÃ©miscouata polling 
division will shift to the riding of 
Kamouraska-RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup-TÃ©miscouata-Les Basques, you 
might get a bit turned around, but no matter, because it will be the 
same person here after the next election.
<P>
	I had a question for my hon. colleague, one I have been asking 
myself ever since I came here. On a number of occasions, the Bloc 
Quebecois has come back to the issue of funding of political 
parties. Being 43 years old and having been raised in the political 
culture established by RenÃ© LÃ©vesque, according to which the 
funding of political parties in Quebec is based on contributions 
from individuals rather than corporations, I have the impression 
that this argument, in democratic terms, is very convincing in and 
of itself and does not require further explanations.
<P>
	I would like to know whether my colleague thinks that it is 
because of a lack of courage that the present government has failed 
to address this in the bill, because it would have been impossible to 
break the vicious circle by which, when a company has contributed 
$50,000, it then influences the way in which political parties are 
funded, and by influencing political parties, companies can keep 
making $50,000 contributions.
<P>
	Is it because the present government lacked the courage to 
change this state of affairs, or is it also because of a certain 
ignorance of political culture, of the positive effects that could 
arise from such a reform?
<P>
	I would like to know whether my colleague thinks it is for one of 
these two reasons, or for another reason altogether that he thinks 
would help us understand better why the government is reforming 
the elections act but is closing its eyes to such an important aspect 
as funding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to my hon. colleague's 
question, let me say, first of all, as I indicated earlier, that every 
chance we have had since coming here in 1993, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have defended funding of political parties as we know it 
in Quebec.
<P>
	We have also strongly criticized funding by big business, these 
large corporations that make huge profits every year and can easily 
afford to make substantial contributions to the traditional parties 
such as the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. Any 
government receiving such funding has no choice but to return the 
favour at one time or another. For one thing, what this means for 
democracy is scary.
<P>
	Will bills introduced in the House under these circumstances 
truly reflect the wishes of the people or those of the lobbyists and 
financial backers? That is the first part of my answer.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Now, as to whether the people opposite had enough courage or 
not, I have to say that they lacked courage in introducing this bill. 
For once, funding of political parties could have been put in the 
hands of those who should have it, the voters, with a cap on 
contributions.
<P>
	Our colleagues across the way missed a golden opportunity to 
give power and opportunity, equal power and opportunity to all. At 
present, there is disparity. Some political parties are immensely 
rich because big business keeps pouring money into their coffers, 
while the others get the crumbs. This necessarily has an effect on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6759"> 6759 </A></B>
<P>
the debates. All parties are not on an equal footing, there are strings 
attached. They certainly lacked political courage in this matter.
<P>
	There is still time to take corrective action. They could do it right 
now. But they will argue that, traditionally, nothing new is added at 
third reading stage, that we should either pass or defeat what we 
have before us.
<P>
	The strength of the Parti Quebecois is in public funding. You can 
be sure of one thing: we will get re-elected in the next election and 
we will have public funding to thank for that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul CrÃªte (Kamouraska-RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate at third reading on 
Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the 
Referendum Act, which includes interesting things, such as a 
computerized file and other significant technical changes.
<P>
	On the other hand, as the hon. member pointed out earlier, and I 
will elaborate on this, the bill is silent on an important issue, 
namely the financing of political parties. This is something which, 
under the British democratic system, has evolved very slowly. 
Quebec uses a very modern system, a system that is almost ahead 
of its time, compared to what exists in Canada, North America and 
even elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	Let me make a comparison for the benefit of voters. Under the 
Quebec act, only individuals can make financial contributions to 
political parties, up to a maximum of $3,000 per party. Companies, 
unions, organizations or lobby groups cannot give a cheque to the 
government and thus have an influence they should not have, since 
they do not vote.
<P>
	By comparison, the federal legislation allows any corporate 
entity to help finance political parties. As we know, a number of 
big businesses, particularly in the banking sector, take full 
advantage of that provision. Lists of contributions show amounts of 
money as high as $30,000, $50,000 or $80,000 paid to political 
parties.
<P>
	Under the federal legislation, there is no ceiling for such 
contributions. There is a maximum for income tax purposes, but 
nothing prevents someone from contributing $100,000. To give you 
an example, the New Democratic Party once received $250,000 
from someone. This has a negative impact on democracy.
<P>
	I think political parties can become somewhat complacent and 
dependent when not forced to go and meet people like the Bloc 
Quebecois does. We ask people to contribute $10, $20 or $50 to 
help our party survive. We talk with voters, who give us their views 
and tell us about their interests and concerns. This is very healthy 
for the political life of a party.
<P>
	However, it is not easy. It requires daily and constant efforts. It 
may not be the favourite part of our work, but it forces us to be in 
touch with voters. Therefore, this issue should have been dealt with 
in the act. The government should have taken this opportunity to do 
so.
<P>
	Under the current federal legislation, political parties rely on 
cocktail parties at $1,000 a head, on special meetings at $2,000, 
$5,000 or $10,000, and even on cheques in the amount of $50,000 
or $80,000 from businesses. Then you know what happens to the 
legislative process.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Then, when an organization has a point of view to give on a bill 
being drafted or one already tabled, there is a tendency to listen a 
little harder when someone has given us $50,000, for example, or 
when Canadian banks contribute $300,000 or $400,000; there is a 
chance that the government will be more receptive. The ordinary 
citizen cannot come up with this sort of money. There is a double 
standard. Our democracy, which is so well viewed in the world, 
still has a little way to go.
<P>
	Earlier, a member of the government party said that Parliament 
is wonderful because it tolerates a party that she described as 
separatist, but that I would call sovereignist. I would reply to the 
member that we are here today primarily because of our funding, 
which is rooted in Quebec's tradition of looking to individuals for 
contributions. We set our own constraint, so that, although the 
federal legislation allowed us to seek funding from companies, 
unions and organizations, we did not choose that route; we decided 
to respect the spirit and the letter of the Quebec legislation and to 
accept contributions from individuals only.
<P>
	That meant that we certainly had our work cut out for us in the 
years before the election, but, at the same time, it brought us into 
contact with voters, with the result that we could be sure that, 
unlike other platforms, our party's platform reflected what 
Quebecers wanted. This is the advantage of funding by individuals. 
This fundamental concern with ensuring contact with the citizen 
was almost the greatest contribution made by RenÃ© LÃ©vesque to 
democracy in Quebec.
<P>
	I would like to mention various pieces of legislation, because 
this is the ultimate result. It allows legislators to be much more 
independent of large corporations, unions and other organizations.
<P>
	Quebec has passed minimum terms of employment legislation, 
voluntary retirement and anti-strikebreaking legislation, and 
legislation banning advertising aimed at children. Is this not the 
very legislation which, in a system with very powerful lobbies that 
even go so far as to make financial contributions, would not have 
been passed by a government with behind the scenes forces at 
work?
<P>
	If the children's advertising industry had been able to contribute 
$50,000, $100,00 or $200,000 in Quebec in order to oppose this 
bill, do you think we would have succeeded in creating legislation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6760"> 6760 </A></B>
<P>
as progressive and as generous to the public, while meeting the 
criteria for equality in our society?
<P>
	The funding of political parties is an important and significant 
element in a society's democratic quality of life. It is regrettable 
that, when the government was revising its Elections Act, it did not 
take the time to find a solution to this. Perhaps there could have 
been compromises, but there is certainly material here for a start: a 
ceiling on campaign contributions could have been set.
<P>
	The present Liberal government could certainly have stated that 
$5,000, or $10,000 was the maximum that could be accepted. Then, 
when people come looking for favours, saying ``Well, I did give 
you a hand'', the answer is ``Yes, you did give a hand, but that 
helping hand is worth a maximum of $5,000 or $10,000. One is not, 
therefore, required to bend over backwards in response to large 
donations. That could have made a difference, having a ceiling, but 
the main element is that only individuals may donate. This makes 
us independent.
<P>
	Taking the example of the taxation document tabled by the Bloc 
Quebecois, do you think a political party which had received 
$50,000 or $100,000 from various organizations could have tabled 
a document of such quality, one acknowledged by the finance 
minister himself as constructive and positive? No, this was a 
document based on common sense, on the outcome of the 
consultations we held.
<P>
	The official opposition finance critic, among others, came to my 
riding. Meetings were held with chamber of commerce members. 
They shared their opinions with us. We included in our proposal the 
views of the La PocatiÃ¨re and RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup chambers of 
commerce, views which are moderate, interesting and non-partisan 
and hence could be used. The entire document was drafted without 
any undue pressure from anyone. On the other hand, banks and 
labour unions could also make representations.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In the case of Canadian, do we not have a situation that is 
strongly influenced by political party financing? One wonders 
whether things would have been different if contributions could 
only be made by individuals and whether there would not have 
been an entirely different solution to the future of air transportation 
from Canada to other countries as opposed to the one we have now, 
where we have a lame duck that has been barely surviving for the 
past few years.
<P>
	Why does the government keep pouring money into this 
company? What could justify this? It is difficult to find an answer, 
but I think that if the government had included in the bill a 
provision to tighten the rules for political party financing, this 
would have been a major contribution.
<P>
	In 10, 15 or 20 years, people would have said that this 
government brought about major changes in standards of political 
behaviour and that individual citizens have become more important 
to their elected representatives because only individuals can 
finance their activities and influence them in what they do by the 
quality of their argument, not by the number of dollars in their 
wallet.
<P>
	These are important factors which we do not find in the bill, and 
that is pity. Revising legislation like the Canada Elections Act and 
the Referendum Act is not a daily occurrence. That is what we are 
about to do, and a few elements will be in effect for the next 
election. So at the end of this century and into the next decade, we 
can expect to live with the present legislation. There are elements 
that should have been considered regarding financing. These are 
not in the bill, and it is really too bad and is difficult to accept.
<P>
	However, I believe we in the Bloc Quebecois are known for our 
tenacity and for the fact that we can open the books at any time and 
say who contributed to our campaign, and I think the Government 
of Canada missed a wonderful opportunity to make major changes 
to improve the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I have 
understood what my colleague said, he feels that, in Canada, there 
are two sorts of contributions under the existing elections act and 
even with the bill before us. There are political financial 
contributions and there are ideological financial contributions.
<P>
	Here is an example. In Canada, in recent years, only about two 
per cent of the population has contributed reasonable sums to 
political parties. This may be described as ideological funding. 
These people give because they believe in the party's program, its 
intentions and its policy.
<P>
	On the other hand, always during this time and under the former 
elections act, new contributions, political financial contributions, 
were made. For example, 40 per cent of the top 500 companies 
made contributions, and 35 per cent of the top 155 financial 
institutions contributed in the same period.
<P>
	When the bulk of a political party's funding comes from these 
major financial institutions, and this is my question to my 
colleague, does their contribution affect objectives, policies and the 
legislation introduced in this House? Do these people not expect, 
and this is my other question, some sort of return on the exorbitant 
amounts they contribute to the traditional federal parties?
<P>
	<B>Mr. CrÃªte:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question. I will answer by giving him two examples. The first one I 
will draw from our political past.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6761"> 6761 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As you know, in Quebec in the 1960s, the government took over 
the hydro sector. I suspect that was when LÃ©vesque developed his 
plan to limit the funding of political parties to that provided by 
individuals.
<P>
	A very powerful lobby of private companies opposed 
government ownership of utilities. These companies were making 
important contributions to the political parties. They used to send 
all kinds of money to ministers and members of Parliament and 
LÃ©vesque was keenly aware of this pressure. His reasoning was that 
those he spoke with thought government ownership made plain 
common sense. That was his finding.
<P>
	Then, he figured there might be a way of reducing the pressure 
and ensuring that the voters are given as much importance as those 
who do not have the right to vote. In a democracy, the greater the 
importance given to the voters at the expense of those who do not 
have the right to vote, the more significant and interesting it sounds 
to me.
<P>
	The other aspects I would like to address is family trusts in the 
existing system. Take the hypothetical case, in relation to family 
trusts, where funding by corporations and other organizations did 
not exist. Would the outcome have been the same if only individual 
citizens could have funded these trusts? To ask the question is to 
answer it. That is why this reform is incomplete.
<P>
	This is an incomplete bill. There is an important element 
missing. The government overlooked a significant aspect in 
lacking courage in establishing its political base: the funding of its 
political activities. The bill does not contain the main thing that is 
required to ensure the quality of democratic life that suits our 
needs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to support Bill C-63. This is an important stage in 
the process undertaken two years ago to establish a permanent 
voters list. Members who took part in this exercise know how 
necessary it had become to modernize our electoral system.
<P>
	I would like to briefly point out the four key elements of the bill, 
for the benefit of those who are not very familiar with the issue.
<P>
	First, the bill provides for the establishment of a permanent 
register of electors to replace the door to door census. Second, the 
electoral period is reduced from 47 to 36 days. Third, one last door 
to door census outside of an electoral period will be used to make 
the preliminary list of voters that will be distributed in the five days 
following the call of the next election. This census will also 
provide the basic information for the permanent electoral list. 
Fourth, changes are made to voting hours, so as to put all Canadian 
electors on the same footing.
<P>
	The bill will basically allow a more modern and effective 
management of electoral operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to emphasize the considerable work that preceded 
the introduction of this bill and the high degree of consensus I 
believe exists around its provisions and the necessity to move on 
these changes.
<P>
	Through the work of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform 
and Party Financing and the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, many elements of this bill have been explored. 
Furthermore, the bill now reflects committee amendments flowing 
from the diligent work of my colleagues on that same committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to say a few words on comments made earlier today 
by the hon. member for Bellechasse, who made a major 
contribution to the process that led to this bill. I must reject the 
comments he made, when, to a certain extent, he questioned the 
credibility of the staff of Canada's chief electoral officer. In my 
opinion, these people have served well all members from all 
political parties who took part in the exercise.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I understand that this is the great hall of debate, to debate ideas 
and to debate values, but I only regret that we have commented 
today on professional officials, darned good professional officials, 
who served the committee and this whole process very well. Yes, 
they were in attendance, and continue to be today, to be consulted 
by all parliamentarians who have an interest in this process. 
However, I regret that there was some doubt left as to their 
integrity. I want to express on behalf of the government our total 
confidence in those officials, which ultimately reflects our 
confidence in our entire electoral process. I do not believe we 
should compromise either their independence or their impartiality.
<P>
	In addition, our chief electoral officer and his staff have worked 
on this issue, at times in consultation with provincial counterparts 
and members of the committee. I believe we now have a bill which 
meets the needs of Canadians and it should be implemented as soon 
as possible.
<P>
	It has been suggested that there has not been enough time to 
consider this bill. In fact, Elections Canada began working on the 
register in 1994. Elections Canada apprised the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs several times on its 
progress, including the feasibility report which was presented in 
March 1996. This led to more work and the result is the proposal 
which is before the House today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6762"> 6762 </A></B>
<P>
	In summary, the register project has moved ahead as quickly 
as possible while providing time for parliamentary study and 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If I may, I would first like to provide the House with a few 
explanations about this bill. As I mentioned earlier, a final 
enumeration will be carried out nationally, not during an election 
period.
<P>
	The procedure used for this enumeration would be the same as 
the one used after writs are issued. This final enumeration would be 
beneficial from two points of view.
<P>
	First, it would make it possible, in anticipation of the next 
general election, the 36th in our history, to compile a preliminary 
list of voters, which would be distributed in the five days after the 
writs are issued. Rapid distribution of this and subsequent lists will 
make it possible to shorten the electoral period. Canadians quite 
obviously want a shorter election campaign, for practical as well as 
economic reasons, but also because it would allow greater 
intergovernmental co-operation.
<P>
	Second, this final enumeration would provide an opportunity to 
collect the data necessary to compile a permanent register of 
voters. Enumerators will ask voters their full name, address, sex 
and date of birth, and ask them to confirm that they are indeed 18 
years of age and Canadian citizens.
<P>
	On the question of sex, the government is pleased to support an 
amendment restricting this information to internal management of 
the register by Elections Canada. It will not appear on the lists 
distributed to parties, candidates and provincial administrations, if 
their legislation requires it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The permanent register would be compiled through this last door 
to door enumeration and through the use of the Prince Edward 
Island and Alberta lists, since these provinces are better positioned 
to co-operate with Elections Canada. The register would be fully 
operational for electoral events following the next general election.
<P>
	What are the benefits of this bill? The register would be 
maintained and kept election ready by Elections Canada. It would 
keep the list current by drawing from existing federal and 
provincial data sources. It is also important to note that the register 
would generate the preliminary list of electors for an electoral 
event whose early availability is key to a shortened campaign.
<P>
	Once the writs are issued there would also be a new and 
enhanced revision process to ensure that all Canadians have the 
opportunity to have their names on the voting list.
<P>
	A permanent register of electors has several advantages. Over 
time it would provide considerable savings at the federal level by 
replacing door to door  enumeration with data provided by Revenue 
Canada and Citizenship and Immigration Canada. We estimate the 
federal savings at $30 million for each federal general election. It 
would also save costs for parties by making it possible to shorten 
the electoral period to 36 days.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It has been asked why 36 days was decided on. The Royal 
Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing had 
recommended a 40 day campaign. Ontario's campaign is 37 days 
long. Certain countries, such as Great Britain and Australia, also 
have short campaigns.
<P>
	The amendment means that federal campaigns, both 
referendums and general elections, will be 36 days long. We 
anticipate that provincial and municipal administrations will also 
want to have access to the federal register. Should this be the case, 
there will be additional savings to taxpayers, who support the three 
levels of government after all.
<P>
	Finally, this register will encourage better federal-provincial 
co-operation and make it possible to reduce overlap and 
duplication.
<P>
	Elections Canada worked with all its provincial counterparts on 
this project. They are enthusiastically and impatiently waiting to 
see the final version of this legislation in order to finalize the latest 
agreements with Elections Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Elections officials in Alberta and Prince Edward Island are right 
now best positioned to collaborate with Elections Canada in 
building the first register. The New Brunswick legislature is 
debating relevant legislation at this time. In other words, the 
provinces are supportive and eager to see us institute this initiative.
<P>
	This enthusiasm extends to provincial registrars of motor 
vehicles and of vital statistics where there are agreements in 
principle to provide Elections Canada with data once the federal 
legislation is passed. Allow me to make several points about the 
bill absolutely clear.
<P>
	The register of electors would not prevent a citizen from 
exercising his or her constitutionally protected right to vote. 
Citizens would not have to have their name on the register to vote. 
However, they would need to ensure that their name is placed on 
the voters list either during the electoral campaign or on polling 
day using procedures already in the law and enhanced by this bill. 
Also, we believe the register would be as efficient in terms of 
accuracy as the current system of door to door enumeration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6763"> 6763 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill respects voters' privacy and includes measures aimed at 
ensuring the confidentiality of personal information.
<P>
	We insist that the principle of active consent be applied to any 
information issued by federal sources. This is particularly 
important for any information transmitted by Revenue Canada. 
Taxpayers would, in fact, be required to check a box on their tax 
return indicating their consent to having their name, address and 
date of birth passed on to Elections Canada.
<P>
	A similar approach would be used with new Canadians, to ensure 
that they could exercise their newly acquired right to vote.
<P>
	The bill also indicates who would be entitled to use this 
information and states that it is to be used for election purposes 
only. Any improper use of the information would be subject to 
strict penalties.
<P>
	Voters could also write to the chief electoral officer in order to 
request that their personal information be stricken from the voters' 
register, or that they continue to be included in the federal listing, 
without any possibility of the information being passed on to other 
electoral administrations. Similarly, they could also ask for access 
to their information and have any errors corrected or changes 
made.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Once Canadians learn of the advantages of the new system they 
will want to ensure its success. With some 3.7 million changes each 
year to the population of eligible voters we need this multifaceted 
approach to keeping the register current.
<P>
	On a final clarification, the bill ensures that each vote carries 
equal weight. We have struck a compromise that is equitable within 
the geography of a country that majestically spans six time zones. 
The proposed voting day schedule acknowledges a world of 
instantaneous communication but ensures that each vote has equal 
weight, whether cast in the riding of St. John's East, Newfoundland 
or in Skeena, British Columbia.
<P>
	In conclusion, members are asked to vote on a bill that reflects 
work of the past years, modernizes our electoral system, gives each 
vote equal weight, meets concerns of opposition and government 
parties and promotes federal-provincial co-operation.
<P>
	Fundamentally this bill is consistent with our democratic 
traditions and for that reasons should be implemented as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. whip of 
the government. I need a couple of further points of clarification if 
he might provide them.
<P>
	Earlier today I asked another member of the government why 
there appears to be a contradiction. On the one hand the 
government claims that there is genuine universal support for this 
legislation, for these changes to the elections act. Yet what we find 
are quite a number of amendments coming from all directions to 
this particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	It would seem to me that if there is support, and if this has been 
well thought out, indeed if it has reached the point where the 
government in its infinite wisdom has decided to fast track this and 
bring forward time allocation to hurry this through the House with 
very limited debate, it is a piece of legislation that is all 
encompassing and that certainly is going to do the job with no need 
for amendment.
<P>
	That is the first question I have for the hon. whip. There certainly 
appears to be a contradiction in this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The second point is he talked long and grand about the 
confidentiality of the electoral lists once in place. I wish I could say 
I share his confidence in that this list will be kept confidential. It 
certainly makes one wonder when a few weeks ago it was revealed 
that a filing cabinet showed up at some place in Ontario with seven 
or eight Revenue Canada files belonging to individual Canadians. 
This is the way the government treats the confidentiality of 
information.
<P>
	Given that it is well known that computer software can be 
hacked into on a regular basis nowadays, I simply do not share the 
confidence of the hon. member and his government that this 
particular list will be secure and will be used, as he stated, only for 
electoral purposes. I wonder if the hon. member could clarify 
further how he intends to keep the list truly confidential.
<P>
	If so, why is there a need to identify voters by gender? Could he 
perhaps touch on that issue as well. There is a real fear among 
female voters that their addresses and their places of residence will 
become known and become public knowledge. The gender 
associated with that obviously is a concern for security purposes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Prince 
George-Peace River for his remarks and his questions.
<P>
	No, and I hope he is not too shocked or too disappointed, there is 
not universal support. I think it is quite clear within the halls of this 
wonderful Chamber today that there are some different views and 
some opposition, but the bill does meet the test that was set forth a 
few years ago.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	There is a great consensus across the land with regard to 
elections as to whether they should be shorter. If we have a 
difference of opinion on whether it should be 40 days or 36 days, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6764"> 6764 </A></B>
<P>
certainly the bill concretely addresses the  matter and I believe it 
will meet the test of Canadians in terms of length.
<P>
	I think there is a great deal of consensus also with regard to the 
other objective which was to establish a permanent register. With 
due respect to opposing views on certain matters in the bill, I think 
those two principle objectives have been met in the legislation. Let 
us not forget this was not drawn in haste. In fact, there has been a 
great deal of dialogue and a great deal of debate throughout the 
country over the past few years about this subject matter. I believe 
that having considered some of the amendments that were put 
forward what we have arrived at demonstrates the openness which 
was apparent in the deliberations of this piece of legislation.
<P>
	I went on the record earlier in committee on the matter of 
staggered hours. In a country like ours which has six different times 
zones, I submit it is not perfect. It is a partial solution but I believe 
we have made some great strides in terms of recognizing each vote 
as being equal in weight. I wish there were a perfect way we could 
all finish voting at the same time and all the results would come out 
at the same time. That would be wonderful. But given the realities 
of the six time zones, I recognize that even with the present 
legislation polls in British Columbia will be open for half an hour 
longer than those in Ontario, Quebec and other provinces.
<P>
	Yes, by the time the polls close in British Columbia there will be 
some early results beginning to come out of other regions of the 
country, principally in Ontario and Quebec. However, I think we 
have made some progress and I submit this is a partial solution but 
the best solution we were able to arrive at at this time.
<P>
	With regard to the confidence in our system, we cannot legislate 
confidence. Either the confidence is there or it is not. I happen to 
have all the confidence in the world in our electoral process as it 
was, as it is now and as it will be further improved with the 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, although 
the hon. member did not mention political party financing and did 
not answer the question as to whether financing should be provided 
exclusively by voters or by large corporations, nevertheless, there 
are certain grey areas in the Canada Elections Act with respect to 
other expenditures in the course of an election campaign. For 
instance, certain related expenditures may be made before, during 
and after an election.
<P>
	This represents an enormous amount of money for the traditional 
parties. It may be as much as $4 million or $5 million per election, 
and this is to pay for certain expenses which cannot be specified. I 
am thinking of polls ordered by political parties and research on 
which a party like the Liberal Party of Canada or the Conservative 
Party will spend nearly $1 million, on both counts, during an 
election campaign, without any of this  appearing in the books of 
the riding associations or in a candidate's statement.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to mention volunteer work, not the grass roots 
volunteers who belong to the organizing committees, people who 
come and work because they believe in a political party, but the 
volunteers provided by large lobbying companies. We are given 
some very striking examples in the Lortie report.
<P>
	Some companies like Public Affairs International, who are 
lobbyists, told the Lortie Commission that they had lent as many as 
six to eight experts in various fields to do partisan work for the 
benefit of the traditional parties. This work could be worth $1,000 
or $2,000 daily. Why, when this bill was introduced, did the 
government not consider revising these grey areas which create an 
imbalance between the various political parties in this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first say that the system we are 
advocating is fair. There is nothing hidden in the funding of 
political parties. In my election campaign, all contributions are 
made public, regardless of the amount or the source. There is 
nothing magic nor hidden, everything is public.
<P>
	Since 1988, I have had the honour to represent the people in my 
riding of Stormont-Dundas. At no time have I felt my integrity 
compromised by contributions to my own or my party's political 
campaign.
<P>
	I can say, quite sincerely, that I am fascinated by the way the 
Bloc members and the members from Quebec handle their 
financial affairs. It is most interesting, and possibly worth looking 
into later on.
<P>
	Today I am perfectly comfortable with the way our political 
parties are funded. I think we are very fortunate in Canada to be 
funded by major companies. It means that members like me, 
without personal means, may be elected.
<P>
	Under the American political system, for example, Bob Kilger 
could never be a representative. I could never be, because my 
pockets are not deep enough to permit me to represent my electors 
as I can in Canada thanks to the system of funding political parties.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time 
of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway-youth employment; the hon. member for 
Rosedale-trade; the hon. member for Davenport-infrastructure 
program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with my colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6765"> 6765 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill has been very interesting in a number of respects. 
Yesterday during report stage we discussed the fact that it is 
probably one the most important bills we could have in the House 
of Commons in that it specifically and directly affects how we 
vote. Indeed, voting and democracy are absolutely Siamese twins. 
The two things go together. Therefore how we structure this bill 
is exceptionally important.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It has been raised a number of times by my colleagues in this 
House, the reality that this bill came forward rather quickly, that it 
was in committee only for two weeks, one of which the House was 
not sitting, and that the government has seen fit in some respects to 
treat this Chamber once again as a rubber stamp in making sure we 
have closure so that it gets out of the House in proper jig time.
<P>
	While I would definitely like to commend the government for 
having listened during debate and, as a result of that, bringing 
forward a few meaningful amendments that were proposed under 
unanimous consent this morning, it must be pointed out that if the 
process had been better and had allowed sufficient time for there to 
be proper input and proper thought put into it, I feel this bill would 
be far better than it is right now.
<P>
	So while on one side of the coin I do commend the government 
for listening and then, even after report stage and by unanimous 
consent from the House, moving some meaningful amendments to 
the bill, it must be severely criticized for the fact that it put itself 
into that position.
<P>
	I particularly want to recognize that the Liberals have removed 
sex designation from the list that will circulate annually to political 
parties. The words ``sex'' or ``gender'' would appear only on the 
deputy returning officer's copies. This would allow for two things 
to happen. First, at the poll the people who are responsible in 
determining who is in front of them desiring a ballot to cast a vote 
that the designation would be easier with the gender designation.
<P>
	Second, although it is just a small thing it is very significant, 
those women who wish to maintain the confidentiality of their 
gender in terms of widely circulated lists, that would be respected.
<P>
	I would also like to take a look at the annual provision of lists. 
The government whip has gone out of his way, if I understood his 
speech, to make the point that this annual provision of lists is for a 
specific purpose. Unfortunately, throughout the entire day I have 
yet to have a definition of what that specific purpose might be. If 
the lists are not against this law, but if the lists against this law are 
not going to be used for purposes other than that for which they are 
designed, then what is the purpose of the lists? The government has 
not made that clear at all.
<P>
	The major bone of contention that I have with this bill is the 
issue of the staggered voting hours. The government whip went out 
of his way to say they wanted to make sure that all votes are equal 
in Canada. I believe all these votes are equal in Canada, 
notwithstanding that Prince Edward Island has four seats with an 
average of about 35,000 voters per seat versus most constituencies 
with about 100,000. There are aberrations in the system but when 
people go to the polls in Canada they are casting a vote and 
hopefully an informed vote.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, it seems to me that what the government has 
done in this particular case is to respond to a perception of a 
problem. There is no problem. It has responded to a perception of a 
problem.
<P>
	The perception is that for people like me from British Columbia, 
when the results come on at eight o'clock at night, with the polls 
having been closed for three hours in Ontario, four hours in the 
maritimes and four and a half hours in Newfoundland, many of the 
results are in and therefore the die has been cast. That is a 
perception.
<P>
	As we discussed yesterday, the reality is if a person wants to 
make use of the Internet or of various satellite services or long 
distance telephones, they can call to eastern Canada and determine 
which way the vote is going. However, I know full well that for 
every person who would say that the Liberals are taking all of the 
seats and we want to get on to the Liberal gravy train so we had 
better vote for a Liberal, there would be at least a counter balancing 
number of people who would say that I did not want those 
scallywags to have the full sway in Ottawa so I am going to make 
sure there is a counter balance.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	This is a perceived problem. In responding to this perceived 
problem let us take a look at what it will do. The majority of people 
who will be watching this on television will probably be political 
wonks. In other words, some of us just love to be in politics and 
understand what is going on. Certainly for people who read 
<I>Hansard</I> that would be true. The reality is that we need to take a 
look at what this will do, even those of us who are involved in 
politics and who take a great interest in politics.
<P>
	Something occurs on voting day which is completely legal and 
completely above board. During the course of the campaign 
political parties will have identified the people who are most likely 
to support them at the polling stations. By a perfectly legal process 
they become aware of who has and who has not voted. Obviously 
there is no way-and there never will be a way-to know how they 
have voted, but they will know who has or who has not voted. 
Therefore, if my colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca had not 
voted and I knew that he was going to be voting Reform, my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6766"> 6766 </A></B>
<P>
supporters would make a point of calling him up and asking him if 
he needed help to get to the polling station. People are offered rides 
to get to the polling stations. This type of follow-up occurs.
<P>
	In Ontario the polls will close at 9:30 p.m. There will be a period 
of time, from approximately 6:30 p.m. until 9:30 p.m., when this 
kind of activity will take place. For the Liberal Party, the Reform 
Party and other parties which are well organized in Ontario and 
have constituency organizations that have identified their voters, 
this is a bonus. It gives them time to call people, perhaps do some 
last minute arm twisting and get them out to the polling station. 
People who cannot be bothered to go out to vote because it is 
raining or whatever will be contacted and asked if they need a drive 
or some help to get to the polling station. The parties that are 
organized in given constituencies will be able to get out the vote.
<P>
	Contrast the situation in Ontario with that in Vancouver. 
Vancouver is a very growing, hustling, bustling, congested city. 
Most people have to commute. Commutes in Vancouver range 
from an hour to an hour and a half. Even if people get off work at 
five o'clock in the afternoon, they will probably be coming through 
their door, looking forward to a cup of coffee and a meal at around 
6:30 p.m. Then someone could call them to say: ``Rush over to the 
poll because it is going to close at seven o'clock. You have to get 
over there to vote''. For the person who does not treat their 
franchise seriously, they will say: ``Thank you very much for the 
call, but I would just as soon sit down and put my feet up''.
<P>
	The difference between the voting patterns in Vancouver and the 
voting patterns in Toronto, I predict, will be absolutely measurable 
following the next election. There will not be a 
disenfranchisement. In other words, the people in Vancouver will 
still have a 12-hour opportunity. Those who take their voting 
responsibilities seriously, as all Canadians should, will make sure 
they get out to vote. However, for those people who require 
encouragement to vote, that activity will simply not be available in 
British Columbia which is in the Pacific time zone.
<P>
	What have we done? We have come up with a perceived 
problem. We have come up with a chattering kind of a problem. 
People are saying: ``I think this'' or ``I think that''. However, when 
the average Canadian thinks the entire issue through, the question 
that they will be able to answer is: Would I actually telephone my 
brother, my sister, my cousin or my friend in Toronto to see how 
things went before I cast my vote? The answer dominantly will be 
no.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Here we have a little wee, tiny, minuscule perceived problem 
that is now being answered by the government in a very 
ham-handed way. It is going to change the way in which the 
political process occurs on the west coast in comparison with 
central Canada. That is indeed unfortunate.
<P>
	It is an example of the flaws in the bill. As essential as some 
parts of the bill are, in actual fact it is going to change voting 
patterns in ways that we cannot even define at this time and only as 
a result of trying to respond to a perceived problem. It is 
unfortunate that the Liberals continue to use the House as a rubber 
stamp and have shoved this through under closure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague for his previous 
intervention and also for allowing me to speak for half his time.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the government for bringing in Bill 
C-63. It addresses some of the concerns that Reform has been 
putting forward. It changes the way in which elections are handled 
in this country. There are also a number of grave concerns that we 
have.
<P>
	Certainly extending the 11-day vacancy period after somebody 
quits and a byelection needs to be called is a great disadvantage to 
the parties that are not in power and certainly a great advantage to 
the government. The 11 days should be extended to at least 30 days, 
or perhaps even 45 days, to give the parties who are not in power a 
chance to put together a reasonable election strategy for that 
byelection. Eleven days enables the government in power to call a 
snap election and then to manipulate the current system by 
allowing strategic byelections to be called to its advantage.
<P>
	Second, decreasing the electoral period from 47 days to 36 days 
is a welcome change and enables us to shorten the period of time 
that exists before the election day. I would also like to congratulate 
the government on enabling enumeration to take place so we have a 
permanent election list which is going to save taxpayers a lot of 
money. That is something which we in Reform completely support.
<P>
	However, as my counterpart from the Kootenays said, it is 
extremely important to remove gender because if anybody gets that 
list, he or she can manipulate the situation. It would enable 
somebody to identify single women living alone. As a security 
issue that is certainly important.
<P>
	All is not rosy with this bill. It contains some measures of which 
we do not approve. First, the implementation of this bill is far, far 
too early. When we were supporting this bill we did this in good 
faith, keeping with the idea that the bill would give all the political 
parties a fair amount of time to accommodate that within their 
election strategy. The government in its heavy-handed fashion has 
chosen to implement this bill in the spring of 1997.
<P>
	One may say cynically that is politics. The government has to 
take into consideration the fact that politics may be what it is but at 
the end of the day we are here to represent the people and to ensure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6767"> 6767 </A></B>
<P>
the people are going  to have their democratic rights honoured. This 
bill does not do that.
<P>
	We also feel, particularly coming from British Columbia, that 
the early closure of the polls in B.C. does a huge disservice to the 
people of that province and of Alberta. Many people work 12 hour 
days. For example, nurses in hospitals often work from seven in the 
morning until seven in the evening. Those people will not be able 
to get out and vote if the polls are closing at 7 and 7.30. Therefore, 
this aspect of the bill seriously compromises the ability of many 
Canadians, in particular those living in British Columbia, to have 
their democratic rights honoured. After all, voting is a democratic 
right we all share. Many have fought to preserve and enshrine that 
right within the country, a country that is wonderful and free. 
However, this bill does not prevent that from happening.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The government also cannot change the rules of the game in 
mid-stride. What would be fair and equitable not only to the people 
here but also to all Canadians is to enable this bill to be introduced 
after the next federal election toward the fall of 1997.
<P>
	Another aspect which would have shown a great deal of fairness 
would be to have fixed election dates. We do not have that. It does a 
great disservice to Canadians and gives an inordinate amount of 
power to the prime minister of the day.
<P>
	Fixed election dates would enable all political parties and 
Canadians to know whether their democratic rights are going to be 
honoured and when the election is going to be called. It changes the 
dynamics and enables the public to have a greater amount of power 
than the present situation where the prime minister of the day 
controls when the country will have an election.
<P>
	Another aspect that the government could have shown a great 
deal of magnanimity about is the issue of referenda, something that 
we in the Reform Party have championed ever since we came here. 
Referenda enable the Canadian public to truly exert their 
democratic will on this House. Referenda will remove power from 
the Prime Minister's office, remove power from this House and 
give it to those who should have it the most and that is the people.
<P>
	Rarely is this tool ever introduced. It needs to be introduced far 
more. It does not necessarily have to cost more money. 
Piggy-backing referenda on top of national elections would enable 
a lot of fundamental questions to be answered and truly enable the 
Canadian people to be represented within the House in a much 
more equitable way. That is not happening now.
<P>
	As I have said before many times, power in this country does not 
exist in this House. We live an illusion, a house of cards, because a 
vast amount of power is centred in the hands of the Prime 
Minister's office, a few  cabinet ministers and some of the captains 
of industry. That is where all the major legislative proposals and 
initiatives are put forward. The rest of this House has to cower 
underneath that, for those who do not are hammered by the existing 
whip structure that we have, which is really a perversion of the 
Westminster system.
<P>
	The public needs to know this. I believe that the only real time 
that members exercise their democratic will is every four or five 
years when we have an election.
<P>
	In between elections little democratic will is exerted. On the 
surface it is exerted through committees but by and large 
committees and members of Parliament, the elected tools of the 
public, could be far more effective if members and committees 
were allowed to better represent the Canadian people by giving 
them far more leniency, far more power, far more ability to address 
their constituents' concerns and also to be answerable to them.
<P>
	The issue of recall has not been mentioned which would have 
been of value. We have a recall system in British Columbia that is 
by and large unworkable. The Prime Minister could have 
demonstrated the promise that he made before being elected that he 
would make this House more democratic. One of those ways would 
be to give the power to the people to be able to remove an elected 
member of Parliament that was not doing his or her job. Right now 
we do not have that, but our country desperately needs it.
<P>
	The public would have a great deal more respect for the 
government if the government instituted a very effective and 
reasonable structure of recall.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	I was at the PQ convention in Quebec last weekend. I must say 
that I was very impressed with the discourse which took place there 
and the civility of it. I found it interesting that many of the people 
represented at the PQ convention want the same things that the 
Reform Party has been putting forward in its plan A which is some 
reasonable decentralization, to strengthen the federal government 
where it is doing a good job but to strengthen the provinces to do 
what they do best.
<P>
	The inaction of this and previous federal governments has 
seriously compromised the ability to keep the country together by 
not addressing that issue and also by not building bridges between 
the people of Quebec and the rest of Canada. I ask hon. members on 
both sides of the House to please take heed of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate today and to support Bill C-63 
as it has evolved during the positive debate and study. Having 
chaired the committee study and having been a party to the debate 
in the Chamber, I would like to speak to the perception that this bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6768"> 6768 </A></B>
<P>
has been rushed and that opposition concerns  have not been given 
adequate hearing. Before I address these concerns, I would like to 
respond to some misconceptions about the impartiality of Elections 
Canada.
<P>
	My colleague from Bellechasse suggested this morning that 
there was collusion between Elections Canada and the government. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Elections Canada officials 
have been available to the House and as importantly, to the 
committee on procedure and House affairs to help us arrive at a 
good bill which Elections Canada will then administer.
<P>
	The government would have been remiss in not consulting 
Elections Canada officials for their expertise on this bill. In fact, as 
my colleagues opposite will remember, it was Elections Canada 
officials when they appeared before the procedure and House 
affairs committee in March this year who prepared a draft piece of 
legislation which formed part of the genesis of the bill before us 
today.
<P>
	I respectfully suggest that the member is misguided in 
suggesting that the presence in the government lobby of Elections 
Canada officials would prove his allegation. The truth of the matter 
is that these officials have been available to all members for the 
past two days of debate. I might also point out that my hon. 
colleagues from Bellechasse and Calgary West on numerous 
occasions have had the opportunity to discuss points of 
clarification with Elections Canada officials in the government 
lobby.
<P>
	With regard to the major thrust of my speech, a careful review of 
milestones in this phase of reform of the elections system will help 
illuminate the actual process the bill has followed. Members of the 
procedure and House affairs committee are well aware of the 
extensive work that was carried out beginning in 1991 with the 
Lortie commission.
<P>
	As colleagues in the House know, this body consulted widely 
and heard from many witnesses. In their extensive report the 
commissioners recommended a permanent register and 
commended for further consideration the concept of shorter voting 
hours. This latter point was complemented by commission 
reflections on public attitudes toward shorter campaigns.
<P>
	Committee deliberations by the Special Committee on Electoral 
Reform started in 1992 after the Lortie report was received. This 
work culminated in Bill C-114 which was passed in 1993.
<P>
	We then moved to the 1993 general election. Elections Canada 
was able to reuse electoral lists from the 1992 referendum to build 
the election register as a result of an amendment contained in Bill 
C-114. This eliminated the need for door to door enumeration in all 
provinces except Quebec. This was a real cost saving and 
demonstrated that the list could be reused thereby lending support 
for the concept of a register.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The next year Elections Canada began to work in earnest on the 
elections project. Data sources and systems were considered and 
the provinces and territories were consulted and contacted. I should 
reiterate the continuing work with and interest of these other levels 
of government in this cost saving initiative.
<P>
	My predecessor in the chair of the committee on procedure and 
House affairs invited Elections Canada officials to several 
committee discussions which began in April 1995 when the 
committee gave its concurrence to further work on this issue. 
Without getting rhetorical, this does not sound like a bill that is 
being rushed.
<P>
	December 1995 found Elections Canada back before the 
committee to provide a progress report and findings. As my 
colleagues opposite know, when I assumed the chair of the 
procedure and House affairs committee, I was pleased to chair a 
meeting in March 1996 where we received the feasibility report on 
the register project. We had a good discussion in committee. 
Members were asked to pursue the debate in their respective 
caucuses and to report back on these discussions.
<P>
	My personal objective and our objective as a government was to 
be able to provide additional guidance to the chief electoral officer. 
I felt this would be important since the feasibility report raised the 
possibility of a shorter electoral campaign and the prospect of an 
enumeration outside an election period, a major initiative which is 
the thrust to build the register and to permit a 36 day campaign. But 
the feedback was limited. An opportunity seems to have been 
missed to broaden the consultation on an issue so important to 
elected representatives in this House now and in the future.
<P>
	Following the presentation of the feasibility study and the draft 
bill presented by Elections Canada, a committee of senior officials 
began to review this matter and allied issues, privacy being one. 
This work has contributed to the bill we have before us.
<P>
	The bill was introduced and caucuses were briefed by the leader 
of the government in the House and by the chief electoral officer. 
The bill was referred to the committee before second reading. As 
members are well aware, the government has three legislative paths 
available to it when introducing a bill: a committee can be asked to 
develop the bill; a committee can choose the traditional process; or, 
a bill can be referred to committee before second reading.
<P>
	Members will know that Bill C-63 was referred to committee 
before second reading. The fact that the leader of the government is 
the sponsor of the bill is entirely normal. As the member for 
Bellechasse pointed out in his much appreciated comments this 
morning, Bill C-69 was also sponsored by the leader of the 
government.
<P>
	The referral to committee before second reading indicates that 
while the government has made certain  decisions about the policy 
it wished the House to consider, the government House leader and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6769"> 6769 </A></B>
<P>
the government as a whole were prepared to give serious 
consideration to members' comments about possible 
improvements to this bill. Referral to committee before second 
reading both invites those comments and creates the procedural 
room where necessary to proceed with wide ranging amendments.
<P>
	Members will know the process has worked in this case. A total 
of 33 amendments have been made to this bill as a result of this 
committee process. I will speak to these in a moment. The point is 
that the bill is better for these amendments. The process chosen by 
the House leader to study the bill contributed directly to the 
acceptance of those amendments. Members on all sides of the 
House who have contributed to these and other suggestions should 
take pride in their involvement in this process.
<P>
	As a result of the committee work, the amendments which were 
made meet express concerns. These amendments include: a 
provision for staggered voting hours, which came from my 
colleague from Vancouver; a provision to use provincial lists to 
build the register; a provision answering concerns of the privacy 
commissioner and the broadcast arbitrator; a coming into force 
provision; and a provision to distribute the annual list earlier and to 
provide a definition of how the list could be used by parties and 
candidates.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I would like to briefly touch on some of this morning's debate on 
the use of provincial lists. To reinforce what the leader of the 
government said, I reiterate that provincial lists will be used to 
build the first federal register as long as they meet the criteria 
outlined this morning.
<P>
	Bill C-63 has from its introduction provided that these lists be 
used to maintain the register. As a result of debate at report stage 
and second reading, additional amendments, 19 in total, were made 
which I believe contribute to the effectiveness of this bill. These 
new amendments include: provisions concerning the use of gender 
and date of birth information; revisions to the staggered voting 
hours; an 11 day waiting period for the calling of byelections to 
recognize the different dynamics occurring in byelection events; 
and provisions to provide preliminary electoral lists following the 
planned last door to door enumeration.
<P>
	May I also remind the House that we have had an opportunity 
both in the House and in committee to consider the bill that was 
brought forward by my colleague from Vancouver East. Any 
process can be improved but in the case of this bill, we have 
worked together and we have improved the original bill together. I 
appreciate that my colleagues on the committee acknowledge this. 
As my colleague said this morning in  quoting an American jurist, 
we have moved with deliberate speed.
<P>
	May I take this opportunity to thank my hon. colleague from 
Bellechasse for his thoughtful and helpful comments. He has 
worked diligently on this bill throughout and he has been open to 
amendments, even this morning.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary West also deserves our thanks and 
appreciation. His comments and suggestions in part are reflected in 
this bill. I believe he has made an important contribution.
<P>
	I also want to thank our own Liberal colleagues on the 
committee who have worked diligently, particularly the member 
for Stormont-Dundas, to bring together the forces that bring us all 
to this House. Sometimes they are forces of disagreement but no 
doubt they are forces to put forward good legislation, legislation 
that has thoughtful and wise amendments and amendments that 
have come from experience and policy directions of every region 
of our country representing the linguistic duality and geographic 
size of our country. I salute him and the other members of our 
committee.
<P>
	The government has listened to the comments about this bill and 
accommodations have been made. This is in keeping with our 
longstanding approach on electoral issues of providing all 
members with an opportunity to contribute to developing electoral 
policy on these particular issues as well as on others.
<P>
	In conclusion, we are asked to vote on a bill that will make 
important, practical and desirable changes to the way Canadians 
vote for those of us asked to represent their interests in this House. 
I look forward to the earliest implementation of these changes that 
will modernize and improve Canada's electoral system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know that 
my colleague who just spoke has so many more notes available to 
him, I wonder if there might be unanimous consent to permit him 
to carry on with his speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
parliamentary secretary to continue with his speech?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hear a no, actually from the same side as 
the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to the debate all day. I have a very 
simple question. Why did the government decide that the perceived 
problem of voters in the west, knowing what eastern voters have 
decided, could best be solved by putting the western voters at a 
disadvantage?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6770"> 6770 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the time has expired. 
Pursuant to an order made on Monday,  November 25 it is my duty 
to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of third reading stage of the bill now before 
the House.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are no points of order while the 
question is being put.
<P>
	All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.

please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should return the word 
``Canadian'' among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian Census.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise this afternoon. I 
appreciate the fact that my motion has come forward, Motion No. 
277. It is certainly high time that this happened. I am pleased that 
the House has the opportunity to debate this motion. I am also 
pleased that it is a votable motion.
<P>
	I would like to refer specifically to question No. 19, under 
socio-cultural information, on the long 1996 census form, which 
asks: ``Is this person white, Chinese, South Asian, black, Arab, 
West Asian, Filipino, Southeast Asian, Latin American, Japanese, 
Korean or other?''
<P>
	The list appears to follow no logic. For instance, it mixes skin 
colour, black or white, with ethnic origin, Chinese, Arab, Filipino, 
Japanese and Korean, and then geographical origin as well, South 
Asian, Southeast Asian and Latin American. In addition to those 
ten categories, one could also identify oneself as other. Under 
``other'' we could assume that someone might put ``rosy'', 
``Martian'', ``Hades'' or whatever. Some people might put 
Canadian and, of course, that is my point today. Many people have 
done that and I know that many more people will. I trust we will be 
able, through this motion, to make some changes to that.

	Let us must get back to reality. For the first time in Canadian 
census history Canadians were asked to identify their race. It is a 
socially divisive and racist question as well as invasive and 
offensive. An added insult was the  absence of a Canadian category 
in section 19. In other words, Canadians were asked to deny their 
own heritage when responding to this question. If Canadian were a 
choice on this list, as it should be, that is exactly how most people 
would respond, and in fact many people did in May 1996.
<P>
	In a note to question number 19 the government defends this 
socially divisive and racist approach to categorizing Canadians. 
Section 19 of the census form states: ``This information is collected 
to support programs which promote equal opportunity for everyone 
to share in the social, cultural and economic life of Canada''.
<P>
	What in the world does that mean? A further explanation is 
provided in the background information to the census: ``The 
question on visible minority population in Canada provides 
information for programs under the Employment Equity Act which 
promotes equal opportunity for everyone''. There of course is the 
nub of the issue.
<P>
	What do we mean by equal opportunity for everyone? Perhaps 
we could refer to the Canadian Bill of Rights of 1960 and the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982. The Canadian 
Bill of Rights of 1960 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall 
continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, 
religion or sex the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely the 
right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of 
property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law; the 
right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law; 
freedom of religion; freedom of speech; freedom of assembly and association; and 
freedom of the press.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights adopted by this Parliament in 1960, 
which was opposed by the Liberals, states pretty clearly the true 
meaning of equality and of being a Canadian. A Canadian to me is 
anyone who was born in Canada, anyone born to Canadian parents 
or anyone who has come to Canada and has fulfilled the 
requirements for becoming a Canadian. It is pretty clear. It is pretty 
simple: anyone born in Canada, anyone born to Canadian parents or 
anyone who has come to Canada and has fulfilled the requirements 
for becoming a Canadian. That is someone who can stand up and 
say ``I am proud to be a Canadian''.
<P>
	But question 19 on the 1996 census form ensures that Canadians 
must become hyphenated: an Anglo-Canadian, a Franco-Canadian, 
an Italian-Canadian, a Chinese-Canadian, an Indo-Canadian, a 
Slavic-Canadian. And on and on it goes; an almost but not quite 
Canadian, which is shameful.
<P>
	The government is always expounding on how wonderful 
Canada is and I know it is a wonderful country, so why not let the 
citizens of this country preserve their heritage as they see fit? 
Forget the  hyphens and simply say ``I am Canadian, period''. But 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6772"> 6772 </A></B>
<P>
of course there is nothing in question 19 that enables people to do 
that.
<P>
	This social engineering process is sanctioned in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982 which states in section 
15(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal 
protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination, and in particular 
without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, 
age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This looks good in principle and on paper and is then followed 
immediately by section 15(2) which goes on to negate section 
15(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection 1 does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object 
the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including 
those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, 
religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Of course the question is what is the point of section 15(1) when 
you look at 15(2). Section 15(2) of the charter emasculates the 
previous section. It can best be described as the right to 
discriminate clause. In other words, section 15(1) says that every 
individual is equal before and under the law until some other 
person anointed under section 15(2) comes along; then equality 
becomes expendable.
<P>
	I am reminded of George Orwell's <I>Animal Farm</I> from my 
teaching career where Napoleon the pig said: ``All animals are 
created equal but some are more equal than others''. What a 
tragedy it was in that book and what a commentary it is on society 
when we say all are created equal and yet we are sorry, but some 
are more equal than others.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Section 15(2) legitimizes employment equity, which is a 
euphemism for quotas, and it should be obliterated from the charter 
of rights and freedoms. It is a disgrace and a shame to democracy.
<P>
	This then explains why the government collects information on 
ethnic origin, because it is required by the social engineers to 
promote legislatively mandated employment equity programs in 
the public service and in businesses of 100 or more employees 
doing business with the Government of Canada. These programs 
claim to promote equal opportunity for everyone. They do exactly 
the opposite. It is a concept that is socially divisive and is 
contradictory to the perception of equality and fairness shared by 
most Canadians.
<P>
	Employment equity seeks to confer benefits on members of 
designated groups which must be identified by the program 
managers. Many people refuse to self-classify on the form because 
of a loss of legitimacy in the eyes of colleagues. Most people wish 
to be chosen on the basis of merit. I would certainly hope that 
people in  this House believe they got here because of merit. It is 
sad to say that some are here because they were anointed in their 
nomination process. That is sadder yet than even what we are 
talking about today.
<P>
	The avoidance of self-classification skews the statistical basis in 
many important ways. It skews the whole thing because some 
answered and some did not. Yet the social engineers are asking the 
questions about numbers because they want to determine what their 
programs will look like. If enough people refuse to classify 
themselves, the appearance of discrimination is then elevated. 
There will be a degree of disparity between the number of 
designated group members in the workforce and the number 
available to work.
<P>
	For example, the clerk here in the House of Commons appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of 
Disabled Persons concerning Bill C-64, an act respecting 
employment equity. He stated that a voluntary self-identification or 
a self-classification survey was sent to 1,700 House employees. 
Only 23 per cent returned the survey and of that number less than 
50 per cent identified themselves as belonging to a designated 
group. What does that do when 1,700 surveys are sent out and 50 
come back stating they are not sure about this? Obviously the 
numbers are going to be skewed and for the social engineers it is 
going to mess up their figures and programs.
<P>
	These inaccurate statistics have important consequences for 
employers. If some members of designated groups refuse to 
self-classify, employers must consistently report a 
non-representative workplace. They would then be forced to report 
non-compliance when in fact they may well be complying. This is 
clear injustice.
<P>
	Employment equity action carries with it a presumption of 
inferiority. It flies in the face of the merit principle. Employment 
opportunities should be based on the ability to do the job and on 
that criterion alone.
<P>
	Is the government saying then that designated groups cannot 
compete on their own merit? If accident of birth is a qualification 
for a job then it is an outright mockery of the merit principle. No 
self-classifying group should accept being treated in this 
patronizing manner. They should resent all that the employment 
equity program symbolizes.
<P>
	The role of government is to ensure equality of opportunity, not 
equality of results. Bill C-64 was whisked through this House 
recently and there is also the Canadian census form that so many 
people have been aggravated about and have been in touch with 
me. I will bet a dollar that there are a lot of Liberal MPs who should 
stand up here today and say that they have also received calls from 
their constituents saying: ``I want to represent myself and label 
myself Canadian. Why can't I do it on the census form?'' If they 
are not coming forward with that information then perhaps the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6773"> 6773 </A></B>
<P>
word smug might come to mind, as if only people in other  ridings 
who are not represented by Liberals would have people outraged.
<P>
	I know somebody in Edmonton right now who is in the process 
of being charged. He lives in what is a Liberal held riding for now, 
but he has said that they have come after him three times and are in 
the process of charging him. That is shameful. This is a young man 
who is a Canadian through and through. This is a young man whose 
heritage is Jewish. However, he said that he was a Canadian under 
section 19, but they came back to his house time and time again. 
What is wrong with this picture? Somebody is going to be charged 
and possibly convicted under this because he stood up and said: ``I 
am a Canadian, period''. It is shameful.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	For those people who smirk, for those people who think that they 
have all the answers in the world, something is dreadfully wrong 
here. I challenge the members across the way to make this right. 
They could do it in a heartbeat yet I can tell by the looks on their 
faces they have no intention of doing that, which is sad.
<P>
	Legalized discrimination invites discriminatory practices. 
Discrimination in favour of someone logically requires that another 
be discriminated against. Employment equity legislation officially 
sanctions discrimination against those groups that are not 
designated. By putting some people in, by committing, then 
obviously other people are left out by omitting them.
<P>
	One group is able bodied white males. We have heard story after 
story in this place of people who have said that they tried to get into 
the RCMP or some other group and they simply were not able to do 
it because there was a quota system.
<P>
	The government's role should be to ensure equality of 
opportunity and to protect individuals from discrimination in 
employment. Instead of predetermined employment results, the 
government must act as guardian of the merit principle and allow 
individuals to excel through a fair competitive process. I do not 
know how anyone in this place could ever deny that.
<P>
	Employment equity programs are opposed by the majority of 
Canadians. In a December 1993 Gallup poll, 74 per cent of the 
respondents said that qualifications should be the sole criteria for 
hiring for management positions. Many Canadians do not want to 
be classified by their ethnic origin. In the 1991 census, 765,095 
Canadians ignored the ethnic distinctions presented by Statistics 
Canada and gave Canadian as their sole ethnic origin. The numbers 
are not out yet from the 1996 census but I am sure they will be way 
higher than 765,095.
<P>
	I also question how it can be fairly determined who belongs to 
visible minority groups. Should a person of racially mixed 
parentage be counted as a visible minority? Should third generation 
visible minority Canadians be  thought of as disadvantaged in the 
same way as a new visible minority citizen? What about the 
Caucasian who constitutes a visible minority in certain areas? It is 
a quagmire and one that could be easily solved by simply putting 
the word Canadian in section 19.
<P>
	Studies have shown that Canadian employers are generally fair 
and that discrimination is not systemic. The Economic Council of 
Canada undertook a study in 1991 called ``New Faces in the 
Crowd'', asserting that there was no significant discrimination 
against immigrants in general, and no apparent tendency to 
discriminate against immigrants from the third world. Indeed, the 
report suggested that immigrants take some time to catch up to 
native born Canadians because their overseas qualifications do not 
match those obtained in Canada. This is from the Economic 
Council of Canada.
<P>
	In addition, businesses know that having a representative 
workplace is in their best interests ultimately and of course they are 
going to want to have that cross-section.
<P>
	Employment equity breathes resentment toward designated 
groups. First, it will be assumed that employment was not obtained 
through the merit principle. Second, it labels them as being inferior 
and unable to compete on a level playing field. Third, it seems that 
they need mother government to run interference for them. To me 
nothing is sadder than that.
<P>
	The government may have had good intentions when it 
introduced employment equity legislation which led to this racist 
and socially divisive question on the census form. I will give the 
government the benefit of the doubt on that, maybe it was trying to 
do something good.
<P>
	I think this legislation is demeaning and detrimental to 
designated groups and legalizes discrimination against 
non-designated groups. This kind of legislated mandated social 
engineering has no place in a democratic country like Canada. It is 
also a denial of the most basic fundamental right of all Canadians: 
the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without 
discrimination, one of the basic rights that defines our democracy.
<P>
	I am one of those designated groups and I find it offensive that I 
would get some sort of special treatment. I know in many respects 
women are not treated well in the business world. I know of women 
who have gone to get business loans from a bank and they have 
been asked who the man is that is in charge. What a pathetic state it 
is. We are approaching the new century and we need to be moving 
forward, yet women are having a problem for instance in getting 
business loans. That is shameful. Yet I do not think the answer is to 
have employment equity to label me for instance as a designated 
group and that I would need special status.
<P>
	In running as a parliamentarian I can think of nothing sadder 
than for women on either side of the House to go  door knocking 
and say: ``Hello, I am a candidate in your constituency. Please vote 
for me because I am a woman''. I cannot do that. I do not think it 
would be right for any one of us to do that. As soon as we start 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6774"> 6774 </A></B>
<P>
labelling people and putting them into groups then we leave out 
other people and it represents a real danger.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	All Canadians should be treated equally under the law regardless 
of what group they belong to. To borrow a phrase from the Liberal 
majority report in 1992 on the employment equity review, the 
Liberals said: ``The principle of social justice and fairness must 
always be foremost in the minds of those who draft the laws by 
which Canadians abide''.
<P>
	If this government is truly committed to the betterment of all 
Canadians, it must remove the emphasis on race, ethnic and 
geographical origins from its policies and ensure that hiring and 
promotion are based solely on the merit principle. A good start 
would be to include the word Canadian in section 19 of the 
sociocultural information of the 1996 Canadian census or better 
still, remove section 19 altogether.
<P>
	Let us say it together: I am proud to be a Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. FranÃ§ois Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Motion M-277 put forward by the hon. member 
for Beaver River. I listened carefully to the comments and relevant 
remarks she made in this debate. The hon. member for Beaver 
River raised a number of points.
<P>
	First of all, Statistics Canada's question no. 19 about ethnic 
origin makes us wonder if the word ``Canadian'' should not be just 
one of the choices on the list census respondents have to choose 
from.
<P>
	Personally, what I had the biggest problem with in the points 
raised by the hon. member for Beaver River is this tendency to 
standardize everything from coast to coast, so that ``Canadian'' 
becomes the obvious choice. Of course, we are Canadians under 
the law.
<P>
	But what does ``Canadian'' mean in terms of ethnic origin? 
Various groups came to this country at different times in Canadian 
history. As a small boy, I remember reading in history books that 
Canada was founded in 1534 when Jacques Cartier planted a cross 
in GaspÃ©. We have since learned that there had been people here 
long before then.
<P>
	We learned that the Vikings first visited Newfoundland probably 
as early as the 11th century, and that the First Nations were already 
established on this land. There has been much denial in our history 
of the existence of people settling in Canada long before the white 
man arrived.
<P>
	To make the origin of Canada coincide with Jacques Cartier's 
arrival in 1534 is regrettable and, in my opinion,  it is a totally 
racist attitude which quietly became ingrained in our customs. The 
fact is that this country had people living in it at the time and, 
therefore, already existed.
<P>
	However, it is important to look at the notion of ethnic origin. Is 
a person an Amerindian? Was that person born in France, in Great 
Britain? What is the origin of his or her name? This information 
helps us understand, along with statistics, the various contributions 
made to Canada by immigrants. When I refer to immigrants, this 
means all of us, even those who were here 400 years ago. Indeed, 
we all moved here from somewhere else.
<P>
	There are terms not to be confused, and there is some confusion 
in the speech made by the hon. member for Beaver River. For one 
thing, her conclusion on the meaning of the word ``Canadian'' is 
not precise enough. This meaning should be explained, and I will 
do so later by tabling an amendment.
<P>
	The confusion probably relates to the notion of ethnic origin 
versus citizenship. Citizenship is a legal status given to the 
inhabitants of a country, which comes under federal jurisdiction in 
accordance with section 91 of the 1867 British North America Act.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It is the prerogative of the federal state to grant Canadian 
citizenship to people who come to live in Canada and who wish to 
stay here, earn a living and settle permanently in this country. This 
is one of the criteria to be eligible for Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	However, we must not confuse citizenship and nationality. If 
asked what my citizenship is, I must say I am a Canadian, since I 
was born in Canada and federal laws make me a Canadian citizen. 
Now, if I am asked my nationality, I am going to reply that I am 
Quebecois by nationality, because I am attached to the territory of 
Quebec, to this fledgling country of Quebec, and this is the word 
with which I identify most strongly. For me, my nation is Quebec.
<P>
	Another person might define himself as an English Canadian, a 
French Canadian, someone else might consider himself Acadian, 
each one defining himself according to his innermost feelings with 
respect to his origins.
<P>
	It is a bit the same with the concept of ``domicile'', which was 
discussed during the debate on Bill C-63. My colleague from 
St-Hubert, who sits on my left, is well placed to correct or support 
me on this, but civil law tells us that the concept of ``domicile'' we 
were discussing today comprises a material element, i.e. a physical 
establishment, as well as an element of intention, i.e. the desire to 
make that physical establishment one's principal residence. I am 
not sure if my definition is correct. If not, the hon. member could 
correct me from her long experience with the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6775"> 6775 </A></B>
<P>
	As for nationality, there are two elements. There is the material 
element, the place one lives, and the element of intention, the 
group with which one most identifies. This is not always an easy 
matter. Everyone must answer for himself. I cannot answer for 
others. The hon. member for Beaver River would like the law to 
answer ``Canadians from coast to coast'' for all the people 
questioned, but it is not that simple.
<P>
	One might well wonder. For example, I see the clerk at the table, 
Mr. Lukyniuk. With that name, he is probably not from Brittany or 
Ireland. I would wager that he is probably Ukrainian in origin, but 
surely now a Canadian. What about his definition of himself? Are 
we to deprive him of the right to indicate what his origin is, what he 
or his parents contributed to the wealth and diversity of Canada?
<P>
	My colleague from Winnipeg North is, quite clearly, not from 
Alsace or the Walloon part of Belgium, or anything of the sort. If he 
is able to indicate his origins, all the better. The more information 
the state has on the origin of its citizens, when they came to 
Canada, and under what circumstances when that question is 
appropriate, the more understanding we will have. I believe that 
information is what is needed to knock down the walls of 
misunderstanding.
<P>
	Someone has written a book which is, I think, called ``Uneasy 
Patriot''. This book offers us some help in understanding the 
Canadian reality, the difficulty we sometimes experience in living 
as Canadians, the means we have developed to resolve certain 
conflicts. It is not always easy, but we have created a traditional 
approach that will work in the best of times as well as the worst of 
times, when the social fabric is under severe tension.
<P>
	We experienced this on October 30 last year, when Quebec went 
to the polls. I am convinced that this ability to absorb, this 
democratic fabric we have woven together for generations evolved 
very gradually. Despite certain alarmist statements made from time 
to time, we have developed a tradition of tolerance in Canada 
which enables us to accept change, provided it is done 
democratically.
<P>
	There are several examples of this. In 1992, when the 
Charlottetown accord was rejected, all governments campaigned in 
favour of accepting the offer except one, the Government of 
Quebec. The accord was massively rejected. The next day, people 
were not marching in the streets to demand the government's 
resignation, to get rid of the government. We have a tradition of 
respect for the results of a democratic vote, and that is how we 
developed a great capacity for tolerance.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	To recapitulate: We should not be stuck in a definition of 
``Canadian'' which we would be unable to get out of, the excuse 
being that everything has to be Canadian so that it becomes 
impossible to specify what kind of  Canadians we are. As far as 
Statistics Canada is concerned, we must not confuse citizenship 
with ethnic origin and nationality.
<P>
	Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the word ``should'' 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``include ``Canadian'', ``Quebecker'', ``English-Canadian'', ``French-Canadian'' 
and ``Acadian'' among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian Census.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I can inform the hon. member for 
Bellechasse that his motion is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a proud Canadian. I chose 
Canada to be my country. I rise in debate today in full knowledge of 
my Canadian pride.
<P>
	The motion tabled by the Reform member for Beaver River 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should return the word 
``Canadian'' among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian Census.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On the surface, it sounds innocuous to public good. Examined 
closely, it is harmful to good citizenship.
<P>
	I am proud to be a Canadian citizen. If I am asked what is my 
ethnic origin, I will proudly answer ``Filipino''. Yes, I was born in 
the Philippines. My colour is brown, ``kayumanggi'' in my native 
tongue.
<P>
	Speaking of languages, neither English or French is not my 
mother tongue. Tagalog is. I had to learn English in school. Now I 
am studying French.
<P>
	These are some characteristics of my ethnic origin, my 
ethnocultural background, my roots. I am proud of my Filipino 
heritage. They are a people known for their hospitality, their work 
ethic, their creativity and determination, and their generosity of 
heart.
<P>
	At the same time, I am proud to be a Canadian by choice. I am 
proud not only because of the physical beauty of our country-its 
immense geography, beautiful lakes, beautiful scenery, majestic 
mountains, surrounding oceans and rich natural resources-and not 
only because of Canada's economic wealth, important as it is. I am 
proud primarily because of the beauty of our people. We are 
diverse in cultures, yet we live in harmony. We are a people of 
varied ethnic origins, yet we share a common national vision. I 
approach this motion secure in the knowledge that Canada is a 
nation of human achievement.
<P>
	I have with me a copy of the May 14, 1996 census questionnaire. 
It gives the reasons for which the questions were asked. The 
member for Beaver River should have carefully studied the 
document. It outlines clearly the nine steps to answering the 
questionnaire.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6776"> 6776 </A></B>
<P>
	When one correctly answered the questions in steps No. 1 to 
No. 5, only Canadian citizens and immigrants would be 
proceeding to answer the questions in the subsequent steps. When 
one correctly answered the question in step No. 7, the respondent 
would have answered questions about Canadian citizenship. Thus, 
by the time the person was answering the question on ethnic or 
cultural identification, he or she would have been identified in 
answer to the earlier question as being Canadian or not. Hence, 
to require that the word ``Canadian'' be returned among questions 
of ethnic origin on the Canadian census as the motion before us 
insists would not only result in confusion but would create a 
redundancy that no one would wish to happen.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	There was a purpose or set of reasons for every question, namely 
to serve public policy and public programs and public good. The 
question on ethnic origin of Canadians, specifically question No. 
19, was not about whether we are Canadians or not. It was not 
intended to measure national identity or national pride. In fact, this 
question was asked to be answered after the respondent had 
identified himself or herself as a Canadian.
<P>
	To have listed Canadian for question No. 19 would not make it 
possible to determine the numbers and characteristics of the visible 
minority population, the essential purpose of this particular 
question, to serve a legitimate public policy.
<P>
	Answers to question No. 19, along with other related questions, 
provide information needed to deal with many vital economic and 
social policy issues of concern to Canadians. This particular 
question was adopted for the 1996 census after rigorous 
consultation and testing, a process which clearly documented that 
accurate data would be produced and that respondents clearly 
understood the question and did not react negatively to it.
<P>
	One cannot help but sense that the criticism to question No. 19 
about ethnic origin is directed more at the idea of employment 
equity rather than at the collection of statistical data. But the 
Reform Party had already lost this debate in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	For example, when the member was speaking about the 
able-bodied white Canadians that are excluded from the 
Employment Equity Act, I have to tell the member about simple 
arithmetic. If you target equal opportunities for a fraction of 100, as 
in the act, the remainder of the citizens of this country, the 
able-bodied white males, are included in this act. It is only simple 
arithmetic. It is a lesson in fractions. It is a lesson in proportion.
<P>
	The Employment Equity Act has been a federal law for a decade 
now and the census is the only possible source of objective 
information needed to administer the act and to evaluate its impact 
over a period of time. It is therefore in the interest of everyone, 
including this  member, who wishes to debate this issue, to have 
objective census data rather than biases and unfounded opinion.
<P>
	We should remind ourselves that we have a federal law on 
multiculturalism. It is about the balance of rights and obligations, 
about managing Canada's diversity in the interests of the individual 
Canadian and of Canada as a whole, about accepting the 
contribution of all her people and providing them with the 
opportunity to participate fully in Canadian citizenship. Section 27 
of the charter of rights and freedoms guarantees to preserve and 
protect the multicultural heritage of our nation.
<P>
	It is a given that we must have objective data to serve good 
public policy. Statistics Canada has always been ranked by 
international panels of statisticians as the best in the world. While 
we should be vigilant of every department, we should do so not to 
the point of partisanship which can only destroy.
<P>
	The motion before us impugns unkindly the international 
distinction that Statistics Canada has justly earned. Worse, the 
motion before us is an insult to common sense.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Commission said in its recent 
report to Parliament: ``Asking question No. 19 is entirely 
reasonable in a pluri-cultural society which needs to understand 
itself''. Understand each other we must.
<P>
	I am, you may say, Mr. Speaker, a Filipino Canadian. Whether 
the two words are separated by a hyphen or a space does not detract 
from my loyalty to Canada, from my pride in Canadian citizenship, 
a citizenship that I will serve in peace, a citizenship that I will serve 
in war.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	This is true, irrespective of our origin. It is true of my wife 
Gloria with whom I immigrated to Canada in 1968. This is true of 
our four sons, who all were born in Winnipeg and are Canadians by 
birth. They too are proud of the Filipino heritage of their parents' 
roots.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that our diversity is and should be a source 
of national pride for all of us. We are a model to the world. Canada 
has shown the world that co-habitation of cultures is the strength of 
the Canadian federation and inherent in this national achievement 
are the unifying forces of universal values.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to add my words to this debate in 
support of the motion by my hon. colleague from Beaver River.
<P>
	The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should return the word 
``Canadian'' among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian Census.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6777"> 6777 </A></B>
<P>
	The recently submitted Bloc Quebecois amendment would add 
behind the word Canadian: Quebecois, English Canadian, French 
Canadian, Acadian and I am not sure what else.
<P>
	It is interesting that the Bloc Quebecois, the separatists in the 
House and in this country, are endeavouring this evening to explain 
to Canadians what Canadian means. Talk about the pot calling the 
kettle black.
<P>
	As well, I listened with great interest to the member who just 
spoke. I am pleased that he is so proud of his heritage. A lot of 
immigrants who come to this country are proud of their individual 
heritages. They come to Canada from countries around the world. 
But there are also Canadians who are proud to be Canadian. We 
would like to be known as Canadians and be registered as 
Canadian.
<P>
	For the hon. member to say in his remarks that the motion is an 
insult to common sense is complete and utter rubbish. The motion 
is common sense. I only wish I could do as good a job as the hon. 
member for Beaver River did during her remarks to this motion this 
evening.
<P>
	The motion seeks to bring some logic to the issue of racism and 
equality. On the one hand, Canadians are striving to eliminate 
discrimination based on ethnic origin or skin colour, to say first and 
foremost that we are all Canadians and are equally deserving of the 
rights, privileges and pleasures that come with being Canadian.
<P>
	On the other hand, the federal government demands that 
individuals distinguish themselves by their skin colour, ethnic or 
geographic origin, to stand up and be counted as different.
<P>
	In the 1996 census, respondents are not even given the 
opportunity to identify themselves as Canadian. Census question 
19, in fact the entire long form of the 1996 census, stirred up a great 
deal of controversy in my constituency of Prince George-Peace 
River and across the country. The member for Beaver River 
referred quite eloquently to the problems that this question and the 
whole issue stirred up. People are simply furious about this and 
they are demanding change. However, we cannot expect common 
sense from the government.
<P>
	I cannot help thinking whenever I address this issue of how the 
writings of George Orwell apply to the 1996 census. For the one in 
five Canadians who were required by law to complete the long 
form it must have seemed as though big brother was indeed 
watching over them.
<P>
	I recall that in the year 1984, many social analysts celebrated the 
fact that the oppressed society predicted in Orwell's book <I>1984</I> had 
little resemblance to real life. Ha. However, I cannot ignore how 
millions of Canadians felt about the invasive questions asked of 
them by their big brothers in the federal government this past 
spring. With their privacy seriously jeopardized by questions that 
ranged from income, all types of household expenses, race, colour, 
et cetera, these Canadians faced fines or jail if they did not answer 
the questions.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	In addition, as my colleague from Beaver River mentioned in her 
remarks, the specific application of the book <I>Animal Farm</I> by 
George Orwell to the 1996 census is even more frightening. She 
cited the quote that all animals are equal but some animals are 
more equal than others. It would appear that the federal 
government's discriminatory practice of conferring special status 
means that all Canadians are equal, it is just that some Canadians 
are more equal than others.
<P>
	I suggest that some hon. members take the opportunity to refresh 
their schoolday memories and pick up copies of these two books. 
We are always searching for quick examples to give our children 
when they complain that their math lessons and required English 
readings have little relevance to real life. Ironically, I did not 
expect that we would be able to tell them that <I>Animal Farm</I> and 
<I>1984</I> are books that bear such similarities to life in 1996.
<P>
	While census data may appear to some as simply statistics and 
record keeping, keep in mind that these data are used by all sorts of 
different groups and individuals for all kinds of purposes, including 
employment equity legislation, funding programs and tax benefits, 
to name but a few.
<P>
	One of the reasons ``Canadian'' was eliminated as a category in 
the 1996 census was that 3 per cent of respondents to the 1991 
census reported themselves as being Canadian. Apparently this 
caused a great deal of difficulty for Stats Canada in interpreting the 
results because it was under pressure to produce these statistics for 
use in employment equity programs and other initiatives. So the 
federal government's answer was to simply eliminate the option of 
identifying oneself as Canadian.
<P>
	What happened to the 3 per cent of people who identified 
themselves as Canadian? Statistics Canada's difficulty in 
interpreting the results makes me wonder how accurately census 
data reflect our society. The fact that Stats Canada has also 
admitted that 10 per cent of the aboriginal population in this 
country was not enumerated in the 1991 census shakes my 
confidence in its results even further.
<P>
	When we consider this information will be used to determine 
employment equity figures until the year 2003, it is a wonder how 
anyone either for or against employment equity can trust these data 
to be used for that purpose.
<P>
	The very idea that the federal government encourages hiring on 
anything other than the basis of merit is preposterous. But of course 
we have all become quite accustomed to hearing special interest 
groups and Liberal MPs extolling the virtues of these so-called 
equal opportunity initiatives. Employment equity creates 
resentment in the workplace and widens the gap of understanding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6778"> 6778 </A></B>
<P>
between races and ethnic groups. It accomplishes not harmony but 
discord.
<P>
	I believe that one large misconception on the part of some 
members in this House is that minority groups are in favour of this 
type of government action. However, many individuals are 
reluctant to identify themselves as a member of a minority group. 
The 1992-93 report on employment equity in the public services 
states that the number of visible minority employees may be under 
identified by one and a half times. Many individuals do not wish to 
identify themselves as members of a particular race or ethnic group 
either because they wish to be considered on the basis of merit 
alone or because they do not wish preferential treatment over their 
colleagues.
<P>
	Furthermore, in my home province of British Columbia just 11 
per cent of those asked in a December 1993 Gallup poll supported 
employment equity initiatives. As we are all well aware, British 
Columbia is fortunate to be home to a cosmopolitan society that is 
enriched by a skilled population that represents a broad range of 
visible and cultural minorities. Based on this poll it is obvious that 
many of the individuals in those groups themselves do not feel 
there is a need for employment equity.
<P>
	Employment equity legislation and any other program or 
initiative that gives preferential treatment to a group or individual 
based on physical, social or cultural characteristics is 
discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	That is the definition of the type of discrimination we are talking 
about today, giving one individual preferential treatment over 
another on the basis of skin colour or country of birth.
<P>
	Another obvious practice by the federal government that confers 
special status and preferential treatment is an archaic act of 
Parliament that grants one group of Canadians special tax 
exemptions based on their race and place of residence. I am of 
course referring to the Indian Act.
<P>
	I would like to go on and on about the need for the reform of the 
Indian Act and other archaic pieces of legislation that exist in this 
country and need to be overhauled but I simply do not have the 
time.
<P>
	It is not simply question 19 of the 1996 census that is the 
problem. It is the socially divisive initiatives that will be driven by 
the responses to this question. If Canadian were to be included as a 
category it would be a good first step in breaking down the walls of 
racism and discrimination.
<P>
	This motion is an opportunity to make real headway in the war 
against racism and discrimination. It is action that is based on 
reality. When we are done with the  debate today on this motion and 
because it is votable, as the hon. member for Beaver River has 
indicated, I certainly encourage all hon. members from both sides 
of the House to support this motion and return the option of 
registering oneself as truly Canadian to Canadians from coast to 
coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to Motion No. 277 
which calls for the government to include the word ``Canadian'' on 
the question concerning ethnic origin in the census.
<P>
	First, I would like to point out that for a number of censuses 
respondents have been able to respond ``Canadian'' to the ethnic 
origin question. This question appears only on the long form 
questionnaire which goes to 20 per cent of the population. In the 
1996 census conducted last May, ``Canadian'' was listed among the 
examples provided as possible answers to the question on ethnic or 
cultural origins.
<P>
	The census has played an important role in the development of 
Canada. For more than 100 years, the census has informed us about 
the social and economic development of our country and on the 
evolving diversity of our population. For the last four censuses, it 
has provided statistics reported on the number of people who 
reported Canadian as their only ethnic origin.
<P>
	I would like to assure the House that Statistics Canada is 
committed to developing census questions that meet the highest 
priority needs of data users. Prior to every census, Statistics 
Canada consults interested Canadians throughout the country in 
government, in community associations and as interested citizens 
in an effort to identify information requirements which might best 
be addressed through the census.
<P>
	For each census, Statistics Canada carefully tests and evaluates 
all the proposed questions. For the 1991 census the ethnic origin 
question went through a particularly rigorous consultation, testing, 
review and approval process. This process ultimately included 
approval by cabinet and the prescription of the questions by the 
governor in council as required by the Statistics Act.
<P>
	The increasing diversity of Canada's population, coupled with 
the increasing number of persons who chose to report Canadian as 
their only ethnic origin in 1991, led Statistics Canada to undertake 
further consultations and testing on the ethnicity question. This 
ensured that the census would continue to meet the important needs 
for accurate data on the composition and characteristics of the 
population. As a result, the question was modified again for the 
1996 census.
<P>
	Testing of the modified question indicated that people clearly 
understood the question and that it would produce accurate data. 
The 1996 ethnic origin question  included as examples of possible 
answers the most frequently reported ethnic origins from the 1991 
census. Canadian was among the examples provided since 
Canadian was the fifth most often reported ethnic origin in the 
1991 census. Respondents could report up to four ethnic origins in 
the space provided. Canada is a country populated by aboriginal 
peoples, immigrants and the descendants of immigrants. Indeed, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6779"> 6779 </A></B>
<P>
census data show that our population includes people with more 
than 100 different ethnic and cultural origins. We are all proud of 
both our heritage and of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The government acknowledges that for some Canadians the 
ethnic origin question is a sensitive one. It can be associated with 
emotional issues such as personal identity, national unity, 
patriotism or fear of oppressive regimes in former homelands. 
Nevertheless, many Canadians are proud to report their ancestry or 
ethnic origins on the census, and indeed are anxious to do so. For 
them it is a straightforward and simple question.
<P>
	For others whose families may have been in Canada for many 
generations or who no longer have any connection to their country 
of origin, the question may be difficult to answer or may be 
considered irrelevant. For this and a variety of other reasons many 
people choose to report their ethnic origin as Canadian and nothing 
else. The census has provided them with the opportunity to do so 
and the results have been published.
<P>
	Since 1981 Statistics Canada has published the number of people 
who chose to report their ethnic origin as Canadian. This number 
has been increasing and has reached 765,000 in 1991. As I 
mentioned earlier, Canadian was the fifth most frequently reported 
ethnic origin in 1991.
<P>
	As in past censuses, Canadian was a valid answer to the ethnic 
origin question on the 1996 census. The data are now being 
tabulated and will be published as soon as the results are available. 
Adding or changing questions on the census form is not a task that 
Statistics Canada takes lightly. The agency must tread a fine line to 
accommodate many different needs, balancing the many 
conflicting demands for information with the need to minimize the 
reporting burden and the intrusion on the privacy of Canadian 
citizens.
<P>
	The census provides information which is vital to virtually every 
sector of society. Census data are used in the administration of 
more than 80 federal and provincial legislative measures and 
support critical decision making by private industry and by every 
level of government throughout the country.
<P>
	Throughout the years census data on ethnic origin have been of 
widespread interest to federal departments, provincial, territorial 
and municipal governments as well as agencies and companies of 
every kind. In fact, these data are among the most widely used data 
from the  census. The data are used to help immigrants integrate 
into Canadian society, to plan heritage and multicultural programs 
and to deliver services to an increasing, diverse population.
<P>
	Statistics Canada has a proven method of treading the fine line 
between meeting data needs and minimizing the burden on the
<P>
public. The Canadian census enjoys wide approval and support 
from the public and from data users. This House should not get 
involved in the difficult and complex business of survey design. 
Rather, we should leave this task to Statistics Canada. Let us give 
the agency the chance to review the results of the 1996 census and 
then design and test questions leading to the submission of proven 
workable proposals for review and approval of cabinet as required 
by the Statistics Act.
<P>
	I am confident that the agency can formulate questions that make 
sense to respondents and still supply the data needed to inform the 
decisions of government, industry and individual citizens in the 
first decade of the next century. No decision should be made about 
the content of the 2001 census at this time. As Canada enters the 
21st century it is important that the census questions keep pace 
with the changes in our society. Consultations for the 2001 census 
as well as the evaluation of the 1996 census results will bring many 
new ideas to the forefront, including the need for the collection of 
statistics on the ethnic origins of the population. The cost of the 
census and the burden on the respondents must be taken into 
account before any decision is made to add or to change questions.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	I call on members of the House to reject Motion No. 277 and 
leave this difficult job to Statistics Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary North will 
have the floor when this matter comes back for debate.
<P>

	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of 
the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUTHEMPLOYMENT">YOUTH EMPLOYMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to follow up on a question which I asked at 
the beginning of October concerning the very difficult situation 
facing Canada's young people, in particular the absolutely unac-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6780"> 6780 </A></B>
<P>
ceptable level of  unemployment which in real terms is in excess of 
20 per cent for young people.
<P>
	Members of the House will recall that a little over three years 
ago the Liberal government was elected on a promise of jobs. The 
red book promised jobs and a new hope for change from the 
Conservative government. Instead, what we have seen are levels of 
unemployment particularly among young people which are even 
higher than they were when this government was elected. In fact in 
September alone over 19,000 jobs were lost in the age group of 15 
to 24.
<P>
	There is a growing insecurity which young people are facing as 
they look at their futures. The very tragic unemployment situation 
is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	I spoke earlier today at the conference celebrating the 15th 
anniversary of the Canadian Federation of Students. The chair of 
the Canadian Federation of Students, Brad Lavigne, spoke out 
strongly earlier this year on this issue. He said: ``Where are the red 
book promises of jobs, jobs, jobs? Instead of creating jobs, the 
Liberals have made cuts to the public sector and pursued a 
destructive high interest rate policy. That is not a long term 
approach to jobs''.
<P>
	Young people today are facing soaring tuition fees, except in the 
province of British Columbia. The New Democratic government in 
that province has actually frozen tuition fees for this year, next year 
and the following year. Students are facing increasing debt loads. 
The average debt load of a graduating student is about $24,000.
<P>
	There have been cuts in research and development. That is not 
what the Liberal government was elected to do, certainly not to cut 
funding for example in research for environmental technologies. 
There has been no renewal of the national AIDS strategy.
<P>
	Cuts have been made in arts and cultural programs and to the 
CBC.
<P>
	All of this has directly affected the opportunity of young people 
to find meaningful jobs in our economy.
<P>
	Young people are looking for tax relief in the education system. I 
appeal to the government to listen carefully to the Canadian 
Federation of Students' request for tax relief and also for an 
academic component to any infrastructure program.
<P>
	The fact is that there are too many young people who not only 
cannot find work but who are underemployed. For example, there 
is the physicist who is driving a cab in Toronto and cannot find any 
other work and the historian who is delivering pizzas.
<P>
	There is a tremendous amount of insecurity, not only about jobs, 
but because of the growing number of part time jobs, contractual 
jobs and temporary jobs, more and more young people do not have 
jobs which will provide them with decent pensions. At the same 
time, the Canada  pension plan is under attack. The Reform Party 
suggests that we wipe out the Canada pension plan and replace it 
with super RRSPs. The Liberal Party talks about cutting the 
benefits of the Canada pension plan and increasing the age of 
retirement. Now is the time for us to be reaffirming our support for 
the Canada pension plan and strengthening it as a very important 
social insurance program.
<P>
	There are fewer summer jobs for students. There are fewer part 
time jobs. There is a lot of pressure on them.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	What this country needs is a government that is committed to 
full employment, committed to putting jobs at the heart of its 
economic strategy. There are many ways of doing that. One is a fair 
tax system. The national leader of the New Democratic Party, 
Alexa McDonough, has been travelling across the country getting 
out the message that there are alternatives.
<P>
	It is time that this country had a government that did not just 
listen to the wealthy and the powerful. It is time that we had a 
government that put young people and employment of young 
people at the heart of its economic policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed 
helping young Canadians make the transition into the workforce 
has been a priority of this government.
<P>
	This is an obvious statement in that the 1996 budget reallocated 
some $315 million of budget savings to help create employment 
opportunities for young Canadians over the next three years. This 
included, contrary to what the member just said, a doubling to $120 
million of the 1996-97 contribution to student summer placement 
initiatives which enabled the creation of more than 60,000 summer 
employment placements this past summer.
<P>
	In addition through our Canada employment centres for 
students, some 664,000 students have benefited from a variety of 
other employment measures since 1994. Youth Service Canada has 
already given some 5,200 young Canadians the opportunity to learn 
work related skills and life skills while engaging in community 
service activities across the country. Youth Internship Canada will 
provide over 35,000 youth with the opportunities to gain 
employability skills and work experience that will help them get 
and keep a job. In total more than 430,000 young Canadians will 
benefit from this government's youth programs this year alone.
<P>
	As the hon. member is aware, the Government of Canada 
appointed a ministerial task force on youth to obtain input from 
Canadians on how to help young people make a successful 
transition into the labour market. Furthermore this government has 
also made  public its intention to introduce a program to help 
students better manage their Canada student loan debts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6781"> 6781 </A></B>
<P>
	This is what we have started to do for young Canadians. We will 
continue to examine ways of supporting youth so that they can 
succeed in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRADE">TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I had the 
opportunity to question the Minister for International Trade on the 
signing of the free trade agreement between Chile and Canada, he 
situated this agreement to some extent within the context of 
Canada's general international trade in his response.
<P>
	I think we must look at this agreement in the context of what we 
are doing in Canada to diversify our trade with the United States 
and to find new markets, especially markets opening up in the 
Asia-Pacific region and in Latin America. In this context, it seems 
to me that Chile is very important, because it is now associated 
with Mercasur, an association of four Latin American countries: 
Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil.
<P>
	If we really intend to create a free trade zone in the Americas by 
2005, as stated in Miami a year ago, we must remember that there 
is a lot of work to be done in terms of international trade and the 
signing of agreements like the one we have with Chile.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In that context I would like to pursue my question of the 
minister. In his answer to my question, he specifically said that he 
perceived that the additional advantage this agreement would bring 
to this country would be in the areas of investment, tariff reduction 
and perhaps serving as a model whereby the United States would be 
brought into this process.
<P>
	Clearly tariff reduction is there. That is a factor in every 
agreement of this nature, so let us leave that aside and speak for a 
moment on both the investment issue and the American issue. I 
would like to ask additional questions of the parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	How do we see Chile in terms of its investment regulations? My 
understanding is that when the tesobonos problems arose with 
Mexico it shook the very foundations of the financial markets of 
Latin America. Chile was one country which survived that 
experience precisely because it had in place investment controls 
which were more strict than those of other Latin American 
countries. Mexico in fact collapsed and then Argentina very nearly 
collapsed on top of it, but Chile survived.
<P>
	Surely it would seem to me that when we enter into an agreement 
with Chile that we would want to reinforce and enable that type of 
arrangement to be in place. We  would be a part of it and we would 
relate that to the International Monetary Fund and other monetary 
policies. That is certainly an issue which I think is preoccupying 
for many of us when we look at this agreement.
<P>
	Perhaps more preoccupying is the role of the United States in 
this. It is clear that it would be beneficial to bring the United States 
into this agreement. It is clear that if free trade of the Americas is 
going to be realized by the year 2005, an essential first step is to 
bring in the United States.
<P>
	Will the United States be brought in with environmental and 
labour standards side agreements such as those we have insisted on 
in NAFTA? My understanding is that the present political climate 
in Washington is that an ever increasingly conservative Congress 
will resist a great deal any suggestion by the administration that we 
should have side agreements of this nature attached to the Chile 
agreement.
<P>
	It seems to me that if ultimately Chile is going to be a part of 
NAFTA, then we have to incorporate into its arrangements with us 
these very important agreements because we are all concerned with 
the problem of the harmonization of standards.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer the member as best 
I can.
<P>
	The recently signed Canada-Chile free trade agreement is an 
important development for Canadian businesses. With this 
agreement Canadian exporters will gain significant access to one of 
the region's fastest growing economies and a gateway to all of 
Latin America.
<P>
	All Canadian exports are currently subject to an 11 per cent duty 
when they enter Chile. This agreement paves the way for increases 
in trade with Chile by eliminating the duty for roughly 75 per cent 
of current Canadian exports to Chile. The agreement will mean 
immediate duty free access on goods such as telecommunications 
equipment, electrical generating equipment, mining and forestry 
equipment, durum wheat, barley, lentils and maple syrup. A further 
15 per cent of current Canadian exports will have duty free access 
within five years.
<P>
	Since 40 per cent of our GDP depends on trade, an agreement 
such as this one is essential for the creation of jobs and growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, if Chile provides, for key products, improved 
access to other countries where Canadian products cannot enter 
duty free, this ensures that Canada will also enjoy improved access. 
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6782"> 6782 </A></B>
<P>
Elimination by both sides of anti-dumping measures will guarantee 
free access for Canadian exports and move forward the 
international reform of anti-dumping measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Cultural industries and the autopact are exempted from this 
agreement and social services and health care are fully protected. 
High tariffs for dairy, poultry and eggs over quota are preserved.
<P>
	We have signed side agreements on labour and the environment 
that provide us with the new mechanisms to seek to influence 
Chilean policies in these important areas.
<P>
	This bilateral agreement is a step toward fulfilling Canada's 
broader trade policy objective of promoting hemispheric trade 
liberalization under the FTAA. This free trade agreement will be a 
bridge to Chile's accession to NAFTA. Canadian exporters will 
have an important advantage over the United States, Asia and 
Europe in the Chilean market. This will give Canadian exporters a 
head start on their U.S. competitors when Chile does eventually 
join NAFTA.
<P>
	The Canada-Chile free trade agreement sends an important 
message to our trading partners that Canada is prepared to take the 
lead in creating a freer trade environment throughout the world.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week I asked the President of the Treasury Board whether in view 
of the 10 per cent unemployment rate in Canada the government 
intends to launch a new infrastructure program this winter.
<P>
	In 1993 the Canada infrastructure works program was a rightful 
promise kept by the government within weeks of taking office. The 
result of this joint federal-provincial-municipal program has been 
the creation of over 110,000 jobs for Canadians, all for the purpose 
of improving Canada's infrastructure and enhancing the skills and 
technological expertise of Canadians.
<P>
	Before the infrastructure program, unemployment stood at 11.4 
per cent. Today it is at 10 per cent with youth unemployment 
around 14 per cent. We need more job creation by government if 
we are to cope with almost jobless growth.
<P>
	Today about 97 per cent of the $6 billion in federal, provincial 
and municipal funding has been committed. Consequently we need 
to prime the pump. Again, we need a new infrastructure program 
with the same funding formula as the first but with new goals. For 
instance, we could target new infrastructure funds for energy 
efficient investments, to make buildings more efficient, to reduce 
energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This would create jobs for 
Canadians in the construction trades and environmental technology 
fields.
<P>
	The Canadian Home Builders Association estimates that for 
every $10,000 spent on a renovation, half a person year of direct 
employment is created. Increased funding for the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program would be a good vehicle both for 
creating jobs and increasing energy efficiency because it aims at 
improving the safety, health and energy efficiency of older 
buildings, structures and homes across the country.
<P>
	A new infrastructure program would help stimulate private 
sector job creation and community initiatives. Again I ask the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board: 
Does the government intend to launch a new infrastructure 
program this winter?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the chance 
to respond to my colleague, the hon. member for Davenport. My 
friend asks if the government intends to launch a new infrastructure 
program.
<P>
	The Prime Minister first invited provincial premiers at the first 
ministers' meeting in June 1996 to consider renewal of the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	At the October 4 meeting of the Minister of Finance and his 
counterparts, the federal government outlined what its position 
would be if the program were to be renewed. This position included 
the following points: The federal government will fund no more 
than one-third of the total program in every province. The program 
will continue to be focused primarily on improving municipal 
infrastructure. The financial participation of the private sector will 
be actively encouraged.
<P>
	In order to contribute to job creation programs, funds should be 
incremental. Infrastructure investments should also have a 
strategic focus on the 21st century by improving the conditions for 
medium and long term job creation, enhancing competitiveness. 
And the program would continue as a national program. We will 
not proceed without the full participation of all provinces.
<P>
	Since that meeting the media has reported that British Columbia, 
Quebec and Ontario are now onside to join the new infrastructure 
program. However, provinces have not yet indicated they are ready 
to increase their overall capital spending on infrastructure to match 
federal contributions for the new program.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6783"> 6783 </A></B>
<P>
	The premiers' deadline of November 1 for the report back from 
their finance ministers has passed. However, we are still waiting to 
hear something official from the provinces.
<P>
	With respect to the renewal of the program, any decision to 
extend it must be taken in the context of fiscal realities, and in light 
of the objectives of both the provinces and the government.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is 
deemed to have been adopted. The House stands adjourned until2 p.m. tomorrow.
