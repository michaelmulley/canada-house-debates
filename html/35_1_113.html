	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in record time this 
morning Canada responded formally to the seventh biennial 
report of the International Joint Commission on Great Lakes 
water quality.
<P>
	Last spring the IJC issued a clarion call for action by Canada 
and the United States to get serious about cleaning up the Great 
Lakes.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Government of Canada has taken the IJC's message to 
heart and we have responded in an unprecedented 
timeframe-not just with words but with deeds and concrete 
action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since last spring Canada has got its Great Lakes act together. 
In July we signed and are now implementing the 
Canada-Ontario Great Lakes agreement, an agreement that had 
languished for three years. In September we released the 
proposed toxic substances management policy. Today I wish to 
announce a new action plan for the management of chlorinated 
substances in Canada.
<P>
	These measures are forceful responses to the 
recommendations of the International Joint Commission. More 
important, they demonstrate that Canada will do its part to 
restore and protect water bodies like the Great Lakes. We will 
work to ensure a healthy and safe environment for all residents 
and, in response to this issue, in particular for the 45,000 
citizens who live around the Great Lakes basin on both sides of 
the border.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canada-Ontario agreement is innovative and 
co-operative. It sets out schedules, targets and mechanisms for 
co-ordinated action. Canada and Ontario have agreed on a 
shared vision of sustainable development for the Great Lakes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank those people in the department who 
worked very hard to bring forward this speedy response. When 
we asked for a response this fall they said it could not be done. 
The Department of the Environment did it and I think John Mills 
and the team from Ontario deserve special credit.
<P>
	In this new approach we are embracing the ecosystem 
approach, cleaning up pollution hot spots and implementing 
binational commitments. We cannot clean up the Great Lakes 
alone. The agreement is based on the principles of pollution 
prevention, shared responsibilities, openness and 
accountability.
<P>
	Equally important, in responding to the commission's call for 
building partnerships-and I see a member of the commission in 
the House today-the Canada-Ontario agreement provides a 
context for the participation of other partners.
<P>
	Governments cannot do the job alone. The agreement 
provides a smart fiscally responsible way to resolve the complex 
challenges that we face in the Great Lakes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada and Ontario are putting in place strategies to 
eliminate the use, generation or release into the Great Lakes' 
environ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7140"> 7140 </A></B>
<P>
ment of 13 problem chemicals. The agreement targets 
significant reductions for 26 other toxic substances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are putting our money and our science where our mouth is. 
Despite serious financial restraint the federal government is 
putting millions of dollars over the next six years into the 
restoration of the Great Lakes. These efforts make a difference.
<P>
	Collingwood Harbour in Ontario is the first Great Lakes hot 
spot to be declared clean. We intend with the stakeholders group 
to keep it that way. Co-operative efforts produce tangible 
results.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our proposed national toxic substances management policy 
would commit Canada to the virtual elimination from the 
environment of those substances that result from human 
activity, take a long time to break down, build up in living 
organisms and are toxic. In drafting this policy, the Government 
of Canada paid attention to the IJC's recommendations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to repeat. In response to the IJC's report we are 
proposing that Canada reach virtual elimination from the 
environment of all man made substances resulting from human 
activity which rest in the environment for a long time, 
accumulate in living organisms and are toxic.
<P>
	In elaborating the policy we are in fact adopting the 
recommendations of the IJC. The emphasis has to be on 
prevention. There is no point in spending a small fortune to 
clean up the Great Lakes, the Fraser River and le fleuve 
Saint-Laurent if we turn around and pollute them all over again.
<P>
	As part of our approach to toxics I am pleased to advise the 
House of Commons this morning that Canada is implementing a 
chlorinated substances action plan that will benefit the Great 
Lakes region and the rest of the country.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Chlorinated substances will be managed under a five part 
action plan. That action plan includes targeting actions to focus 
on critical uses and products. Government action will include 
eliminating the most harmful chlorinated substances, taking a 
sectoral approach to managing chlorinated substances and 
entering into environmental performance agreements with key 
industrial sectors like the dry cleaning sector and other 
governments.
<P>
	We will also improve the scientific understanding of chlorine 
and its impacts on the environment and human health. 
Following the IJC report we will develop detailed 
socioeconomic and health study issues of the use of chlorinated 
substances and their alternatives. We intend  to improve access 
to all this information for Canadians. We want to promote 
international efforts for global action on chlorinated substances.
<P>
	We are adopting the advice of the world's most respected 
scientists. I personally want to thank Dr. David Shindler for his 
very constructive contribution in the development of this action 
plan.
<P>
	At a special meeting convened by the Society of 
Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, scientists agreed to 
ban all uses of chlorine that are not supported by a critical 
review of the scientific evidence to protect the environment. 
They also agreed that actions are needed to restrict or ban a 
number of toxic persistent and biocumulative chemicals, some 
of which are chlorinated.
<P>
	The scientists agreed that there are some positive uses for 
some aspects of the chlorinated chain, including the use of 
purification processes in drinking water. At this point we have 
no alternative to the use of chlorine for safe drinking water. 
Certainly it is reasonable to expect that Canadians want to feel 
safe about the water they drink. There is also no reasonable 
alternative to certain chlorinated compounds in the 
development of pharmaceutical products, including 
antihistamines and anti-inflammatory medication.
<P>
	The plan I am announcing today has to do with ridding Canada 
of chlorinated compounds that do persist, that are biocumulative 
and that are toxic. These chlorinated compounds will be gone. 
We are committed to the virtual elimination in the Great Lakes 
basin of nine toxic chlorinated substances identified by the IJC. 
We are also committing to significantly reduce the use, 
generation and release of five other substances.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As part of our immediate efforts, we will be working with two 
important industry sectors to reduce the release of chlorinated 
substances: dry cleaning and metal degreasing.
<P>
	We are all in this together and the smartest route is to work 
together to find solutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know we can make progress. Since we determined that 
chlorofluocarbons were destroying the ozone layer we 
implemented a phaseout program to reduce their production in 
Canada. So far we have reduced CFC consumption by 77 per 
cent. The government intends to build on this progress by 
introducing an accelerated ozone protection program.
<P>
	We are also working with the provinces and the territories to 
produce national guidelines for water, sediment and soil quality 
for more than 40 chlorinated substances. We are undertaking 
major initiatives to examine the alternative use to chlorine 
based technology.
<P>
	The government believes all Canadians wherever they live 
care deeply about the environment and want to be included in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7141"> 7141 </A></B>
<P>
future decisions, but Canadians often feel hamstrung by the lack 
of information. That is why the  government will produce later 
this year a national publicly accessible database with 
information on the environmental release of 178 substances.
<P>
	We want the public to have a say in understanding and in 
developing public policy. We see the national database as a step 
in the right direction in furnishing Canadians with the 
information they need to make sound decisions about their own 
environmental future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Next spring, Canada will co-host, in Vancouver, a United 
Nations' conference bringing together international experts on 
the long-range transport of persistent organic pollutants.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	We will be hosting in Vancouver next spring an international 
congress of experts from the United Nations on the 
transportation of long distance, persistent toxic substances. It is 
a direct result of our intervention at the United Nations 
commission on sustainable development. We pointed to a 
situation in which in the Canadian Arctic right now women face 
the incredible difficulty of having excessive levels of PCBs in 
their breast milk. This is not because of industrial development 
from which they have benefited but rather because of long 
distance airborne toxins which come from other parts of the 
world. We need a global response.
<P>
	When we met yesterday with the Prime Minister of the 
Ukraine we underlined the importance of developing an 
international approach to toxic management so the women of the 
Arctic do not have to face the incredible health hazard of having 
elevated levels of PCBs in their milk because the world 
community has not responded with tough regulations and with 
tough responses of pollution prevention.
<P>
	We are also entering into negotiations with the United States 
because we believe an ecosystem approach is the way to go. We 
are exploring with the United States a pilot project on 
chlorinated substances in the Great Lakes in which Canada and 
the U.S. will focus on a dual approach to the elimination of 
persistent biocumulative toxins.
<P>
	Canada will continue to work with the United States in 
addressing other Great Lakes issues. No Canadian program, no 
matter how comprehensive, no matter how successful, can 
achieve the goals set by the International Joint Commission. In a 
meeting I had recently with the members of the International 
Joint Commission they pointed this out to me.
<P>
	Let me use Lake Superior as a microcosm. If today all 
industrial input into Lake Superior on the Canadian and 
American sides were eliminated, we would still see a poisoning 
of that lake by up to 20 per cent as a result of international 
airborne toxins.
<P>
	Not only do we need a domestic approach, we need a 
binational ecosystem approach to develop closed loop systems 
for industrial emissions. We also need a global approach to deal 
with the problem of international airborne toxins. Canada will 
continue to work very hard with the United States. I know that 
my American counterparts are expected to table their IJC 
response next spring. They are looking forward to working very 
closely with us in developing a constructive binational 
approach.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We need joint action on the clean-up of boundary waterways 
such as the Detroit and Niagara rivers as well as Lake Superior. 
We are eagerly awaiting an American national program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are waiting with impatience for a national American 
program to clean up, to prevent pollution and to deal with the 
health of this vital ecosystem. As I stated earlier, it is an 
ecosystem that supplies the drinking water of 45 million people, 
the heart of the fresh water supply of the world.
<P>
	I want to thank the International Joint Commission. Through 
its carefully considered recommendations the commission 
continues to provide vital advice on Great Lakes environmental 
issues. The government wants to clean up the Great Lakes. It 
believes the best way to encourage action from our neighbours 
to the south and from other countries is to show leadership on 
environmental issues in Canada.
<P>
	In the last month we have tried to do that. Working with the 
very able chair of the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development we have announced a new 
environmental industry strategy. We have proclaimed the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, no mean feat and one 
for which special tribute is due to my parliamentary secretary, 
the former minister of the environment for the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	We have also introduced important improvements to that act 
only yesterday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have announced new legislation for a commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development and we have 
announced the proposed toxic substances management policy 
and the chlorinated substances action plan.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians want the government to be a world leader in 
environmental issues. We are determined to provide a balanced 
ecosystem approach that recognizes the key is pollution 
prevention and that responds positively to the very constructive 
IJC recommendations. The goal for chlorinated substances that 
are toxic, persistent and that accumulate in living organisms 
should be virtual elimination. That is the goal we have embraced 
today.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
International Joint Commission, a Canada-U.S. bilateral 
organization created by treaty in 1909, is responsible for 
monitoring the progress achieved in meeting the objectives of 
the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement by the Canadian and 
U.S. governments, Ontario and eight states bordering the Great 
Lakes.
<P>
	Last winter, the commission tabled its seventh report 
reaffirming the recommendations in the two previous reports 
and made new recommendations to eliminate pollution in the 
Great Lakes. The conclusion of the seventh report was 
inescapable: The Joint Commission rejected the approach 
traditionally favoured by both countries. It recommended a 
drastically different strategy. The commission wants a clear 
action plan aimed at virtually eliminating persistent toxins 
threatening human health and the future of the Great Lakes' 
ecosystem.
<P>
	It favoured a consultation process involving the federal 
government, Ontario, as well as union and community 
organizations to allow each player to participate in making 
decisions on how to achieve cleanup goals. What caught the 
attention of ordinary people-who do not know as much about 
the environment as biochemists and scientists with recognized 
expertise in this field-is probably the effect of toxins on animal 
and human health.
<P>
	Reproductive, metabolic, neurological and behavioral 
abnormalities in humans, fish and birds which are due to water 
pollution in the Great Lakes are simply inconceivable. Exposure 
to these toxins increases the risk of breast and other types of 
cancer. In the long term, scientific evidence shows that PCBs, 
dioxins and organo-chlorinated compounds disrupt hormonal 
balance in animals. Studies show the existence of similar effects 
in humans.
<P>
	Even more distressing are the long-term effects of these 
toxins on the body; they are currently hard to identify but may 
become devastating in the not too distant future. This is caused 
by toxic waste spills in the Great Lakes.
<P>
	We must, however, admit that the governments of Ontario and 
Canada have made significant progress since the first agreement 
was signed in 1971. Since then, the amount of PCBs found in 
seagull eggs has gone down by 90 per cent. The iron and steel, 
and pulp and paper industries have reduced their release of 
conventional pollutants by 75 per cent since 1972, compared to 
90 per cent for the petroleum industry.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not denying the efforts of the two 
governments, but would like to point out that certain problems 
remain and that the Canada-Ontario agreement signed in July 
has been criticized on several counts. For example, Jay Palter of 
Greenpeace expressed his disappointment with the agreement. 
He felt that it would not protect the health of the public and the 
environment of the Great Lakes, because it ignored the  most 
toxic chemicals and did absolutely nothing to eliminate the most 
toxic chlorinated substances in the Great Lakes.
<P>
	Today, the minister is admittedly proposing an initial step 
towards the elimination of toxic chlorinated substances, but it is 
clearly insufficient and does not seem to meet the expectations 
of the environmental stakeholders. The minister indicates that 
the plan is designed to eliminate nine toxic chlorinated 
substances and to reduce the use, generation and release of five 
other substances, without placing a total ban on the use of 
chlorine.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The International Joint Commission proposed that the use of 
chlorine and chlorinated compounds in manufacturing 
processes should be restricted, gradually eliminated and 
ultimately banned. Naturally, this approach was dependent on 
government consultation with industry and the other 
stakeholders.
<P>
	The minister is basing her opinion on the results of a special 
meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and 
Chemistry, from which she has concluded that it is not necessary 
to ban the use of chlorine in manufacturing processes. We need 
hardly remind her that this opinion is not shared by all 
stakeholders in the Great Lakes' question.
<P>
	At the biennial meeting of the International Joint 
Commission, which was held in the fall of 1993, a big 
controversy developed over the prohibition of that toxic 
substance.
<P>
	For example, Greenpeace and Pollution Probe challenged 
claims made by American organizations such as the Chlorine 
Chemistry Council, as well as the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association, to the effect that chlorine is not such a toxic 
substance.
<P>
	It is essential to conduct research on chlorine and its 
alternatives in industrial processing techniques to put an end to 
the ambiguity regarding the virtual elimination of toxic 
substances which are harmful to our health.
<P>
	Let us not forget that 40 million people live on the shores of 
those lakes. We often hear about the damage caused to the 
Amazon forest, the desertification of African land and 
numerous other sites threatened by human activity. The Great 
Lakes are one of those sites, since one quarter of the world's 
freshwater supply is found there. A long time ago, people may 
have believed that, because of its size, this body of water would 
never be seriously affected by pollution, but now we have to 
recognize that, after years of spillage, these toxic substances 
have formed sediments and created a very real problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7143"> 7143 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister says that she is anxiously waiting for the 
American plan. It seems somewhat strange to us, Bloc 
Quebecois members, that the Canadian strategy would be 
released when the American plan is not even known.
<P>
	If there is an issue over which the two countries should 
consult with each other it is the follow-up of the 
recommendations made by the International Joint Commission. 
The clean-up plans of both partners have an impact on the same 
body of water; consequently, these efforts must complement 
each other. As was the case when the signing of the Oslo 
Protocol on acid rain was announced last May, when measures to 
be initiated by the Government of Canada to deal with 
transborder environmental problems are announced by the 
minister in the House, it is imperative to supplement these with 
an agreement with the neighbouring country in order to make 
these clean-up efforts effective.
<P>
	In this respect, the 1992 report by the sub-committee on acid 
rain of the Standing Committee on the Environment was quite 
clear, and I quote: ``Thus, while a unilateral Canadian program 
of controls on acid-rain-generating emissions might carry 
moral or political suasion, it is recognized that a permanent 
solution to the problem in North America must include the 
United States''.
<P>
	The same applies to dealing with pollution by chemical 
substances in the Great Lakes. The same applies to the clean-up 
of the St. Lawrence River. Last week, I went with the 
environment and sustainable development committee to the St. 
Lawrence Centre, which implements a federal-provincial 
program, with a budget of around $100 million, to clean up the 
river.
<P>
	We know that 40 per cent of the toxics that pollute the river 
come from the Great Lakes. We therefore feel it is essential to 
take a comprehensive and consistent approach. Why bother 
spending all this money on cleaning up the river, if toxic 
substances can come from unmonitored sources upstream?
<P>
	If we do not take steps to deal with the whole problem, we are 
just wasting taxpayers money. We are literally throwing it down 
the drain.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	In concluding, we want to thank the members of the 
commission for their excellent job in clarifying what remains to 
be done to eliminate pollution in the Great Lakes. Their 
determination is a sign that future generations may yet see these 
magnificent waters in their pristine state.
<P>
	As the commission's report said, what we do to the Great 
Lakes, we do to ourselves and to our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today with a divided opinion on the minister's statement. 
While I support action that will lead to the clean up of the Great 
Lakes, I question the  manner in which the minister is planning 
to attain this goal.
<P>
	During the last few weeks we have seen a flurry of activity 
coming out of the minister's office. Some of the announcements 
I have agreed with, such as the submission on environmental 
assessment regulations and the commissioner for the 
environment. Others I have disagreed with, such as the $57 
million subsidy to the already booming environmental services 
industry.
<P>
	Despite the minister's recent activity I still have some 
concerns regarding this government's approach to the 
environment. Considerable obstacles remain before Canada can 
claim, in the words of the minister, to be a world leader on 
environmental issues.
<P>
	Most important among them is the question of 
federal-provincial jurisdiction. Herein lies the Achilles heel of 
all environmental laws and regulations in Canada, this tug of 
war, this fight between the federal government and the 
provincial governments on environment, or who is going to have 
control.
<P>
	The minister will recall earlier this year she fought hard to 
have the NAFTA environmental office placed in Montreal. We 
have heard nothing further from this commission for 
environmental co-operation. Why? I would suggest in all 
probability it is because the commission is ineffective without 
provincial co-operation. The Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act still requires federal-provincial agreements to 
avoid confusion and duplication with provincial laws.
<P>
	These are some of the critical issues that must be addressed 
before we can claim to be a leader in the environmental sector.
<P>
	This announcement on the Great Lakes is one which I support 
in principle. However I cannot agree with the minister on its 
content for it is heavy on studies but light on substance. For 
example phrases like detailed assessment, improved access to 
information, seeking global action, and improved scientific 
understanding are all nice rhetoric and make great headlines but 
they result in little action.
<P>
	As my colleague has said, the Great Lakes provide one-fifth 
of the world's fresh water supply. I will repeat that: one-fifth of 
the world's fresh water supply is in the Great Lakes. Protection 
of this resource is clearly of critical importance and there is no 
one who disputes this.
<P>
	Numerous agreements and reports have been produced since 
the first Great Lakes water quality agreement was signed in 
1972. Protection of this resource clearly remains critical. 
Response to this problem to date has been a Canada-Ontario 
agreement and a proposal to manage chlorinated substances. 
The Canada-Ontario agreement is a jointly funded $250 million 
program to clean up the Great Lakes. This is a good first step, 
but we must take our southern neighbour into consideration 
when dealing with the Great Lakes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7144"> 7144 </A></B>
<P>
	Environment Canada released a report last year estimating 
that dump sites along the U.S. side of the St. Lawrence River 
were responsible for about 60 per cent of the most hazardous 
substances polluting Lake Ontario. With facts like these 
obviously a Canada-U.S. agreement is critical, but there is no 
joint agreement with the U.S. to date. The minister says she is 
working with the U.S. toward an agreement, however I would 
like to see some concrete actions toward this goal.
<P>
	This plan does not hold much water-no pun 
intended-without an American agreement. We are sharing the 
same water trough. Our actions are being undermined by the fact 
that we do not have a joint agreement to ensure U.S. 
participation and compliance.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister was correct when she stated that progress can 
only be made in co-operation with other governments and 
federal spending will be useful only if it levers participation by 
other parties. Without American and provincial co-operation 
these plans are futile.
<P>
	The minister talks about discussions, but when will the 
minister get beyond talk and take some concrete action? We 
need an agreement, not just rhetoric.
<P>
	The seventh biennial report which the minister refers to 
suggested that the degradation of the Great Lakes has 
potentially catastrophic implications for human health. The IJC 
report noted, as the minister has pointed out, that chlorinated 
substances are an integral part of the problem and link chlorines 
with low sperm counts in men and increased breast cancer in 
women. Although the IJC report suggested a ban on all 
chlorinated substances, these conclusions lack scientific 
backing. It is impractical to ban all chlorinated substances, 
however we do need to manage them more effectively.
<P>
	To reduce the release of chlorinated substances the minister 
talks about working with two industry sectors. She mentions the 
dry cleaning and metal degreasing industries. What about 
Canada's number one industry, forestry? Pulp and paper mills 
are major users of chlorine in the bleaching process. The 
minister fails to mention this industry in her speech and I 
question why. I suspect it has a lot to do with the older mills and 
the precarious balance they have between the economy and the 
environment. However it is a major sector in Canadian industry 
and I believe it needs to be addressed here.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am encouraged that the minister is taking 
action on the Great Lakes. However it is not enough just to say 
that Canadians want to be a world leader on environmental 
issues, we must take the necessary steps to attain this goal. We 
need an agreement with the Americans and all of the provinces 
to reduce chlorinated toxins. We must work closely with all the 
industries involved.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House requests the government to table a clear detailed plan to show 
how and when it intends to balance the budget including a clear statement of its 
vision of the role of the government in the economy in order for the people of 
Canada to debate the plan and vision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege and a pleasure for me to 
talk on this motion on this auspicious day. Today is October 25, 
1994. It happens to be the first anniversary of the general 
election last year at which time the Reform Party laid before the 
people of Canada a real plan of how to deal with the debt and the 
deficit.
<P>
	We presented to the Canadian people a plan that we called 
zero in three, a plan to balance the budget in three years. We laid 
out specifically where we would cut the money. We had a 
balanced plan between growth in the economy and cuts in 
government spending. In that way the Canadian people would 
know that within three years we would have a balanced budget.
<P>
	We spelled it out in detail that we would cut 25 per cent of 
subsidies to crown corporations. We would reform 
unemployment insurance to make it a real insurance plan based 
on the debate and discussion between management and labour. 
We talked about abandoning and eliminating subsidies to 
special interest groups, and so on. We laid out a complete and 
detailed plan on how we would achieve that.
<P>
	On this day last year 2.5 million Canadians voted for that plan 
and elected 52 Reformers to this House. It was one of the great 
electoral upsets in the history of Canada. We had only one MP 
before and now we are represented here by 52 MPs.
<P>
	During that same election, the Liberals ran around waving 
their red book. The Prime Minister said that he had a book and he 
had a plan. The nature of our motion today is to ask where that 
plan is. We have not seen it yet. On this the first anniversary the 
Liberals have been in power for one full year and we are still 
waiting for them to take action on that infamous red book 
``Creating Opportunity, the Liberal plan for Canada''. We have 
not seen what they intend to do with it.
<P>
	The Liberals talked about reviving the economy, reducing the 
deficit, creating high tech jobs. One of the first things they did 
was cancel the helicopter program that was going to cost about 
$5 billion and would have generated all kinds of research and 
development and high technology. What did they do with the 
money? They started digging up ditches, digging sewers and so 
on. That will not add to the future viability of this country. That 
type of plan will get them nowhere in the long term.
<P>
	We were expecting big things when they waved that book all 
through the election campaign. We thought it was going to be an 
exciting 100 days, even though we were sitting in opposition, 
but what happened? It took the government almost 100 days to 
get Parliament back sitting. That type of lethargy is what has 
happened. That is the story of this Liberal government in this 
past year.
<P>
	The Liberals have fallen flat. They have not delivered on their 
promises. They have accomplished very little, if indeed they 
have accomplished anything apart from their discussion papers 
of course.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	A few weeks ago the Minister of Human Resources 
Development laid before us a document that said we have a 
problem. Did he have any solutions? No, he had nothing. He 
promised to deliver that paper in June and he did not. He took 
until October before he laid that plan before us and all he could 
was say was that there is a problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7146"> 7146 </A></B>
<P>
	We are looking for real direction from this government. We 
have not seen it so far. In his plan of a review of social programs 
he excluded $20 billion of old age security payments. That says 
this is not even going to form part of the discussion. Transfers to 
the provinces for help, let us not even talk about that. It is not 
part of our social security review. Yet the whole idea is surely to 
review the program to find out if any money can be saved.
<P>
	The ministers of the government have to get their act together. 
We are asking and pleading with them to lay before Canadians a 
plan of action that shows us how they intend to balance this 
budget.
<P>
	He talked about a health care program. The Prime Minister 
took great pains to explain and be proud of the fact that he was 
going to call a premier's conference on health care in June. It did 
not happen in June and it did not happen in July. By the time 
October came around he finally got a few people to show up. Not 
one representative from the provinces showed up on his much 
vaunted forum on health care. Again it has fallen flat.
<P>
	The red book said the Liberals were going to reform the GST. 
The finance committee met ad nauseam from January to June. It 
produced a document but we still have not seen anything. They 
have no plan. They promised to get rid of the GST and they have 
not produced a thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Stand by. A 
simple tax is coming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Small business people are struggling to handle 
all the complex accounting. Yet one year later, no plan, no 
proposal. The finance minister floated out the idea of a national 
12 per cent sales tax. I can assure the Minister of Finance that a 
flat 12 per cent national sales tax will not fly in my home 
province of Alberta.
<P>
	Canadians were promised good government and that Ottawa 
would hold the separatists at bay through their good 
government. We have 53 of them sitting here and through their 
lack of leadership we now have a bunch sitting in Quebec City 
which is bent on taking Quebec out of this federation. It is a 
national tragedy that through their lack of leadership and lack of 
direction they have allowed that to happen. If they had kept the 
separatists out of the provincial government in Quebec this 
country would be a lot better off today. We found out through 
question period in the last few weeks that they were caught flat 
footed and did not even get the documents and agreements all 
signed properly. Therefore the separatists were able to make 
political hay out of their lack of ensuring that paper work was 
done and getting an agreement signed on Collège Lac-St-Jean.
<P>
	They promised that parliamentary democracy would be 
revived and we would have open government. Yet we find that 
the whip is applied as soon as one person wants to step out of 
line. Oh, no, that is not allowed. So much  for their great 
statements on revived and open government.
<P>
	They did promise us that there would be action on the deficit 
and the debt. By the admission of the Minister of Finance when 
he brought down his first budget, within three years he will add 
$100 billion more to our debt. He has not even told us or given us 
any idea when he will even attempt to get to a balanced budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> He does not know how.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There will be a royal commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> My friends are also upset. We want to know 
what the government is saying. What is the plan? There is no 
plan. They have been around for a year and we want to know 
what they intend to do. Canadians want to know. That is that they 
were elected to do, yet they have not been able to produce.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance talks about the deficit being reduced 
to 3 per cent of the GNP within three years. It is the wrong target 
because the debt will continue to grow. He has not given us any 
idea how he is going to go beyond that.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	To bring it down to $25 billion in three years is minuscule, 
timid and lacks any guts whatsoever to get the job done. Now we 
find by the Minister of Finance's own admission last week that 
even his own small and timid target of reducing the deficit to 
$25 billion is going to be out of his reach unless he makes more 
serious cuts. He has not given us a plan.
<P>
	We need to know what the government intends to do. 
Canadians have their right surely because those members were 
elected on a red book that set action and we have had one year of 
inaction.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tells us about the $6 billion to $9 
billion of additional cuts that are necessary to meet this target. 
Yet nothing in the two documents that he tabled last week before 
the finance committee, ``A New Framework for Economic 
Policy'' and ``Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate'', in any way 
shape or form gives us any idea how the minister is going to 
tackle this job of cutting.
<P>
	He could have gone back to the plan that we laid out last year, 
our zero in three plan. We laid it all out there. It was quite 
simple. The advice was there for free and yet even that seems to 
be beyond his comprehension.
<P>
	He did say last week that what we seek are jobs and growth. To 
get there we must stop the debt. Our ultimate goal is a balanced 
budget. He has said it. We want him to deliver. We want to know 
how he is going to deliver and we want to know when he is going 
to deliver on the commitment that he made before the finance 
committee last week.
<P>
	The minister also said that the entire role of government in the 
economy must be rethought. I hope he has some kind of vision 
when he makes these kinds of statements, some plan or idea of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7147"> 7147 </A></B>
<P>
the role of government  in this country and how it is going to 
interact with private industry to ensure that we get back together 
on our fiscal senses. Nothing has been produced.
<P>
	The government has lost a clear sense of economic leadership 
in a vision of what the role must be in a modern economy and 
where it should leave the action to others.
<P>
	Here is another quote out of the same publication. We see that 
the Minister of Finance really does not know. He is asking 
Canadians what they want. This is what I call leadership from 
behind. He says: ``We have a problem. Everybody talk about it, 
please. If I can find that there is some consensus in the nation 
then I will go in that direction''. That is not leadership.
<P>
	That is leadership from behind. That accomplishes nothing. 
We are looking for resolute action now to resolve the deficit for 
the benefit of future generations. Six hundred billion or $650 
billion in debt at an interest rate averaging 6, 7 and 8 per cent is 
completely and absolutely unsustainable by this country. The 
Minister of Finance seems quite willing to allow that to happen.
<P>
	Canadians deserve to know what cuts are to be made, when 
they are to be made, how and when this government plans to 
balance the budget. The Canadian people deserve to know the 
vision of the Minister of Finance and the role that the 
government has for this economy.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance now to ensure that he eliminates 
all the waste in government, that he can reform the MPs pension 
plan. He can start here in this House. He does not have to go out 
in the street and talk to Canadians and say: ``What do you 
want?''. We in the Reform say and I know that all Canadians 
agree that it is time that we reform the MPs pension plan.
<P>
	I looked at the public accounts. They were tabled in the House 
last week. The government threw in another $10 million just to 
bring up the level of money in the plan to cover the excess 
payments that are now going out because 200-odd MPs at last 
election are now out on the street. They are not out on the street 
but they are on their own. They are out on the street with a huge 
pension plan paid by the Canadian taxpayers. They are upset and 
they would like to see some reforms.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance needs any ideas we say he can start 
right here in this House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Is he listening?
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> I doubt it. What about unemployment 
insurance? We said last year that business and labour should sit 
down together and revamp the UI program in order for it to be a 
self-sustaining program. We hear some musings by the minister 
along those lines on this the anniversary of the election. It has 
been one whole year and he is just starting to get to the point 
where we were a year ago.
<P>
	He could target social spending to those in need. Yesterday 
afternoon at the University of Alberta I was talking to people 
who are faced with substantial increasing costs in their 
education. As they are being asked to pay for more and more of 
their education, there are retired people who are sitting on the 
beaches in Hawaii or who are sitting in the sun in southern 
United States and Mexico collecting old age security on top of 
the whole wealth they have accumulated during their life.
<P>
	I said during the election that we will cut off old age security 
to senior families which earn more than $54,000. All I got from 
the seniors was: ``Why so high at $54,000? Bring it down. It is 
far too much''.
<P>
	They had never seen that kind of money before. Yet this 
government continues to pay almost $5,000 a year per retired 
individual regardless of their income. They may be millionaires. 
When we have fiscal problems why should we be spending that 
kind of money on people who do not need it?
<P>
	Consider special interest groups which get half a billion 
dollars. Just cut them off. It is that simple. It does not take a lot 
of guts. Just do it. The Minister of Finance should start right 
away.
<P>
	How about improved financial accountability in government? 
Treasury Board has a policy in place called program evaluation 
where programs are evaluated basically on four points. One, is it 
relevant? Are we still spending money by virtue of habit? Two, 
is it effective and meeting its objectives? Three, are we 
delivering the program efficiently and, four, is there another 
better way to deliver the program?
<P>
	Program evaluation is a policy that is currently being used a 
small amount by the Treasury Board, but could be used much 
more in order for Canadians to find out how the programs are 
working and how they can be revamped and regeared to ensure 
we are getting maximum bang for our buck, that those in need 
are receiving the assistance and we are spending Canadian 
taxpayers dollars efficiently, well and wisely.
<P>
	These are just some of the things we and the Minister of 
Finance could do, but unfortunately he is going to wait another 
six months until he tables his budget in February before we 
know what his next nickel of cuts is going to be. Even by his own 
admission he is already missing his target.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some of the figures we have so far. The 
1994-95 spending estimates show old age security costing $20.6 
billion. Next year it will increase to $21.4 billion. Transfers to 
provinces were $26.3 billion last year, increasing to $26.4 
billion. Grants to natives of $3.8 billion last year are up to $4.1 
billion. Grants to international assistance remain the same at 
$2.6 billion. Other subsidies and transfers at $4.5 billion are 
going up to $4.9 billion.
<P>
	There is not a single cut. We wonder why this country is in a 
mess. We wonder when this government will take serious, real, 
concerted action. That is what Canadians  want. It is long 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7148"> 7148 </A></B>
<P>
overdue. We call upon the Minister of Finance to table his plan 
and his vision now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I looked forward to this 
opposition motion today because it gives the Government of 
Canada a chance to put on the record in a factual way not only 
the vision this government has in terms of putting people back to 
work and getting this economy going, but some of the specific 
initiatives that have been passed in the last eight months since 
we have taken power. It is important that we focus on the deficit 
and debt of this balance sheet for Canada and we are doing that. 
The <I>Financial Post</I>, which no one would ever claim to be a paper 
sympathetic to the Liberal Party, in the Saturday edition had a 
masthead saying we are heading in the right direction. The 
Reform Party should take note of that.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	I want to be very specific. We need growth in the economy. As 
a government we have said pre the red book, during the red 
book, in the last eight months that small business represents the 
greatest hope of putting Canadians back to work.
<P>
	I am not going to use this report from the industry committee 
called ``Taking Care of Small Business'' as a display, but I do 
want to say that the Reform Party, which worked on and 
supported the report, has to acknowledge that already the banks 
are acting on some of the recommendations we have put in the 
report.
<P>
	At the same time I do not know how the member who was the 
lead speaker for the Reform Party could stand in his place and 
not acknowledge that our exports have been up four months in a 
row, our manufacturing sector is on the rebound. All the 
statistics and all the numbers show that. Our tourism deficit is 
coming down.
<P>
	By the way, I am not standing here claiming victory. That is 
not the point. The point is that we have created an environment 
not only with specific actions but a psychological environment 
which is important in any economic equation. We cannot go 
around here cut, cut, cut without using our creative ability to 
cause growth specifically in the small business sector.
<P>
	I hope the remaining speeches put forward by the opposition 
parties today will be a little more balanced. Confidence in the 
economy is an important factor in the equation. Reformers have 
to acknowledge, if they are going to be looking at all of the facts, 
that there are many good signals in the economy today. I believe 
that the government has assisted in creating those positive facts.
<P>
	I would like the member of the opposition to stand in his place 
and acknowledge that manufacturing is up. Exports are up. The 
tourism deficit is coming down. House starts have been up the 
last four months in a row. It is a fact that 300,000 new jobs have 
been created in the last nine months. If he would just 
acknowledge those things, we could begin having a truly 
constructive debate here today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, the selective statements by the 
parliamentary secretary certainly seem to bolster his case. He 
talks about the masthead in the <I>Financial Post</I> at the weekend 
supporting his vision. It was from that particular article that I 
thought about leadership from behind.
<P>
	The article talked about the fact that there is a consensus 
among Canadians that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development should move ahead and reform UI even though he 
has not laid a plan before us as part of his social services review. 
The survey said go and go now because the people want 
something done.
<P>
	As for the psychological advantage, businesses want cuts, 
cuts, cuts. As I said in my opening remarks we could start by 
cutting the MPs pension plan. We would get applause from 
Canadians just by doing it right now. That is the type of 
demonstration which would send a strong signal to all people in 
Canada, not just small business people, that the members of 
Parliament are serious about reining in the deficit. If we are 
talking about austerity let us start right here. It is a wonderful 
opportunity that the government is missing.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	He talks about vision. We have not seen any vision from the 
Liberal Party. We are asking for a plan. We hope the Liberals can 
deliver one very soon. I know that Canadians are getting fed up. 
They will run out of patience and find somebody else to do the 
job if the Liberals cannot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
the record show that the Reform Party did not acknowledge any 
of the facts I put on the record in my previous comments.
<P>
	I would like to show that we are prepared to debate the tough 
issues openly. As the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said quite clearly on many occasions, his 
document is not a fait accompli. It is a discussion paper. It is a 
debating tool. It is an instrument to get people involved as we 
restructure the government's social service programs.
<P>
	Quite frankly that is the way to go. I know Reform Party 
members really think that is the way to go. They are known for 
their 1-800 numbers and their fax machines where they get their 
questions for question period. The point I am trying to make is 
that Reformers should go back to the way they started where 
they were going to be a bit more constructive about debate.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge one area. It is an area in which I have a 
personal interest and it is the whole issue of tax reform. I was 
absolutely amazed at the opening speech today. The Reform 
Party campaigned vigorously on a single tax system to reform 
the tax system. All of us believe that the tax system of Canada 
needs reform. I would like it to show on the record that the 
opening speaker today never once talked about the single tax 
system or as they call it, the flat tax system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7149"> 7149 </A></B>
<P>
	In the whole year Reformers have been in the House of 
Commons they have done very little to honour the campaign 
pledge which they made that they were going to work diligently 
to reform the tax act of Canada. I hope the member today is not 
symbolic of the whole spirit of the Reform Party, that it has 
deserted its campaign on comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to confirm for the hon. 
parliamentary secretary that no, we have not abandoned or given 
up in any way, shape or form our desire to reform income tax.
<P>
	We would not stop there of course. We want to reform many 
more programs, far beyond just the income tax system. We 
include elimination of subsidies to special interest groups, 
reform of the pension plan for members of Parliament, 
downsizing government, downsizing subsidies to crown 
corporations, bringing in competition to ensure that we have 
effective and efficient government. Why stop at just reforming 
the tax system? The whole system needs reforming from top to 
bottom.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the Minister of Human 
Resources Development's plan as being not a fait accompli. My 
goodness, he did not even get started, beyond saying there is a 
problem. We have said in our motion today that we are looking 
for a vision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very rare that as Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance I actually want to jump to 
my feet to participate in a debate. After listening to the first half 
hour of debate, we have to bring a little intelligence and hard 
work to this debate, with the exception of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry whose interventions were 
both intelligent and thoughtful.
<P>
	There is an obligation in the House of Commons when we 
have these debates that the opposition brings to bear a different 
perspective than that of the government and does it through 
research, through common sense and through bringing to the 
attention of the House the concerns of their constituents.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	I happen to know the city of St. Albert and I know how 
intelligent its voters are. The member who preceded this 
member is a very intelligent person from the Conservative Party 
and a very wise man. I am sure the people of St. Albert would 
want their member to bring to the House some facts and figures 
to support their case and not just sitting here and talking.
<P>
	My hon. colleague behind me from Peterborough can tell the 
House, as he too, like myself, taught at a university. From our 
history departments, we all know that if we do not learn history 
we repeat the same mistakes of an earlier generation. In fact, the 
opposition is repeating so many mistakes that the former Prime 
Minister from Alberta was quoted in the papers this morning as 
saying that he thinks it will be quite easy for the Conservative 
Party to come back. When a party of one person or two people 
think they can overtake the new opposition it just shows 
everyone how weak they think it is let alone how we think it is.
<P>
	Does the parliamentary secretary realize that this is the first 
opposition day offered up by the Reform Party since we have 
come back this year?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> It is the first one you gave us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> What topic do they choose? They choose the 
financial structure and budgeting process of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> That is what Canadians choose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> What is the great strength of this government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> You tell us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> It is the financial structure, the reorganization 
of the government, the production of an excellent first budget 
and, for the first time in the history of any government, the 
production of a prebudget process with documents from the 
Minister of Finance to show Canadians exactly what we have to 
do to get ourselves reorganized.
<P>
	On our anniversary date they give us our strong hand to talk 
about it. Thank you very much, team. This is exactly what we 
need.
<P>
	Let me just talk about some of the things that we have done for 
the last year. In this very instructive book called ``The First 
Eight Months of the Liberal Government-Promises Made, 
Promises Kept'', 43 areas are mentioned in which we said before 
the election we would proceed. These areas range from fairer 
taxes, federal-provincial fiscal arrangements, GATT, the goods 
and services tax, job creation, North American free trade, 
prebudget consultation, reducing the deficit, removing 
interprovincial trade barriers, child support payments, literacy 
initiatives, social security reform, unemployment insurance, 
youth employment and learning strategy, the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy, building Canada's infrastructure, Canadian 
space program, protecting fish stocks, the reintroduction of the 
residential rehabilitation assistance program, the science and 
technology review, supporting small and medium sized 
businesses, the commissioner of the environment and 
sustainable development, international leadership, protecting 
Canada's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7150"> 7150 </A></B>
<P>
wildlife, the end of tobacco smuggling, the enhancement of 
Canadian cultural identity-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> It's like talking to a divorce lawyer. You 
have done nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, in this document are the most 
amazing facts about how the government has worked hard in the 
first year.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> In category after category we have set out a plan 
of action which opposition parties, not only in Canada but 
anywhere in a democratic society, would ask how these guys 
accomplished so much so quickly. I would say that it is through 
the hard work of the Prime Minister. He has set the standard for 
the rest of the caucus and we have proceeded to work on our 
plans.
<P>
	The motion today asks us to move toward a balanced budget 
immediately. I would say to the Reform Party that everyone in 
the House, I think, and judging from what happened in the 
finance committee, is absolutely committed to making sure that 
we get our House in order. There should be no doubt about it. 
The Bloc has said the same. The Reform Party has said the same. 
Therefore, the question becomes one of how do we do it. What is 
the best topic? What is the best strategy? That is where I return 
to the organized strategy of the government.
<P>
	We set out in our first budget certain objectives of how to 
manage the deficit. We are right on course. The Minister of 
Finance has said on several occasions that we will meet our 
target each and every year. The critical issue facing Canadians 
after the last 10 years of government has been the complete lack 
of credibility in the financing of the country. We have proceeded 
to deal with the issue of credibility.
<P>
	I am very proud to be working with the Minister of Finance 
who has in every statement systematically re-established a 
credible framework for the governing of the country and putting 
our financial House in order. The strategy was reaffirmed last 
week in our economic and fiscal update. This important paper 
set the parameters for a public budget consultation that is both 
unprecedented and fundamental to fostering economic growth 
and jobs.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Let me remind the opposition that when the Minister of 
Finance spoke to the House committee on finance he zeroed in 
on our fiscal challenge. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Facing up to the debt challenge is the keystone of responsible economic 
policy. If we fail at that, we fail at everything else. It is not a question of focusing 
on jobs or the debt. It is a question of focusing on both.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From time to time we hear the opposition party taunting. We 
have asked the opposition parties on several occasions to give us 
some ideas, to help us out with this very difficult process. There 
are going to be tremendous tradeoffs. There are going to be a lot 
of people hurt in the process. The purpose of government is not 
to hurt Canadians. It is not the fault of the poor that we are 
bankrupt. It is not the fault of the elderly that we are  bankrupt. It 
is the fault of government after government which has refused to 
deal with the fiscal crisis.
<P>
	It is a question of fair taxes. We set out that we would deal 
with fairer taxes. We started out by dealing with the $100,000 
capital gains exemption. The corporate income tax deduction 
and the GST tax credit for meal and entertainment expenses 
were reduced from 80 per cent to 50 per cent. Large private 
corporations with capital over $15 million are no longer eligible 
for the small business deduction.
<P>
	New measures will prevent Canadian based companies from 
using foreign affiliates to avoid paying Canadian taxes. We will 
ensure that the income from securities held by financial 
institutions is measured appropriately for tax purposes. 
Corporate tax rules relating to tax shelters, research and 
development incentives, debt forgiveness and asset sales are 
tightened.
<P>
	The first $25,000 of life insurance benefits provided by 
employers will no longer be tax exempt. The threshold for the 29 
per cent tax credit on charitable donations is lowered from $250 
to $200. The age tax credit for hiring seniors will be 
progressively reduced over the next two years. The taxation of 
family trust, a very difficult issue in which I know the Bloc has a 
particular interest, has been reviewed by the House of Commons 
finance committee. We know there will be positive 
recommendations for change coming out of that.
<P>
	The difference is that we have our facts and we have organized 
a program to achieve success. We are not just rambling on. We 
are not just using up the time of the House of Commons for 
polemics and rhetoric. There is a real job to be done.
<P>
	At the time of the first anniversary of the last 
government-and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Industry was there-there was no reason to celebrate. It had 
not kept its promises from 1984, let alone the promises from 
1988. It was met with dull silences. Its members wore little 
flowers to promote the Prime Minister, but what did that mean in 
terms of substance? It meant absolutely nothing.
<P>
	There can be no doubt about our commitment to meeting the 3 
per cent deficit target we have set out for 1996-97. There should 
be no question that this is a vital first step forward toward an 
ultimate goal: a balanced budget.
<P>
	I am sure the House needs no reminder of the price Canadians 
are paying for decades of surging deficits and debt. It is 
measured in higher taxes, high interest rates, too few new jobs 
and too little growth. We have started out on the deficit 
reduction track to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP in 
three years. Canadians should understand why that 3 per cent 
target is so important. In the words of the Minister of Finance, 
we will reach that target come hell or high water.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7151"> 7151 </A></B>
<P>
	Reaching that level will mark a turning point in the battle 
against the debt. It will mean that the economy will be growing 
faster than the debt. In other words the debt will finally begin to 
shrink in relation to Canada's economy. This will be happening 
only for the second time in more than two decades.
<P>
	We can look at the issue in another way. The federal deficit 
currently near 6 per cent of GDP has not been as low as 3 per cent 
since 1974-75. There is another point that is just as important to 
emphasize. It underscores why it is better to move ahead by 
concrete steps than to issue wishful, long term plans for deficit 
elimination. Setting firm deficit targets for the near future 
represents a major change from the past.
<P>
	Because Canadians have become cynics about federal 
deficits, because they have suffered too many years or rosy long 
term promises, we have set out realistic targets and will take the 
actions needed to deliver bottom line results. Our success will 
strengthen credibility for our long term objective: eliminating 
the deficit completely.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	This strategy is based on fundamental, political and public 
reality. We believe it is best to set out short term targets, 
concrete milestones and hit them. With short term targets there 
is no excuse for delay and no acceptable grounds for not taking 
tough action to address the problem. When unrealistic long term 
goals are set, we can always find a reason to avoid tough action 
today, tomorrow and the tomorrow after. That was the Tory 
record and it is a legacy we refuse to accept.
<P>
	I want to highlight another aspect of the political and public 
reality of deficit fighting. The previous government believed in 
imposed solutions that did not draw upon real national 
discussion and consensus. Now it is Reform that looks for 
instant slash and mash solutions.
<P>
	Our government is a national government committed to 
democratic principles of openness, access and consultation. It is 
those principles at work that govern our approach to winning the 
deficit battle. The Minister of Finance made that point clear 
when he addressed the House of Commons finance committee. I 
quote the minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During our first round of prebudget consultations, Canadians told us they 
wanted clear targets to which they could hold the government accountable. We 
have provided those milestones.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians can now judge if we keep our word. That is why our target is not 
cast ahead into the fog of some far off future. It is only two years away.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That is why we have set year by year milestones on the way to that target-so 
that we can be held to account. That is why we have used very prudent 
assumptions in determining how our targets can be met. And that is how we will 
restore confidence in the financial credibility of the Government of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are not just words. It is a formal pledge. That is why we 
took several concrete actions in the last budget and that is why 
we have achieved our targets.
<P>
	Several issues are still confronting the government. For 
example interest rates, triggered by the U.S. federal reserve 
fight against inflation and compounded by worries about 
Canada's fiscal burden and the Quebec situation, are much 
higher than anyone expected. Because of the size of our debt 
even small changes in interest rates have mammoth effects on 
our carrying costs.
<P>
	The fiscal update sets out the dimension of the challenge we 
face under different and increasingly prudent interest rate 
assumptions. Based on the current outlook and the average of 
private sector forecasts we would still need an additional deficit 
action of $2.3 billion in 1995-96 and $5 billion the year after.
<P>
	If we assume interest rates that are half a percentage point 
above the average private sector forecast without any new 
budget action, we risk falling short by $3.1 billion of our target 
next year and by $6.3 billion in 1996-97. The numbers are even 
worse if we assume interest rates a full percentage point above 
the average forecast and growth that is half a percentage point 
lower. Then the deficit could be $5 billion above our target next 
year and $9 billion off the target in 1996-97. The combination of 
high interest rates and a large debt poses a major challenge.
<P>
	In the discussion in the finance committee last week the 
Minister of Finance indicated several principles. First, the 
deficit reduction must be part of a strategy to create jobs from 
growth. Second, the actions must be fair, making sure that the 
most vulnerable are not left behind. Third, deficit reduction 
measures must be selective and strategic reflecting clear 
priorities. Fourth, we must be frugal with taxpayers' dollars 
and, finally, budget action should weigh on the side of cuts and 
spending rather than increases in revenue.
<P>
	As we seek these reductions we should keep another thing in 
mind, another lesson from the past. Under the previous 
government the problem was not the 10 or 15 per cent that was 
lopped off in each year's last minute frenzy. Rather the problem 
was that no one paid attention to doing better with the remaining 
funds. We will not make that mistake. Canadians do not expect 
smaller government. They demand smarter government. That is 
why the Minister of Finance went to the finance committee last 
week.
<P>
	I want to take a minute to explain the significance of this 
action. Under Standing Order 83(1), accepted by all members of 
the House last spring, the government committed itself to the 
first prebudget review in the history of any western democracy, 
particularly in the parliamentary system. It has not been done in 
Britain. It has not been done in Germany. The American model 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7152"> 7152 </A></B>
<P>
is much different. It has been tried in selective ways in the 
provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	We want to have Canadians involved to understand how 
difficult some of the choices in front of us might be. There is the 
law of unintended consequences that we learn when studying 
history wherein we do one thing and have a number of side 
effects that we did not want. We want Canadians to get into 
active discussion with us about what those tradeoffs might be.
<P>
	We have presented a two part plan for creating jobs, for the 
reorganization of the government and for the establishment of 
new priorities. When the Minister of Finance was before the 
committee he raised three questions he wanted the committee to 
look at. First, are the economic assumptions for growth and 
interest rates appropriate? Second, what should be the balance 
between cuts in spending and measures to raise revenues? Third, 
what specific actions should be recommended? We want to 
move away from the scenario of not in my backyard.
<P>
	I am sure members of the House hear the reactions, for 
example to the social security review. People are saying that we 
should not touch a particular program, not even discuss it. When 
we move into financing the country we cannot have little 
cubbyholes or little special tax situations that we cannot talk 
about. We want everything on the table.
<P>
	We want opposition members to participate in the round table 
discussions we are to have across Canada. We want to hear their 
suggestions. When we report back to the House in December we 
want all members of the House of Commons to have an 
opportunity to make their own contributions. In late December 
and in January when the serious work on the budget begins to 
take a shape the Minister of Finance can look at the report of the 
House of Commons finance committee, thank Canadians for 
their support and thank the House of Commons committee for 
organizing their comments in a constructive fashion.
<P>
	It is not an easy process. I thank members of the Reform Party 
for bringing these issues to the attention of the House. I wish 
they would be able to contribute a little more positively. Perhaps 
other speakers during the afternoon will go back to their 
research bureau and say that the parliamentary secretary for 
finance was correct. We do need some more ideas. Let us sit 
down, maybe for the first time. I do not know how that party 
works but let us sit down, take a look at the problems facing the 
country, and use the time of the House of Commons effectively.
<P>
	One of the great frustrations of Canadians watching the 
parliamentary channel is how many people are really 
contributing ideas. In our platform for the last year, the 43 areas 
in which we have taken initiative and the nine tax changes I 
think we provided a very specific idea. I see the lead critic for 
the Bloc Quebecois is beginning to warm up for his contribution. 
We will listen for his specific ideas.
<P>
	We have in front of us an opportunity to debate and to present 
ideas on reduction. I know the Bloc has changed its views in the 
last couple of weeks and is now on the bandwagon. It is nice to 
have Bloc members aboard. We will look for specific 
suggestions. When it came to certain budget measures in the last 
budget-and it was difficult-Bloc members were on their feet 
in the House complaining about this cutback and that cutback. It 
would be good to have them understanding that in the overall 
framework everyone has to pay a price and everybody has to 
contribute in re-establishing the physical health of the country.
<P>
	In conclusion I thank the House for the opportunity to 
participate today and for the opportunity to put forward some of 
the areas in which we have made major accomplishments. I look 
forward to the contributions of my colleagues on this side and 
my colleagues on the other side. Through questions and answers 
and good debate we will have a better idea of how to put the 
country back together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the dissertation of the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. He is a 
very influential person within the finance committee. He sits at 
the right hand of the Minister of Finance. Would this not then set 
fear into the hearts of the innocent when they wonder where is 
the plan?
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not like these people came here yesterday. They were in 
opposition for nine years. They were the architects of the 
disaster we are living in today trying to get elected 35 years ago. 
They have had one year of power and what have they 
accomplished? Absolutely nothing.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance stands 
there and says: ``Well, what are your ideas? You are trying to 
smoke us out''. They are going to get our ideas in black and 
white but they are going to get them after they finally put theirs 
on paper, finally.
<P>
	What we have here are the Liberals in a new olympic Liberal 
sport: low hurdles. You set the hurdle low enough and you can 
crawl over it, which is about what they are doing. They are not 
going to wear themselves out jumping over high hurdles; they 
are going to wear themselves out tripping over low hurdles.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary who has given us a litany of 
the 47 things they have consulted on so far to tell me one specific 
thing they have accomplished. Not the 47 they have talked 
about, just one they have accomplished.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7153"> 7153 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, the willingness of the Reform 
Party to give me an opportunity to expand on our good activities 
for the last year is exceptional. I appreciate the goodwill with 
which these questions are lobbed toward me.
<P>
	Where do you start? You start with what we-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Where do you start?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> I appreciate the inexperience of the Reform 
Party members in the House but it is still no excuse for not 
having any ideas on the table. They are adults and they should be 
able to participate.
<P>
	Let us just talk about the infrastructure program. Let us talk 
about the way Canadians finally had a government that said: 
``You people need to get back to work. What we are going to do 
is we are going to start this project''. In a classic Liberal fashion 
which I am very proud of we started out with a number of 
projects across this country-and you are smiling-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Spending other people's money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Do you know what they do not talk about in the 
House? Have they ever asked a question about Alberta projects 
in question period? They just say silent. Why? Because they 
understand that for Albertans the only piece of good news from 
any government is what this government is doing on 
infrastructure. It has not come from the provincial government. 
It has not come from this opposition party. The only good news 
has come from the minister of energy and her colleagues who 
work very hard for the province of Alberta. The best evidence of 
that is in infrastructure.
<P>
	I know that in Winnipeg-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Liberal road kill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Liberal road kill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. In this-I do not 
know if I dare call it-I will just say it is the first anniversary 
and leave it at that.
<P>
	Clearly, we want to continue what we have established over 
this first year as parliamentarians from both sides of the House 
and that is a respectful way of conducting debate, vigorously 
and sometimes more animated than others. Ultimately however 
we do want to retain decorum and respect for one another and for 
this great institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I share your respect for this 
institution. I apologize to you and to members of the House if 
my animation toward the good infrastructure program seemed to 
be-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You could not help it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> It is hard not to get excited by this program.
<P>
	I come from Winnipeg and quite frankly mine is one of the 
poorer constituencies in the country. Last summer is the first 
time since I was elected to this House that anybody has come up 
and thanked me that they had an opportunity to work.
<P>
	Some people are snobbish about building roads, but there are 
a lot of people in this country who work building roads and they 
need those jobs. There are a lot of people who drive cars and 
buses over those roads. There is nothing to be ashamed of for 
creating a better infrastructure.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry stays 
on top of all these issues. He points out that in Winnipeg we are 
going to be rebuilding the road system which allows trucks to 
exit from the airport more quickly to the south. Part of our 
overall plan to rebuild the Manitoba economy is around the 
airport and transportation. We used to be the gateway to the west 
but that economy has changed. We are now going to be the 
gateway to the south.
<P>
	You cannot walk away from the project. It requires capital. It 
requires investment. The minister for human resources, who is 
responsible for western Canada and Manitoba, came forward to 
the provincial and municipal governments. Their response was: 
``Thank you for putting this together. Thank you for giving us 
the opportunity. We will throw in some money. We think it is 
important. Yes, we know it is borrowing money and we know 
this is expensive, but sooner or later people want to see their 
governments do something for them''.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	When I passed by people working this summer one came up to 
me and said: ``Mr. Walker, I have been in Canada for 15 years. I 
am a little embarrassed. I am still just a road construction guy. 
My kids are going to college. However, I am working this year''. 
It is important to him. He is not going to be doing anything else, 
but he is going to be working.
<P>
	The cultural community in Winnipeg which is so important 
does not have the capital. However we came up and said: ``We 
are going to help your fund raising effort. We are going to put 
some money into this. You go to the provincial and municipal 
governments and the private sector. Let us see if we cannot 
rebuild your facility. Let us see if we cannot build it up for the 
first time in a decade''. From the looks on their faces it was 
apparent we were doing something so they might have an 
opportunity. I can only say this with passion. It must be 
understood that the relationship between Canadians and their 
governments requires governments to act on their behalf. There 
are some very needy people who need our response.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7154"> 7154 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, It is interesting to listen to the hon. parliamentary 
secretary. I would encourage him not to break his arm patting 
himself on the back however.
<P>
	On this first anniversary I find it interesting that the Liberals 
come to the House of Commons saying: ``Give us your ideas''. 
After being in opposition for eight years and burning to take 
power with all they had to offer the country, they end up asking: 
``Well, what are your ideas?''.
<P>
	I find the credit they take for the infrastructure project 
interesting. This project will add $6 billion or $8 billion to the 
debt. It will provide jobs for a few months which our children 
will end up paying for. I find this very interesting.
<P>
	The question on my mind is with regard to the consultation 
process. Two of these processes are taking place right now, one 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development and the other 
by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The first consultation I mentioned is one for which Canadians 
are asked to give the government their ideas, but it is a process 
that makes it extremely difficult for Canadians to take part. 
After the minister's announcement they were given until 
September 7 to get their briefs in. This was after applying for the 
information on the proper procedure to follow.
<P>
	As far as the people of British Columbia are concerned, these 
consultations are being held November 16 and 17. It seems to be 
a very short timeframe for filing briefs, one that is impossible 
for anyone but the special interest groups who already have their 
briefs in. As a result, members of Parliament are having to 
gather the information, take it out to their ridings and perhaps 
return it to the minister.
<P>
	With regard to the consultation process with the Minister of 
Finance, it seems to be much more an exercise in rubbing 
people's noses in the mess that has been caused by previous 
governments over the past 25 years, to soften them up for the 
process of what is to take place. I really question whether 
consultation is being required as much as preparing people for 
the onslaught of what is to come.
<P>
	The Reform Party provided a program during the election 
campaign a year ago in which by focusing resources upon those 
people most in need we would be able to eliminate the deficit in 
three years. This would be done without the harsh consequences 
the Liberals keep trying to portray us as bringing onto the 
country.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask the hon. parliamentary 
secretary is when will the Liberals really take seriously the 
process of consultation and open the doors for Canadians as well 
as opposition members to provide the ideas they keep calling 
for?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, first the addition of a $6 billion 
debt to the country is simply Reform Party arithmetic and has 
nothing to do with the substance of what happened.
<P>
	On the question of consultation, if for some reason the 
member thinks the public is not being given a chance to be 
heard, I would ask the member why he did not read his House of 
Commons order book? That order and the description of the 
consultation process has been on the books for nine months. It is 
clear to everyone who is a concerned parliamentarian how the 
process is going to work. I can assure him on behalf of the 
Minister of Finance that everyone who wants to be heard will be 
heard. He might also be interested to know that next week when

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleagues from the Reform Party for 
providing an opportunity to return again to the topic of public 
finances and to discuss a motion they introduced today 
concerning a detailed plan, or should I say the lack of a detailed 
plan, to be tabled by the federal government outlining its 
approach to the budget.
<P>
	In contrast to my Reform colleagues, I would say that there is 
most definitely a plan and that it has been in place since last 
February 22 when the Liberal government tabled its first budget. 
If we are to believe the initial measures introduced by the 
federal government at that time, and if we are also to believe the 
various measures it has introduced and the numerous proposals 
it has made since then, this plan consists in slashing benefits to 
the very people in Quebec and in Canada who can least afford to 
do without them-the unemployed, recipients of social 
assistance, those with health problems and senior citizens as 
well.
<P>
	There is clearly a plan, a very detailed and specific plan, to 
transfer the financial problems of the Canadian government 
onto the backs of those who least deserve them, who certainly do 
not deserve the insult of being abandoned by a government that 
won the election on a campaign that emphasized the dignity of 
having a job, the dignity that we owed the least fortunate in our 
society. This is the very group of Canadians that the government 
is insulting today.
<P>
	What most struck me in the speech by the Minister of Finance 
was not the size of the deficit and of the debt; this is not news to 
us or to anyone else. We know that the federal government has 
been in the red, not just for one year but for ten. For ten years 
now, this government's approach to public finances has been 
building up to this impasse. I would remind the hon. members 
across the way that it was under a Liberal government that things 
first began to go badly. The deficit began to grow between 1970 
and 1985. And it was when the present Liberal Prime Minister 
was Minister of Finance that the financial problems started.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7155"> 7155 </A></B>
<P>
	Between 1970 and 1985 the deficit grew from 0.3 per cent of 
the Gross Domestic Product to 8.7 per cent. Fifteen years of 
Liberal rule led us to disaster. It is this legacy we are dealing 
with today. This Liberal legacy has led to drastic cuts-again, 
Liberal cuts-to solve the very serious public finance problem.
<P>
	I noticed that in his speech the Minister of Finance mentioned 
a serious matter, namely that the current problem is essentially a 
structural one. It means that even with ideal conditions for 
economic growth and employment development, the system is 
so tainted and its financial and economic impact so serious that 
Canada's unemployment rate can never go under 8.5 per cent 
and that the structural deficit-again, even in ideal economic 
growth conditions-will stay at a minimum of around $30 
billion year after year.
<P>
	The minister's response to these structural problems was to 
propose more cuts, which will not do anything to solve these 
structural problems because what is needed-as Quebec 
sovereignists, and the Bloc Quebecois in particular, 
understood-is a comprehensive reform of the system. 
Sovereignists have decided to get out of the vicious circle by 
reforming the system. This system is impossible to sustain. It is 
also impossible to reform because if that had been the case, the 
Liberals across the floor would have spent their first year in 
office trimming off the fat, reducing the bureaucratic structure, 
eliminating inefficiency, and decentralizing as much as possible 
by transferring to the provinces all levers of economic and 
social development.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Instead, they take drastic measures that hurt, that show their 
lack of compassion for and attack the unemployed without 
solving Canada's fundamental public finance problems.
<P>
	How much credibility can this government have, when all the 
commitments made by the Liberal Party of Canada during the 
election campaign are not being honoured? I will give you a few 
examples.
<P>
	In the last week of the election campaign, the current Prime 
Minister said that a Liberal government would never increase 
taxes in its first two years in office. What did the Minister of 
Finance present us with last week? The possibility of tax 
increases.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also said in this House that he did not rule 
out the possibility of tax increases this year. What credibility 
can this government have, when in less than ten months those 
people go back on the commitments about taxes that they made 
to the taxpayers of Quebec and Canada?
<P>
	What credibility can they have when the Prime Minister and 
all his ministers led Quebecers and Canadians to believe during 
the election campaign that they would abolish the GST? What 
have they done since then? Not only have they started to 
soft-pedal on the promise of abolishing it but they have tried to 
find an alternative to the GST in a sneaky, even dishonest way.  
Not abolishing the tax but an alternative that is as bad as the 
original tax and even worse in some respects. Month after 
month, they have tried to make the provinces, Quebecers and 
Canadians take it.
<P>
	What credibility can those people have? What credibility can 
the Minister of Finance have when he talks about the largest 
process of consultation ever undertaken by a federal 
government since Confederation? We had a consultation process 
before his budget was tabled: forums here and there and 
everywhere. I participated in those forums. Of course, a few 
representatives of organized labour and community 
organizations were invited to each of these forums, for the sake 
of appearances. Ultimately, what happened is that $5.5 billion 
was cut from unemployment insurance and $2 billion from 
funds allocated to the provinces.
<P>
	Who said to do that? Who presented such a recommendation 
in the pre-budget forums that year? No one. But those forums 
made the Minister of Finance look good. Again he will make 
himself look good by saying that he consulted Canadians and 
that they said to cut another $7.5 billion from post-secondary 
education, health and, once again, unemployment insurance. 
That is how the Minister of Finance consults.
<P>
	Who will believe in that? Who will believe in this desire for 
democracy expressed by the Minister of Finance and his 
government?
<P>
	I think that after a year of this government, Quebecers and 
Canadians are starting to realize that those people have lied to 
them and not told them the whole truth, that they are going back 
on their commitments and throwing them in the garbage. They 
are not inclined to keep the commitments which got them 
elected.
<P>
	Several months ago, I heard the Prime Minister refer to the 
unemployed and welfare recipients as lazy beer guzzlers who 
should go back to work. I understand why: the Liberals' detailed 
plan is to cut at the expense of the unemployed and the poorest 
people in society. That is the plan. Since the last budget came 
down, I have gone to my riding and met people who suffer as a 
result of the savage cuts this government has made to 
unemployment insurance, which force whole families onto 
welfare. Whole families are discouraged and depressed and 
have lost the dignity which the Prime Minister says they should 
have regained with his government.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I suggest to Liberal and Reform members that they go back to 
their ridings and talk to people affected by these cuts. I would 
advise them to go easy on slick rhetoric and go out, maybe once 
every couple of months, and meet some of these people in your 
ridings. It is important that these members go and talk those who 
suffer, and who will continue to suffer, because of them. I have 
met some of these people, as have my colleagues from the Bloc. 
I can tell you that I was deeply moved to see mothers rush to get 
social assistance when they had never contemplated such a-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Bleak reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> -bleak reality.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Liberal members are cynical to the point of 
putting words in my mouth to describe their own harmful 
actions to Quebec and Canadian families. It is terrible to see 
them behave like that!
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tabled an elaborate strategy to solve 
the problem of the deficit and the debt, a problem which 
everyone recognizes, but that strategy targeted the poorest in 
our society. Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois made detailed 
suggestions which respect the dignity of people, of the poor, of 
those who are looking for jobs but cannot find any, and of those 
who are depressed and who get even more depressed when they 
see the Liberal Party of Canada continue to make them pay a 
price which they should not have to pay. I did present these 
suggestions to the Minister of Finance and to those cynical 
members opposite.
<P>
	In fact, we presented an eight-point proposal to the 
government. The minister should stop saying that we only 
complain. We do make constructive suggestions which could 
allow us to recover over $12 billion in the first year alone, 
without making the plight of our poorest ones worse.
<P>
	For example, we suggested to the Minister of Finance and to 
the Liberals that the government should completely withdraw 
from fields which fall under provincial jurisdiction, instead of 
continuing to invest in those, as proposed in the Axworthy 
reform regarding education and health, but-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I simply want to point out, 
in the course of this vigorous debate, that hon. members should 
remember to refer to the minister by his title and not by name. I 
know it was an oversight, because the hon member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has acquired some not inconsiderable 
skills during his first year in the House. I simply wanted to 
remind him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. It was said in the heat 
of the debate. Everyone refers to this reform by the minister's 
name, so I forgot we were on the floor of the House and that 
ministers should not be referred to by name.
<P>
	Last week, we suggested to the Minister of Finance that the 
federal government withdraw from all areas of provincial 
jurisdiction and not, as is the case in the social security reform 
proposals presented by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, maintain and reinforce the federal government's 
involvement in areas that are the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
provinces, such as health care and education.
<P>
	Since in its discussions on relations between Quebec and the 
federal government, the Bélanger-Campeau Commission 
concluded that at least $2 billion could be saved by getting rid of 
all this duplication and overlap, I do not think it would be an 
exaggeration to say that at least $3 billion could be saved in the 
process. For a start, the government could do, as suggested by 
the Bloc Quebecois last June, and abolish the GST, give this tax 
space to the provinces and let them be responsible for 
introducing a consumer tax. As a result, hundreds of millions of 
dollars in GST administration costs could be recovered. Our 
second constructive suggestion for the minister was to cut many 
of the subsidies now being given to businesses. As you know, 
these subsidies represent a total of $3.3 billion. I am not saying 
they are all useless, but many are given as a form of patronage to 
businesses that are not efficient and not competitive, at a time 
when the stakes have changed as a result of globalization of 
world markets and international competition. There is a 
potential savings of $3.3 billion here for the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	The same goes for the defence budget. In its election 
platform, the Bloc Quebecois proposed a 25 per cent reduction 
in the National Defence budget. So far, we have seen a 10 per 
cent cut in the last budget, or $1.1 billion. We have other 
positive and constructive suggestions to allow the Minister of 
Finance to cut another $1.6 billion from the defence budget.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	According to all Quebec and Canadian experts we consulted, 
it is possible to get this extra 15 per cent without reducing or 
watering down the Canadian Forces mandate. Fourth, we asked 
the Minister of Finance to immediately stop government 
financing of Hibernia.
<P>
	A total of $3.3 billion has already been sunk into this project 
without any prospect of profits and without knowing when the 
first barrel of oil will be extracted. If I remember correctly, the 
price of a barrel of oil must reach $26US for the Hibernia project 
to merely get to the point where it is no longer losing money on 
every barrel of oil is extracted from this drilling rig, without 
considering past losses. This year alone, another $250 million 
will be sunk into this project. Next year, another $250 million or 
even $300 million could be spent on this project, according to 
the finance minister's projections, without any hope of 
profitability.
<P>
	How many more billions of dollars will the federal 
government sink into this project, when it is asking all 
Quebecers and Canadians, especially the poorest, to tighten 
their belts? Fifth suggestion, we asked the Minister of Finance 
to read again the last three reports from the auditor general, 
which reveal blatant carelessness, again, in government 
program management as well as a bureaucracy which-in some 
respects-is still overspending and wasteful in 1994, when we 
are told that public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7157"> 7157 </A></B>
<P>
finances must be brought under control and be more balanced 
over the next three years than they have  ever been. This is our 
fifth suggestion to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Sixth, we suggested that the Minister of Finance improve tax 
collection and tackle the recovery of bad debts. The auditor 
General says that there is $6 billion to pick up here. This amount 
of $6 billion does not even include contested debts. This is $6 
billion that the federal government could get, but because of its 
laxity, we have a deliberate shortfall of over $6 billion this year.
<P>
	The same goes for our seventh suggestion to the Minister of 
Finance and, strangely enough, these suggestions do not appear 
in his documents. We asked him to reform the Canadian tax 
system, but not by cutting the age credit, not by taxing RRSPs, 
not by attacking the middle class and the poor; we asked him to 
eliminate undue advantages for family trusts which benefit 
wealthy Canadians. I would recall a rather significant statistic. 
Ernst and Young surveyed 121 trusts-we only have surveys to 
go on because the Department of Finance and the Department of 
Revenue do not want to do a comprehensive analysis of family 
trusts-and I will give you some figures about them.
<P>
	The average value of the assets in 121 trusts was $47 million. 
These are not family trusts for middle-income or high-income 
people, according to our own definition; these are $47 million in 
assets belonging to very rich Canadians. These family trusts 
held up to half a billion dollars. Indeed, that was the amount held 
in Trust No. 121 in the sample, which was the highest one. Five 
hundred million dollars. Five hundred million dollars in a trust 
which, year after year, and possibly until the death of the last 
beneficiary, benefits from a tax exemption on capital gains. If 
this beneficiary is lucky and lives to the age of 84, he may 
benefit from this tax exemption until he is 80 years old, on 
capital and assets which may be in the millions of dollars.
<P>
	The same goes for tax conventions. We told the Minister of 
Finance but he is refuses to listen because he does not like the 
idea of targeting his friends, the friends of this government. We 
said that, even after the changes made to the taxation system last 
February, Canada still had tax conventions with 16 countries and 
these are considered to be tax havens.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The government loses hundreds of millions because Canadian 
corporations and very high income earners use these countries to 
avoid paying taxes. It is time to eliminate such loopholes and it 
is time this government realizes that it was not elected by major 
corporations or by those very rich Canadians who have family 
trusts with, on average, assets of $47 million and sometimes as 
much as half a billion dollars. It was elected by those people 
whom the government has been targeting since it took office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. 
member of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Just imagine for a minute that Quebec is a separate country. I 
would like to ask him what kind of system, what kind of tax 
reform he wants for Quebec? You referred to problems arising 
from Canada's complex system. I would like an answer to the 
following question: As far as tax reform is concerned, what kind 
of system would you have if you became a separate country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question 
reflects the tendency of these people to evade the issues. Today, 
the issue is not Quebec's sovereignty. We are talking about their 
government's budget process. We are talking about their 
government's inertia. We are talking about the flabby approach 
of the Minister of Finance, who has spent the past year-I want 
to say this because it is true-colouring the Conservatives' blue 
book purple because they are even more conservative than the 
Conservatives and telling us we are in the red.
<P>
	So the issue is the consultation process that is going on now. 
The issue is the measures this government is taking at the 
expense of the most vulnerable in our society. Sovereignty is not 
the issue.
<P>
	However, I would like to answer a small part of his question. 
Look at how the sovereignist movement has operated in Quebec 
for the past 30 years. It has not operated on the basis of a rightist 
philosophy, like our Reform Party friends have done since they 
were elected a year ago. It has not operated on the basis of a 
philosophy that is very close to the right, which is the approach 
being taken today by the Liberals. It has operated, from the 
outset, in accordance with the views of Mr. Lévesque. It has 
operated on the basis of a profoundly democratic society that is 
intent on the well-being of its most vulnerable members and 
that wants to provide for a fair distribution of our collective 
wealth, and I think that once Quebec is sovereign, we will have 
some really exciting projects.
<P>
	As soon as we get out of this system, we can go ahead with 
some very exciting projects to create full employment, increase 
our collective wealth and regional development and give people 
new hope and dignity. We will provide real projects to help 
people recover part of that dignity, without pretty speeches like 
the Prime Minister gave us when he referred to people who had 
lost that dignity as beer drinkers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
curious about a couple of comments made by the hon. member. 
One was with respect to business subsidies. He said that in many 
cases subsidies are made to businesses that are uncompetitive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7158"> 7158 </A></B>
<P>
	I guess he is implying that it is okay to make subsidies to 
businesses that are competitive. In that case, it is kind of 
redundant in my judgment. I have to wonder whether the 
member, given his remarks, can justify any subsidies to business 
at all.
<P>
	Is the hon. member so committed to deficit reduction that he 
would give up his MP's pension, should he ever be lucky enough 
to get that far, given the Bloc's stand? Would he go on record 
today saying that he is opposed to MPs pensions as they stand 
now, especially considering his stand on things like family 
trusts which he would argue confer special privilege?
<P>
	Obviously that is what MP pensions do. Let us hear what the 
member has to say on that issue.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, about the $3.3 billion budget for 
subsidies to business, during the year we have been here, we 
have asked the Minister of Finance to put everything on the table 
and allow a parliamentary committee to look at federal 
government spending in a very thorough and specific way. We 
have always included the $3.3 billion in subsidies to business, in 
order to scrutinize what type of subsidies were involved and who 
the beneficiaries were. Did they really have a structural impact 
on the economy enabling us to face the challenges of 
internationalization and international competition?
<P>
	We never received a reply from the minister in this regard. 
But, as you said, logic dictates that a normally competitive 
business should not need subsidies. However, we are now faced 
with radical economic changes.
<P>
	The mere fact that the latest GATT agreement signed last 
December will bring about tariff reductions of about 75 per cent 
over the next six years is already a lot to deal with.
<P>
	Although tariffs between the most industrialized countries 
already averaged five or six per cent, it still makes a difference, 
especially when, according to most experts, the value of the 
Canadian dollar remains very high despite some drops in recent 
months.
<P>
	We are again in a situation where the slightest tariff protection 
can compensate for the fact that Canadian businesses are not as 
competitive, probably in part because of the Canadian dollar.
<P>
	I submit to you that a normal, competitive business should not 
be subsidized. Often, all these subsidies to business do is 
generate competition between Quebec or Canadian firms 
because one received a subsidy while the other did not. I think 
that this system must be totally revised. I would say to you that 
most of this $3.3 billion should go.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to return to my opening question. The member who is the 
finance critic for Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition criticized 
some of the areas in the tax design with which he did not agree. 
By the way, I share his views in a couple of the areas.
<P>
	However, he is here to lead his province out of Confederation. 
He stated that in his speech. That is his democratic right, but 
Quebecers and Canadians would like to know what type of tax 
regime, tax design, tax system Quebecers will have in this new 
country that they are designing?
<P>
	It is very important for the member, who has this lead role, to 
tell Quebecers what this system is. We would also like to know 
what this system is because it might contain a couple of ideas we 
could implement now. Specifically, what will the tax regime 
look like in this separate Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we would have a normal tax 
system for a normal modern industrialized country. We would 
surely have a more equitable system that would not favour only 
the very, very, very high incomes. I am not talking about high 
incomes in the definition we have. I just gave you the example of 
family trusts, with an average of $47 million in assets and as 
much as half a billion. It is not right that these people pay no 
capital gains tax year after year for 80 years.
<P>
	As we have shown from the beginning, sovereignists care 
about tax fairness, and I suppose that in a sovereign Quebec such 
treatment would be called into question. The same goes for the 
3,400 Canadians who did not pay a cent of income tax to the 
federal treasury last year, even though they had a very high 
income. I think that we would also try to correct that effectively.
<P>
	I would remind you-I know that I have only a minute 
left-and you will tell me that it is not related to the question, 
but it is related to the question, quite a bit in fact; I would remind 
you that sovereignists care about the collective well-being. We 
have also shown that we want to reduce the contribution of big 
corporations and big lobby groups to the financing of political 
parties as much as possible. That is why the Parti Quebecois, 
just as the Bloc Quebecois, is financed by the people.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	That is why a sovereignist government in Quebec, unlike the 
Liberal government in Ottawa, is not subject to undue pressure 
and influenced by gifts, in some cases, from lobbyists for very 
rich Canadian families with assets of $47 million to half a 
billion that are not taxed for 80 years.
<P>
	This already gives us a good idea that the prime concern of a 
sovereign Quebec will be the majority of the people, not an elite 
who provides the funding, as it does for the Liberal Party of 
Canada, so that this government  has its hands tied and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7159"> 7159 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of Finance does not put the real tax loopholes in his 
paper but goes after the tax breaks affecting middle- and 
low-income people.
<P>
	So this gives you some idea of what sovereignty would mean 
for us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of the whip of our party and pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), 
Reform speakers will be dividing their time.
<P>
	In speaking to the resolution before us, presented by my 
colleague from St. Albert, we must recognize its focus and 
concern. The major focus is a request that the government look 
at balancing the budget. Instead of meeting targets that leave 
major deficits, it must look at balancing the budget and bringing 
the deficit to zero. That is what we are focusing on today, 
indicating to the government that there is some urgency in 
working toward that kind of target.
<P>
	The other thing we make reference to in this resolution is a 
plan which the government could implement. We are requesting 
the government not hide behind the 3 per cent that it set for 
Canadians, that it will reach supposedly and hopefully in three 
years. We are saying it is owed to Canadians that we should go 
further, that the red book plan should be extended to a point at 
which it details and outlines programs within departments, the 
priorities which will be set with regard to social spending, the 
projections with regard to growth in the economy that will move 
us to the most important target, balancing the budget.
<P>
	No government can sit and wait beyond one term to reach 
necessary objectives. The way the government is moving at the 
present time it is saying to Canadians: ``We are going to leave 
you at the end of our term with at least a deficit of $25 billion''. 
It wants to go back to the people at that point and say: ``We did 
our job. We reached our 3 per cent''. That is hiding behind the 
real problem, which is a truth that must be revealed. I hope the 
discussion on this resolution today reveals some of that truth.
<P>
	Today is the anniversary of all of us being elected to the House 
of Commons. At this point we all have more confidence as to our 
purpose, our focus and the reason we are here. As finance critic, 
I have been given the responsibility of dealing with the finances 
and the budget of Canada.
<P>
	One of the motivations and the reason I left my 
responsibilities in the Alberta government, moved to seek the 
nomination for the Reform Party, got elected and came to the 
House of Commons was a very focused purpose. When I lived in 
the city of Edmonton a number of young people from the 
University of Alberta were in my home day in and day out. 
Those young people were good, quality students with very 
excellent averages and tremendous abilities.
<P>
	They said to me day after day: ``We are going to get an 
education. We are going to be qualified to do something. But 
what is there out in the Canadian community that will offer us a 
chance to perform as we wish, to use our talents and our 
abilities? Will there be a job available?''.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I examined that discussion and thought about it. I said to those 
young people that I thought there was only one place where we 
could resolve the problem we have, that is in the House of 
Commons and in the federal political arena. That was one of the 
reasons for making the decision to come to this assembly. I am 
here now and I believe the job must be done.
<P>
	What do I believe? What do I believe is the secret or the road 
to dealing with the problem? Much of it is set out in the rhetoric 
and comments in the document presented in the finance 
committee called ``Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate''. A lot of 
good objectives are established by the Minister of Finance and 
the Government of Canada. They want to work toward balancing 
the budget. That is a good objective. They also say that some 
very immediate things must be done. They set out a relationship 
between bringing the deficit into line, bringing it to zero, 
dealing with the debt and balancing the budget. In turn if those 
things are dealt with they will bring about growth in the 
economy and job opportunities for Canadians.
<P>
	That is the sequence I agree with. I was very disappointed, I 
must say, with the red book plan of the government. In the 
campaign a year ago it was clearly stated by the candidate in my 
constituency, and I am sure by other Liberal candidates and 
those who were elected, that they were going to create jobs for 
Canadians. That is the wrong approach to job opportunity. 
Government cannot create jobs. It absolutely cannot create jobs.
<P>
	The government initiated a program of infrastructure for 
Canadian municipalities in a variety of jurisdictions in Canada. 
Certainly there were jobs made available to Canadians. Those 
jobs were short term, for six months, a year or maybe two years. 
They were jobs made available to Canadians. They were not jobs 
created by the economy that would be there for a long period of 
time, would be self-supporting and would be part of the private 
sector or the private economy of our country. If those kinds of 
jobs are created they are long term and will will benefit our 
country. Certainly the Government of Canada will benefit by 
increased revenues into its coffers to take on its responsibilities.
<P>
	In this term of office, between now and the next election, we 
have the opportunity to reach the goal of bringing the deficit to 
zero or near zero. The government must be more aggressive. I 
looked back on this year's performance of the Prime Minister 
and of the Minister of Finance. I thought about that last night 
and I asked myself how I could describe what they were doing. 
Why is it that the Prime Minister on his first anniversary is  high 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7160"> 7160 </A></B>
<P>
in the polls, at 60 to 70 per cent in terms of popularity? That is 
very high. Why is he so popular?
<P>
	If we re-examine what is being done there is not very much 
being done in Canada, not very much in terms of the 
government. There are a lot of studies, a lot of reviews and a lot 
of procrastination. The only concrete thing I can see is with 
regard to infrastructure. That was put forward by the minister. It 
is implemented and it is there.
<P>
	How do I describe it? We have what I would call sort of a pied 
piper syndrome in Canada at the present time. We have this 
popular leader who is leading us down the road while playing a 
beautiful piece of music. The people of Canada are saying: 
``Things are okay. It is all right. Things are going to work out''. 
A nice song is being sung but they are not focusing on the 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	The deficit is being ignored because of the comfort zone being 
given to Canadians by our Prime Minister and the Liberal 
government. Some day they will wake up to the fact that the pied 
piper is taking us down the road. I recall my father telling me the 
story many times. The pied piper led the children into the river 
and they all drowned. My father had another innovation where 
they went into a cave and a heavy rock rolled over its entrance 
and the kids were lost to the families of the town.
<P>
	The same thing is going to happen here. The people of Canada 
are being led down the road to where they will fall into the debt 
hole. We are going to have a crisis because we are going to fall 
into the debt hole and the government is not dealing with it. That 
was said in the document presented to the finance committee 
called ``Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate''. Page 25 of that 
document states very clearly what the circumstances are. This is 
the government's document. The Minister of Finance presented 
it to the committee on October 18, 1994.
<P>
	It says that by fiscal year end 1994-95 the net federal debt is 
expected to be $548 billion. It also says that if program spending 
remained roughly in balance with revenue, compound interest 
alone at today's average rate of about 8 per cent would cause the 
debt to grow by almost 50 per cent, to more than $800 billion 
within just five years. That is before the turn of the century, 
before the year 2000. It goes on to say that by then the annual 
interest payment would be about $64 billion or $20 billion more 
than this year's forecasted debt charges. Can we imagine $64 
billion out of the budget? Our budget now is $127 billion in 
terms of revenue, and $64 billion will be paid out of it. That is 
how serious it is.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is getting all the laurels, all the credit, but 
he is leading us into a debt hole and into a crisis. The 
government must come up with a plan and give the people of 
Canada some details on how we are to be led out of this grave 
and difficult situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make one short 
comment and then ask a question.
<P>
	I think the member is not being reasonable on the 
infrastructure program. During the establishment of 
infrastructure the job time might be for three, six or nine months 
but the actual completed infrastructure provides an 
environment. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance said, the new transport system from the airport in 
Winnipeg will be there for 30 or 40 years. It will allow for the 
economy in that sector to move forward in a more efficient and 
productive way in terms of exports to the southern United 
States.
<P>
	However I want to ask the member a question about the deficit 
and the debt. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance said in his remarks this morning, if our interest rates 
were to go up by half a point it would cause an added burden of 
approximately $3.5 billion in service charges. Obviously we 
have to create an environment where we can stabilize our 
interest rates and create a system that would put downward 
pressure on interest rates, which subsequently would allow us to 
have a lower cost in servicing the debt of the country.
<P>
	Does the finance critic for the Reform Party believe a tax 
system that is fair and promotes entrepreneurship could reverse 
capital flows that are currently leaving the country? By capital 
flows reversing and coming back to Canada a downward 
pressure could be put on interest rates. Does the finance critic 
believe that comprehensive tax reform could create that 
possibility?
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his questions.
<P>
	In terms of the infrastructure question that he raises, if a 
government must invest in some type of job opportunity or in 
some infrastructure project maybe jobs are created as a side 
benefit. However, if our country has good infrastructure such as 
roads, et cetera, the private economy has a good base from 
which to work. That is a very proper function for government 
and I agree with it.
<P>
	The point I was making with regard to infrastructure is that it 
is not the solution to the problem. It is very short term. It is not a 
long term solution. We cannot keep borrowing money and 
investing it. Somewhere the hole gets a little too deep and we get 
into trouble.
<P>
	I will deal with last question the hon. member raised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> With regard to 
the downward pressure on interest rates and tax reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7161"> 7161 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> A fairer tax system would 
have a reflection on interest rates. What has to go along with that 
is certainly the deficit reduction we are talking about to deal 
with confidence in our country.
<P>
	A number of investors in our country right now are looking at 
us. Those who judge our credit as a country are asking if we have 
dealt with the deficit and saying if we have not it looks like it is 
getting out of control. Then our interest rates go up and we have 
some problems. It is not only a proper tax system that deals with 
a rise in interest rates. It is certainly a question of whether the 
government has shown the will and dealt with the matter of the 
deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today to participate in debate 
on the motion brought forward by the Reform Party requesting 
that the government bring down a plan of action.
<P>
	I was going through my files today on this very subject and 
found a headline that caught my eye: ``Slashing the Deficit in 
Just Two Hours''. This was the heading of a column in the June 
13, 1994 edition of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine by Diane Francis. She 
has a plan. I might not agree with all the things in her plan, but at 
least there is a plan and there are topics that can be discussed.
<P>
	We are here today to find out some ideas and put some 
thoughts on the table about how we can reduce the deficit and the 
debt. As we all know politics is the art of possible. Let us try to 
make things possible by reducing the deficit and the debt. For 
far too many years the country has been living off its credit. Like 
other spendthrift debtors there comes a time when they finally 
have to pay the piper. They either quit spending more than they 
earn and begin to repay their debts, or the banks foreclose on 
their homes, seize their cars and they are bankrupt.
<P>
	The bank is getting ready to foreclose on our mortgage, to 
repossess our car and to cut up this nation's credit cards. Finally 
the country and its government have to wake up and face this 
reality. No longer can it be ignored. The finance minister has 
finally heard this message and I congratulate him for having the 
courage to admit it in his statement.
<P>
	The Reform Party was catapulted here one year ago by 
common sense Canadians. We have been trying to get this 
message across to the government from the first day of this 
Parliament. Decades of spendthrift management and extremely 
poor decisions have entrenched programs and attitudes that have 
led the nation to spend its birthright and mortgage its future. We 
must for our children's sake get this mess under control.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	The finance minister has said that each one of us must decide 
which government services we personally can do without. No 
longer can Canadians take refuge in the attitude that someone 
else can pay, that someone else's services can be cut. We must 
let Canadians prioritize our  spending, prioritize our programs, 
something again that the Reform Party and its members on this 
side of the House campaigned for rigorously during the last 
election.
<P>
	Governments have often sought to supply services through 
crown corporations because it was felt these were necessary, 
that these services could not be provided by the private sector. 
Perhaps at one time this was true. Perhaps there was justification 
for pouring funds from the public purse into these uneconomic 
businesses, but it is an expensive proposition and one that has 
stifled competition.
<P>
	This philosophy has also cost this country greatly in dollars 
and lost opportunities. Over the years crown corporations have 
contributed mightily to our monstrous national debt and high 
taxes which have stunted growth and discouraged innovation in 
this country. There comes a point when these crown 
corporations no longer fill any real need, when inertia is their 
prime reason for being. We can no longer afford this.
<P>
	Today we are a nation of some 28 million people. Times have 
changed. Our needs have changed. Yet still we ladle public 
money into ventures best left to the private sector and in the 
process we smother competition and eviscerate the 
entrepreneurial spirit. The people of this country have been led 
down a perilous path.
<P>
	The plain and simple fact is that goods and services are 
provided more efficiently, more effectively and with better 
quality by the private sector in a competitive environment. Why 
then do we still maintain crown corporations and agencies that 
meddle in the free marketplace on the strength of huge dollops 
of money from the public purse?
<P>
	Even at a time when there was justification for government 
owned broadcasters which gobble up close to $1.2 billion a year, 
how can it be justified today? For instance the CBC was created 
so that Canadian culture was sure not to be lost, but things have 
changed. Technology has changed. An example of that is the 
private cable companies.
<P>
	Private cable companies across this nation supply community 
access channels. In my own riding of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Shaw Cable provides 
access to a community channel for cultural programming, for 
interest groups to make programs. This is something we should 
look at. How can $1.2 billion a year to the CBC be justified? 
Would this money not be better spent on educating and training 
our youth so that they can have productive futures, so that they 
will have no need for expensive UI programs or welfare?
<P>
	We must set realistic priorities. We no longer have the luxury 
of wasting precious tax dollars on foolish spending. Of course 
the other side will criticize me by saying: ``The hon. member is 
saying he is just going to cut everything''. I want to make it very 
clear that is not what I am saying. I am saying that every single 
government department, agency, crown corporation and 
marketing board should be evaluated for its relevance in  today's 
economic climate. If the same function is or could be provided 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7162"> 7162 </A></B>
<P>
by the private sector, that government body should be disbanded 
immediately.
<P>
	Organizations such as the Canada Council defy common 
sense. When we are talking about shrinking funds for education 
and health care, how can we as responsible members of this 
place support any endeavour which is not necessary for the 
well-being of the people we represent, all Canadians?
<P>
	Last summer the Minister of Transport announced a move to 
place more of our transportation system in the hands of the 
private sector. This is a positive change which will benefit all 
Canadians. The minister has recognized the fact that these 
services can best be provided by the private sector. The people 
of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt have supported this 
concept in town hall meetings across my riding. As well the 
same thoughts were heard at every one of the government's 
prebudget consultations earlier this year.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	In the prairies farmers are demanding that the Canadian 
Wheat Board be reformed and that producers be given the 
opportunity to sell their grain to whomever they choose. One 
producer who operates a small milling operation with its head 
office in Penticton has detailed years of interference with his 
business by the wheat board. This interference has severely 
limited his opportunity.
<P>
	Let us explore this for a minute. The Canadian Wheat Board is 
an interesting topic. It is widely known that western Canada 
produces the world's best durum wheat. It is ideal for pasta 
products. I am not a farmer. I am a common type of person, but I 
must scratch my head in wonder. It would seem there is a 
tremendous opportunity in western Canada for someone to go 
into the pasta production business. It is also interesting to note 
that there is not one pasta producer in western Canada. Why is 
that? Let us look at some examples.
<P>
	North Dakota, which grows about as much durum wheat as the 
province of Saskatchewan in a good year, has four prosperous 
pasta operations. This House should know about a real success 
story for the North Dakota growers in the village of Carleton. 
They built a plant without any state or federal government 
assistance. They have the most modern equipment. It runs 24 
hours a day and has 240 employees. It processes 250 tonnes of 
wheat daily into highly valued privately packaged pasta 
products that are shipped all over the United States. There is 
more good news: expansion plans are under way.
<P>
	Why then does western Canada not have a pasta producer? In 
western Canada, durum growers owning their own mill would be 
in the same position as if they were trying to sell their wheat 
product independently. They would be forced to sell it to the 
Canadian Wheat Board at the board's prevailing initial price. 
Then their company would be forced to buy that wheat product 
back at the board's selling price.
<P>
	Durum wheat growers could not legally sell directly to their 
own company in this country, nor could their company buy their 
own wheat. It is just ridiculous. In other words, any benefit 
durum growers who are also the investors in the private 
company would have in the pasta plant would have to be shared 
among all the wheat producers in Canada.
<P>
	I am not saying that the Canadian Wheat Board is stifling 
competition in this country. Just a minute, maybe I am, but then 
again maybe I am not. What I am saying however is that we 
should put it on the table, discuss it and evaluate it. It appears 
this country is missing yet another golden opportunity.
<P>
	My time is running out so I will close by saying it seems that 
the national economics elude the test of common sense every 
family must face when handling their finances. Canada's 
deficits are not insurmountable. Canada's deficit and debt are 
merely symptoms of an inept and cowardly leadership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin by commenting on 
the last point the member made on creating a value added pasta 
plant for our durum wheat. The member has brought a new 
insight to me. I will give him an undertaking that I will take his 
point up with the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not know the issue well and there may be some technical 
points which make this not as easy as the member describes it. 
However, I think the member has raised a very insightful point. 
Any time we can create a value added opportunity with a 
resource like this we should look at it.
<P>
	This goes back to the point I wanted to make. In the last nine 
months this government has taken on a very thorough review of 
all crown corporations. If they do not meet the public policy 
objective that we all believe in then a lot of those crown 
corporations have had their budgets cut, some of them severely. 
It would be inappropriate to leave Canadians with the 
impression that we are not reviewing and evaluating all crown 
corporations.
<P>
	In fairness to the member, he did acknowledge that the 
Minister of Transport has done a very good job in 
commercializing all the airports in Canada, privatizing and 
offloading them to local authorities. Some would even argue 
that he is moving too fast. I know the Reform Party feels quite 
comfortable with that. However, I caution members opposite 
that when we are dealing with a complex department like 
transport, which traditionally has galvanized the spirit of this 
country and helps pull this country together because it deals 
with rail, transport and sea, before we just cut and offload it we 
have to make sure we are doing it in a manner that does not 
fracture the very fabric of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7163"> 7163 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments by the hon. 
member. Whenever we come up with value added ideas such as I 
have mentioned here today we should explore them at every 
possibility.
<P>
	There is a misconception on that side of the House of what the 
Reform Party is saying should be done. We have said this very 
clearly but it has fallen on deaf ears at times that the items 
Canadians feel are the most important should be prioritized. It 
should look like a balance sheet. I know the hon. member has 
spent many years in business. It is very similar to what someone 
would do in their own business when they found that their 
outflow of money was larger than what they were bringing in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> This is not a business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> The hon. member says that this is not a business. 
But Canadians are saying they want government to use common 
sense principles like the average person uses in Canadian 
society, whether it is in a business or whether it is when they are 
working out their family budget at home. These things have to 
be prioritized and then everything else should be put on the 
table.
<P>
	What the Reform Party has been saying is the items which 
should be saved and protected for all Canadians are things like 
the federal funding for the health care system, federal funding 
for the Canada pension plan and for old age security where it is 
directed to those people who are most in need. We are saying 
that funding should be maintained for those areas and possibly 
more if need be. We are saying that education funding is a 
priority in this country.
<P>
	There are about three or four items on the balance sheet that 
pertain particularly to things that should be saved. On the other 
side are the things that should be cut. Those things are the things 
we are talking about that are on the table.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, there is a 
housekeeping matter I would like to dispose of.
<P>
	I wish to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 
33(2)(b), because of an earlier ministerial statement 
Government Orders will be extended by 32 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak to this supply day motion. It 
allows me to review a very important policy paper concerning 
the government's economic strategy that the Minister of 
Finance presented to the Standing Committee on Finance just 
last week.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Obviously the member proposing today's motion must have 
been occupied elsewhere when the Minister of Finance tabled 
``A New Framework for Economic Policy'' on October 17. 
Perhaps the length of the document, 87 pages, was too much for 
him to absorb. He may still be waiting for the Cole's notes 
version. I know on their side of the House it is all about simple 
problems with simple solutions that pop into their heads, so they 
must be right.
<P>
	If I appear a little sarcastic, frankly that is the only reasonable 
response to a motion that calls for the government to table ``a 
clear statement of its vision of the role of government in the 
economy''. That comprehensive statement has already been 
tabled. It made headlines across the country.
<P>
	If the hon. member or any Canadian phones the distribution 
centre of the Department of Finance, the phone number is 
613-995-2855, a copy will be provided immediately.
<P>
	I suspect if the hon. member takes the time to study this 
document, which he has not apparently, he will appreciate its 
significance. Canadians have seen only too often what happens 
when a government implements policies without clear guiding 
principles. The result is like building a house without a 
blueprint. It is chaotic, it is costly and the roof leaks.
<P>
	Canadians deserve to know the principles which guide the 
Canadian government. That is why this government has set out 
the framework for the economic policies we intend to build 
upon. This paper, ``A New Framework for Economic Policy'', is 
a clear statement of objectives that will guide what the 
government will do and what it will not do. It provides the very 
vision that the hon. member wants Canadians to debate.
<P>
	Before I get into details, let me set the scene by describing the 
underlying principles of the framework. This government has 
one overriding goal: jobs and economic growth. While a strong 
economic recovery has taken hold, the fact remains that our 
unemployment rate is too high with Canadians paying a tragic 
price. That price includes lower government revenues and 
higher costs, problems that contribute directly to the deficit 
dilemma they are so concerned about and we are concerned 
about.
<P>
	Sound economic policy and good social policy are linked. 
Sustainable social programs depend on a sound economy. 
Canadians need more jobs and better jobs. Jobs create dignity 
and wealth and enable us to sustain our commitment to social 
justice.
<P>
	Common sense suggests, and the hon. member must agree, 
that a country that is to continue to care for its citizens must be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7164"> 7164 </A></B>
<P>
country that pays its bills. That means living within our means 
and creating jobs through economic growth.
<P>
	The fact is the logic and approaches of the 1960s simply are 
no longer good enough in a 21st century arena. We cannot afford 
them and we will not succeed with them. Previous generations 
responded to the challenge of their times by building the 
physical and social infrastructure of Canada. We have a similar 
challenge and our own responsibility to create the infrastructure 
for our times and for that of our children, the infrastructure of 
ideas and innovation.
<P>
	It is innovative combinations of people, capital and ideas 
which will place us at the cutting edge of economic change and 
growth. Working people harder and making government meaner 
is not the key. Working smarter and making government more 
effective is what Canadians want and need. To work better and 
smarter the very nature of government itself must change. The 
time is long past when governments can or should do 
everything.
<P>
	We need a partnership that gives responsibility to those who 
are best able and suited to do the job, be it government, business, 
labour or the volunteer sector. That requires a government that 
knows where its true potential lies and what its real limitations 
are.
<P>
	There is a difference between Liberals and the member who 
sponsored this motion. We believe government has a role to play 
as catalyst, as facilitator setting goals and monitoring 
performance. I believe government should get out of the way but 
not stand aside. That is Liberalism for the 1990s.
<P>
	Like countries everywhere Canada must adapt to the powerful 
trends that are shaping the global economy, the global financial 
market, the dynamic growth of economies in the Pacific rim and 
parts of Latin America, South America, and the impact of 
information technology. Each of these has dramatically 
increased the competitive stakes. The bottom line is clear, to 
become more competitive Canada must become more 
productive.
<P>
	Productivity is about how well ideas, workers, resources and 
investment are brought together in a country's economy. 
Productivity is about ingenuity, about better management, 
paying attention to the common sense of workers. Productivity 
growth is the basis for a better standard of living for every 
Canadian.
<P>
	Some Canadians fear that productivity is a code word for 
fewer jobs, greater hardship. They are mistaken. History shows 
the compelling relationship between productivity and 
employment. Between the fifties and early seventies 
productivity growth was high, averaging 2.3 per cent. During 
those decades unemployment was low and incomes rose at a 
steady pace. The picture changed from the seventies to the 
nineties. Productivity dropped by more than half, 
unemployment soared and the growth in incomes slowed to a 
virtual halt.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	How do we improve productivity? First, we improve skills. 
We must become more innovative and provide a welcoming 
climate for investment. We must remove the disincentives we 
have created for business and individuals, disincentives that 
hold us back because they encourage dependence or block 
opportunity.
<P>
	There is another critically important imperative for a more 
productive, prosperous Canada, as our framework paper 
emphasizes. We must get our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	Let me turn now to the objective for jobs and growth the 
government has set out in ``A New Framework for Economic 
Policy''. There are five key areas which we must focus on. I will 
be interested to hear if the hon. member opposes any one of 
them.
<P>
	The first is helping Canadians acquire skills, the skills to get 
jobs, keep jobs and find better jobs. The facts are clear. Jobs for 
people with high school education or less are shrinking while 
jobs for those with beyond high school education are growing. 
In fact projections show that almost half the new jobs created 
during the nineties will require more than 16 years of education 
and training combined.
<P>
	I should add that there is a particular element of this challenge 
that engages small business. They do not have the resources that 
large firms have to help employees acquire the new skills that 
the information age demands, much less basic abilities in 
literacy and numeracy. Small business depends on a public 
education system that is doing its job.
<P>
	In terms of education, the challenge in Canada is not money. 
We spend more on education than just about every other country. 
What we need are better results. Individuals, employers and 
government must co-operate and share responsibility in 
improving education and training.
<P>
	The second part of our framework is encouraging Canadians 
to adjust to change. Economic progress depends on a 
willingness to embrace new opportunities. It is our view that 
protecting and subsidizing business is almost always the wrong 
way to go. For that reason the government may change the entire 
approach to subsidies.
<P>
	Equally, we believe regional economic assistance should 
focus on genuine opportunities such as tourism that have great 
potential to be self-sustaining. Government should focus on 
winning industry sectors, not specific enterprises. Government 
has not been terribly good at picking individual winners.
<P>
	At the individual level the existing unemployment insurance 
program must be changed. It is bad economic policy today and 
bad social policy. We intend to take measures to bring it back to 
what it was, insurance, and to create programs that foster job 
readiness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7165"> 7165 </A></B>
<P>
	Further, we believe high payroll taxes are nothing more than a 
tax on hiring. We have taken steps to reduce UI premiums and 
will do more in the future.
<P>
	The third element of our framework is getting government 
right. Our attitude is straightforward. It is time to make choices. 
We must eliminate or reduce lower priority activities and target 
scarce resources to the highest priority programs, helping those 
in need, ensuring that people get the training and the 
opportunities they require.
<P>
	We are also trying to drain the swamp of federal regulations 
which costs Canadian businesses tens of billions of dollars each 
year. Regulatory reform has the potential to increase 
productivity, stimulate investment, create more cost efficient 
government. We have reviewed more than half of the 3,000 
regulations on the book. We have eliminated more than one 
quarter and left another one quarter in place. The rest are in the 
process of being revised and examined.
<P>
	Providing leadership in the economy is the fourth objective. 
While the private sector creates jobs, the government has a clear 
role in creating a healthy economy which gives the private 
sector the confidence to add jobs.
<P>
	In our knowledge based economy success depends on skills 
and innovation. The government can contribute by gathering 
and disseminating information and ideas about technology and 
new markets. As well, it can play an important role in bringing 
businesses together, something that is critical in an economy 
where many new firms are small and highly specialized.
<P>
	One priority is to do more to harness science and technology 
in order to improve productivity and growth. Government can 
help by building better links among industry, universities and 
government labs. It also has a particular role in making sure 
small business benefits from the latest know-how in the high 
technology sector in particular.
<P>
	Trade is another area where government involvement is 
essential for success. Today more than ever Canada is an 
exporting nation. It is vital that more companies become 
exporters and that we look beyond our traditional markets to the 
emerging economies of Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. 
Here the government can help by providing more information 
and ensuring that small business has access to export financing. 
We must work toward an end to export subsidies by foreign 
countries. Until that day we must do what is necessary to ensure 
that our exporters can compete with foreign competitors.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The fifth and final objective is absolutely essential to the 
others. We must create a healthy fiscal and monetary climate. If 
we do not, as the finance minister told the Standing Committee 
on Finance, we will fail at everything else. That is why we have 
staked out a firm commitment to bring the deficit down to 3 per 
cent of  GDP by 1996-97, effectively cutting it in half from its 
present level. That is why we have also made it clear that this 
deficit target is an interim step in meeting the ultimate goal to 
eliminate the deficit completely.
<P>
	It would be absurd to claim that a single policy paper has all 
the answers to secure Canada's economic future. Other papers 
on specific issues are being completed. I suggest that no 
government in recent memory has demonstrated our 
commitment to providing Canadians with factual, accessible 
information on its economic principles, its strategic agenda and 
the fiscal situation.
<P>
	Examples include not only the framework document, but its 
companion financial update entitled ``Creating a Healthy Fiscal 
Climate''. There is also the first ever annual financial report of 
the Government of Canada that was released earlier this fall as 
suggested by the Auditor General. To me and I hope to all 
Canadians the evidence is clear. Our government has a vision of 
the role of government in building a more prosperous nation.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite would better serve his mandate 
and the interests of the entire nation by providing meaningful 
alternatives, if he has any. Motions calling for statements that 
already exist do nothing but pass our time. Let us dismiss this 
motion and get on with the real business of future building.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's speech. I did not 
hear him comment too much about the fact that given the 
government's current plan for budgetary spending, our debt will 
grow by $100 billion in three years and our deficit will still be 
$25 billion a year after three years. These are the government's 
projections. Our annual interest bill will go from about $40 
billion to $50 billion a year. This is in spite of a time of 
economic growth in Canada. At the end of these three years we 
may face a recession given the cycle of business and the 
international marketplace.
<P>
	Would the member comment on whether he thinks the current 
3 per cent of GDP deficit ratio is acceptable in light of those 
statistics?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. It is not only acceptable, it 
is achievable. It is an interim step on the way to addressing what 
I know the hon. member opposite wants to address, the overall 
deficit and debt problem. We are starting down that road in the 
right direction with an achievable target and we are going to get 
there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see that the Liberals have one more member of their 
olympic low hurdles team thinking that 3 per cent is just fine.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to most of the dissertation of the 
hon. member for St. Paul's. A good deal of what he said about 
what the legitimate role of government should really be would 
find favour on all sides of the House as we are searching around 
now with yet another study to find out what the legitimate role of 
government should really be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7166"> 7166 </A></B>
<P>
	The reality was however that it was 10 minutes of platitudes 
disavowing 35 years of Liberal history. That is the route. That is 
the reality. It was 10 minutes of platitudes disavowing 35 years 
of Liberal mismanagement of the economy that got us into this 
mess.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member for St. Paul's is this. After 
nine years in opposition, one year in government, is it not time 
that the government came out with specific responses to specific 
problems rather than yet another consultation? Does the hon. 
member opposite consider it the legitimate role of government 
to pick winners and losers in the marketplace? This is a very 
simple question. Is it the legitimate role of government to pick 
winners and losers?
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the member's 
last question, no, and I said as much in the speech. We should 
pick winning sectors and that is what we are going to be doing.
<P>
	With respect to the member's suggestion that we are 
disavowing Liberalism or the Liberal viewpoint or policy of the 
last 35 years, absolutely not. We still put the Canadian people 
first and foremost. As we attack the debt and deficit, which must 
be addressed, we keep the Canadian people clearly in focus.
<P>
	Unlike members opposite, we know how complex the issue is. 
We know that Canadians want to have a say in what we are 
doing. Many have asked to testify before the finance committee 
in the prebudget consultations-we are oversubscribed 
already-and I for one welcome hearing what they have to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear 
that the hon. member opposite is proud of the $275 billion that 
the Liberal government contributed to this wonderful national 
debt.
<P>
	If they are going to blame the Conservatives for a portion of it 
we really believe that these members should take their share as 
well.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is when it comes to the 
deficit and to balancing the budget, which they claim now after 
they have listened to the Reform Party long enough, what sense 
of urgency does the member opposite have to getting to a zero 
deficit and a balanced budget? What sense of urgency does the 
hon. member have in getting to a balanced budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. 
member got his lead into the question. I do not know if he was 
listening to the debate or not.
<P>
	However, on the second part which was the urgency of getting 
to a zero deficit or balanced budget, clearly that is set out in the 
documents that I was discussing in my speech earlier. The 3 per 
cent figure by 1996-97 is clearly stated and has been stated on 
numerous occasions by the Minister of Finance as an interim 
target. We are going to hit it. We are going to get there and then 
we will move on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not be quite as harsh with the hon. member for St. 
Paul's as my colleagues.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a couple of direct questions. I am 
reading from a speech given by the transport minister. That is 
my big concern. It says U.S. rails have higher labour 
productivity than Canadian rail, 64 per cent higher actually. I 
appreciated the comment that we are going to become 
competitive.
<P>
	The other excerpt I would like to read is this: ``Rail has more 
than 200 separate kinds of actions or decisions that must be 
approved by the National Transportation Agency''. Then he 
goes on and says: ``In Canada, the approval process for 
conveyance can take up to six months. In the U.S. approvals are 
granted in as few as seven days''.
<P>
	How is the Liberal government going to make us competitive 
with these kinds of hindrances? These have been injected into 
our system during the last 25 or 30 years. All of a sudden are we 
going to do it in a six-month period? I have been after the 
transportation agency to stop the back-tracking. It has been 
almost a year and we have not been able to stop that yet. What 
action can we take?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. That is precisely the kind of example that we are 
looking at in transportation policy. The Minister of Transport is 
conducting reviews that are precisely addressing those 
impediments to business, productivity and competitiveness that 
I was speaking about earlier in my comments.
<P>
	These reviews are going on throughout government. We are 
getting on with regulatory reform. We are getting on with social 
policy reform. We are addressing this in the context of 
prebudget consultations. All of that is under way. I know the 
hon. member is impatient and I do not blame him.
<P>
	Canadians understand that we do not fix problems overnight. I 
know he has some colleagues who think it is all simple 
problems, simple solutions. We will do it, we will wrap it up 
tonight and it will all work out tomorrow morning.
<P>
	However, on this side of the House we know things are 
complex. Canadians want to speak to us. We want to listen and 
we want to do the best for all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7167"> 7167 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address our motion requesting the government table a 
clear, detailed plan to show how and when it intends to balance 
the budget.
<P>
	For years the Reform Party has been saying that the deficit 
and the debt and the interest costs to service that debt together 
constitute the single most critical problem facing Canada today.
<P>
	We have been saying this loud and clear for the past year in the 
House as well. As the debt clock continues to tick its way into 
the second half of a trillion dollars, we are increasingly aware 
that the old way of doing things in Canada simply does not work 
any more. The Liberals are standing firm on their policy of 
status quo federalism while the Bloc Quebecois continues to 
push its separatist agenda.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Reformers believe that these two approaches do not cut it for 
Canada. There is another option for a new and better Canada and 
we would like to invite people to have a look at what we intend to 
build on our side of the fence. Like a house, Canada is 
mortgaged to the tune of $534 billion. The interest payments on 
this mortgage alone eat up one-third of our tax dollars, leaving 
less money for social programs and for government services. 
That is why there is a need to balance the budget.
<P>
	Even in the red book the Liberals have pointed out the dangers 
of continual deficits in the $30 billion range. What have they 
planned to do this year? Simply add $39 billion to the debt. By 
the end of the first three years of their mandate they will have 
added another $100 billion to the debt.
<P>
	The time has come to build a home that we can live in 
comfortably without adding further to our mortgage. We must 
start by having a foundation of responsible spending and set 
priorities so that we can afford things that are really important, 
like strong walls and a good roof instead of wasting money on 
frills like gold bathroom fixtures and swimming pools.
<P>
	Our building plan trims the size of the federal government, 
carefully prioritizes social spending, and cuts out frills like 
multiculturalism funding, subsidies for businesses and special 
interest groups, the gold bathroom fixtures to which I was 
referring.
<P>
	On this note I would like to focus attention on where and what 
to cut in the area of special interest groups. As many of you 
know, the Reform Party does not court special interest lobbies 
and is opposed to the subsidization of such groups with 
government funds. The reason for this is straightforward. 
Political interest lobbies have a singular political purpose and 
that is to advance their own agenda. We feel strongly that 
taxpayers should not be shouldering the cost of their activities.
<P>
	The National Action Committee on the Status of Women for 
example receives about $5 million a year of  taxpayers' money 
while claiming to represent the interests of all women in 
Canada. What have Canadian women received for this money? 
Calls for pay equity, which pushes the country away from 
embracing hiring practices based on merit and not gender, 
demands for a national day care system when the majority of 
parents would prefer to raise their children themselves, given a 
better tax situation.
<P>
	The fact is that based on recent polls more than half of 
Canadian women have not even heard of NAC. NAC has about 
2,000 card carrying, money donating supporters. They claim 
higher totals but this is because every member of the YWCA is 
automatically added as a member of their organization.
<P>
	These 2,000 supporters are a stark contrast to the women's 
group called REAL Women which has over 40,000 members, 
collects no government subsidies and gets its money from the 
people it purports to represent.
<P>
	The fact is that when the government subsidizes political 
lobby groups it subsidizes only some and not others. Mr. 
Speaker, through you to the finance minister, cut funding to 
NAC.
<P>
	On another front the Canadian taxpayer is paying millions of 
dollars annually for union leaders to understand the importance 
of the Canadian labour movement. The total handouts by the 
Department of Labour during the period of 1989 to 1992 to 
unions was almost $18 million. If unions would dedicate their 
members' dues to union business rather than political action 
they would not need handouts from the taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, 
through you to the finance minister, cut funding to unions.
<P>
	As a businessman I have seen people take advantage of 
government subsidies and grants, not because they need to but 
because the money was served on a gold platter. Here it is, take 
it. It is called incentives. Staggering sums continue to be ladled 
out in handouts to businesses despite the fact that national 
business groups have called on the federal government to stop 
giving them money. This money usually comes from giant slush 
funds known as the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and 
the Western Economic Diversification Agency. The 1994-95 
estimates have almost $1.3 billion being funnelled through 
these agencies on pork barrel programs.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, through you to the finance minister, cut funding 
to pork barrel agencies, including his own federal office of 
regional development, a $400 million program in the province 
of Quebec.
<P>
	I have a question. Why Olympic Saddledome renovations 
when Calgary needs $60 million worth of sewer repairs? The 
infrastructure program simply puts Canadians $6 billion further 
into debt and the jobs they create are over when the money runs 
out. Mr. Speaker, through you to the finance minister, cut out 
infrastructure immediately and quit tempting Canadians with 
my grandchildren's money.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7168"> 7168 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The government is tilting the playing field, giving financial 
assistance to just those groups it wants to hear from. The idea 
that the government is looking out for the interests of all 
Canadians is just a smoke screen. It is only a select few that 
count.
<P>
	A perfect example of this will become apparent in the next 
couple of months with the much talked about consultations 
across Canada on social and economic reforms. The government 
favoured special interest groups have already been given their 
advance notice to prepare their presentations while ordinary 
citizens have been left to their own devices.
<P>
	The game goes on and it is habit forming, so much so that the 
government even continues to give money to groups to lobby for 
things that the general public actually agrees with. Here is a 
good example. I do not smoke and the majority of Canadians do 
not smoke. The health minister and her department clearly want 
to put an end to smoking. I do not have a problem with that but 
can someone tell me why we paid $200,000 to the 
Non-Smokers' Rights Association to tell us what we already 
know? Incidentally, the Non-Smokers' Rights Association has 
just 300 paid up members. That is not what I would call 
significant public support. Mr. Speaker, through you to the 
finance minister, cut funding to the Non-Smokers' Rights 
Association.
<P>
	The simple truth is that we are now on the verge of losing our 
home to foreign creditors. We simply cannot continue to give 
borrowed money to people who have no proper claim to it.
<P>
	Direct government subsidies to business distort the 
marketplace and punish success in order to subsidize failure. 
Money is taken from successful people in businesses and 
reallocated to unsuccessful people and unsuccessful businesses 
in the name of job creation. In the same way that government 
subsidies to business distort the economic marketplace, 
subsidies to political lobby groups distort the political 
marketplace of ideas.
<P>
	In a true democracy this is intolerable. That is why the Reform 
Party believes that people should be free to express their views 
but use their own financial resources. That is why we are against 
special interest funding. If an idea has merit and is deserving of 
public support, that idea will rise on its own with financial 
assistance from the people who support that view. If not, then 
the idea will fade away as it deserves. Let the people speak 
rather than the subsidized lobby groups.
<P>
	It is time to cut spending and stop giving money to those who 
do not deserve it. It does not take months of consultation, task 
forces, studies and commissions to understand this fact. The 
Liberals, three years prior to becoming the government, wrote 
studies and went across the country. The Prime Minister asked 
them too. They have already consulted with people and they still 
do not know what the people are saying. I do not know when they 
will get it.
<P>
	People at the grassroots level are saying quite clearly that they 
will no longer subsidize special interest activities with their 
hard earned tax dollars. Gone are the days of needless 
government frills and fancy fixtures.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, through you to the Minister of Finance, if the 
government wants to start cutting it can start right here. Cut 
spending on special interest groups and save taxpayers a half a 
billion dollars. Cut spending and stop direct business subsidies 
and save taxpayers $1.3 billion.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, through you to the finance minister and to the 
Liberal government, let us build a mortgage free home that we 
can all afford and pass on to our children and our grandchildren 
with pride.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to all parts of the speech of 
the member opposite and I have a couple of comments to make 
and a question to ask.
<P>
	At the beginning of his speech he talks about, and quite 
rightly, our grave concern about interest payments. He 
suggested that if we were responsible, somehow we should be 
able to eliminate it overnight. It is inappropriate that we should 
be incurring more debt and more interest payments tomorrow, 
the next day or the day after. However, I want to make it clear 
both to the member and to the people out there in the audience 
that to accomplish that tomorrow would mean we would have to 
cut $40 billion out of government expenditure. The member 
opposite is suggesting that we cut $40 billion out of the federal 
budget tomorrow.
<P>
	That is an unreasonable approach. We want to cut the $40 
billion but we are going to do it over a reasonable period of time 
with reasonable policies that protect individual Canadians while 
we are doing it, not overnight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> That is the Tories all over again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> We have been listening to that for nine years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The member across suggested a number of 
ways he thinks we can do it. Let me enumerate some of them. He 
talked about the fact that he wants to eliminate day care. To him 
daycare is not important. Let us sweep it off the table. That is not 
of any interest to anybody.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	According to the member pay equity is not important. Let us 
sweep that off the table. That is not something we want to have 
anything to do with.
<P>
	We do not want anything to do with unions or with economic 
diversification in the areas of this country that are hard hit 
economically. No, we do not want to help any of our 
disadvantaged regions. That would be something we would not 
want to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7169"> 7169 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, he talks about special interest groups. He mentions 
that we do not want to fund them. He suggests that we should not 
have to do that because they would pay for it themselves. I agree 
there are occasions where I would like to see somebody who is 
able to afford to make a case to the government pay for it 
themself, but not everybody has the financial resources to do 
that.
<P>
	If we use the member's scenario, the rich would have an 
opportunity to present to Parliament and an opportunity to make 
their voice heard, but the poor would be shunted aside because 
they would not have the money to be able to do it.
<P>
	I do not think that is the kind of representation we want to 
encourage as a government. I bring these points up to the 
member opposite and suggest that he might want to re-evaluate 
and take a second look at some of the suggestions that he is 
making to the hon. finance minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it extremely humorous that I 
have to re-evaluate. We have proposed for the last three years to 
balance the budget over a three-year period. It is through a 
combination of spending cuts and growth in the economy. If the 
hon. member opposite and all of his frontbench cabinet 
ministers would listen, the Reform Party policy is the following: 
We would cut about $18 billion, $19 billion, $20 billion over a 
three-year period in various ways, shapes and forms, listening 
to the people. When we get in we would expect those cuts, 
especially making those cuts in the first year of our 
mandate-which the party opposite did not have the political 
will to do-would help to stimulate the economy.
<P>
	It is not $40 billion in one year. Is that very clear, Mr. 
Speaker? I know you understand it, but through you do the 
members understand that? It is not $40 billion in one year. It is 
$18 billion to $20 billion over three years and the rest comes 
from growth. I hope I have put that to rest and that I have been 
quite clear.
<P>
	I am letting something affect me which as a professional 
football player I was told never to do. I am developing rabbit 
ears. While I am speaking to you, Mr. Speaker, I am hearing 
noises from the members opposite. We are not supposed to hear 
that. We are supposed to give our speeches and answer the 
questions. I am trying to do that.
<P>
	Do we have any time left on this?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just a little.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I will entertain another question if the members 
opposite have the courage to ask me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask one very 
short question. I still do not believe we sit in this Chamber to put 
all of our energy toward helping those people in our society who 
are advantaged. I believe that a good part of our responsibility is 
to make sure that those people and regions in our country that 
are disadvantaged from time to time get our attention and our 
support.
<P>
	I would like to ask a very simple question of the member. 
Does he believe in that fundamental view, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes I do. Not only do I, but there is a 
comment I would like to make with all respect to the hon. 
member who asked me that question. He has made a suggestion 
to his government and he has been making suggestions to the 
Canadian public for the last few years.
<P>
	Nobody with any intelligence or any brains over on the 
government side even gives this man the time of day or the 
attention that his ideas and suggestions deserve. After we make 
the proper cuts that are required, after we find out what the 
government needs to spend, whether it is $100 billion or $80 
billion, then get rid of the Income Tax Act and replace it with a 
flat tax, a proportional tax. Our tax is a little different than what 
he is proposing, but we would definitely support him. He is not 
being listened to. He must be about the most frustrated member. 
He is not a backbencher and he cannot get the attention of the 
government. I would be embarrassed to be sitting on that side of 
the House.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Far be it from me to fuel 
any more cynicism than there already is in this place at times, 
but some might say that was kind of a long question. In any 
event, resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for those Canadians who are watching this debate on television I 
would like to read again the motion that has been put forward 
today to the House for debate by the Reform Party:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House requests the government to table a clear detailed plan to show 
how and when it intends to balance the budget including a clear statement of its 
vision of the role of the government in the economy in order for the people of 
Canada to debate the plan and vision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are a few things we need to point out about this process 
that Reform's motion suggests and proposes. One is about this 
whole question of public debate and consultation.
<P>
	I have been rather amused to hear the government keep 
playing the violin about consultation, talking to the people, 
wanting Canadians to draw up a blueprint for reform of social 
programs, which is the area I am involved in the most, but not 
having anything to debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7170"> 7170 </A></B>
<P>
	If we have a debate there is a proposal, a question, some sort 
of statement and people take the pro and the con and they debate 
it. How can we debate a nothing? There is no debate.
<P>
	This government has made a fetish out of debating and 
consultations and put no meat on the table, put no clear 
proposals on the table, no question to be debated. It is just: 
``What would you do about social program reform? What would 
you do about budgets?''. People are going to come from all over 
the map on that type of question.
<P>
	What we have suggested in this motion today for debate is that 
the people of Canada be given a plan and a clear vision to debate. 
The government should come forward and say: ``After talking to 
all of our experts, after examining all of the options, after 
examining all of the facts and figures and knowing all of the cost 
benefit of what we might do and what we might not do, we think 
we should do this. However, because this is a democracy, 
because we want to truly represent the people who are paying the 
bills and whose futures are going to be affected by this plan, we 
are now going to you the people and we are saying this is our best 
judgment about how we should attack and address this problem. 
But we want to know whether you are willing to support it, given 
all the information that we can make available to you and given 
sufficient time for you to examine our proposal''.
<P>
	That is what consultation is. It is not just: ``What do you 
think?''. We definitely need leadership from people in charge, a 
plan and a proposal and some direction, vision and purpose. We 
need to get that out for debate.
<P>
	We do not have that from this government. That is one of the 
things that is sorely lacking. I am afraid quite frankly that the 
Canadian public will become very cynical, very disenchanted 
and very disrespectful of this whole business of consultation. It 
is going to become a dirty word. What it means is just pooling 
our ignorance, just ``whatever you think''. That is not good 
enough.
<P>
	Consultation has to be focused on something concrete, 
something specific and something with some vision and a plan. 
Therefore I urge this government not to debate the notion of 
consultation with this kind of open ended, whatever you think, 
throw it at us. Let us show as parliamentarians and leaders, 
particularly those members who are representatives of the 
government party, that there is some leadership, a plan and a 
focus and that we are going somewhere so that we as Canadians 
can say: ``Yes, we agree. We support that. It makes sense to us'', 
or ``No, we would like to see changes''. At least we would know 
what we are talking about.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk about balancing the budget. 
Goodness knows our party has been talking about it for seven 
long years. They say seven is the perfect number. I hope it is 
because some time or other you would like to see this vision of a 
balanced budget coming to fruition.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	We have been labelled as hackers and slashers, wanting to gut 
social programs, and all of the negative things that can be 
thrown at people who have one very sensible, very common 
sense proposal, and that is that we live within our means.
<P>
	Why on earth would representatives, leaders and public 
officials want to borrow from the future? We do not want to 
mortgage our country. We do not want to lay the burden of our 
spending on our children. Why would that be such a difficult 
concept to accept? We do not know.
<P>
	Why would it be such a difficult concept for the government 
to accept? We do know because it is still believed that 
governments can scoop up our national wealth and reallocate it 
in a way that is beneficial to Canadians. If the last 30 years have 
not demonstrated that that is a foolish and fallacious notion, 
then I do not know what will convince people.
<P>
	If you had done something for 30 years, if you had scooped up 
billions and billions and billions of dollars of our national 
wealth and had it spent by bureaucrats, politicians and social 
engineers and then seen the mess we are in today, you would 
have thought that someone would stand up and say: ``Gee, 
maybe this isn't working. Maybe we should do something 
different''.
<P>
	No, Mr. Speaker. What do we have from this government? 
Instead, the same old cant about ``Well, maybe we just need 
different programs. Maybe we just need to spend it differently. 
Maybe we just need to do this or that or the other thing''.
<P>
	Maybe what we should do is run this country like any sensible 
business or household is run, that is living within its means, and 
letting people have the freedom to define their own futures, to 
look after themselves and their families, to help each other and 
their communities instead of this notion that somehow the state, 
mother government, the bureaucracy, the central planners, the 
wise men from the government can do everything.
<P>
	It is not working and it is time that we acknowledge that. It is 
time that we started to say that we can do better in this country. 
We can do better than giving billions and billions of our hard 
earned dollars to government, politicians, bureaucrats, 
programs, and social engineering experiments that are simply 
making the situation worse.
<P>
	When we talk about balancing budgets we are simply talking 
about taking the money that we have and using it with some 
common sense. We are talking about taking the money that we 
have and using it for what needs to be done, not what 
governments and bureaucracies and industries of different sorts 
think should be done with it.
<P>
	This talk about balancing the budget is going to be just so 
much talk until something is done. I remember as a brand new, 
some would say very green, parliamentarian sitting in this 
chamber in February and listening to the finance minister. One 
thing that the finance minister said  struck me very powerfully. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7171"> 7171 </A></B>
<P>
He said: ``We are no longer going to nibble around the edges of 
our deficit.'' I thought, wow, this is great. What happened at the 
end of the day? He cut just over one billion from spending. A lot 
of people said that was by smoke and mirrors, sleight of hand 
and kind of mixing and matching the numbers. When you are 
spending $160 billion and you cut it just over a billion, is that 
not nibbling around the edges?
<P>
	Canadians are sick and tired of governments and politicians 
who say one thing and do another. It is time that this government 
and this House got a grip on this country, started using some 
common sense, started using some principled behaviour in the 
way they manage this country and its wonderful resources, and 
started balancing their spending.
<P>
	I urge this House to strongly support our motion today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like many thousands of 
Canadians I listened intently to this speech and I would like to 
use a western analogy: Where's the beef?
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	All we heard was an outright condemnation of the existence of 
every system in place, everything we have worked for in 
Canada. I have not heard any solutions or proposals from the 
Reform Party. They are actually condemning the consultation 
process which has been put into effect.
<P>
	The opposition held a number of failed electronic town halls 
across Canada to try to gauge the population, but to its surprise a 
number of things came out of that. Often the population in 
Canada was in total disagreement with its own policies.
<P>
	Reform members tell the Government of Canada that it is not 
doing its job. I have seen what happened on their side over the 
past few months. Every time they have tried to consult the 
population in their fashion they failed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to respond to 
those terrible distortions of what is happening with the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	I am amused and in disbelief that member of government, a 
parliamentary secretary, would ask: ``Where's the beef?''. The 
government has had no beef for one full year after working 
away. It has no beef at all in its social program reform. It has no 
beef at all in a plan to balance the budget or even get it down to 
its feeble target of 3 per cent of GDP. I would have thought the 
parliamentary secretary would be standing up telling Canadian 
people where their beef is, not demanding that a third party 
supply him with the beef.
<P>
	If the member wants to see some beef, perhaps he should look 
at the plans put forward by the Reform Party and tabled in the 
House. For the benefit of the government perhaps he should get 
a report on the consultations of our party with his finance 
minister to try to give him a bit of hand holding in coming up 
with a sensible plan to do what he is supposed to do. Those 
concrete proposals were put forward by a brand new third party 
of 52 green, untried MPs, and the government still says: ``You 
tell us what to do''.
<P>
	This party is going to have a plan ready to give the Canadian 
people and to run the country in the proper way after the next 
election.
<P>
	The member talked about town hall meetings. It is interesting 
to note that just last evening the Liberal Party imitated Reform's 
electronic town hall by trying to get out and consult with the 
people. We have led the way in public consultation and in 
innovative ways to get the true input of Canadian people. We are 
delighted the government is catching on that this needs to be 
done, but I certainly think it is inappropriate for the member 
opposite to suggest that somehow our electronic consultations 
are not working when his party is aping them or imitating them. 
That does not quite make sense to me.
<P>
	I might add the consultations that have been done with the 
Canadian public have given valuable input not only to our party 
but to the governing party. I hope he is paying attention to what 
is being said in those consultations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that a lot of 
Canadians are not listening to the Reform Party. We have seen it 
in terms of the percentage of the popular vote it actually has 
according to recent polls.
<P>
	I would also like to raise other things. How about regional 
economic development? That seems to be an area where the 
Reform appears to be really lacking. I am from eastern Canada. I 
am from a very rural part of Quebec. The fisheries industry has 
gone down. There is no longer any fish. We are having problems. 
We cannot find the various resources we once took for granted. 
What do we do?
<P>
	What do we do with these people? What do we do with the 
50,000 people of Newfoundland and the maritime provinces 
who were laid off? Do we just tell them to go away, it is their 
problem, there is no fish and we cannot do anything? After all 
this is a compassionate society, is it not? This is why the 
government has to make sure we address the issues and the 
needs of all Canadians, but especially those who are having a 
harder time than other Canadians.
<P>
	To say that it is inappropriate for me to make comments, the 
fact is that we know the results of the Reform Party. People have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7172"> 7172 </A></B>
<P>
passed comments and judgments on the way your people look at 
policy and on the way you people look at governing Canada.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I hate to intervene 
when anyone has the floor but again I must remind all colleagues 
on both sides of the House to make their interventions through 
the Speaker and not directly to one another.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. parliamentary secretary to wind up his 
question so the member for Calgary North can give a short 
rebuttal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, in summary, I am still waiting on 
this side for concrete proposals from the opposition instead of 
its usual rhetoric that everything done by the government never 
works.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, it always makes me a little 
concerned when I hear members say things like ``you people''. It 
is so easy to hang facile labels on people, to somehow suggest 
there is something not quite acceptable about a group. That is 
called bigotry and it is called labelling.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not a bigot and I have never 
used those words in reference to the Reform Party. I was only 
alluding to the form and substance of that party, which is not 
necessarily reflected in its policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was listening very 
attentively to the debate. Clearly the member used the word 
bigotry but in no way in any instance referred to anyone in the 
House being a bigot.
<P>
	I would remind all of us to be conscious and selective in the 
words used in vigorous debate. I would ask the hon. member for 
Calgary North to conclude her remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I urge hon. members opposite 
to look at proposals, ideas and suggestions without labelling 
people or attacking people who make them and suggesting that 
somehow proposals are invalid because of where they are 
coming from.
<P>
	It is not helpful to the debate. It does not help us work together 
as parliamentarians to solve the very real difficulties in the 
country. I suggest that we need to spend less time on attacking 
each other and more time on attacking the difficulties that face 
our country and coming up with concrete and positive solutions 
together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by picking 
up on some of the remarks the member made in her speech. It is 
very important for Canadians and for the Reform Party to 
understand that the Government of Canada cannot be run in the 
same way as a business.
<P>
	The Reform Party mentioned earlier that I have had a little 
business experience and I would like to deal with that. The fact 
is that I have had a little business experience. In business the 
preoccupation is with earnings per share per quarter, and profit 
and loss is the bottom line. The bottom line for the board of 
directors of the House is not profit. The bottom line that we are 
responsible for is the people of Canada.
<P>
	My colleague comes from an eastern part of the country, a 
rural region. He spoke earlier with passion because he has been 
sent to this boardroom to speak for his people, not unlike my 
colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, who has to 
come to the Chamber and speak for the people of his region who 
right now are going through a hell that very few of us in the 
House can imagine. If the House becomes preoccupied with 
cuts, cuts, cuts and eliminating the deficit entirely, who will 
speak for and who will look after Canadians who are truly 
disadvantaged and in real pain?
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	When General Motors decides the earnings per share per 
quarter are a little low it lays off l,000, 2,000 or 10,000 people. 
Who picks those people up? It is the programs designed by the 
men and women in the Chamber. General Motors does not pick 
them up.
<P>
	I had the privilege of working for two years with one of the 
most successful companies the country has ever produced, 
Magna International. Its latest report was published about two 
weeks ago. It made pretax about $400 million and paid about 
$140 million in taxes. Its net profit was about $240 million. In 
the middle to late seventies Magna was one of those companies 
the taxpayers of Canada supported. It developed computer aided 
design and computer aided manufacturing that allowed it to be 
one of the greatest companies in North America, one of the 
greatest exporters. Today that small company employs 20,000 
Canadians.
<P>
	In debate in the House on better public policy we cannot focus 
on just cuts, cuts, cuts; lean government; efficient government; 
and wasteful government. I am not going to support waste. No 
one in the House would. We all want lean government but we 
must have a caring government, as my colleague from New 
Brunswick said earlier. She said that it could not be a mean 
government.
<P>
	What concerns me about the debate today is that there is not 
enough focus on growth. We have tried with concrete activities 
in the last year not to focus just on deficit and debt. We have also 
focused on growth.
<P>
	We said in opposition and during the campaign that small 
business was the greatest hope for driving this economy and 
putting Canadians back to work. We said the 900,000 men and 
women who own and operate small businesses across the 
country represent our greatest hope for putting Canadians back 
to work. The government acted immediately in the industry 
committee to work on their greatest difficulty, which was access 
to capital. We heeded; we were told by them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7173"> 7173 </A></B>
<P>
	We consulted them in opposition and they said that if we 
became the government we had to have the courage to challenge 
the financial institutions because as small businesses they 
needed access to capital not just on the debt side but also on the 
equity side. We did that. I am happy to say that we did it with the 
help of the Reform Party and with the help of the Bloc. We 
recognize that. We acknowledge it publicly. It is concrete action 
that we took.
<P>
	When members of the Reform Party stand today they should 
not be shy in acknowledging that a specific action has taken 
place that affects the business lives of about 300,000 small 
businessmen and women who employ possibly millions of 
Canadians. Do not just focus on the negative, do not just get 
caught up in opposing for the sake of opposing.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Since coming into power we have taken specific action on the 
information highway. In terms of that activity we are probably 
one of the most advanced countries in the world. It allows us to 
hook up, network and interact with companies all over the 
world. This is a tremendous aid to our export activity. The 
results are shown in the hard numbers. These are not Liberal 
numbers nor are they Government of Canada numbers. These 
numbers are acknowledged by independent agencies. Our 
exports have increased dramatically in the last year and no one 
can deny that.
<P>
	We should be looking at those export numbers. We should be 
encouraging them even more because we cannot reduce the 
deficit and attack the debt unless we get those 1.5 million 
Canadians back to work. We are not going to leave them 
hanging. Jobs have been our central focus before the campaign, 
during the campaign and in our first year as government. The 
facts are that over 300,000 Canadians have been put back to 
work not by us directly but by assisting in creating some hope 
and an environment where we were serious and were focused on 
a direction.
<P>
	I did not pull those numbers out of the air. They are real 
numbers reported by independent agencies. I am not standing 
here saying that we are satisfied with those numbers. We are not 
satisfied. How could we possibly be? However, progress has 
been made by this government in the first year of its mandate.
<P>
	There is another thing this government has decided to push. 
The Prime Minister is in Vancouver today announcing our 
renewed focus on tourism activity in Canada. After the forestry 
and automotive sectors tourism is our greatest job creator. There 
is not one member of Parliament in this House who would stand 
up and speak against tourism.
<P>
	We have taken action on tourism. From a piddling little 
budget of $13 million in the Department of Industry for tourism 
for all of Canada, the Prime Minister today will announce that 
we are going to make tourism a priority sector. He is announcing 
a further $50 million for partnerships with the private sector.
<P>
	As every member in this House will stand up and say, tourism 
can generate a return in less than four or five months, once we 
get out there and market it and tell people to come to Canada. 
And it is not just for tourism, it is for trade shows and 
conventions, activity that will support other business 
opportunities. Sometimes people think tourism only concerns a 
family on holiday but it is more than that. Tourism is making 
sure we get our share of trade shows and conventions. This 
government has taken specific action and the Prime Minister 
will announce that commitment in Vancouver today.
<P>
	I have been around this town. I have been an assistant to a 
prime minister and this is my second term as an MP. I watched 
the Tories when they governed here. I sincerely believe our 
government has been one of the most effective and hardest 
working governments I have ever seen in this town.
<P>
	This government is making decisions almost at the speed of 
light. I know it is never fast enough and I will be the first one to 
admit that. There is a transition period and it takes a little bit of 
time. Many in the Reform Party are business people. You do not 
just go in and take over a business and make all your decisions in 
the first month or the first quarter. You have to get a handle on 
things. We have been able to get a handle on things very quickly. 
The numbers are starting to go in the right direction, but is it 
enough? It is never enough, but we will press on.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	There is another thing I want to take on today in challenging 
the Reform Party on its motion. One of this government's 
commitments has been to support Canada's export activity. I 
cannot remember when another government has done so much 
as this one in terms of selling products and services abroad, 
especially in the Asia-Pacific region and the eastern European 
countries. We must be one of the most export oriented 
governments Canadians have ever seen.
<P>
	In reflecting on one of the reasons that our exports have so 
dramatically improved, we can trace a lot of this export activity 
back to Pierre Trudeau's multiculturalism policy of 1971. I will 
explain this to the Reform Party. In 1971 when Pierre Trudeau 
stood in this House and said that we were going to have a policy 
in which no culture was less than or greater than another culture 
and we were going to encourage people to retain and promote 
their cultural heritage, this was something no other country in 
the world was doing. The United States had its melting pot 
theory and we did the opposite.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7174"> 7174 </A></B>
<P>
	Today there are Canadians who have retained their language 
and culture of origin. We have a trading advantage into every 
part of the world because of that facility with language and 
culture that no other nation on earth has. A close analysis of our 
trading activities abroad will trace a lot of that success back to 
that multiculturalism policy, the very policy the Reform Party 
wants to strike and cut saying that it adds no asset value to 
Canada's balance sheet.
<P>
	I suggest to member's opposite that multiculturalism is not 
about dancing, it is not about books. It is about turning 
Canadians into assets for Canada's balance sheet. Those people 
who have been able to use their links and their roots back to their 
country of origin have provided tremendous success for our 
exports side.
<P>
	My point is that in this last nine months we have acted 
aggressively on some very specific issues. We appreciate the 
constructive tone of the members opposite during the debate 
over the last year. There have been times when they have not just 
opposed for the sake of opposing and the debate has been very 
constructive.
<P>
	In many respects I am quite comfortable with some of the 
Reform Party's thrusts, especially in the area of tax reform. As I 
said earlier, there are only a few years to get things 
accomplished in this Chamber and the greatest catalyst for 
making things happen in this place is a constructive opposition.
<P>
	I say sincerely that if it focuses, the Reform Party has a chance 
to act as a real catalyst for tax reform in Canada, which is the one 
thing we have not yet taken on. Even though we have 
accomplished all these other things in the last year I hope the 
Reform Party will not give up challenging us on tax reform.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> I thank 
you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to comment on 
the dissertation of the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood 
this afternoon. I want to acknowledge the fact that this hon. 
member does have a very real interest in the debate today. It is 
not just a matter of his having to be here to speak about it. I am 
sure the hon. member is here because he wants to be here and he 
is doing what is in his heart to do.
<P>
	During his dissertation the hon. member mentioned that when 
a company takes over a business it had better take its time to find 
out what is going on before doing anything. It is a good idea, if 
you can afford it. However it would seem to me in my 
experience that before a business decides to take over another 
business, those taking over the business have a pretty good idea 
of why they are doing it and what they intend to do.
<P>
	The analogy of course is that this government in getting ready 
to accept power had nine years in the wilderness. It has had one 
year in power and what has it accomplished? I would suggest 
precious little. I am afraid I have to chalk up one more member 
of the Liberal  olympic low hurdle team. If you make the hurdle 
low enough, anyone can stumble over it.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood should all 
social programs in Canada be based on want or need?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to answer the last part of the member's question first. Of 
course we have always based any government expenditure on 
need and not on want. As I said earlier in my remarks, 
governance is not to be focused on those who are advantaged. It 
should be focused on those who are disadvantaged.
<P>
	I challenge the member's approach to taking over a company. 
He mentioned that you have a pretty good idea of what you are 
taking over. Generally speaking that is the case but I can say to 
the member, and he knows this, that when we took over there 
was close to $7 billion on the deficit that had never been talked 
about during the election campaign.
<P>
	If the member was-

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to point out that, one year ago today, this government 
received its mandate from Canadians. Since then, numerous 
commitments have been fulfilled, including the Canada-Quebec 
infrastructure program, which has resulted in the 
implementation of several projects.
<P>
	Thanks to federal contributions of some $90 million, this year 
the city of Montreal was able to start urban infrastructure 
projects of over half a billion dollars. On top of improving the 
residents' quality of life, these infrastructure projects will result 
in the creation of some 4,800 new direct and indirect jobs, 
during the construction work itself as well as in the following 
months.
<P>
	During the first year of its mandate, the government strived to 
create jobs, restore confidence and rebuild the credibility of the 
federal administration. Contrary to the Parti Quebecois

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
year ago today Reform defied the odds, confounded our critics 
and thrilled our supporters as 52 of us were elected to the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	Canadians saw in Reform the fresh wind of change. They saw 
men and women just like themselves who believed in what they 
believe in. Live within your means. Protect honest citizens. 
Listen to the people. In short, use common sense. That is exactly 
what they told us.
<P>
	That is exactly what we intend to do. While the government

yesterday's results in the Saint-Jean by-election. The election 
has confirmed the mandate given to the sovereignist 
government of Quebec.

	The election was mainly about the future of the Collège

Minister of Education as a bare minimum.

improve on this agreement by ensuring that the CMR maintains 
its military avocation. The federal government will have to go

Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government has done nothing in the 
area of parliamentary reform in its first year in office. The 
thinnest part of the Liberal red ink book is a chapter on integrity 
and parliamentary reform. Once again the Liberals set low 
standards for themselves and failed to meet them.
<P>
	The red ink book talked about giving MPs a greater role in 
drafting legislation. It has not happened. Whenever a committee 
begins to show any independence, government members are 
whipped into line.
<P>
	The red ink book talked about giving committees greater 
influence over government spending. It has not happened. 
Committees could not reduce the estimates by one dollar.
<P>
	The red ink book talked about parliamentary review of order 
in council appointments. That has not happened either.
<P>
	The red ink book also promised to change the outrageous MP 
pension plan. In good Liberal fashion, they have talked about it, 
they have studied it, but they have done nothing. They will not 
even allow conscientious MPs to opt out.

Mr. Speaker, things are becoming more confused instead of 
clearer. The minister refuses to confirm that foreign

the CSE does not spy on Canadians. So how can the minister

thousands of Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

we have said a number of times that the Privacy Act has to be 
obeyed by all Canadian agencies and that includes the CSE.
<P>
	The databank at the CSE is exempt from the provisions of the 
Privacy Act. That does not obviate the fact that all activities of 
the Communications Security Establishment follow the law 
explicitly. This has been affirmed by the former privacy 
commissioner, Mr. John Grace.

every number of years.
<P>
	There is one that is ongoing. In the fullness of time I assume

the operations of the CSE fully conform to the privacy act.

with respect to job creation. Until recently Liberals have 
claimed that job creation is primarily stimulated by government 
spending. Now the finance minister and others are saying what 
Reform has been saying all along, that debt, taxes and 
government overspending kill jobs and that deficit reduction 
and lower taxes are what stimulates private sector job creation.
<P>

	Will the Deputy Prime Minister now admit that by creating $6 
billion of additional federal, provincial and municipal debt

killed more long term jobs than it created? Will the government 
commit to a Reform job strategy based on deficit and tax 
reduction?

stated in the House and repeated it again yesterday to all

high. Now they are talking about reduction. We told them that 
the spending cuts in the February budget were not sufficient and 
now they are making repairs.
<P>
	The government has been forced toward Reform positions in 
the social and fiscal areas. Can we now count on the Liberal 
government to steal the rest of our platform, in particular our 
democratic reforms such as free votes, referendums, citizen 
initiatives and recall?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	A year after the election of the Liberal government, we have 
come to realize that its employment strategy simply amounts to 
setting up an infrastructure program that creates only temporary 
jobs, reducing access to unemployment insurance and passively 
benefits from the economic recovery. Considering population 
growth, we are still over 800,000 jobs short of the pre-recession 
level.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister realize that her government's 
approach to job creation is coercive, reducing access to 
unemployment insurance and UI benefits and to forcing the 
unemployed to re-enter the labour market and try to find jobs 
which simply do not exist?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question. It gives me an opportunity to say, I am sure 
with some great satisfaction, to her and her constituents that as a 
result of the efforts of the government the unemployment rate in 
her riding has gone from 12.1 per cent down to 9 per cent.
<P>
	If we keep it up, at that rate she will have no unemployment by 
the end of our term.

over a million unemployed workers in Canada, not counting all 
those who have precarious, very short term jobs?
<P>

	How can the Deputy Prime Minister pretend that her 
government has restored hope and dignity for the unemployed, 
when in Quebec alone, 22,000 unemployed workers had to resort 
to welfare after the 1993 cuts in unemployment insurance, and 
since then, her government has never stopped forcing those who 
are no longer eligible for UI benefits to live on welfare?

statement she just did when she and her party continually oppose 
every effort of this government to invest in better training, 
better job creation, better development? They are against any

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today the <I>Financial Post</I> reported on a memo from the 
government's finance department which concluded that this 
government's immigration policies are worsening the 
unemployment crisis. It said that current levels which are twice 
as high as any other nation on earth are not creating jobs but 
creating competition for them.
<P>
	Will the minister of immigration heed the conclusions of the 
finance department and dramatically reduce immigration 
levels?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some of the thoughts 
contained in that report are by no means new. We heard those 
representations being made during the eight month consultation. 
Next Tuesday the government will be presenting its plan for 
1995 in large measure based on the things we have heard and 
discussed with Canadians. I ask the member to wait until 
Tuesday and render an opinion then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
a year now this minister has been telling Canadians that high 
immigration levels are okay, even when unemployment is high. 
We have said there is a level at which immigration hurts the 
economy and the finance department agrees with us.
<P>
	Will the minister wake up to the facts, show some political 
will and cut the numbers? Will he do what is right for Canadians 
and not just for the immigration industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure the member 
read the entire document. To say that it agrees entirely with 
Reform Party policy is exaggerating one great leap.
<P>
	Immigration generally has been a positive force for Canada. 
On page 74 of the red book it is stated very clearly: ``We will 
continue to support an immigration policy that balances our 
demographic and economic need with our capacity to settle and 
absorb immigrants''. In other words it means a balanced 
program which we do have and will continue to have after 
November 1.

<P>
	During the last days of the federal election campaign, the 
Prime Minister promised to reduce the deficit without raising 
the taxes of Canadians during the first two years of his mandate.
<P>
	Last week, however, in another about-face by this 
government, the Prime Minister referred in no uncertain terms 
to the possibility of raising taxes, contrary to his campaign 
promise.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance account for the fact that 
exactly one year after it came to power, his government has 
already reneged on its commitment not to raise taxes and that the 
minister himself is feeding speculation about the possibility that 
his government will tax RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has said repeatedly, in no uncertain terms and as 
recently as yesterday, that we are firmly committed to bringing 
the deficit down to $25 billion in 1996-97.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also said that we wanted to proceed 
mainly by cutting spending, but if we had to change this, we 
were prepared to do so because the main objective is to avoid the 
burden of higher interest rates.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also made it very clear that he wanted to 
close tax loopholes, a process we started in the last budget.

incomes, not those that benefit the very  wealthy Canadian 
taxpayers that the minister is protecting in his Budget and his 
pre-budget consultations.
<P>
	Why will the Minister of Finance not admit that you do not 
change the rules halfway through the game and that he will have 
to stop these damaging speculations by telling the House quite 
clearly that he will not tax RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

<P>
	The hon. member said that we were attacking the middle 
class. In fact, in the last Budget we eliminated flip flop deals by 
large corporations and multinationals. We eliminated the 
preferential tax rate for large corporations. We eliminated the 
$100,000 capital gains exemption. And we introduced new rules 
for foreign affiliates. We made promises and we acted on them.

<P>
	We said we would respond to local needs and local priorities 
as established by municipalities. That is exactly what we have 
done. We have done it right across the country with the support 
of all the provinces, and do you know what? We have done it on 
reallocation, not on increasing the debt of this government. 
Most of those municipalities and provinces have done the same 
thing.
<P>
	In the course of this program we have put 100,000 Canadians 
back to work. We anticipated most of these projects would put 
people to work on construction in the short term but they would 
also create spin-off jobs which will put still another 100,000 
Canadians back to work.
<P>

this program has been a great success.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 100,000 
short term jobs means one day or one week for some workers.

insurance benefits and transfer payments to the provinces for 
social assistance, post-secondary education and health. The 
federal share of these social programs amounts to $32.6 billion.
<P>
	Why is the Minister of Finance making cuts in these social

reduce its operating expenditures, business subsidies and 
further reduce the defence budget which all together amount to 
$34.5 billion?

we cut business subsidies, but we did not cut transfer payments

who refuses to accept the Quebec consensus expressed at the

development. It was not a question of transferring funds but 
helping them to set priorities. The Quebec minister responded 
by saying: ``Why can Quebec not have the same thing?''
<P>
	I want to point out that we have already offered the province 
of Quebec much more in terms of responsibility for managing 
human resource programs than we have offered to all the other 
provinces. We said to all the provinces that we would invite 
them to take planning responsibility for close to 60 per cent of 
federal manpower expenditures, that we would transfer the full 
responsibility for deciding on training programs under the 
CEGEPs and community colleges, that we would ask the 
provinces to take the responsibility of setting up a single 
window, guichet unique, and we would also look at sitting down

grams as they relate to  education, such as stay in school 
programs and other areas.

proposals that have been made to the particular Indian bands 
across the country.

Mr. Speaker, the minister is confusing this with his evaluation of 
the administrative agreements which he proposed to 10 native 
Indian groups. According to former minister André Bourbeau's

will waste more than $750 million in the next three years and 
maintain the present confusion which penalizes Quebec's

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

minister has written to his counterpart in the Government of 
Quebec again underlining that we are quite anxious, willing and 
open to sit down with the Government of Quebec and the 
governments of other provinces to negotiate based upon the 
proposal that we have submitted for manpower training just as 
we are prepared to co-operate on helping to support strategic 
initiatives, helping to support new child care initiatives and 
helping to support a changeover so that we can develop a way of 
assisting on the very active and very useful program in Quebec, 
APPORT, which is a social assistance program.

safer. That balanced approach is succeeding and is going to 
succeed further in making our communities safer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister speaks of making changes. How about 
Allan Kinsella and Serge Damien who escaped from the Bath 
institution who should have been held in a maximum security 
prison and should not even have had a hope of parole for 25 
years?
<P>
	Will the minister tell this House whether or not he would 
support the repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code and 
therefore make life indeed life?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I made my position 
clear some months ago.
<P>
	The government's position on section 745 is crystal clear. We 
introduced an amendment to section 745 to provide plainly that 
whenever an application is brought under that section that the 
court is obligated to hear from the families of the victims.
<P>
	That is the change we propose in section 745. It is contained in 
Bill C-41 and that is the policy of this government.

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
concerning his meeting with the home affairs minister for India 
tomorrow, Wednesday, October 26.
<P>
	There are many Canadians who are concerned about human 
rights in India. The human rights report and the Asia watch 
report have both detailed violations.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to discuss these with the home 
affairs minister for India when he meets with him tomorrow?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. 
member for monitoring human rights violations, not only in 
India. I know she is doing this in other parts of the globe.
<P>
	Members of this House will be happy to know that yes, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs will be addressing this with the 
minister visiting Canada. Canada is taking advantage of its good 
relations with India to make continual representations to that 
country regarding our concern about the human rights 
violations.
<P>
	At noon today members of the New Democratic Party, the 
Reform Party, the Liberal Party and the Senate met with a 
representative from Amnesty International concerning these 
human rights violations. I think all members will be happy to 
know that Canada has made representations for Amnesty 
International to visit other parts of India, not only Bombay, but 
Punjab, Kashmir, et cetera.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, N.D.P.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Health. Last week the Prime 
Minister opened the National Health Forum by stating: 
``Canada's health care costs must be cut or medicare could be 
destroyed''. Today we saw a study that showed that drug prices 
have increased 11.6 per cent.
<P>
	What is the minister's position? In opposition it was 
opposition to Bill C-91 which hit the consumer with increased 
drug prices for provinces and territories and the federal health 
care plans. Does this Minister of Health want to save Canada's 
health care plan and if so, will her government rescind Bill 
C-91?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there were a number of questions there. I do not know 
which one to start with.
<P>
	First, the Prime Minister stated that we must preserve the 
principles of medicare that were put in place by the federal 
government many years ago. We have to effectively and 
efficiently spend our dollars in order to guarantee those 
principles.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, the report that came out today definitely concerns the 
increase in terms of usage of newer drugs, not necessarily just an 
increase in prices.
<P>
	Again, we must look to ensure that the drugs we use are the 
most cost effective.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would hope that we will continue as we 
have since the beginning of this Parliament and have the 
courtesy of not only listening to the question, but also having the 
courtesy to listen to the answers.

all respect that in the view of the Chair the question he posed

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry had approximately six 
minutes left on questions and comments.
<P>
	Are there any further questions or comments for the 
parliamentary secretary?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the fact that you 
have acknowledged I had some time left in answering the 
question from the Reform Party.
<P>
	The question had to do with the comparison the Reform Party 
tries to make quite often that running a government is very much 
like running a business. Of course I do not agree that running the 
Government of Canada is like running a business at all.
<P>
	The member said we should have had a pretty good idea when 
we took power about what was happening with the books and 
records of the country. The member knows that when we took 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7187"> 7187 </A></B>
<P>
over the books and records, there was close to a seven or eight 
billion dollar difference in the real numbers.
<P>
	I really believe the Reform Party should acknowledge that. It 
should likewise acknowledge that our very aggressive handling 
of the deficit and the debt is something for which we should be 
given some marks.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the motion tabled in this House by my 
colleague from Saint-Albert. The hon. member for Saint-Albert 
sits on the Public Accounts Committee, which I chair, and I want 
to let him know that I share his point of view on the sorry state of 
our public finances and on the finance minister's inability to 
resolve Canada's public finance crisis.
<P>
	I also agree with him that the government should table in this 
House a detailed plan to show how it intends to balance the 
budget as well as its action plan schedule. The Bloc Quebecois, 
however, does not agree with the ways advocated by the Reform 
Party to balance the budget. The Bloc Quebecois does not share 
Reform members' vision of the role government should play in 
the economy either.
<P>
	In our opinion, the government must not only create a healthy 
competitive climate encouraging people to develop skills and do 
their best, but also protect society's poorest and most vulnerable 
and help them get out of the vicious circle of poverty and 
dependency. Where are we as taxpayers today, a year to the day 
after the election of a Liberal government? The two papers 
tabled last week by the Minister of Finance simply note the 
deterioration of Canada's public finances.
<P>
	The minister merely describes the state of government 
expenditures and revenue without proposing any vigorous 
action plan to correct the situation and substantially reduce the 
deficit. Yet, the red book, which all ministers misquote almost 
daily to save face in response to the questions asked by the 
Official Opposition during Question Period, contains many 
promises, and I quote: ``The basic elements of our approach 
include fiscal responsibility and fairness, deficit reduction, and 
a balanced and stable monetary policy''.
<P>
	The deficit forecast for this year is still close to $40 billion, 
more precisely $39.7 billion, while the forecast for next year is 
$32.7 billion. Even if the Liberal government met its target of 
reducing the deficit to $25 billion in 1996 and 1997, it would add 
$97.4 billion, almost $100 billion, to the $500 billion-plus debt 
already accumulated.
<P>
	Even if the government met its goal of 3 per cent of GDP in 
1996-97, it would still raise the debt to over $600 billion. Is that 
the deficit reduction promised by the Liberals in the red book? It 
is more and more unlikely that the government will succeed in 
keeping the deficit below the $40 billion level this year and 
below $33 billion next year.
<P>
	The government recognizes at last, but a bit late, that the 
increase in interest rates, which was partly offset by the 
recovery this year, will entail additional cuts of up to $4.7 
billion in 1995-96 and $9 billion the following year if it is to 
reach its objective of a deficit of no more than 3 per cent of the 
GDP before the end of its term.
<P>
	Can we honestly talk about fiscal responsibility as the 
government promised in the red book? According to us, it looks 
more like chronic irresponsibility. In such a context, the red 
book looks more and more like a jumble of wishful thinking 
prepared just to seduce some disillusioned constituents 
throughout the election campaign. In that same red book, they 
also talked about fiscal equity.
<P>
	Well, let us talk about it. The government's budgetary 
approach is based on the social security reform, that is on 
cutbacks in transfers to provinces and in social programs that 
will merely penalize welfare recipients and students, the 
unemployed and the elderly. The overtaxed middle class, which 
historically served as the milking cow for government taxation, 
is not reassured when even the Prime Minister talks about a 
possible hike in taxes, as opposed to what he promised during 
last year's campaign, and when the Minister of Finance is 
juggling with the idea of taxing RRSPs.
<P>
	Naturally, this government lacks imagination in the fiscal 
area as in all other areas of management. They also promised a 
stable and balanced monetary policy. Interest rates have 
increased since spring and should increase some more during 
the coming months because you have to reduce the deficit if you 
want to relieve the upward pressure on interest rates and give 
more flexibility to the Bank of Canada so that it can, in turn, 
lower interest rates. So goes the vicious circle of indebtedness.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois agree that government finances 
must be overhauled to reduce the risk premium Canada pays on 
interest rates, mainly on foreign loans. The government's 
budget policies should aim for a far more substantial reduction 
in the federal deficit. The Liberals are not on the right track and 
will not be able to keep their campaign promise of a balanced 
and stable monetary policy.
<P>
	The red book says, and I quote: ``A number of government 
programs and tax expenditures-some of which have been 
identified by the auditor general-are inefficient, poorly 
managed, or motivated by purely economic reasons. Just as we 
are proposing new measures to grow the economy, we will 
examine such programs with the objective of reducing waste and 
inefficiency and promoting economic growth. Expenditure 
reductions will be achieved by cancelling unnecessary 
programs, stream-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7188"> 7188 </A></B>
<P>
lining processes, and eliminating duplication. This effort will 
take place in partnership with provincial governments''.
<P>
	How ridiculous this sounds when we read it again today, a 
year after the Liberals came to power. Ridiculous, especially 
when we compare the red book with the two instruction manuals 
it spawned last week: <I>A New Framework for Economic Policy</I> 
and <I>Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate</I>. Upon reading these two 
documents, which list a set of principles and indulge in a lot of 
wishful thinking and which are to be used for consultation 
purposes, we realize that, for the government, social security 
reform remains the cornerstone of deficit reduction and of 
improving the state of government finances.
<P>
	According to the Minister of Finance, improving the state of 
government finances will be achieved, as we said earlier, 
through cuts in unemployment insurance, student loans and 
social security. The jobs and growth strategy, says the minister, 
is based on the following main themes: encouraging Canadians 
to adapt to change; rethinking the role of the state; putting the 
economy on the right track; and creating a healthy fiscal and 
monetary climate by reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GSP by 
1996-97, the ultimate objective being to balance the budget.
<P>
	Aside from a few very general principles, the government's 
new policy framework merely reminds us once again of the red 
book's objective which is still to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent 
of GDP before the end of the government's mandate. There are 
no concrete proposals for meeting this objective, aside from a 
number of haphazard budget cuts.
<P>
	Given the sorry state of Canada's finances and the resulting 
prohibitive foreign debt, the Liberals' target of $39.7 billion in 
1994-1995, again barely under the $40 billion mark despite the 
strong economic recovery, strikes the Bloc Quebecois as overly 
cautious and irresponsible in view of the size of the problem.
<P>
	In order to point up the reduction in the deficit, you will recall 
that the Liberals overestimated the deficit in 1993-1994, the last 
year the Conservatives were in power, at $45.7 billion. The real 
deficit that year, however, was $42 billion. Without a change in 
policy, the government told us, the projected deficit that year 
would have been $41.2 billion. In our view, the minister's 
deficit reduction objective is still not high enough.
<P>
	In a context of economic recovery, with Canadians willing to 
do their part, what kind of leadership is it to lower the deficit 
from $41.2 billion to $39.7 billion? This is a paltry $1.5 
billion-it is laughable, really. The minister is not even certain 
that his timid attempts to improve the situation will achieve 
their purpose. As he told us last week, these two documents will 
be submitted for consultation. I, for one, have always believed 
that the government was elected to make decisions and to 
manage. The Liberals are trying to change the art of governing. 
For them, it seems to mean consulting.
<P>
	Not only has it set its sights too low, but the Liberal 
government is erratic and hesitant when it comes to specific 
measures to eliminate an uncontrolled debt that has become 
uncontrollable under their leadership.
<P>
	To reduce the deficit, the government must find enough 
manoeuvring room to meet its budget goals, which we find, as I 
said earlier, a little too ambitious based on the following 
measures. The government promised to tackle waste, 
duplication and mismanagement in order to reduce operating 
expenditures. Yet, year after year, the Auditor General finds 
numerous cases of waste and mismanagement. Many of his 
recommendations are not acted on. What about program 
assessment? Program expenditures now exceed $120 billion, 
while most federal programs evaluated cost less than $250 
million.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	No large-scale program has been evaluated yet, either in 
government departments or Crown corporations. On what basis 
and under what criteria will the minister responsible for 
reviewing all government programs conduct the promised 
review? Will this review integrate the Auditor General's 
recommendations? We do not know any more than that.
<P>
	You will agree with me that the measures proposed by the 
Minister of Finance to create a healthy financial climate are not 
exactly innovative and ambitious. As the Bloc Quebecois 
already said, the minister only describes the government's 
balance sheet without proposing any concrete measure to reduce 
the deficit.
<P>
	The reform of social programs remains this government's 
framework to reduce the government deficit. Although the 
government made a commitment not to increase taxes, the 
minister says in the document that ``broadening the tax base is 
preferable to raising tax rates''. What does this position mean 
for the future?
<P>
	In the same document the minister says that given the scope of 
the measures needed to meet its deficit-reduction goals, the 
government must contemplate tax initiatives. This means that 
we must expect new tax increases at some point.
<P>
	Tax breaks on retirement savings, or RRSPs, represent almost 
$15 billion, $14.9 billion to be more precise. The Liberal 
government must be tempted to eliminate RRSP deductions, 
which would reduce its annual deficit by 37 per cent in one fell 
swoop, without any additional streamlining effort. RRSPs 
account for 55 per cent of all the government's tax expenditures 
including the credit for charitable donations, the tax credit for 
research and development, the exemption for injured workers' 
compensation, and the largest, making up 55 per cent of the 
total, is RRSPs. How tempting to eliminate just one, that one, 
which would affect only one group of taxpayers. Only one group 
of taxpayers would be targeted and in one fell swoop more than 
half the tax expenditures would be eliminated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7189"> 7189 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is preparing us for this type of cut that will 
affect mainly the middle class. When he says that he must 
consider tax initiatives, the minister is surely thinking of 
RRSPs.
<P>
	No offence to the member for St. Albert, with whom I agree, 
but the government has no detailed plan on how to balance the 
budget and will not table such a plan, nor does it have a 
timetable and a clear vision of the government's role in the 
economy.
<P>
	To conclude, I will add that this government does not seem to 
want to keep its commitment not to raise taxes, it is vacillating 
and only as a last resort did it admit that it had to make more cuts 
to achieve its future budget objectives.
<P>
	This government prefers to re-examine government programs 
instead of tackling the machinery of government as such. This 
government promised us ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' in the 1993 election 
campaign. Today, it tells us only about cuts and reducing the 
deficit. Its rhetoric varies depending on the prevailing 
circumstances, you will agree.
<P>
	This government observes and consults. It gives the people no 
concrete measures except for cuts in social programs and in 
transfers to the provinces. It is counting on the economic 
recovery in order to avoid making painful decisions, which will 
be even more painful because of its indecision.
<P>
	This government no doubt has a work plan that it is 
developing in secret while its leading lights consult left and 
right. Even the Prime Minister is consulting the health 
stakeholders to define the health care system for the next 
century in the absence of the provincial premiers and health 
ministers.
<P>
	In the end, the <I>Toronto Star</I>'s allegations are being confirmed: 
the shortfall of the next two fiscal years will be recovered 
through made up for with cuts in social programs. That is what 
this government's political agenda boils down to. I believe that 
Quebecers and Canadians deserve better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the interesting comments made by my 
distinguished colleague, the hon. member for La Prairie. I want 
to ask him if he finds it normal that a government running a 
country on the verge of bankruptcy tolerate having accounts 
receivable of $6.4 billion and a revenue minister who does not 
do much to recover that amount?
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member finds it reasonable that a government 
on the verge of bankruptcy play war games and spend $2 million 
in just 48 hours?
<P>
	Does he find it reasonable that the parliamentary restaurant, 
on the sixth floor of this building, incurred losses of $2 million 
last year presumably because its clients, including senators and 
others, would leave without paying their bills?
<P>
	Does he find it reasonable that a government running a 
country on the verge of bankruptcy would have an agency such 
as the CSE, which has over 1,000 employees and an annual 
budget of 250 to 260 million dollars? These people are not all 
spies but, seemingly, several of them are.
<P>
	Does the hon. member find it normal that this same 
government accept the fact that large amounts of money in 
family trusts are exempt of normal taxes?
<P>
	Since my colleague used to be an alderman in his home town, I 
also want to ask him if he agrees that the federal government 
should follow the example of municipalities and table a 
balanced budget? If the government insists on playing Santa 
Claus, it should not do so at the expense of future generations. 
Instead, it should have the courage to raise taxes. It is easy to be 
generous when you know that it is the third or fourth generation 
down the line which will have to pay for the goodies handed out 
now.
<P>
	Finally, does he find it normal that a government borrow, 
often from foreign countries, to pay the interest on the deficit for 
the current year?
<P>
	There are several questions. I would appreciate it if the hon. 
member for La Prairie could answer most of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from the 
Bloc Quebecois for this array of very relevant questions.
<P>
	First, I would like to tell you that I agree completely with what 
you said, especially concerning the accounts payable. Naturally, 
the Canadian government was often compared to a business; 
thank God it is not a private business, because if it were, either a 
small, a medium-sized or a large business, it would have gone 
bankrupt a long time ago.
<P>
	What you said about the accounts payable is also true for the 
accounts receivable. How many millions if not billions of 
dollars in taxes are not collected by the Canadian government? 
As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I 
can say that our committee has the opportunity to analyze the 
recommendations made by the auditor general. Year in and year 
out, the Auditor General says the Canadian government lacks 
rigour in the collection of accounts receivable, meaning taxes, 
as well as in the area of accounts payable.
<P>
	You talked earlier of the restaurants here, on the Parliament 
Hill. Recently, I read that these restaurants do not even make 
enough money to pay their staff. This is absolutely absurd. 
Basically, this is a sign of the laxness that the Canadian 
government has been guilty of for many years. In previous 
years, in collective bargaining,  the Canadian government, as an 
employer, never stood up to the labour unions. And we are now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7190"> 7190 </A></B>
<P>
in the absurd situation where the revenues of the restaurants do 
not even cover their manpower costs. The restaurants on the Hill 
do not even make enough money to cover the fixed costs, let 
alone the variable costs.
<P>
	You also talked about the $2 million it costs the Canadian 
government to play war for 48 hours. You were surely alluding 
to the William Tell competition that was mentioned here last 
week. Clearly, the whole defense policy must be reviewed. The 
Department of National Defence has a $12 billion budget. We 
have seen the government try to close bases here and there in 
Canada. That is not the Bloc's position. We think that the 
defence budget should be reduced by at least 25 per cent, which 
represents about $3 billion. The government just has to say no to 
these war games and to other decisions made by the generals. We 
know that, historically, in Canada, as in the United States and 
many other countries, oftentimes it is not the Minister or the 
Prime Minister who runs the Department of National Defence 
but the generals.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	When the generals submit their budgetary requirements each 
year, they ask for a lot of what I would call military hardware to 
play war games. As far as I know, the Second World War ended 
in 1945. It is true that Canada was involved in the Korean War. It 
is also true that we have sent troops to several countries as part 
of a multinational force in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, 
but I do not think that it justifies a $12 billion budget today. It is 
us, taxpayers, who have been paying year after year for this 
military hardware to please the generals and other army leaders. 
I think the time has come for the civilians to regain control of 
this $12 billion defence budget.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The municipalities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Municipalities, yes, I certainly agree with you, 
since I was a municipal councillor for 11 years in Ville 
Saint-Lambert, in my riding, on the South Shore of Montreal. 
They never had a deficit in Saint-Lambert or in any of the 
neighbouring towns or anywhere in Quebec, for that matter. If a 
town runs a deficit in one year, the deficit is transferred to the 
following year's budget. If this principle were applied by the 
federal government, it would not have a $500 billion deficit 
today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Longueuil, for a brief question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
following question for my colleague and it is that for the past 20 
years the government has been living on credit and has borrowed 
nearly $1 billion for every million people we have in Canada. 
Does this not prove the federal system does not work, that it is 
very expensive and that instead of blaming the government, 
perhaps we should blame the system? The Conservatives did not 
do a better job, the Liberals before them did not, and today's 
Liberals are not doing a better job either. So there is a  problem, 
and the problem is not the government as such but the federal 
system, which does not work. Does the hon. member agree?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly with the 
hon. member for Longueuil. The government's financial 
bankruptcy-its cumulative debt of more than $500 billion 
which goes back to the end of the seventies-proves that 
Canadian federalism does not work.
<P>
	If you will allow me to use the following metaphor, it is as if 
Canada were a large multinational corporation with 10 branches 
in 10 different provinces or countries, and for more than 30 
years, there has been constant squabbling between the branches 
in the provinces and the central government in Ottawa or 
somewhere else, and they can never agree on how to do things.
<P>
	In the private sector, to keep the shareholders happy, they 
would have made the necessary decisions right away and either 
decentralized or created other independent corporations for 
these entities. What we are asking as Quebecers is to have an 
independent entity so that we are politically autonomous, which 
would not preclude administrative agreements or agreements 
based on an economic union with the rest of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to participate in this debate.
<P>
	I would like to start by thanking the third party for giving us 
yet another opportunity to crystallize for the Canadian people 
the differences that exist between the Liberal philosophy toward 
the role and responsibilities of government and the Reform 
philosophy in that same regard.
<P>
	It was a year ago exactly today that the Canadian people 
elected 177 Liberal members to this House. I believe they did so 
because they believed and had confidence in our philosophy; 
one that said that it is important and necessary for the 
government to take fiscal management responsibilities 
seriously, that we must reduce the debt and the deficit. The 
Canadian people also agreed that there is more to the role of the 
Canadian government. They agreed with us that part of the role 
is to help create jobs and develop economic growth.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Contrast that with the Reform Party members who, as I saw 
them today in question period, were very happy to elect 52 
members from one region of the country, a very important 
region but one region. Their strategy is very telescopic, very 
single-minded, and says that the role of government is really to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7191"> 7191 </A></B>
<P>
get into power, slash and burn, cut the debt and deficit, fold up 
the tents and get on with it, get out of town.
<P>
	Every once in a while I wonder what it must be like to be a 
constituent in a Reform member's riding. I think of the young 
people who come to see me in my constituency, young people 
who have graduated from university and have been unable to get 
that important first job. They cannot get unemployment 
insurance and the alternative is welfare. They come to my office 
and we talk about the Canadian Youth Services. We talk about 
wage subsidies. We talk about different strategies whereby the 
government can impact and assist the young people in their 
search and their finding of a job.
<P>
	I do not know what it must be like to be a Reform member and 
be unable to talk about these strategies, to talk about a 
government providing these kinds of opportunities and actions 
that do in fact help get Canadians into the workforce, 
contributing and productive in our economy.
<P>
	We are here talking about the deficit and it is important. I have 
a few words I want to share in that regard. Many suggestions 
have been made about eliminating the deficit. Unfortunately, a 
significant number of those suggestions, including some made 
by hon. members in this House, are not based on a sound grasp of 
the facts.
<P>
	This afternoon I would like to discuss some of these 
misconceptions. Let me begin with a remedy much favoured by 
certain members of the opposition, eliminating social benefits 
for higher income Canadians. Of course there are some potential 
savings here but they are much smaller than is often claimed. 
Why? To begin with, many social programs already target 
benefits on the basis of need or income. The guaranteed income 
supplement is an example. So are spousal allowances, the child 
tax benefit and the GST credit. Other social benefits are reduced 
or recovered as income rises. Old age security, for instance, 
starts being recovered at about $53,000. Unemployment 
insurance is recovered at about $58,000 and the age credit at 
about $26,000.
<P>
	There is also an unfortunate truth faced by anyone who wants 
drastic cuts to elderly benefits. The fact is most elderly 
Canadians are at the lower end of the income scale. Almost 
three-quarters of our elderly have annual household incomes 
below $30,000. About half of all elderly benefits go to those 
who receive the guaranteed income supplement. That means 
individuals with incomes under $15,700 and couples under 
$23,800. In short, the notion that rich Canadians collect huge 
sums in social benefits is simply a myth and a mistake.
<P>
	Another common belief about our social programs is that 
much of the social security spending goes to cheats but that too 
is a myth. Cheating is not the culprit behind the high cost of 
social programs. Chronic dependency is.
<P>
	The rules for governing unemployment insurance for example 
have unwittingly encouraged chronic use, fostering dependency 
on certain industries and regions. This is precisely the kind of 
problem that calls for a careful rethinking of the way we 
structure our spending. What will be achieved by a draconian 
slash and burn approach? Does Reform believe that thousands of 
jobs will immediately appear for workers in depressed regions 
once they are forced off their UI dependency?
<P>
	Another silver bullet solution held out by Reform members is 
to slash government operating costs. They see Ottawa as a fat 
city and the public service as an easy target for the resentment of 
heavily taxed Canadians. Yes of course the reduction of 
operating costs is an important goal, one to which our 
government has demonstrated a commitment, but it can never be 
the principal source of the savings needed to address the deficit 
problem.
<P>
	The net cost of running the government and delivering 
programs represents only about 12 per cent of the total federal 
budgetary spending, about $20 billion. That is a lot of money but 
it is less than half the 1993-94 deficit. Even the most drastic 
cuts, even the absurd extreme of laying off every public servant 
would come nowhere close to solving our deficit problems.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Other facts speak loudly too. The cost of government has been 
repeatedly restrained in recent years including restraint 
measures in the last budget. In fact we have implemented 16 
specific expenditure reduction exercises over the past decade of 
which 12 had a direct impact on operating budgets of the 
government departments but operating costs exist for a reason 
whether the mythmakers want to believe it or not. It is futile to 
repeatedly cut back operating costs in isolation from the 
programs that give rise to those costs.
<P>
	There are other suggestions for eliminating the deficit that do 
not entail spending cuts at all. Some of these too are based on 
mistaken notions. For example we are often told that the 
government should sell off crown corporations. There may be 
good reasons for privatizing crown corporations but reducing 
the deficit is really not one of them.
<P>
	The impact of privatization on deficit is extremely limited. 
That is because crown corporations are already recorded as 
government assets. As a result the only situations in which the 
deficit would be reduced by privatization are those where the 
assets could be sold for more than their current book value. I 
doubt whether there are many such cases at this time.
<P>
	We also hear that the government could drastically reduce the 
deficit by lowering interest rates. People who hold this view 
forget that interest rates are not set by the government but by 
investors. The Bank of Canada can influence short term interest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7192"> 7192 </A></B>
<P>
rates but it cannot dictate long term rates or the cost of 
borrowing in international  markets. Who would buy our bonds 
if we offered uncompetitive rates?
<P>
	Occasionally the argument is still made that the government 
should increase the money supplied to finance the debt but 
history has shown time after time that this is a bogus and a 
bankrupt solution. Printing money to pay down the debt failed 
miserably. That is because it ultimately fuels inflation because 
people realize that their money is worth less. The ultimate result 
is that printing more money to solve your fiscal problems leads 
directly to higher interest rates and higher debt servicing costs. 
In the end the problem has not been solved. It has been 
worsened.
<P>
	So far I have focused on a number of proposals for deficit 
cutting that are based on what we might call myths. My purpose 
in doing this is not to accept a defeatist attitude because the 
deficit must be wrestled to the ground and this government has 
and will do just that. But you cannot defeat the deficit with 
shallow snake oil solutions founded on illusion. What we need 
as I said earlier is a careful rethinking of the role of government 
and the way we spend. It is precisely what the government is 
doing.
<P>
	As the finance minister has said the time of nibbling away at 
the margins is over. The government's comprehensive strategic 
approach is reflected in a new framework for economic policy 
that was released last week. It is also reflected in the 
comprehensive reform of our social security system that is 
already under way as well as the ongoing reviews of science and 
technology, defence and foreign policy, and small business 
policy.
<P>
	I want to focus this afternoon on the federal program review. 
To my mind this is precisely the kind of meaningful selective 
approach to cost cutting that has been absent from deficit 
reduction exercises in recent years. It is precisely why earlier 
efforts have not succeeded.
<P>
	What is program review? It refers to a fundamental review of 
all federal programs and activities besides the major statutory 
transfer payments to provinces and people which are being 
reviewed separately as I mentioned.
<P>
	It includes examining grants and contributions, tax 
expenditures, cost recovery and overhead. The goal of this 
review is a more effective, smaller and affordable government, 
one that concentrates on its core roles and responsibility.
<P>
	Each government department and agency has been asked to 
review and assess its activities against six guidelines. These 
guidelines are as follows: First, does a program area or activity 
continue to serve the public interest? Second, is there a 
legitimate and necessary role for government in this program 
area or activity? Is it really ours to control? Third, is the current 
role of the federal government appropriate or should the 
program be transferred to the provinces?
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	What activities or program should or could be transferred in 
whole or part to the private or voluntary sector? If a program 
continues how can its efficiency be improved? Finally, is the 
program affordable in light of the current fiscal situation?
<P>
	As a result of this review some programs and services will be 
streamlined and some may be eliminated, particularly those that 
can be provided more efficiently by the private sector or that 
overlap with services provided by other levels of government.
<P>
	Some of the changes resulting from the review will be 
announced in the 1995 budget. Others will be implemented over 
several years. The end result will be a smaller and more 
affordable government, but that government will continue to 
protect the most vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	The federal program review is only one facet of the 
government's efforts to put our fiscal house in order. I have 
spoken of it at some length because I believe it provides an 
excellent example of the kind of approach that must be taken to 
deficit reduction; an informed, thoughtful and efficient 
approach, one that contrasts sharply with the draconian 
knee-jerkism proposed today by some hon. members.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to utilize this kind of approach with 
the private sector and it has worked very effectively to improve 
productivity, to help companies focus on what they should focus 
on. The strategy that I am proud of is part of our Liberal 
philosophy. It suggests that we understand that there are things 
that we cannot deny and that is that straight across the board cuts 
do not recognize differences in individual needs of Canadians 
and our institutions.
<P>
	I would like to make one final point. In his presentation last 
week before the Standing Committee on Finance, the Minister 
of Finance emphasized that the government has clear principles 
to guide it in making the decisions necessary to achieve its 
deficit target. The minister said, for example, the deficit 
reduction measures should weigh on the side of program 
spending cuts over revenue increases, that selective, strategic 
cuts are to be preferred over across the board cuts and that the 
most vulnerable in our society must not be left behind.
<P>
	The minister also made it clear that the government would not 
be making its decisions alone, that it wanted to hear from 
Canadians. I believe that the open, democratic consultation 
process that the government has put in motion is exactly what is 
needed if we are to put an end to the glib solutions and nibbling 
away at the margins.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7193"> 7193 </A></B>
<P>
	I have every confidence that Canadians will recognize the 
importance of and contribute significantly to the kind of 
thoughtful approach our fiscal problems in Canada need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for her intervention. I thank her for 
indicating that this motion gives her party the opportunity to 
crystallize Liberal policy. That is exactly what this debate is 
about.
<P>
	We would like to know what the Liberals really plan to do. We 
would like to know what the government process is going to be. 
We would like to know how they are going to reduce the 
spending she has talked about.
<P>
	Despite the pejorative comments that have been made by the 
member about the Reform policies, there are still questions 
about what the Liberals are going to do. These questions are 
raised by this member's speech. She has discussed crown 
corporations. Should we privatize crown corporations? The 
question is also can we afford to continue subsidizing crown 
corporations at the rate at which they are being subsidized 
today?
<P>
	She talked about the open consultation process. There is real 
doubt in my mind about this process. It seems as though people 
are being told: ``Look how hard it is to cut expenditures''. 
Nobody in this House believes it is easy, but to say to people: 
``Let us see how you can do it if we cannot'' is not really a 
consultation process. There is nothing being put before the 
people for them to work with. Just to say how difficult it is and 
``can you show us how to do it'' is not a consultation process.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The question still is how will the government reduce the 
deficit. That is what we are asking. We are not asking more 
questions about if, when and may. How will the government 
reduce the deficit? How will the government regain control of 
the financial position of our nation?
<P>
	That is the question I put to the member, not to decry about 
other policies, not to say the member has not told us how to do it. 
What is in mind? The government has been waiting for years to 
take power. The problem has grown in complexity and intensity 
for those years. By the time all the processes are finished the 
problem will be advanced that much further. We will likely need 
to have more consultations.
<P>
	How will the government reduce the deficit? What is its 
vision? That is what we are asking.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his questions. There are many in his intervention.
<P>
	I think our process is very clear. I would refer him to the lilac 
book, as the member for Capilano-Howe Sound called it. A 
very clear set of documentation was presented by the Minister of 
Finance last week. He talked about our commitment and our role 
in economic development. He talked about our responsibilities 
in terms of fiscal management. He identified very clearly  the 
areas that Canadians can address and look at as they make their 
considerations and deliberations on how we should manage the 
process.
<P>
	In talking about the process of consultation I feel it is an 
exceptionally important part of the way we want government to 
behave and manage itself in the 1990s and into the 21st century. 
Canadians all through the course of the election campaign talked 
about feeling divorced from the government process, about the 
fact that they were never consulted or asked; things were just 
done to them. We are doing our best to change that. Through the 
formal consultation process, the process that will be held by the 
finance committee, Canadians will have a real opportunity to 
participate.
<P>
	I would suggest as well that each individual member has the 
opportunity to participate at the grassroots level in his or her 
riding; to take documentation that has been presented and 
prepared for us by the Ministry of Finance and share it with 
individuals, with groups and with people in their ridings; to help 
work one on one with people to understand the issues; to discuss 
the strategies and the possibilities; and to bring that information 
to the standing committee, to the House and to the minister 
directly.
<P>
	As for the question on whether or not the minister and our 
government will make the decisions, we will make the 
decisions. They will be very clear at the time of the budget. Prior 
to that the critical point is to talk to Canadians. We are talking 
about the need to make changes, the type of which we have never 
seen before. These issues will impact on each and every one of 
us and each and every Canadian we represent. They have every 
right to be consulted; they have every right to contribute.
<P>
	In my role as a member of Parliament I have a responsibility 
to get that information from them and I will do that. The member 
should not be mistaken: our minister has made a commitment to 
reach our deficit targets and he will find them in the budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's remarks and I was 
shocked by her referring to ``chronic use of unemployment 
insurance'' as if implying that people who are on UI, year after 
year, or rather frequently, are doing it on purpose. I could not 
help but think of the peat bog workers in Rivière Ouelle, or the 
hotel and inn employees in Rivière-du-Loup, or the forestry 
workers in Saint-Jean-de-Dieu and wonder what they must 
think of what is going on in this government.
<P>
	This government, which was elected to create jobs, has not 
been giving much hope to people in the regions. It has been 
telling them: ``We are going to create a two-tier unemployment 
insurance system which will penalize those who use it often; at 
the same time, we are going to reduce the investment tax credit 
which allowed regions to create permanent jobs and seasonal 
workers to go on from seasonal jobs to regular jobs, all year 
round''.  By reducing the investment tax credit, the message the 
government is giving them is this: ``It is your own fault if you 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7194"> 7194 </A></B>
<P>
are still on UI. It is your problem and it is up to you to solve it''. 
The government gives them a contradictory message.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In the outlying regions, people are reacting to the fact that the 
government is getting ready to cut transport subsidies in an 
unfair manner, without even looking at the economic impact. 
For the past 50 or 60 years, in eastern Quebec and Atlantic 
Canada, there has been a tradition of transport subsidies which 
could disappear without anyone knowing the impact it will have 
if the rules of the game, of the market, are not respected. People 
who work in these areas and who will be hurt by these decisions 
are wondering what is going on in Ottawa, and why decisions 
which are detrimental to regional development are made.
<P>
	The other example is the government's withdrawal from 
transport, airports, harbours and railways. It is getting out of all 
these areas at the same time and people are asking me what a 
radio personality was asking me the other day, which is: Who is 
going to stop all this? Who is going to get a handle on this? I 
would like the member to tell me how she would cut wasteful 
expenditures and increase revenues since, in her remarks, she 
talked a lot about higher revenues and what we could all do to do 
our fair share. Would she consider taxing family trusts and thus 
bring some degree of fairness to our tax system?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, again a number of 
important questions were asked in that dissertation.
<P>
	I want to make clear that neither my government nor I is 
pointing a finger at forestry workers or seasonal workers and 
saying it is their problem. Quite the opposite. We are suggesting 
that we recognize the system is at fault and the system needs to 
be repaired.
<P>
	In response to the issue of dealing with subsidies and making 
cuts to agencies and other organizations, we are clearly and 
actively using a consultative approach to understand precisely 
what the hon. member is suggesting. We recognize that making 
cuts for the sake of cuts is not appropriate. We have to 
understand that when we make subsidy cuts there will be a 
response. Every action creates a reaction and we have to think 
them through before we slash and burn holus-bolus. It is not our 
strategy. It is not our philosophy. We will not do that.
<P>
	Finally, we have to recognize that we are going through 
significant change. Government is going to change. Canadians 
will be dealing with change. We have to accept the difficulties 
there. Part of doing a credible job, a good job, is to involve 
Canadians in the process. I believe we have struck a perfect 
strategy to reach that goal.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise and join in the debate today. Here we are one 
full year to the day into our mandate. That is certainly cause for 
reflection but that is all, for we have barely moved from the 
status quo of doing nothing. Little has been achieved in 
addressing the deficit and debt problem. As I stand here I do not 
see myself slashing and burning, folding up the tent and saying 
let's go home as my hon. colleague from Brant suggested in her 
earlier remarks.
<P>
	The presentation I would like to make today is focused. It 
speaks of an ideology that all Reformers carry, that is 
recognizing that we as a nation have difficult choices to make. 
We are burdened with a federal debt that is more than $535 
billion. This bone crushing yoke demands more than $40 billion 
a year in interest payments. If we do not make some tough 
decisions today we will soon be unable to deal with it at all.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7195"> 7195 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	This is not fearmongering nor is it self-serving as some 
Liberals have been wont to say. Rather it is the tough talk needed 
to make every Canadian realize the magnitude of the problem 
we face. We in the Reform Party take pride in our approach, 
bringing difficult issues out into the open, addressing the 
problem and developing solutions.
<P>
	The challenges that face us today as legislators are really 
quite unique. We have the privilege to participate in the 
changing of our nation. We recognize that this great country still 
in its youth is growing, changing and finding its own identity. 
Part of finding its identity is to throw off the old mantle of 
programs that worked in the past when the nation was young and 
to establish new and stronger programs that will take us further 
into its next phase of maturity.
<P>
	The first step is recognizing that Canada now does too much 
for too many people and can no longer afford to do that. In 
attempting to be everything to everyone we have gone bankrupt. 
Our challenge is to determine what we need to do, to do it well, 
and to encourage individuals to assume responsibility for 
non-essential services.
<P>
	I have always focused upon priorities during debate. I believe 
today is no different as I look at the choices we must make as a 
nation and as a people. We in the Reform Party care about 
preserving Canada for the future for our children and their 
children. We envisage a country that takes care of those not able 
to do so in order that they may be able to contribute to the 
well-being of their families. We envisage a country that 
educates its children, ensures that they can get jobs, contributes 
to the well-being of Canada and thereby focuses on its future.
<P>
	There is no one in the House who lacks compassion at heart, 
and that is contrary to the somewhat pejorative suggestions of 
my colleague from Brant. Coupled with that compassion does 
come a practicality.
<P>
	There has been no better contributor to our nation's ill health 
than the federal deficit and debt. The Liberals would have 
Canadians believe that the Tories are completely responsible for 
the debt problem, but in reality the Tories did not have the 
political will to address the problems created originally by the 
Liberals.
<P>
	Let us consider these Liberals and their accompanying huge 
deficits while in power: in 1981, $14 billion; in 1982, $15 
billion; in 1983, $28 billion; in 1984, $32 billion; and in their 
last budget in fiscal 1984-85 year, a deficit of more than $38 
billion.
<P>
	A combination of three things needs to happen to make the 
finances of government more manageable. We need to spend 
less. We need to spend what we have better and more efficiently. 
We need to lead by example in government. Therefore I have 
decided to focus my remarks today on a particular area, that is 
the Department of Canadian Heritage and all its funded 
organizations. It is possible to find $1.6 billion in savings there.
<P>
	Let us be specific. If the finance minister wants to find cuts he 
can begin with what was once the department of 
multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is too costly. Canadians, 
especially first and second generation Canadians, do not support 
it. Multiculturalism funding serves only to disunite Canada by 
sectoring off parts of society instead of encouraging them to 
embrace their new nation. The responsibilities for race relations 
and cross-cultural understanding should be transferred to the 
Human Rights Institute and its accompanying appropriations 
should be discontinued.
<P>
	The community support and participation program funnels 
millions of dollars into special interest groups and serves as a 
tool to garner votes for the government. Its funding should be 
discontinued. The heritage language and cultures program 
provides grants to special interest groups and promotes the 
disunity of the country. Its appropriations should be 
discontinued.
<P>
	These arguments also apply for the community development 
program, the voluntary action program, the Canadian 
Multicultural Advisory Committee, the multiculturalism 
secretariat, the human rights program, the Canadian studies 
program and the open house Canada program.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	These programs provide a service only to those who use them. 
These are the taxpayers who should support them, privately and 
independently. The minister will save some $50 million by 
cutting funding to these programs.
<P>
	The single largest benefactor of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage funding is the CBC. This organization has enjoyed 
receiving parliamentary appropriations that have continued to 
grow on an annual basis. It now receives $1.1 billion a year from 
Canadian taxpayers. This creates an imbalance in a free market 
setting.
<P>
	Yet the CBC continually comes back with cap in hand year 
after year for more money, for supplementary appropriations. It 
continues to say to the government and the Canadian public: 
``Oh dear, we just cannot fulfil our mandate without more 
funding''.
<P>
	Every year it gets an increase and every year it continues to be 
dissatisfied. At what level of funding will the CBC say it has 
enough to do its job? The CBC is the epitome of government 
waste. Do not tell me that it has a mandate to promote Canadian 
unity while it remains completely unaccountable to the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	It is not subject to the Access to Information Act or to the 
Privacy Act. Further, it is exempt from sections 1 through 4 of 
part 10 of the Financial Administration Act, which makes the 
corporation also financially unaccountable to the Canadian 
taxpayer. These two factors give the CBC a further special 
status, giving it an even greater competitive edge.
<P>
	We are looking at ways of cutting spending in government to 
make government better. The CBC should be required to do the 
same. The Minister of Canadian  Heritage has recommended 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7196"> 7196 </A></B>
<P>
that Canadians pay a new entertainment tax to generate revenue 
for the CBC. Canadians are already taxed to the hilt.
<P>
	The finance minister said we do not need new taxes, we need 
to spend what we have more efficiently.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage has stated publicly that he 
favours partial privatization of the CBC. The government 
should order this forthwith.
<P>
	While we are on the topic of efficiency, let us look at the 
bloated government bureaucracy in desperate need of 
downsizing. The Minister of Canadian Heritage is also 
responsible for the Public Service Commission. In light of the 
recent report in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> describing how seven people 
double dipped after receiving their severance packages, it is 
clear that there is much housecleaning that needs to be done.
<P>
	The government should immediately adopt the auditor's 
recommendation and ensure that these seven people are 
appropriately punished for abusing the public trust. That is what 
this is all about, the public trust. This means in the very least 
recovering the amounts given in those golden handshakes with 
interest and the removal of those individuals from any positions 
they hold.
<P>
	Going after these people is not going to save much money but 
it will send a clear and unequivocal message to the Canadian 
people and their public servants that the days of the abuse of 
public trust are gone.
<P>
	Consider also as examples of government waste the 
following: the 13 members of the historic sites and monuments 
board who chalked up over $78,000 in travel expenses in 1993 
and the 31 members of the National Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women, government appointed people, who spent 
more than $133,000 travelling.
<P>
	The government does have a unique opportunity. There is 
consensus in this House that we need to cut our spending. What 
we now need is consensus on where to cut and how quickly to do 
it. I challenge the finance minister and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage to take a good hard look at those programs currently 
funded by government and choose only those that the Canadian 
taxpayers will support.
<P>
	It is the Canadian taxpayer after all who we are here to serve. I 
ask the government to support this common sense motion made 
today on behalf of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to challenge the member for Calgary Southeast's assertions at 
the beginning of her speech to the effect that this government 
has no recognition whatsoever of the need to cut the debt and to 
deal with the deficit.
<P>
	I cannot believe the member has not been listening to the 
statements of the Minister of Finance either in this House or 
outside the House that clearly indicate-surely she must give 
some form of recognition-that this government has recognized 
the problem of the debt. I  have heard the Minister of Finance 
say over and over again that we cannot allow this debt to 
accumulate at the rate it is. He uses the same figures as the 
member uses. It seems to me that the difference is that we 
recognize the debt. We recognize that we cannot go on paying 
$40 billion a year in interest rates. When that represents the 
huge proportion that it does of the Government of Canada's 
annual spending of $160 billion it is totally intolerable. 
However, I have heard the finance minister say that before.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The difference between us is whether we go at this as a 
surgeon goes at a problem or whether we go at it the way a 
butcher would butcher an animal waiting to be slaughtered. That 
is the difference between the government and the approach 
which the member takes.
<P>
	I sat and listened to her talk about the CBC, which I do not 
have time to comment on. I heard what she had to say about the 
heritage department and multicultural programs. I also heard 
her talk about the language programs whereby the multicultural 
and heritage language groups enable Canadians to maintain 
their languages.
<P>
	I would suggest to the member that she speak to the trade 
critic in her party and find out the evidence we in the foreign 
affairs and international trade committee have heard about. 
There is a need for Canadians to be knowledgeable about other 
cultures and particularly the value which cultures such as the 
Chinese, the Koreans and others can bring with their own 
language and their own culture to advance Canadian interests. 
These are Canadian taxpayers spending money so that 
Canadians will benefit. We will receive tremendous benefits out 
of this in a future multicultural world that we are going into.
<P>
	If we cut the programs the member suggests, I suggest to her 
that Canada will be less rich in a future world which will require 
more knowledge, more language and more competence among 
Canadians in the very areas she wants to cut out with her meat 
cleaver approach to deficit reduction.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not know if there was a question there. 
There was surely a comment. Would you like to address the 
comment?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find 
it rather offensive to have comments that I have made today 
referred to as butchering. Something in my mind finds it rather 
repulsive when I think of the word butchering. I stood here and 
said that there is not a person in this House who does not have a 
compassionate heart, not one. I believe that as I stand here.
<P>
	What we are involved in is a debate. Sometimes I find 
responding to the Liberals like playing dodge ball with a bunch 
of grade threes. Having said that, I would like to say that when I 
was growing up in my household, it was a multicultural 
household. My grandparents were from Norway and from 
Yugoslavia. While I was growing up  the motto in our family was 
you pay for it as you go. All I am asking is that if you are going to 
use a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7197"> 7197 </A></B>
<P>
program or you want access to a part of Canada's heritage you 
pay for it yourself.
<P>
	I am not saying anything about not coming to understand your 
country or coming to understand anything else about others who 
live here, but you pay for it yourself. That is how I grew up. I can 
stand here and speak from some experience in that regard 
because I saw my family do that. It paid as it went.
<P>
	I have to tell the hon. member that there sure as heck was not 
very much money there sometimes either to do that but we all 
survived and survived very well, thank you. I have a great deal 
of compassion for others in this country who do come from other 
places in this land.
<P>
	The last thing I want to say to the hon. member is that I am 
going to let the numbers do the talking. The federal debt 
accumulated in 1974 since Confederation was $25 billion. The 
total federal debt as of now at $535 billion-plus represents a 
20-fold increase in 20 years. The total provincial debt is $186.5 
billion. To say that we have to go slow and nibble at the edges, 
slash and burn, that is not what we are talking about here. We are 
talking about some rational decision making and some hard 
choices. Believe me Canadians, the ones I talked to in my riding, 
are certainly ready for those kinds of actions to take place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I give the floor to the hon. member for 
Longueuil. We have about a minute and a half.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> For me?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> For both of you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> You will have to give me the 
floor another time, Mr. Speaker, because I have so much to say. I 
just want to say that I agree to a great extent with the member for 
Calgary Southeast.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	But there is something I do not understand. For example, she 
did not talk about the efficiency of government 
management-she made a point of the fact that when we pay for 
a service, we must realize that we are actually paying for a 
service, but when it comes from Ottawa, people think that the 
money comes from somewhere like heaven, they do not know 
where it comes from. People keep making demands and getting 
things and do not know where the money comes from until they 
realize that Canada is broke.
<P>
	That is what she did not mention and that is why I ask her if 
she agrees that radical decentralization would make people 
realize why they are paying and I ask her whether she agrees 
with me. If they realize what they are paying for, perhaps they 
will spend with less abandon.
<P>
	I sincerely believe that we will have a prosperous future by 
decentralizing and making individuals responsible. That is what 
we want to do: decentralize. We want Quebec to be sovereign 
because we believe that the  federal government is too 
centralizing. It centralizes so much that it makes good 
management impossible. That is why we want to go so far. That 
is what even the Reform Party is not able to understand and the 
Liberal Party has not understood it for a very long time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. The hon. Secretary of State 
for Parliamentary Affairs. Excuse me. You will forgive a rookie 
in the Chair. I missed one. Excuse me, Alfonso.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think you are doing a fine job. I am also a rookie. You 
are an experienced parliamentarian. I appreciate this 
opportunity to address the House this afternoon.
<P>
	The resolution before the House requests the government to 
table a clear, detailed plan to show how and when it intends to 
balance the budget, including a clear statement of its vision of 
the role of the government in the economy in order for the 
people of Canada to debate the plan and vision.
<P>
	We need that plan if we are to change the present course from 
government overspending to working within our means. To 
effect that change or any other change three things are required.
<P>
	First, we must recognize the problem. As Andrew Coyne said 
so clearly in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> yesterday, the deficit is not the 
problem anymore. It is the debt. It was fine to aim for a balanced 
budget ten years ago, but $300 billion in debt later is simply 
inadequate. That is the problem, the debt and not the deficit.
<P>
	The second thing that needs to be done to effect change is 
understand the implications of what will happen if we do 
nothing to solve the problem. Third is accepting responsibility 
to do what is necessary.
<P>
	These are sound principles that all people who have anything 
to do with the change agree on and all sides of this House agree 
on. The grey book is full of sound principles but it falls short by 
failing to provide a means by which principles can be made 
practical. It is time that the government took control of 
accepting its own principles and put them into action, not just 
talking about them but showing the courage to act upon them. 
The key lies in knowing which principles are crucial, which 
principles will meet the challenge of reducing spending and 
create a dynamic economy.
<P>
	First, knowledge and technology are the new natural resource. 
Second, translating knowledge and technology into practical, 
revenue generating services will provide jobs. Third, Canadians 
will require training and to continue to learn throughout their 
lives the skills necessary to harness the new natural resource. 
Fourth, regional development will be redefined and by doing so 
will redefine government relationships with industry where 
industry determines its requirements and is self-funding and 
lessens the reliance on government  resources. Fifth, we need to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7198"> 7198 </A></B>
<P>
incorporate the global world into our marketplace and develop 
our exporting capabilities.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	As associate industry critic for the Reform Party, I believe 
much of this responsibility will fall to the Minister of Industry. 
The Department of Industry will be integral in the development 
and implementation of the new natural resource. However the 
department has not yet adequately set its focus to accomplish 
that. It must do so before it will be able to set a responsible 
budget, and it will need to do that in consultation with the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	We hope the program review currently under way will result 
in some answers. A noble start has been made in the recent 
science and technology review across Canada. If the Minister of 
Industry and the Minister of Finance truly recognize that 
knowledge and technology are the new natural resources of the 
country then we can reasonably expect to find answers to 
creating jobs and to reduce spending.
<P>
	Industry must take the lead in job creation. The beauty of 
knowledge and technology based industry is that they are 
globally capable, prompting an expanded marketplace and a 
demand for a greater workforce. Industry in this way will 
generate employment.
<P>
	Better implementation of research will foster development 
and Canada will begin to find practical ways of translating good 
ideas into revenue generation. With an increase in production 
and the revenue to support it, Canadians will be employed. Best 
of all, government will be able to reduce its expenditures.
<P>
	With the creation of this new natural resource there will be no 
requirement for government to prop up industries and regions 
which have lost their economic livelihood through the 
depreciation of traditional resources. The new natural resource 
and knowledge and technology based workforce will no longer 
be indigenous to a particular part of the country. The have not 
status of some of the provinces will no longer exist. St. John's as 
well as Vancouver will be able to participate and benefit from 
the ability to farm the resource of knowledgeable people.
<P>
	Costs to the government of $803 million in regional spending 
could be eliminated. Regional support which was created to 
lessen a reliance on traditional resources will no longer be 
required except on the very smallest of levels to assist industry 
through transition. In fact, the very notion of regions may well 
disappear and the restriction of provincial boundaries will be 
transcended out of necessity.
<P>
	Industry will assume responsibility and take its rightful place 
as the generator of jobs and the patron of a sound fiscal 
environment. It is but one solution but a very important one. It 
will signal change, but a change that is essential and necessary. 
It will help government meet its main objective of reducing 
spending, creating  employment, and ultimately fighting the 
debt. Only government can set the wheels moving in this 
direction but it must commit to these objectives and it must 
provide a plan.
<P>
	As members in an employed society, Canadians will 
enthusiastically help to make that change. It can be done. I know 
it can be done. But we need the conviction of the government to 
do it, and we need it now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Okanagan Centre on his 
speech. Once the passions are defused from the House of 
Commons, I often hear very constructive suggestions from all 
members of the House, including members of the opposition.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member a question concerning his 
formula for prosperity. Would he not agree that what we need to 
have is a strong central government to implement the kind of 
programs that he is suggesting?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. The 
simple short answer to the question is yes, we need a strong 
central government. We also need strong decentralization so 
that the decisions that affect the people directly and 
immediately are as close to the people affected as possible. In 
many instances it requires that the local government and the 
provincial government play a very significant role.
<P>
	We must remember it is the central government which creates 
the environment for the marketplace to operate, for industry to 
find its way, and for the lower levels of government to do their 
jobs more effectively so that there is not this duplication that 
exists at the present time and where there is not this 
predetermination to ``fight for my turf and to get out of my 
turf''. We need to co-ordinate these things and that would be my 
answer to the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada's fiscal consolidation 
is an essential component of our economic strategy. We are fully 
aware that the ever-growing debt has a negative impact on our 
whole economy.
<P>
	A growing debt leads to tax hikes, as we saw under the 
Conservative government, discourages investors, pushes up real 
interest rates, forces us to reduce spending on important 
government programs and translates into a large external debt. 
For some years now, a larger portion of our budget has been 
spent on interest charges than on programs. The interest we must 
pay is now the main reason why the deficit will not go away.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7199"> 7199 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why the government is determined to stop the gradual 
and rapid deterioration of Canada's public finances. Of course, 
our first goal is to eliminate the deficit and substantially reduce 
the federal debt. But, in the meantime, we set for ourselves an 
intermediate goal that we can achieve provided that we remain 
vigilant and that everyone shares the burden. Within two years, 
that is, by the 1996-97 fiscal year, we will reduce the deficit to 3 
per cent of GDP, as we promised in the red book.
<P>
	The last time the annual deficit was limited to 3 per cent of 
GDP was in 1974, 20 years ago. Of course, to achieve our goal, 
we must take measures that will affect everyone in one way or 
another. Attitudes must change. Innovation must be 
emphasized. The dependence of some groups and sectors on the 
government must be reduced. We will do it by working hard on 
two fronts, as we have done since we were elected a year ago 
today.
<P>
	We will continue to stimulate the economy to create jobs and 
to increase our tax revenue; we will also continue to vigorously 
tighten our spending on all fronts and at every level. The engine 
of the economy is a dynamic private sector. Nevertheless, the 
government also has a role to play by showing leadership. In a 
knowledge-based economy, success depends on skills and the 
ability to innovate, two factors that can be influenced by 
government.
<P>
	The government can play a complementary role to that of the 
private sector. It can contribute to the innovation process, 
especially in the early stages of research and development. It 
can also promote the diffusion of state-of-the-art technologies 
to small- and medium-sized businesses. The state can ensure 
access to markets for our exporters and help them get a larger 
share of emerging new markets. It can also help develop the 
export capabilities of small- and medium-sized businesses.
<P>
	We feel it is important to keep the inflation rate between one 
and three per cent, in order to promote a stable economic 
climate. We fully recognize that we want to do a good job in that 
respect. In fact, our government made important decisions to 
that effect in the last year and the benefits are now starting to be 
noticeable. Indeed, over the last few quarters, businesses have 
seen their profits increase substantially.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The recovery is also apparent in that consumer demand 
increased by 3.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1994. Confidence 
is slowly being restored. Investments are on the rise and jobs are 
created. From January to September of this year, more than 
327,000 jobs were created. Most encouraging is the fact that 
almost all are full-time jobs. This has a significant impact on 
the mood of Canadians who are now beginning to sense a greater 
stability and are regaining hope.
<P>
	This is not to say that all the problems have been solved. Far 
from it. Unemployment remains high, much too high. Interest 
rates, which are largely influenced by the U.S. economy, have 
maintained their upward trend in all industrialized countries. 
And, more importantly, our national debt continues to increase.
<P>
	Obviously, the issue of public debt in Canada cannot be 
solved through economic growth alone. Some drastic measures 
must be taken to reduce spending and improve our taxation 
system if we are to succeed in reducing the debt.
<P>
	Our main target remains spending control. In order for our 
country to become more productive, the state itself must be 
productive. It must learn to become more efficient to help make 
our economy more productive. In this respect, I think everyone 
will agree that we are doing everything we can to implement the 
principles of sound management and to streamline 
expenditures. We want to eliminate or at least reduce 
government activities that do not have a high priority and 
concentrate our limited resources on the most important 
programs.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know that you yourself are involved in this 
ambitious effort to streamline our operating procedures. In fact, 
the implementation of the Gagliano Plan has already saved the 
administration of this House millions of dollars. We have taken 
initiatives at many levels: we use new technologies to reduce 
inventory; we have eliminated redundant services; we are 
asking certain sectors to be more realistic in the way they reflect 
market prices. We are asking everyone who works on Parliament 
Hill to do their share to reduce spending. Not surprisingly, the 
level of co-operation is very high. This is largely due, I am sure, 
to the spirit of fairness and equity that you, Mr. Speaker, have 
maintained during this process of rapid change.
<P>
	All members of this House have also had an opportunity to 
help streamline federal spending in the course of the many 
debates we have had for a number of weeks on the restructuring 
of federal departments. There again, the achievements are 
impressive.
<P>
	Under the previous government, the cabinet consisted of 40 
people, all heading large bureaucratic structures. Today, we are 
doing a better job with only 20 departments. The best part is that 
restructuring not only helps us save money but ensures that 
government services are more flexible, more efficient and more 
accessible to the public.
<P>
	Unfortunately, not all members opposite are taking the battle 
against the deficit seriously. The Bloc Quebecois members 
shout and hit theirs desks with their fists to show more 
forcefully that they want to fight the deficit but, everytime we 
propose concrete steps to do so, they are against them, 
especially if the cuts hit close to home. You should cut, says the 
Bloc, but not in our backyard. Are they really serious?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7200"> 7200 </A></B>
<P>
	As to the Reform Party, their approach to deficit reduction is 
not only unrealistic, it is plain dangerous. If we listened to them, 
the country would be thrown into a recession which would last 
our lifetime. We must continue on the path defined by the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance. We are going to carry on 
with our attack against the deficit and we are going to 
concentrate our efforts on job creation. Our goal is not only to 
increase the number of jobs, but also to contribute to the 
improvement of our standard of living and to the preservation of 
our principles of social justice.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion before the House leads me to believe that the 
earpieces of the Reform members are not working. It is either 
that or they have not been listening to the Minister of Finance 
when he has spoken on the government's fiscal policy. It also 
appears they have not read the grey book ``Creating a Healthy 
Fiscal Climate''. Had they heard the Minister of Finance speak 
to the Standing Committee on Finance or had they read the 
document they would know that our ultimate goal is a balanced 
budget.
<P>
	Yes, we absolutely share their realization that the vicious 
circle of rising debt and deficits must be broken. As the minister 
noted in his recent speech to the finance committee: ``If we 
don't do the job, we will fail at everything else''. We will win. 
We will not fail. Our party, our caucus, our cabinet and the Prime 
Minister are committed to reversing Canada's fiscal decline. I 
realize the Reform is also interested in reversing Canada's fiscal 
decline. However, unlike the Reform Party, we have presented a 
realistic strategy so the Canadian people will realize our 
objective.
<P>
	The fiscal update book sets out the scope of action needed to 
achieve the government's fiscal goals. It provides an accounting 
of government spending together with a detailed description of 
the source of government revenues. Reform does not have a grey 
book equivalent. In fact it has nothing but soft generalities, 
blanket statements about reducing the deficit to zero, or 
borrowed prescriptions.
<P>
	This document that the Minister of Finance presented to the 
finance committee contains the information necessary to begin a 
broad public debate on the choices to be made and the actions to 
be taken in the 1995 budget. Its intention is to help focus the 
1995 prebudget consultation.
<P>
	Let me say here that this is the first time in Canadian history 
that a government has opened the budget process to 
consultation. Before, the process was that the Minister of 
Finance would meet privately in his office with pressure groups 
whether they were from business, labour or social groups. Only 
on budget night would we learn what were his positions.
<P>
	A partial process was started right after the election last year. 
Through the reform of House procedures this year, we are able to 
have a process where every year the House finance committee 
will receive an economic statement from the minister and will 
go across the country to consult with Canadians and report to the 
minister. Then the minister can make his choice.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Canada's fiscal position impacts on each 
and every Canadian, as will the action to bring our debt and 
deficit under control. That is why we are determined to work in 
partnership with all Canadians to determine and implement a 
solution.
<P>
	The finance committee will hold nationwide public 
consultation on how to create an economy worthy of Canada's 
potential. The finance minister will be meeting with people 
from all walks of life to hear their ideas on issues. We want to 
know Canadians' budget policy views. They will assist us as we 
address the difficult choices which lie ahead.
<P>
	In the grey book we have laid out some principles and values 
which will apply to the difficult choices which face us. I would 
now like to turn to those principles.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Principle number one without doubt is that deficit reduction 
and debt control are essential parts of our strategy to create jobs 
through economic growth. Indeed there is no greater economic 
priority than to resolve this issue.
<P>
	Our government will reduce the deficit and control the debt. 
Doing so will certainly lower taxes and interest rates. This will 
ensure economic growth through increased productivity and 
investment, sustained job growth, entrepreneurial vigour and 
consumer confidence. However, the debt and deficit cannot be 
reduced overnight. To do as the Reform Party urged during the 
election and balance the budget in three years would unleash 
substantial and lasting economic difficulties on all Canadians. It 
would also violate the other guiding principles laid out in the 
fiscal book.
<P>
	For example, fairness must be a principle characteristic of any 
action we take to bring our fiscal situation under control. We 
must ensure that the most vulnerable in our society are not left 
behind. Expenditure reduction must not be an excuse to abandon 
those Canadians in greatest need. That is exactly what would 
happen under the Reform's draconian suggestions. They forget 
that transfers to individuals was the largest component of 
program spending in fiscal year 1993-94, over one-third of all 
program spending went directly to individuals. That includes 
elderly benefits, unemployment insurance, veterans pensions 
and allowances and transfers to Indians and Inuit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7201"> 7201 </A></B>
<P>
	In all honesty I cannot find the words when I think of the 
conditions the most vulnerable would face if Reform were 
sitting on this side of the House. Deficit reduction would be a 
mere accounting exercise. Let us not forget it is not merely an 
exercise out of an accounting book. We are talking about people.
<P>
	That will not happen with this government. Unlike Reform, 
we realize that deficit reduction has a significant impact on our 
broader economic and social goals. That is why in the grey book 
we have set priorities and made reasoned choices.
<P>
	For example, we have announced an interim target of 
reducing the deficit to no more than 3 per cent of the gross 
domestic product by fiscal year 1996-97. At 3 per cent of GDP, 
economic growth will exceed growth of the debt. We will then 
have an extraordinary opportunity to move toward a balanced 
budget.
<P>
	The question is: What actions do we take to get there? We 
believe that to hit our targets the budgetary action should weigh 
most heavily on the expenditure side. Canadians quite frankly 
are overtaxed. They know it and we know it. The government 
must do more with less. The bulk of our savings should come 
through cuts in program spending and not through higher taxes.
<P>
	Of course, as the Minister of Finance noted, Canadians must 
realize that if they want to avoid more taxes they must be 
prepared to support smaller programs, including programs that 
benefit them directly.
<P>
	That is why the Minister of Finance directed the committee to 
ask the specific question of Canadians who appear before it in 
the prebudget consultations: Where should we cut and by how 
much? Believe me, the minister is not looking for generalities. 
He gets enough of those from the Reform Party. He wants to 
know the trade offs, the details and specifics. He wants 
Canadians to put themselves in the government's shoes and 
make hard choices.
<P>
	The minister also wants to know if Canadians believe that our 
economic assumptions are appropriate, if our growth 
assumptions and our interest rate assumptions are prudent, and 
the reason is simple. We believe it is essential that government 
make prudent assumptions to guide its economic and fiscal 
projections.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	In my experience, and I have been in this place for about 10 
years, the Conservative government, Reform's Tory cousins, 
proved that missing fiscal targets destroys credibility and 
merely postpones the need for tougher measures in the future. 
However, meeting targets establishes and strengthens 
credibility for the future and is also considered reasonable 
progress.
<P>
	This Minister of Finance believes in meeting targets. He will 
meet his targets and we will have a better Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very attentively to the speech by 
my hon. colleague, who described in a general way the monster 
that Canada's debt has become. I wish to point out to my hon. 
colleague that this monster was created by the Liberals and the 
Conservatives. The Liberals created this debt under the 
guidance of the hon. Peter Trudeau and raised it to almost $200 
million. The Tories then brought it up to where it is today and the 
Liberals, on regaining office, assure us that it will reach $600 
billion very soon. We fully agree that the debt has become a 
monster.
<P>
	Second, my hon. colleague has just told us that we stand on 
the brink of bankruptcy, another statement which we totally 
agree with. I think that our comedians are often much better than 
politicians at describing some situations. A Quebec comedian, 
Daniel Lemire, is always saying that we should probably declare 
bankruptcy and start over under a new name. That is exactly 
what we will do soon.
<P>
	The government is now saying that we must deal with this 
monster, that we are on the verge of bankruptcy and that they 
must and will make cuts. They will cut unemployment 
insurance, social assistance, transfers to the provinces, increase 
education costs, generalize the GST-they will give it a 
different name but charge it on everything. They will probably 
eliminate the only tax shelter available to the middle class, 
RRSPs, and tax retirement funds. All this is sending out a clear 
message: they are attacking ordinary people. The Bloc 
Quebecois agrees that the debt should be tackled and that cuts 
should be made. This is not a problem. But we are against 
singling out ordinary people. That we disagree with.
<P>
	While complaining about the lack of money and the huge debt 
problem, they easily find the billions of dollars needed to 
finance an unprofitable project such as Hibernia. While telling 
us there is no money left, they easily find the hundreds of 
millions of dollars they throw out the window every year, 
according to the Auditor General of Canada. They also give tax 
credits worth millions of dollars to the hon. Peter Trudeau and 
Brian Mulroney for returning their papers to the government, 
while telling ordinary people that tax credits will be cut.
<P>
	My question is this: When cleaning stairs, one does not do 
only the bottom steps. I would like to know if my hon. colleague 
has ever cleaned stairs and if he realizes that he should start at 
the top and work his way down?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me clarify one thing: I 
never said that Canada was on the verge of bankruptcy. It goes 
without saying that the hon. member opposite would love to 
promote that idea, because it would serve his cause, which is 
Quebec's separation and the destruction of our country. Of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7202"> 7202 </A></B>
<P>
course we have financial problems. Every industrialized 
country in the  world does. So, let us not start saying that Canada 
is going bankrupt. Canada is in the same situation as the all 
industrialized countries-If you want an answer-Did you not 
make a big fuss about proprieties of the House, about the need to 
be polite-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to remind the hon. member that he must 
always address the Chair.
<P>
	Order. We will hear the answer of the Secretary of State.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was trying to provide an 
adequate answer to the hon. member who made a rather long 
speech.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	We will not target only one group. As I said clearly, if we are 
to succeed in alleviating our financial problems, we must target 
every sector in our society. This is why the Minister of Finance 
and the finance committee are currently asking Canadians to tell 
them how they feel the problem can be solved and where cuts 
should be made to ensure fairness. Indeed, we want to be fair and 
the only way to do that is to ask sacrifices not just from one 
group but from all Canadians.
<P>
	This has been the underlying principle of all the reforms 
announced by this government, even though the hon. member 
does not agree, for example, with the way we want to implement 
the social program reform. We can no longer afford to pay 
people to stay home. In fact, the Bloc Quebecois headquarters in 
Quebec City also denounced that situation. During the election 
campaign, it criticized every cut made by the Quebec Liberal 
government. Now that the Parti Quebecois is in office, it has 
decided that the Liberal government budget will remain 
untouched and that no changes are necessary.
<P>
	We are all faced with the same problem and separation is not 
the solution. The problem will be solved by doing like the rest of 
the world, that is by working together and trying to find 
solutions and share those solutions. I am convinced that when 
the new Quebec government holds its referendum, Quebecers 
will vote to stay in Canada and they will continue, along with the 
rest of the country, to work to solve our financial problems, to 
put some order in government finances and to build a country in 
which they will be happy to live.
<P>
	The fact is that in spite of our major problems, the United 
Nations just declared for the second time that Canada is the best 
country in which to live. I keep repeating to the hon. members 
opposite that there are millions of people in the world who 
would give everything to come to Canada. We are not bankrupt 
yet and I think Canada is still a pretty nice place to live.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> If you do 
not listen, you might as well be deaf. I would submit that the 
opposition benches are deaf, completely deaf. Their hearing has 
gone faulty.
<P>
	I say that because we have said many times that the red book 
of the Liberal Party laid out a vision. For example, the red book 
made it very clear we would aim for and achieve a deficit of 3 
per cent of GDP by 1997. The Minister of Finance, after the red 
book, after our election victory of a year ago, built on that vision 
by producing a budget. The budget reiterated our absolute 
unshakeable target of 3 per cent of GDP by 1997.
<P>
	The finance minister laid out a strategy in the budget and it 
continues. Part of the strategy is an unprecedented set of 
consultations that will begin almost immediately. The minister 
through the medium of the finance committee will be consulting 
Canadians from coast to coast on how best to achieve the target 
of 3 per cent of GDP. Can there be anything more democratic? 
Can there be anything more consultative than that?
<P>
	I wanted to lay that out because it seems that the opposition 
parties do not want to listen. Canadians are going to participate. 
Canadians are going to join in achieving the target of 3 per cent 
of GDP. That is my comment. If the previous speaker wants to 
respond to it, be my guest.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the previous speaker. The government 
always talks about when Canada is compared with other 
countries this is the greatest country in the world in which to 
live. Quite frankly, it is no contest. Canada is, when you 
compare it to other countries, certainly the best country in the 
world in which to live.
<P>
	I would like to suggest a real test for the government. 
Compare Canada as it is now with its huge financial crisis, its 
huge deficit every year, its huge national debt, with how it could 
be if we had had responsible government running the country 
over the last 25 years.
<P>
	I look over at the government and I see a mirror of the Tories. 
The Tories' plan was not to reduce spending but count on 
revenue growth to get us out of this fiscal problem. They merrily 
spent like drunken sailors and, guess what, revenue did not 
grow. We ended up another $200 and something billion in the 
hole. The deficit climbed every year and the expected revenue 
growth simply did not occur.
<P>
	That is what the government is counting on as well when it 
uses a figure of 3 per cent GDP by 1997. Theoretically by using 
that figure, the government does not have to cut costs. All it has 
to do is hope for the revenue growth to go up and it will achieve 
that percentage. But that is no accomplishment in thrift. That is 
no accomplishment in-

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. This brings to a close the time for 
questions and comments.
<P>
	It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for Davenport-Environment; 
the hon. member for Selkirk-Red River-Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Resuming debate. I understand that two speakers will be 
sharing the allotted time, beginning with the hon. member for 
Kootenay East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always helpful at the beginning of a speech to bring us back to 
the starting point. I would like to re-read the motion of the 
member for St. Albert:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House requests the government to table a clear detailed plan to show 
how and when it intends to balance the budget including a clear statement of its 
vision of the role of the government in the economy in order for the people of 
Canada to debate the plan and vision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like particularly to draw the attention of the members 
to the phrase, only seven words, ``its vision of the role of the 
government''. I have a vision of the role of the government, 
possibly in the same way that we have the role of management in 
any organization or the way a team works. We have leaders on a 
team.
<P>
	I would like to suggest that we think back. I guess I am 
showing my age when I talk about Bobby Hull and Bobby Orr or 
people like that. We saw them as leaders and as showing 
leadership. When they were virtually physically disabled they 
were out on the ice. They were showing leadership. They were 
working at a deficit but they were showing leadership.
<P>
	We heard a very interesting story from a member opposite. I 
apologize that I did not catch the name of the gentleman she was 
talking about in a member's statement this week. I believe it was 
the chairman of the board of Algoma Steel who has the personal 
opportunity to take $400,000 through a bonus system as 
chairman. He is entitled to have $400,000. He is turning it back. 
He is not taking the $400,000 because he recognizes that if he is 
going to show leadership, if Algoma Steel is going to go ahead, 
then he must exhibit selfless leadership.
<P>
	I suggest that the vision of the role of government in my mind 
is that of showing leadership. I believe that every member of the 
House from the Prime Minister to the independent has a direct 
responsibility to show leadership.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	How does this fit together with what we are presently 
undertaking under the direction of the Liberals? Take, for 
example, the human resources review committee that will be 
going out and around the countryside. Members of the 
committee will be discussing issues like unemployment 
insurance, welfare and how we are going to be helping our 
children with their university educations. They are going to be 
listening to witnesses from organizations like this who are very 
concerned.
<P>
	I have in my hand a note from one of my constituents. In part it 
reads as follows: ``Numerous Canadians have lost their jobs 
over the last year. In most circumstances those who are 
terminated, laid off or fired do not remain on payroll''. Seems 
reasonable.
<P>
	``Canadians assumed when they put their <I>x</I> in the box one year 
ago today, October 25, that those members who they booted out 
of the House would be off the payroll. Not so. Canadians will be 
delighted no doubt to learn that in the 365 days since they 
terminated their MPs the public purse has shelled out for their 
former MPs' pensions, travel expenses, retraining, moving and 
severance. Add it up.
<P>
	I am confident that those Canadians who are lined up at the UI 
office awaiting their miserable little UI cheques for years of 
hard work in companies that have folded due to previous 
governments' mismanagement will be comforted in knowing 
that the members of the government who put them in that 
line-up are still on the public dole of another kind''.
<P>
	This is the kind of hostility there is among the Canadian 
people. I make no excuse for it. I simply report it.
<P>
	If all members of the House are really forthcoming they will 
agree with me that they have been approached by people in their 
constituencies; in their constituency office or accosted on the 
street or in the supermarket with sentiments of exactly that same 
kind.
<P>
	It is the number one issue in my constituency. I have spoken 
about the Young Offenders Act. I have spoken about the deficit 
and the debt. But number one on the hit parade is the MPs' 
pensions.
<P>
	I find it quite amazing that the vast majority of the people in 
the House, with the turnover of over 200 members being here for 
the very first time, are supporting what is the number one 
impediment, the number one wall between members of 
Parliament and the public. The public sees this whole thing as 
being completely unfair.
<P>
	The member for Yellowhead rose in the House and also sent 
out a press release just the other day and I read in part: ``The 
Yellowhead MP laid into the Prime Minister and his Liberal 
government today for turning a blind eye to the fast approaching 
national trough day.
<P>
	On November 21, 52 current members of Parliament will 
qualify to dip into the lucrative MP pension fund once they no 
longer occupy a seat in the House. These pension payouts are 
estimated to cost the Canadian taxpayers $53 million. Among 
the 52 MPs who will sidle up to the pension trough once they are 
out of office are-''. I am sure the Speaker would prefer that I do 
not go ahead and name people like the leader of the Bloc.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7204"> 7204 </A></B>
<P>
	It goes on: ```Canadians find it absolutely unacceptable that 
the Prime Minister says he is dedicated to spending cuts when he 
continues to allow this kind of taxpayers' abuse', the member 
said to a round of cheers from his Reform colleagues in the 
House''.
<P>
	I am rather curious. I absolutely believe it is a barrier between 
good government, in other words people believing in the 
members of Parliament, people believing in this place of power 
and authority in our country. If the number one impediment is 
simply the long awaited reforms that the Reform Party has been 
demanding about the MPs' pensions, why in the world would the 
Prime Minister not have come forward before this point, 
particularly in light of the fact that the National Citizens 
Coalition is going to be launching an MP trough day campaign. 
There are going to be billboards all over the place.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	As the human resources committee goes around led by its 
chairman discussing issues like UI, welfare and how we are 
going to be funding university education, what kind of response 
is that chairman expecting when he sits in front of students who 
are going to be at an exceptional disadvantage perhaps as a 
result of the changes that are going to have to happen? What 
kind of response does the chairman expect from the public for 
his committee when he sits in front of people who are the 
disadvantaged and are presently on welfare when that member 
for Cape Breton Highlands-Canso is going to be drawing $1.5 
million by the time he is 75 years of age? I wonder how the 
university students will feel about that.
<P>
	This is a critical, crucial issue to the entire vision of where the 
government should be going and how the government should be 
showing leadership. Therefore, I call on the Prime Minister and 
the members of his caucus tomorrow in caucus to demand of the 
Prime Minister that this issue once and for all be finally put to 
rest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to say that I was quite surprised by the remarks 
of the member opposite. He knows as well as I do that the issue 
is not simply MPs receiving pensions or even significant 
pensions. The issue is one of double dipping, where an MP 
obtains money from the taxpayer-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Not so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> The issue is double dipping in my riding. I point 
out to the member, if I may, that behind him is the member for 
Lethbridge who is already receiving a pension of some $63,000. 
I will also point out that the $63,000 is from another level of 
government. I just want to say that the taxpayers' dollars are the 
same dollars no matter what level of government. I would like to 
know what the member has to say about the member for 
Lethbridge and the fact that he is double dipping right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, first off I think it would be very 
helpful if we had from the member some kind of a definition of 
double dipping. However, I absolutely outright reject his 
comment about the fact that the issue is double dipping.
<P>
	The issue is not double dipping. The issue is the fact that there 
are 52 more people who are going to be coming to the trough and 
this is the barrier. This is the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to rise and address this issue of double dipping which my 
colleague did not mention in his speech. He said the gold-plated 
MP pension plan is number one on the hit list that Canadian 
taxpayers do not like. I am here to verify that because that is the 
attitude in Calgary Centre.
<P>
	The hon. member should realize that double dipping is when a 
member of the same government gets an appointment. Joe Clark 
was double dipping because he got an appointment while he was 
receiving a pension from this government. If Joe Clark wished 
to run for the provincial legislature of Alberta then he would be 
welcome to continue to receive his pension plan from the federal 
government and work as a provincial MLA. That is not double 
dipping.
<P>
	Double dipping is defined as getting an appointment by the 
same government that you serve. That is where the conflict of 
interest is. There is no conflict of interest if you work for a 
provincial party and then leave that party to run for a federal 
party. If you then run for a federal party, you tell the people in 
your riding you are running federally. If those people in the 
province of Alberta elect you with one of the strongest 
majorities, that is not double dipping. That is not getting an 
appointment from another level of government. That is going 
before the people, laying it on the table and being duly and 
freely elected.
<P>
	Personally, I am getting sick and tired of the whining of the 
government about double dipping.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	It says that it is going to do something about it. It has done 
nothing. I asked the Prime Minister in question period way back 
in January: When can we opt out of this gold-plated MP pension 
plan because many Reformers want to? He said: ``Soon, soon, 
soon''. He has done nothing. It is all talk. Talk is cheap but the 
interest on the deficit and the debt is not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a privilege to address the members of this 
House in debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7205"> 7205 </A></B>
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Cariboo-Chilcotin, it is my 
duty and my privilege to represent the views and the concerns of 
the people in my riding. They are a diverse group but they share 
a common concern, the state of our nation's finances.
<P>
	The Liberals have called upon the opposition benches, the 
opposition members, to provide them with some ideas. I hope 
they have been listening to this debate throughout the day. It is 
quite interesting to be over here and sort of be treated like a ping 
pong ball, to be asked to give ideas. Members do that and then 
they are slammed because the ideas are no darn good at all.
<P>
	In the last federal election, Canadians were given three clear 
choices regarding the deficit. The Conservatives claimed they 
could outgrow the deficit in the hopes that economic growth 
would save the country's bottom line. The Liberals and the New 
Democrats said that they could contain the deficit focusing first 
on the campaign promises and paying the price some time down 
the road. Reform stood alone in saying that we must eliminate 
the deficit.
<P>
	To prove our commitment, we set a target of three years to do 
that. We did it in a clearly outlined program of eliminating the 
deficit, zero deficit in three years. The people of the Cariboo 
spoke clearly on the matter. They wanted an end to sky high 
deficits, extravagant perks, government waste and yes, 
gold-plated pension plans too.
<P>
	They did not want to outgrow or contain the deficit. They 
wanted it eliminated. The Liberals who do not share this view 
received a mandate to govern though I fear many opportunities 
to turn this country around have been ignored and have been 
lost.
<P>
	A year has passed since the Liberals formed the government 
and our country is now a startling $535 billion in debt. With a 
financial catastrophe ahead of us the government has to commit 
itself to new ways of thinking. We are asking in this motion for 
the government to describe that. It has to eliminate waste. It has 
to eliminate overlap, redirect programs and then the lavish 
services Canadians can no longer afford and no longer want.
<P>
	One program that I am particularly concerned about is the 
Canadian International Development Agency. CIDA was 
formed in 1968 under an order in council to distribute aid and 
help the poorest of the world's people. Since that time, however, 
CIDA has grown into an enormous organization with over 1,300 
employees only 250 of whom work overseas and an over $2 
billion budget. That is not much if one says it fast, but 
nevertheless it is $2,000 million for its budget.
<P>
	Despite its size and expense, it has no official mandate from 
Parliament. This agency according to the Auditor General lacks 
the focus and direction to either make a concrete difference in 
the developing world or build enduring partnerships.
<P>
	Another report found that it is more influenced by the 
bureaucratic environment than it is influential in the policy 
process. It has no long term plan and thus tax dollars are being 
wasted on programs that according to the report are having little 
effect on those in need.
<P>
	What I find most disturbing is the fact that CIDA's work is 
duplicated in many areas by numerous non-governmental 
organizations. Many of these organizations receive the bulk of 
their funding from CIDA and this in my view is both wasteful 
and redundant.
<P>
	This agency is adrift and directionless, wasting thousands of 
millions of dollars in the process. I call on the government to 
bring a mandate for CIDA before this House as quickly as 
possible to give this agency a firm direction and bring it under 
the regular scrutiny of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has spoken out on CIDA proposing Bill 
C-250, an act to establish the Canadian International 
Development Agency. By formally establishing the agency and 
providing strict guidelines for its operation, Reform hopes to 
bring more control and accountability to CIDA. CIDA will then 
be able to focus on the tasks it must accomplish, leaving behind 
its heavy bureaucracy and saving Canadians a lot of money in 
the process.
<P>
	I am more concerned though about one of the Liberal 
government's most glamorous projects, the celebrated 
infrastructure program. Reformers are committed to 
infrastructure; roads, railways, airports. They are all critical for 
the country. They tie the country together. They pull our 
communities closer together than ever before. They bring me as 
a member of Parliament from the isolated regions of 
Cariboo-Chilcotin to the federal heart here in Ottawa. Most 
important they keep Canada competitive in an expanding and 
competitive global market.
<P>
	Investments in infrastructure must be seen as just that, 
investments. When starting a business, buying saving bonds or 
purchasing shares, people always have to consider the return on 
any investment. Governments can no longer spend money as 
they sometimes have in the past. The time for catering to regions 
or special interest groups is long gone. Governments today must 
invest in trying to help the most people with every dollar they 
spend, in other words getting the most bang for the buck.
<P>
	That leads me to the infrastructure program. This program is 
rooted in the myth that governments can buy jobs. The vast 
majority of jobs created in this program are short term, the kind 
of jobs Canadians would pass on if given the choice. Their desire 
is for real long term positions with real opportunities, real 
chances for improvement and real hope. The infrastructure 
program gives Canadians false hope. The good news is just a 
flash in the pan, careful or you will miss it as it goes by. We are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7206"> 7206 </A></B>
<P>
left with billions of dollars of added debt for our children and 
grandchildren to repay in the years to come.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has lost control, coming on stream 
just as provinces start into municipal elections. Municipalities 
and provinces have taken advantage of the program to start on 
their pet projects even though a government news release said 
that any projects that are not infrastructure based will be 
refused.
<P>
	What do any of the following projects approved have to do 
with infrastructure? A canoe hall of fame for Shawinigan, 
Quebec; boccie courts in Toronto; luxury boxes in Edmonton's 
Northlands Coliseum; rental cabins in Saskatchewan's Rowan's 
Ravine Provincial Park; an artificial ice rink for Gilbert Plains, 
Manitoba; duck and pond gardens for Winnipeg; removing 
overhead wires in Shelburne, Nova Scotia to film a movie. I 
could go on and on.
<P>
	Infrastructure is supposed to be about roads and sewers. It is 
supposed to be useful, accessible and beneficial for all citizens 
in a community. How many people I wonder will be playing 
boccie in Toronto? How many will be able to afford a brand new 
luxury box at the Northlands? How many will be making use of 
the new cabins at Rowan's Ravine?
<P>
	These are not infrastructure projects. They are pet projects. 
Their very existence goes against the words of those in charge of 
the infrastructure program, against the Liberal red book and 
against the promises of this government.
<P>
	Then there is the issue of the program's cost. This $6 billion 
has to come from somewhere. I can only think of two places; 
either through more debt which will be repaid by our children 
and grandchildren or more taxes. At a time when Canadians are 
taxed to the hilt and their governments are broke, this program 
pushes us even closer to the brink. As the finance minister 
himself pointed out on so many occasions last week, the debt is 
our biggest obstacle to long term security and prosperity.
<P>
	Why the government is making the obstacle harder to 
overcome for the sake of boccie courts and cabins is beyond me. 
To close, I believe the key to eliminating our deficit is to focus. 
To succeed the government must commit itself to cutting the 
deficit, not to some ambiguous floating target, but to a simple 
number and that number is zero. It is only then that we can begin 
to start pulling ourselves out of the deep pit that we are now in.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to what the hon. member from Western Canada had to 
say about how the government should balance the budget and 
spend its money. The member talked in particular about the 
infrastructure project and I would also like to address this issue 
and ask a question in this matter.
<P>
	The infrastructure program set up by the government is not 
harmful in itself. On the contrary, I think it could help us to 
create jobs in the short run, help the economy to work better and 
help the workers to become more productive.
<P>
	What I have trouble with is that the federal government is 
taking part in this infrastructure program. The federal 
government is getting directly involved in an area over which 
the municipalities have jurisdiction. This goes against the 
Constitution, because the federal government has never been 
willing, in the past, to directly impede on municipal 
jurisdictions. But the Liberal government has achieved to do so, 
without Canadians realizing what it was up to, because it says it 
was just trying to help the people. Canadians were taken in by 
the government, but they never realize that the money always 
come from their own pockets.
<P>
	This is why I say again that the federal government's 
involvement at the municipal level is terrible, that it should not 
be allowed and will only lead to inefficiency, since we have 
three levels of government deciding which street to repair, what 
type of bridge to build, what project to undertake. This is 
terrible and should never have been accepted.
<P>
	The federal government should have given the money directly 
to the provinces who, along with the municipalities, would have 
decided which project to support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is some strategy, some 
rationale to my comments on the infrastructure program. We do 
have a stand. Reform supports the development of human 
infrastructure, supporting federal government activities that 
work toward the development of job skills, especially skills that 
are transferable to a variety of job positions.
<P>
	Second, Reform supports the development of physical 
capital, maintaining airports, maintaining our sea ports and 
roads that enhance our economy for years to come and enhance 
our economic competitiveness in the world today.
<P>
	On the other hand, it seems that the Liberal stand does not 
develop human capital. The skills developed are strictly for 
construction, general labour skills. The vast majority of jobs are 
short term basis. The minister cannot deny that. Skills 
developed are not transferable to other areas, just other 
construction projects.
<P>
	It does not develop physical capital. For example, in the 
Liberal policy on infrastructure in Ontario less than half, 41.3 
per cent of the money, is going toward roads; 23.3 per cent for 
sewers; 47 per cent going to non-residential projects like the 
ones I outlined in my speech.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on some of the comments made by the 
member across the way.
<P>
	I find it quite clear that the Liberal platform that was 
developed in the red book was put in print and is a program that 
is not supposed to take all the action within a year. We said that 
in three years we would accomplish this goal. That was to reduce 
overspending to 3 per cent of the GDP. We are very much on line 
with that development.
<P>
	However, in doing that it is extremely important to consult the 
public. The Reform Party often tries to put itself forward as one 
that consults the public. It is now saying: ``We do not agree with 
your timeline''.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian public agreed with our timeline. That is why it 
overwhelmingly elected a Liberal government.
<P>
	Our infrastructure program was very clearly laid out to the 
Canadian public and it was asked to make decisions. One year 
ago it made that decision. Quite frankly, the infrastructure 
project has been a tremendous success in my riding from the 
response that I get back. These are programs and things that had 
to be done in every municipality across this country in order to 
increase the wealth of life of everybody in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to address the hon. member's 
motion today. This past week the Minister of Finance made it 
abundantly clear this government is fully committed to reducing 
the debt and controlling expenditures.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that reducing spending is not the 
only action this government is taking to strengthen our growing 
economy. We are working in partnership with other levels of 
government and the private sector to build strong, vibrant 
economies that will keep our standard of living among the top 10 
nations of the world.
<P>
	I know hon. members will agree that our young people are the 
future leaders and builders of this great nation. This government 
is fully aware of the importance of ensuring that Canadian youth 
are given every opportunity to excel. That is what the youth 
employment and learning strategy is all about.
<P>
	The hon. member asked about the government's vision. Let 
me tell the hon. member for St. Albert that our vision for young 
Canadians is to do everything possible to ensure they fulfil their 
educational potential, get a rewarding job and contribute to the 
social and economic health of Canada.
<P>
	One way the government is doing that is through youth 
service Canada. We already have more than 1,000 Canadian 
young women and men participating in youth service projects. 
In the coming months we will involve an additional 1,400 
participants. That is not the only investment we are making in 
the future of Canada. Through our youth internship program 
young Canadians are being given the opportunity to experience 
training in new and emerging sectors.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member this is not a haphazard approach of 
smoke and mirrors. Far from it. Youth internship projects will 
train young people in skills that will lead to long term, highly 
skilled jobs. For example, we recently announced a 
demonstration project to help those interested to gain the skills 
necessary to pursue careers in the electric and electronic 
industries. Each project will involve 20 students in five 
provinces, with the benefits going to students all across the 
country.
<P>
	I imagine my hon. colleagues will agree there is no better 
teacher than experience and experience is what the participants 
in the government's youth employment and learning strategy are 
receiving. We have said before, and perhaps the hon. member 
should hear it again, partnership is the key to making these 
programs effective. With the demonstration projects under 
youth service Canada and youth internship, the government is 
working hand in hand with a variety of partners, including sector 
councils, that are taking the lead in these endeavours.
<P>
	One of the major aspects in economic renewal is that sectors 
share responsibility in determining and addressing their human 
resource needs. We are working closely with sector councils that 
represent their respective industries. I will say a little more on 
that in a minute.
<P>
	Regarding vision, this government has enough vision to 
realize that we have to make adjustments where needed. That is 
what we are doing with the Atlantic groundfish strategy. The 
main objective of TAGS is to reconstruct the fishery in Atlantic 
Canada to make this traditional industry economically viable 
and environmentally sustainable.
<P>
	We are working closely with fishermen's associations and the 
provinces to make necessary adjustments to the labour force, 
realistic adjustments that must be made. Since TAGS was 
announced in April, we are serving the needs of men and women 
in the fishery through the difficult transitional time.
<P>
	So far close to 41,000 fishermen and women and fish plant 
workers are receiving support through TAGS. For the majority 
that support will continue to 1995. Financial assistance is not 
the only thing the government is doing for women and men 
whose lives have been devastated by the reduction in the fishery. 
We are also providing counselling to about 15,000 individuals 
thus far, and about 3,000 of these men and women are 
participat-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7208"> 7208 </A></B>
<P>
ing in other aspects of the TAGS program on their way to  
becoming self-reliant and able to once again contribute to the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	When the hon. member for St. Albert talks about vision I am 
wondering if he is aware of the resourceful measures this 
government has taken through its strategic initiatives program. 
We have set aside $800 million in the February budget to come 
up with creative ways to address employment problems 
associated with structural changes in the economy.
<P>
	I am pleased to tell the House that the strategic initiatives 
program has been a marked success. Let me cite a few examples. 
In New Brunswick we are supporting NB jobs corps with a $40 
million investment to help older employed workers. This project 
is very successful. At this time most of the 1,000 participants are 
working in nine provincial localities.
<P>
	In Newfoundland a strategic initiatives project is investing 
$10 million to help students and the unemployed continue their 
education using tuition credits and wage subsidies.
<P>
	In Prince Edward Island we are investing $1.4 million to tutor 
unemployment insurance claimants and welfare recipients to 
gain literacy and life skills.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia the strategic initiatives program has invested 
$7.5 million for training and employment opportunities for 
adults at risk of going on welfare.
<P>
	We also have strategic initiative projects in Ontario, the 
Northwest Territories and Manitoba. I am pleased to tell the hon. 
member that the provinces and the territories have shown 
enthusiasm for strategic initiatives from the very beginning.
<P>
	Women comprise about 40 per cent of our labour force but 
they are still in many low paying occupations. The government 
is helping women realize their potential through projects such as 
the one the Minister of Human Resources Development recently 
announced in Rimouski, Quebec. In this case women who have 
no income are being trained to enable them to create their own 
businesses. These entrepreneurial women have a business plan 
but they need support to get it off the ground. This is another 
project that is providing an excellent example of what we can 
accomplish through co-operative partnerships.
<P>
	I am delighted to report also the case for sectoral partnerships. 
This too is part of our vision. Sector councils are comprised of 
leaders in industry, labour, education and all levels of 
government. They work together to build a common vision of 
their human resource needs and to establish comprehensive and 
practical training programs to meet those needs.
<P>
	We currently have some 18 sector councils breaking new 
ground in labour-management relations and we are working to 
establish more sector councils. This partnership includes 
education and training in the community so the school 
curriculum will help students  develop the up to date skills 
necessary to work in today's economy.
<P>
	Sectoral initiatives are involving the private sector in 
decision making in a way that government has not done before. 
Business and industry are investing dollars, time and expertise.
<P>
	In closing, I suggest that the hon. member not be so 
pessimistic in his outlook. Just last week the International 
Monetary Fund reported that Canada's industrial production has 
surpassed the pre-recession peak of 1989-90. Of course there is 
still much to be done, but through programs such as the one I 
have outlined, investment in people, and through a revitalized 
social security system we will help Canadians to improve their 
standard of living and ensure a strong economy for decades to 
come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal Party to which the hon. member belongs is planning on 
reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP within two years. Of 
course, the last time we had an annual deficit equal to 3 per cent 
of the GDP was 20 years ago, in 1974. I would like to remind the 
members that we started to have deficits around 1970, when our 
country was run by a Liberal government under the leadership of 
Mr. Trudeau. You certainly remember that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Year after year, the deficits started to grow and the Liberal 
government began to play Santa Claus. It made promises. The 
deficits continued to grow to a point where the current deficit 
exceeds 6 per cent of the GDP. Our country is on the brink of 
bankruptcy, and if we do not want to mortgage the future of 
many generations to come, we will have to change our 
mentality.
<P>
	I ask the government member who just spoke if it is a change 
in mentality when the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
the member for Hull-Aylmer who is sitting on the other side, 
takes a government plane, a Challenger, to go and give two small 
lectures in the United States at a cost of $170,000 to Canadian 
taxpayers. Is it a change in mentality when we send a delegation 
of F-18s and F-16s to Florida to play war games? The William 
Tell competition cost no $2 million.
<P>
	Is it a change in mentality when the Prime Minister tells us 
that the CSE does not spy on Canadians even though there is a 
building here in Ottawa housing over 1,008 employees whose 
job is to do just that at a cost of between $250 and $270 million a 
year? Is it a change in mentality to have all these duplications of 
services for the same people? We had a good example of that just 
recently. Last year, Ontario created the position of 
Commissioner of the Environment. Last week, in a statement, 
the Minister of the Environment announced the appointment of 
another Commissioner of the Environment here, in Ottawa.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7209"> 7209 </A></B>
<P>
	As for manpower training, we lose $250 million a year just 
with Quebec. Both governments want to train the same worker. 
That costs $250 million a year. It is Mr. Bourbeau, the former 
Quebec minister, a Liberal minister, who said that, not me.
<P>
	Will there be a change of mentality on the Liberal side? Will 
we still let the very rich take advantage of tax shelters and pay 
very little, if any, income tax, thanks to the family trusts where 
we could find a couple of billion dollars. Will there be a change 
of mentality on the Liberal side? When they attack the needy and 
those who lost their jobs, when they cut off those on welfare, 
when they bleed the poor and let the rich get richer, will that be a 
change of mentality?
<P>
	In closing, I ask whether the Liberal Party will again play 
Santa Claus, make nice promises and mortgage our future? It is 
all very well to want to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent, but it will 
require more than mere wishes. Il will require courage, yes, 
courage, Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt about it. The Liberal 
Party will have to be very courageous, but I question their 
courage, because their past actions do not bode well for the 
future.
<P>
	I would like to hear my hon. colleague opposite defend her 
party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. I bring to his attention, however, that we are talking 
about vision and vision relates to the future. While we can learn 
from the past it is important to look to the future with hope; with 
great political will on both sides of the House, as he has 
suggested; with a tremendous amount of courage; and with a lot 
of sticking with it. I truly believe the Liberal government 
understands and will deliver.
<P>
	The member talked about new approaches. That is what this is 
all about. As we go into our budget deliberations we certainly 
know that we need to do things in new and different ways.
<P>
	We talked about leadership a little earlier. There was one 
suggestion that the Liberal government decides what it wants to 
do and does it. That is the old approach. The new approach is to 
talk to the stakeholders and talk to the people who pay the bills. 
That is where we get the wisdom. That is where we learn to 
understand the priorities of the people.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	It is my view that what is in the red book is truly the priorities 
of Canadians. That is why the government was elected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with considerable interest to the dissertation 
of my colleague from Edmonton East. It was interesting in so far 
as it gave us a somewhat biased appraisal of the 
accomplishments of the Liberal Party, probably since the 
beginning of time, but we will suggest it was perhaps from the 
beginning of this Parliament.  However it had absolutely 
nothing to do with the premise being debated today.
<P>
	What is the government doing? When is it going to balance 
the budget? That is the essence of the question. When will the 
Liberal government get at it? The Liberal government was in 
opposition for nine years. It has been in government now for one 
year. Certainly it is important to get at solving the real problems. 
The time to do it is at hand.
<P>
	I have a question for the member. One suggestion that has 
been brought forward in the House on numerous occasions to 
make our tax system fairer, more equitable and far more 
responsive to the needs of Canadian business and individuals is 
the notion of a flat tax.
<P>
	Would the member opposite give the House the benefit of her 
impression of the values or the negative aspects of a flat tax and 
what it would do to help move the government along to where it 
should be going?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question from the 
hon. member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	It is my understanding that we are discussing a vision of the 
government's role in the economy. It was for that reason I spent 
most of my time talking about how we would invest in people so 
that they would be productive and contribute to our economy 
and the fabric of life in our country.
<P>
	The member spoke rather negatively about the success of 
these programs but let me remind my hon. colleague that the 
whole idea of the $800 million for this strategic initiative was to 
try to experiment and be creative in new and innovative ways to 
train our people for their future roles in the work of the country. 
That is the essence of my comments.
<P>
	I might mention another thing that is extremely important. 
Every program I talked about today will undergo the same 
program review in the future that all our existing programs 
today are undergoing. That is what makes us sure we will be able 
to measure success in terms of whether or not it delivers what we 
expected it to deliver.
<P>
	I look forward to working with my hon. colleague on those 
exact kinds of reviews.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I should inform colleagues that the last speaker 
for Edmonton East took 10 minutes and I allowed 10 minutes for 
questioning because she had 20 minutes to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to the motion, 
specifically the part of the motion that refers to the role of the 
government in the economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7210"> 7210 </A></B>
<P>
	Since 1986 Reformers have been talking about the financial 
crisis in the country. We sent warnings to the Tories when they 
were in power and they did not listen to us. We in the Reform 
Party have been warning the government for months and months 
of the impending financial crisis in the country arising out of the 
mountain of debts and deficits.
<P>
	We warned that investors feared the economic uncertainty in 
our country. We warned that spiralling debtloads would hamper 
the country's ability to create jobs. We warned that consumer 
confidence would not return unless the government got its 
financial house in order. These warnings have simply been cast 
aside by the Liberals in the last several months and they have 
branded Reformers as fearmongers.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	They would say there was no crisis, the debt was under control 
or cuts simply would do more harm to the economy than good. 
Now the Minister of Finance says that debt stands in the way of 
the growth we seek and limits our ability to create jobs. He says 
that his ultimate goal is a balanced budget.
<P>
	This new Liberal stand leaves Canadians sort of confused 
since only eight months ago the Minister of Finance tabled a 
budget rife with new expenditures and new taxes, a nefarious 
combination that encouraged an ever expanding underground 
economy, a nefarious combination that leaves investors 
nervously standing pat and consumers keeping their wallets in 
their pockets.
<P>
	Now the government tells Canadians to forget that budget, 
forget the $34 billion it would add to the debt, forget the $100 
billion it proposed to add to the debt in the next four years but 
trust it today, for in the last 32 weeks it has been mystically 
reborn and sees the evils of it spendthrift ways.
<P>
	It is this confusion, this flip-flopping or lack of focus that 
leads Reformers to call for the government's clear vision of the 
role it will play in the economy. To date the vision of the 
government and its role in the economy have been shortsighted 
at best. It continues to intervene in the marketplace creating 
disincentive for investments, disincentives for Canadians to 
work and disincentives for Canadians to spend.
<P>
	One way in which the government stunts the wealth creating 
potential of the economy is through its measures of taxation, and 
the Liberals know all about taxation. The capital gains tax 
exemption was removed in February's budget and this will 
discourage people's will to invest. We pay tax on interest in 
savings accounts and now there is talk about taxing RRSPs.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Never.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> The government should never say never to taxes. 
We have income taxes, consumption taxes, property taxes, 
visible and invisible taxes, all under the assumption that 
government is better than the private sector at redistributing 
wealth to create economic growth  and jobs in the country. I 
would argue that this is fundamentally wrong thinking. The 
surest way to create growth in the economy is to leave more 
money in the pockets of the investors and the consumers. Let 
them decide where their money will be spent, invested or even 
donated.
<P>
	People speak of an impending tax revolt. I would suggest the 
tax revolt is well under way, considering the record of the 
Liberal government and the management of its financial house. 
An underground economy is flourishing. It is estimated at over 
$100 billion a year.
<P>
	The government and its predecessors believe in the fallacy 
that increased taxes bring in a proportional share of increased 
revenues. That is absolutely ludicrous thinking. Taxes upon 
taxes upon taxes create disincentives to employment and 
investment. Will these shortsighted Liberals ever see that 
simple truth? I think not. As Michael Walker stated, such 
disincentives are creating a generation of workers who see no 
point in tiring themselves for paycheques that increasingly go to 
the government.
<P>
	Apparently the government has been through some sort of 
magical awakening in the last few weeks. It is the recent 
contention of the Minister of Finance that ``whatever fiscal 
action is taken, the bulk should come from cuts in program 
spending''. Reformers rejoiced when they heard that; if only we 
could believe it.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	In February the minister boosted the budget of his own 
department by $1.4 billion for 1994-95. He raised DIAND's 
budget $400 million and nudged citizenship and immigration up 
$80 million. In that same budget the Minister of Finance 
launched 18 new programs and 15 new studies.
<P>
	February's budget also introduced a $6 billion credit card 
infrastructure program. As we heard earlier, among other things 
the program involved the covering of boccie courts, building 
stands and hockey arenas in my colleague's home town, and 
building the canoe hall of fame in the Prime Minister's own 
riding, a $6 billion borrowed money program that is still to this 
day staunchly defended by the Minister of Finance as necessary 
to stimulate the economy.
<P>
	Now a few months later the Minister of Finance is looking for 
$9 billion in cuts. Has he suddenly become a believer in 
balanced budgets, a firm believer in the problems debt and 
deficit cause in economic growth?
<P>
	Considering the flip-flop, how can Canadians be anything 
else but confused? How can they have confidence in a 
government whose initial vision was to spend, spend, spend to 
create wealth and growth in the economy and then a few months 
later its vision is that it cannot spend, spend, spend to create 
growth. This has to be confusing to a lot of Canadian taxpayers. 
Canadians want to know what the vision of this government is. 
All we have had so far is talk. They want to see a clear vision, not 
confusion, not flip-flopping.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7211"> 7211 </A></B>
<P>
	This government is content to stumble around in the dark 
attempting to determine if it is time to spend or cut. It is certain 
of one thing and it is something Canadians are becoming 
increasingly tired of. When in doubt, if you lack the political 
guts to make necessary cuts you raise taxes.
<P>
	If the government is looking for cuts it need look no further 
than its own crown corporations. VIA Rail, the CBC, the St. 
Lawrence Seaway, CMHC, and Ports Canada consume $3.6 
billion of taxpayers' money. I would suggest if these are not 
viable corporations, if the government cannot operate them 
without incurring deficits then why does the government so 
steadfastly cling to them? Literally, we simply cannot afford 
arguments over sentimentality in order to justify the 
government taking financial shortfalls in these companies.
<P>
	If the government cannot at least break even in these 
operations then maybe it is time to cut them loose, turn them 
over to the private sector. It is unfair and indeed ludicrous to 
return to the Canadian taxpayer year after year requesting more 
money to prop up a multitude of failing government business 
enterprises. The government should get out of the business if it 
cannot run it at least at a break even point.
<P>
	If we take the $3.6 billion spent on these crown corporations 
and add it to the $6 billion wasted on the credit card 
infrastructure program, we arrive at the $9.6 billion in cuts, or 
approximately what the finance minister is now seeking.
<P>
	I want to talk about public input. This government continues 
to speak of consultations with the public, not just any 
consultations but consultations which are successively 
unprecedented. The Minister of Finance once again has 
promised unprecedented consultations on the run up to his new 
budget. This was promised before the February budget.
<P>
	How many Canadians favoured the removal of the capital 
gains exemption? How many Canadians favoured adding some 
$34 billion to the national debt? I would be interested in seeing 
those numbers but I do not think this government has them. I do 
not think they exist.
<P>
	This government's definition of run up consultations is a 
sham. Extensive unprecedented consultations are a fabrication 
of this government. The Minister of Finance admitted as much 
before the Standing Committee on Finance when he stated: 
``Government by necessity has the final word''. Remember this 
when the government says: ``We know you do not want RRSP 
contributions taxed but by necessity we have to levy a tax on 
them''. Or the minister might say: ``We know you do not want to 
pay higher income taxes but by necessity we have to raise 
them''.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	This government should put questions concerning cuts or 
taxes to the people, really to the people, through a referendum or 
through their respective MPs in this House. Do not patronize 
them by considering the issues to be too complicated for them to 
understand and do not patronize them with arguments of 
necessity.
<P>
	If this government were truly looking at a new vision for its 
role in the economy it would be looking to the people for 
direction through referendum or through the people's MPs to 
determine where to spend, where to save and where to cut. 
Instead unfortunately, the taxpayer is handed lines about 
necessity as the government makes unilateral decisions.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government should be looking at lowering 
taxes and cutting spending in order to eliminate the deficit and 
eventually the debt. It should be looking at unloading a number 
of unprofitable crown corporations. It should be looking at 
removing itself as the blockade to Canadian ingenuity and 
entrepreneurship.
<P>
	Instead, from this government we see a spendthrift budget 
followed much later by calls for thriftiness. We see a 
government hiding behind claims of necessity instead of 
actively consulting with taxpayers on how their money is spent. 
We see no vision, but we see more finger pointing at who got us 
into this mess. We hear of more consultations and we hear of 
more taxes.
<P>
	With such a strategy for our country's economy, investor and 
consumer confidence will continue to deteriorate. Our 
impending financial crisis will continue to loom. All I can say to 
the Canadian taxpayer is: Hold on to your pocketbook as long as 
the Liberals hold on to power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after listening to the hon 
member's speech, it is obvious he does not understand the role 
crown corporations play in this country. The member said that 
we should put the existence of some of these crown corporations 
to a public vote. That is a pretty good idea because I believe the 
reason we have crown corporations is that they fill a role that a 
lot of private corporations would not take on. I am talking about 
services to remote regions and disadvantaged regions.
<P>
	I think of Pacific Western Airlines, for example. It needed the 
Federal Business Development Bank for its initial loan in order 
to get off the ground. It was a government instrument that 
assisted that company in getting started. We can go from 
airports, trains and post offices to the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation. The CBC is an instrument which pulls this country 
together. In some parts of Canada the CBC is the only 
communication Canadians get. These Reformers just want to 
cut, cut, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7212"> 7212 </A></B>
<P>
cut to a point where there will not be anything left to hold this 
country together.
<P>
	We on this side of the House realize that we have to run a lean 
government. However, we are not going to buy their notion of 
turning it into a mean government.
<P>
	I wish the Reform Party would also spend some time talking 
about some strategies for growth. Put some ideas forward that 
will help small business. The hon. member is sitting next to his 
colleague who worked very hard for seven months to put some 
specific ideas forward to help small business get access to 
capital.
<P>
	The Reform Party should spend a little less time on the deficit 
and a little bit more time on how we create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, asking me how to create jobs is the 
easiest question in the world to answer, and I will answer it for 
this hon. member.
<P>
	The biggest impediment to economic growth in this country is 
the cost of doing business. Our taxation levels are among the 
highest in the world. We have taxed ourselves out of the 
competitive market in our manufacturing, our service, our 
production. The answer to getting business and industry off the 
ground is to give them some tax relief.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	If the government had turned the $6 billion it spent on the 
infrastructure program into a $6 billion tax break for private 
business, it would not have just created the 7,000 or 8,000 jobs 
that it did, it probably would have created about 40,000 jobs. As 
a matter of fact, I could be corrected but I believe the Minister of 
Finance some time back said that it would create 40,000 jobs but 
that just did not come about. If the government would get off the 
backs of private businesses and give them some tax breaks, 
some tax incentives to expand and develop and to grow and hire 
more people that would create economic growth.
<P>
	I want to talk about the crown corporations. I realize that 
some crown corporations play a vital role. However that is no 
excuse for the government's inability to run those crown 
corporations at least at a break even point. We are not asking the 
crown corporations to make any money, just break even at least.
<P>
	The hon. members on the other side always make Reformers 
out to be the slash and burners, the hackers and cutters. All we 
want is a government that can operate something at least at a 
break even point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, for one year now that party has been the party of 
gloom and doom, the end of the world is coming. It has been the 
cut, cut, cut party. In fact if those members are looking for an 
alternative name they might call themselves the gloom and 
doom party or the cut, cut, cut party. I rather prefer the second 
because it has more rhythm.
<P>
	Looking at the opinion polls, why is it that Canadians have 
favoured the Liberal Party, the party that is in government today, 
with its gradual approach to the creation of jobs and the 
reduction of the deficit and the debt? Why is it that their party's 
support, whatever little support it had, is evaporating quickly? 
Surely the majority of Canadians have a good sense of 
judgment. Surely the majority of Canadians know what is 
happening.
<P>
	Those hon. members talk about the infrastructure program as 
being inappropriate. First of all, they know as well as I do that it 
was not new money, it was reallocated money. I wanted to 
correct that.
<P>
	Is the hon. member supportive of his other colleague's 
remarks that the infrastructure program is not good for Canada, 
that the infrastructure program jobs are not appropriate jobs? I 
want him to confirm or deny that. Because the infrastructure 
program has created a better, superior infrastructure, does that 
not make it easier and better for us to be competitive, thereby 
creating long term jobs?
<P>
	Will the cut, cut, cut party, the gloom and doom party respond 
to that please?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I prefer to refer to our party as the 
party of reasoned logic. There were a number of questions. I 
would like to answer them one at a time, if I may.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to Canadians as being supportive of 
the Liberal government and what it is doing. We know how polls 
work. If we make 1,000 phone calls, 500 of them are made in the 
province of Ontario. Of those 500, 400 are probably made in 
metro Toronto. The same ratio applies to the province of 
Quebec. Those provinces are in pretty tough shape because of 
mismanagement by not only the federal government but also the 
provincial governments. In British Columbia and Alberta where 
the economy is better because we did a better job of it out there, 
it is not exactly the same as what the polls indicate. Let us be fair 
about the polls.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about this $6 billion as being 
reallocated money. He is talking about taking the $6 billion 
savings, the savings in Liberal terms, from the helicopter deal 
and reallocating it to the infrastructure program. That money 
was not spent yet on the helicopter program. It was cancelled. 
Just because you do not spend the money that is not savings. 
This government chose to spend it. It chose to borrow $6 billion 
and go in the hole $6 billion more.
<P>
	There is a simple truth and it is worth repeating. If the 
government formula of funding to create jobs, the billions and 
hundreds of billions of dollars that the Tories spent and the 
Liberals spent before them and now the Liberals are spending 
again worked, everyone in this country would have about six 
jobs for goodness sakes.
<P>

	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, we have about one minute to 
6.02 p.m. I think I will call it 6.02 p.m. and then we can get on 
with the rest of it.
<P>
	As it is 6.02 p.m. sort of, it is my duty to inform the House that 
pursuant to Standing Order 81(19), proceedings on the motion 
have expired.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BANKRUPTCYACT">BANKRUPTCY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed, from June 9, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-237, an act to amend the Bankruptcy Act (priority of 
claims), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for this 
opportunity to participate in the debate on this bill presented by 
the hon. member for Portneuf that would give employees and 
travelling salesmen higher priority than other creditors in the 
proceeds realized from the property of a bankrupt party.
<P>
	The bill before us provides for payment up to a limit of $9,000 
per person as the first priority in bankruptcy proceedings. The 
existing legislation does, in fact, cover workers. In it, workers 
benefit from a preferred claim to cover wages they earned 
during the six months immediately preceding the bankruptcy, 
for up to $2,000. The current legislation is not a perfect solution 
to the wage earner protection issue, but it is an immense 
improvement from the situation that existed before the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act was amended in 1992 as a result 
of Bill C-22.
<P>
	Hon. members may recall that before then, workers had a 
preferred claim for only up to $500 in unpaid wages and 
commissions. That level was established in 1949, when $500 
represented three months' wages. Since 1949, numerous 
attempts have been made to improve wage earner protection. In 
1970, the report of the study committee on bankruptcy and 
insolvency legislation recommended doubling the preferred 
amount, from $500 to $1,000.
<P>
	Bill C-60, tabled in 1975, contained a provision for the full 
super-priority of wage claims up to $2,000.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In 1980, the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade 
and Commerce assessed three possible solutions. The first was 
to establish a super-priority for wage claims, ranking them 
before all secured creditors' claims. This is the solution 
proposed to us today by the hon. member for Portneuf.
<P>
	The second proposal was to establish a modified priority for 
wage earners, ranking their claims before claims of creditors 
with security on current assets, such as cash, inventory or 
receivables.
<P>
	The third possibility was the creation of a wage earner 
protection fund.
<P>
	The committee maintained that administering super-priority 
and modified priority would be very difficult, the biggest 
problem being how to share the burden among the secured 
creditors, given the large number of possible guarantees. 
Super-priority was very likely to limit access to credit for 
labour-intensive industries. Payment would certainly not be 
guaranteed, much less the speed of payment.
<P>
	The Senate committee recommended establishing a wage 
earner protection fund that would be financed by all employers, 
based on the number of their employees, and by employees 
themselves, who would contribute a modest amount.
<P>
	So it went, that between the Senate committee report of 1980 
and the new Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of 1992, several 
more reports were to address the same perplexing issue of 
protecting the interests of wage earners.
<P>
	In total, there have been seven bills and seven reports all 
trying to address this recurring issue. Super-priority has been 
proposed before. It has been examined and rejected, as has the 
proposal of a fund from government revenues or a tax.
<P>
	In the coming months, the Minister of Industry will receive 
the recommendations of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Advisory Committee that has been struck to look into reform of 
the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. In the meantime, Industry 
Canada has been collecting data to help us make more informed 
decisions. When we examine these issues, we need to know the 
full extent of the problem, and how much it would take to 
resolve it.
<P>
	We must be able to answer a number of key questions before 
we can make intelligent choices on the options available to us.
<P>
	In how many bankruptcies do employees lose their wages? 
How much have they lost so far? Do the trustees refund part of 
the wages owed to them? How soon are these refunds made? To 
date, how much money has been available from the bankrup 
parties' property to pay creditors?
<P>
	I am sure that my colleagues on both sides of the House will 
want to reflect on these questions before they set about to reform 
the bankruptcy laws to provide some kind of wage earner 
protection. We do not have the answers now. We cannot assess 
the impact that Bill C-237 might have. I would suggest that this 
House let the government proceed with its fact-finding. I would 
also suggest that it give the government time to receive the 
recommendations of the advisory committee. On that  basis, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7214"> 7214 </A></B>
<P>
will vote against the legislation before us, and I recommend that 
my hon. colleagues do the same.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In total there have been seven bills and seven reports all trying 
to address this recurring issue. Super priority has been proposed 
before. It has been examined at some length and rejected as has 
the proposal of a fund from government revenues or a tax.
<P>
	In the coming months the Minister of Industry will receive the 
recommendations of the bankruptcy and insolvency advisory 
committee that has been struck to look into reform of the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
<P>
	I believe we need to know and have this report before we can 
proceed in the best possible way.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
bill is one that I really want to speak in favour of. As a business 
person prior to coming into this Chamber, I am very much aware 
of the fact that the success of any enterprise can only broaden on 
the basis of the input of the people who are working for that 
enterprise.
<P>
	Very frequently in small enterprises we have the entrepreneur 
who goes to the wall in terms of his own personal finances, the 
entrepreneur who puts absolutely everything on the line and 
probably pours an inordinate number of hours into the work. 
Then the entrepreneur, his wife, his immediate family or 
relatives might get one or two more people working. At some 
point we have employees coming into this growing business.
<P>
	I will make up a word picture to have a look at what is 
happening. The entrepreneur has $50,000, for the sake of 
discussion, that he can bring to the table. Perhaps he collapses 
some RRSPs or whatever the case may be. He decides he is 
going to go into the pizza business. He suddenly uncovers the 
fact that he is going to require at least $150,000 worth of 
equipment in order to just be in the basic pizza business. If he is 
going to actually get into a restaurant, the number is going to go 
way up from that point.
<P>
	Where is he going to go and where is he going to get the 
money? Let us step aside for a second and talk about the large 
enterprise, not perhaps as large as General Motors, but a larger 
enterprise that might have 100 or 200 people working for it that 
is in business at the moment. It is not infrequent that at this 
particular point in time that entrepreneur who perhaps has been 
in business longer, where there are now millions of dollars 
actually invested in the firm, will still have his house tied down 
with the bank as security.
<P>
	I say I want to speak in favour of this because I am 
sympathetic toward the motivation. After all is said and done, 
employees are simply an extension of the business owner, of the 
entrepreneur, of the corporate culture. When a business is 
reaching a point of downsizing and  things are closing in, those 
employees can make the difference of whether that enterprise 
will work or not.
<P>
	With this kind of protection they might be more 
inclined-after all we do have to look after ourselves in the 
business world-to give of themselves and be more sympathetic 
and actually make this enterprise continue to work. If they do 
not have any protection it is conceivable that either the larger or 
the smaller business could miss a pay day or two. We are looking 
at the pension side of things. It is entirely possible that by 
continuing to work the employee is actually working to his or 
her own personal detriment.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	If we want to have them completely on side and in the back of 
their minds they are working to their own detriment, is it not 
better to have this legislation in place?
<P>
	I repeat, I want to speak in favour of this bill, but I cannot. The 
reason why I will not speak in favour of this bill is because the 
biggest single problem, particularly for small business in 
Canada today, is working capital or equity or just the 
wherewithal to get the job done.
<P>
	At the moment it is not infrequent that businesses are faced 
with a situation of triple or quadruple security. The first thing 
the bank is going to say is: ``We want your inventory''. If that 
happens to be men's socks or widgets, flanges, gaskets or car 
parts, it does not make any difference. The bank says: ``We want 
security over your inventory''. It will not apply any value. It will 
not actually give any value. It just wants it.
<P>
	Second it says: ``We want your accounts receivable''. That 
makes sense because in business terms we have converted an 
asset to a negotiable security, as it were. This is an account 
payable. If it is 60 days or under it is a current asset. This is 
something that the bank by assignment can actually make use of. 
However it is not at all infrequent for the bank to say: ``We are 
only going to give 75, 65, 50 per cent of the value of your 60 
day's accounts receivable''. This is the reality small business is 
faced with.
<P>
	We come back to our little pizza shop owner. The bank will 
also say; ``By the way, we also want to have some way of 
attaching a mortgage to your equipment''. Everything is 
absolutely tied down.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member who proposed this bill, and there 
is no question in my mind that it was proposed in good faith, that 
if he actually speaks to the small business people in his 
constituency he will find that everything is completely tied 
down. Can he imagine that the bank or the lending institution of 
the business person's choice is now going to be told: ``Oh, for 
every employee that I get, I will be guaranteeing up to $9,000 for 
that employee that you will not be able to touch''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7215"> 7215 </A></B>
<P>
	That will be first charge. You will not be able to get to your 
pizza oven. You will not be able to get to your metal press. You 
will not be able to get to anything until that $9,000 per employee 
is satisfied. I suggest to the member that we would be shutting 
down the ability of small and medium sized businesses to get the 
cash they require to do business on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	I want to vote in favour of this. I understand the motivation of 
the member in proposing it. I want to support the employees 
because they deserve support. I want to support them because 
they are the lifeblood, the reason why a business is going to 
succeed. I want to vote in favour of it but I will not because 
without the ability to have access to adequate funding, in putting 
employees first the business will not exist and the employees 
will not even have a job to go to.
<P>
	It is with regret that I must say I will be voting against the 
member's bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have an 
opportunity to speak on Bill C-237, which provides a super 
priority for wage earners and travelling salesmen who can claim 
up to $9,000 owed to them in the event of bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to begin by picking up the point of the Reform 
Party member about how difficult it is for small and medium 
sized businessmen and women to get access to capital today. 
Because small business has a difficult time in getting access to 
capital, quite often the supporting suppliers to a small business 
will put their product or material into the business knowing that 
they have put themselves in a secure position. In fact when small 
businesses cannot get capital it is their suppliers that keep them 
going and help make them viable.
<P>
	This bill is not only going to affect the way the banks look at 
financing small businesses but it will also create a situation with 
the suppliers where they will be hesitant in putting their product 
into a small business environment at a very generous credit 
condition.
<P>
	We realize first of all that bankruptcy and insolvency are very 
complex issues. In the event of a business failing and going 
bankrupt there is only one pie to divide. If suddenly the priority 
is put on the wage earners and the travelling salesmen at a 
$9,000 level, not much room is left in many instances for the 
other components in the business equation.
<P>
	I would like to repeat that the intention of the member is right. 
It is a complex issue. We amended the Bankruptcy Act just two 
years ago. Currently the Minister of Industry has the department 
developing a database on all the activity around bankruptcy 
cases. These studies are ongoing.
<P>
	I really believe it is inappropriate to support this bill at this 
time. We should wait until we have the results of all that data 
which is being collected.
<P>
	The member for Kootenay East has said something about the 
importance of the employee to the viability of the business. I 
share his view and I obviously believe that would be the view of 
the member for Portneuf as well.
<P>
	In a case where we are putting all of the employees in a 
business in a super priority position at $9,000 per person, this 
would really affect the ability of a small businessman or woman 
to obtain the support that is usually required from banks. As we 
all know, even in the current condition banks are making it very 
difficult for small businessmen and women to obtain the 
necessary capital to meet their business plans and their 
objectives. Until we have the banks acting more progressively 
and until their attitudes change toward small business, this bill 
should be defeated.
<P>
	The other thing I mentioned has to do with suppliers. I believe 
that if we sent a signal in a business that if the employees want to 
show confidence in what they are doing they should not be doing 
it by putting themselves in the priority position to the tune of 
$9,000 a head. That in turn might have an adverse reaction on 
the suppliers to the business. Quite often in small business 
situations these suppliers can make the difference in viability, as 
I mentioned earlier.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Are you talking about somebody working 
on a loading dock?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> We are talking 
about wage earners and travelling salesmen. The bottom line is 
as the member for Kootenay East said, if you have a small 
business it might only employ 10 to 20 people. You are talking 
about a priority call of $180,000 just on 20 people. A first charge 
of $180,000 on a business is a heck of a lot of money.
<P>
	Everyone knows I am a believer in equity participation. I used 
to work at Magna International. I believe one of the reasons that 
company has grown from seven employees to 20,000 is because 
every employee has shares in the company. They have a piece of 
the equity. That is the reason they make better products at more 
competitive prices. But that of course is not what we are 
debating here today.
<P>
	I would ask all members that we defeat this bill and that we 
wait until the final results of the study come from Industry 
Canada on all the current activity in the bankruptcy area as a 
result of the last bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, even if 
there are limits to what one can say in this House, I am outraged 
and shocked at what I just heard. On the one hand, very generous 
speeches on workers and employees, all those people who make 
it possible for the big shots to get richer. On the other hand, a  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7216"> 7216 </A></B>
<P>
compassionate one on those poor small and medium-sized 
businesses having serious difficulties, and I agree businesses do 
experience difficult situations. But who do we want to protect 
here? The banks? In that case-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The suppliers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> They can go back at any time and get all of 
their supplies back from the businesses.
<P>
	This is a ludicrous situation that has been going on for years. I 
worked in labour organizations at one time, a while ago, but in 
those days, I must tell you I fought hard for the value of 
employment to be recognized. I will come back to that aspect 
some other time. For years now, workers have been in a situation 
where they are thrown out on the streets without notice and with 
no means of getting paid for salaries owed to them, no pension 
fund and no vacation pay, compensations they earned by 
working hard and that are owed to them. They are totally 
helpless and deprived of everything. Now we say it is because of 
the banks.
<P>
	This all powerful House of Commons could certainly give 
some thought to this issue. I think members here must vote 
according to their own consciences because we all know this is a 
matter of principle. It suggests that the government deal with 
this issue as a priority.
<P>
	I understood very well the speech made by my friend-I am 
sorry, I meant my colleague-here besides me and I cannot say I 
am insensitive to what he said, but I will reply the same way. We 
cannot let others tell us what to do regarding workers who have 
earned salaries, small salaries, when we see banks threaten not 
to finance them.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I am proud of my colleague who is here in the House. Let me 
explain that the maximum of $9,000 he mentioned when he 
introduced this bill, would, of course, be an exceptional 
situation because in most cases, employers pay salaries on a 
weekly or bi-monthly basis. It is an exceptional situation, but 
there have been cases where some very substantial amounts 
have accumulated.
<P>
	The hon. member also pointed out that if they are protected, 
employees will be more inclined to take a chance to help a small 
business through a rough patch, if they have the assurance-as 
my colleague argued-that they will recover their stakes. This 
aspect can be extremely important for a small business because, 
as far as I know, the banks often do not treat them very well and 
give no warning before they pull the plug, as they say.
<P>
	Consequently, it is important for small businesses to know 
that employees will have certain guarantees and will be able to 
stick with their company, even when times are hard. Today, 
however, employees bear the brunt of these hard times, while 
when business is good, they do not get any of the profits.
<P>
	To me, it is a case of elementary social justice. I think we 
should look at what we can do to make the banks take this into 
consideration. In fact, the government has promised it will 
prepare a plan for small business financing and for dealing with 
their specific problems. But it should not let the success of small 
businesses depend on their ability to avoid paying the wages, 
annual leave and pension benefits to employees who earned 
them.
<P>
	I expect the House to vote in favour of this bill. It is a vote that 
reflects a principle and a commitment and tells the government: 
Do what governments have been promising all along and what 
workers now consider to be a running gag. If that is what the 
unions think, you can imagine what non-union workers are 
saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today and discuss Bill C-237. 
This bill proposes to change the priority of payment of claims 
provided for in the Bankruptcy Act so that employees be the first 
to be paid in case of their employer's bankruptcy.
<P>
	The hon. member for Portneuf is proposing to pay these 
claims, up to a limit of $9,000, to each employee of the bankrupt 
business. I congratulate him for this very commendable 
initiative.
<P>
	At first glance, and before thoroughly examining the 
consequences of this bill, I would have been tempted to support 
it. However, after some deep thinking and research on the issue, 
I came to another conclusion, at least for the time being.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that the contents of 
Bill C-237 have been proposed many times in the past. And each 
time, that proposal or another one such as this has been 
thoroughly examined. I am alluding here to seven pieces of 
legislation that have been moved since 1970 on the issue of 
employee protection, as well as seven other reports that were 
tabled on that issue since that time.
<P>
	Finally, these failures led the previous government to forgo 
the provisions relating to the wage claim payment program in 
order to have other provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act adopted. There should be a clear message here.
<P>
	There is still room for improvements, but the present situation 
is better than the one which prevailed in 1992, when the act was

<P>
	At that time, employees could expect only $500 if they lost 
their jobs when their employer went bankrupt. Now, workers 
have a privileged claim up to $2,000 for the six months 
preceding the bankruptcy. The new provisions of the legislation 
provide that no tribunal can approve a proposal unless it 
includes payment of wages owed to the workers up to $2,000 per 
worker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7217"> 7217 </A></B>
<P>
	Bankruptcy and insolvency are complex issues, but the 
general picture is easy to grasp. There is a single cake of finite 
size. If you cut a bigger slice for one group, let us say the 
employees, clearly the remaining slices will be smaller. If a 
super-priority is given to one of the parties, it will be more 
difficult to pay the others, including secured creditors.
<P>
	We have no other choice but to look at the whole picture, 
which requires time, expertise and concerted efforts. We must, 
at least, have a good idea of the impact one priority will have on 
all the others. Even if all parties co-operate and work 
harmoniously, a certain balance will have to be struck when 
dividing the cake.
<P>
	Who should carry the burden of paying the employees up to 
$9,000 in the present difficult situation? What would the 
consequences of such a measure be on credit institutions, when 
fledgling or shaky companies come knocking on their doors 
with a potential debt of $9,000 per employee? What will they 
say to these companies who might employ more people than 
they should? Can we accept that they be penalized because they 
created jobs in an economy where jobs are difficult to come by?
<P>
	Moreover, should employees show solidarity and assume, 
with those who really benefit, part of the financing necessary to 
protect a large work force? Briefly, let us say that we do not 
know precisely what measure would protect the workers more 
effectively, but Industry Canada continues to collect data, while 
the debate goes on. At the very least, establishing a 
super-priority, whether for employees, creditors or consumers, 
would have serious implications for everybody concerned.
<P>
	The whole economy will feel the consequences. Until the 
government has answers to these questions and many other 
crucial and closely related questions which directly affect the 
superpriority issue, it is useless to try to deal with the 
complexities of specific priority claims. The claims of 
employees are part and parcel of the larger issue of bankruptcy 
reform, that we will be debating in upcoming months.
<P>
	I would be hard-pressed to choose between the priority rights 
of the employees, or those of the suppliers, who have the right to 
take back their merchandise, or those of the buyers who made 
their purchases in good faith, not knowing that those goods were 
about to be repossessed. Again, if we put companies in such a 
position that they have to close down or if we create a situation 
where their available capital will disappear, their employees 
will have to look for jobs somewhere else.
<P>
	We are still at an early stage, maybe not so early if one 
considers the history of Canadian workers, who had been 
expecting for a long time what they finally obtained in 1992, but 
nevertheless it is early in the context of the new legislation and 
of the related review process which should be completed by 
1995.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	It was a fierce battle from the beginning, and it took 40 years 
before we could get a revision of the Bankruptcy Act in 1992. 
There was widespread consultation of the people concerned 
because lots of diverging interests were at stake.
<P>
	Perhaps those questions should not even be discussed in the 
context of general legislation on insolvency. The government 
must consider a debtor company's capacity to negotiate its 
successful restructuring.
<P>
	Again, this is a web of very complex problems. In order to 
devise legal options that really work, the people concerned and 
the government must co-operate. We must all work to maintain 
the process by means of a review after three years and people 
must inform the government of any aspect which is of 
importance to them.
<P>
	Another way to protect the reform, in political terms, is to try 
to guarantee government the largest possible consensus among 
stakeholders on any future reform. That is what we are trying to 
do with our consultation and partnership approach.
<P>
	I am convinced that the member for Portneuf has no desire to 
introduce a bill that would imperil the jobs of those very workers 
that he is trying to protect. I am equally convinced that he would 
not want to help a small number of workers at the expense of the 
majority. In no way am I questioning the good intentions of this 
bill's promoter. I am not necessarily taking sides in this matter. I 
am merely trying to obtain more information in order to 
understand the real effect of this superpriority.
<P>
	In my opinion, the House should consider employee 
protection in the larger context of bankruptcy, and to do so, it 
should wait for the results of studies already under way. I also 
feel that it is too early to evaluate the repercussions of the 
priorities which, as I said, are mentioned in the new Bankruptcy 
and Insolvency Act. We must tackle the various aspects of 
bankruptcy, ranging from the international to the individual 
level.
<P>
	The House should go ahead with its review and allow the 
government enough time to receive its advisory committee's 
recommendations on the matter. Consequently, the House 
should reject Bill C-237, at least for the time being.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise today speak to Bill C-237, an act to amend the 
Bankruptcy Act.
<P>
	When I review the intent of the bill a couple of things strike 
me. First, the intention behind it is certainly good. It says 
something about the person who has moved the bill, that they 
want to protect the employees of a business that has gone 
bankrupt. Certainly all Canadians sympathize with people who 
would be denied their wages because a business has gone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7218"> 7218 </A></B>
<P>
bankrupt and they are not at  the top of the list of the secured 
creditors but are well down the list.
<P>
	Having said that, I am also struck by another concept that I 
read about some time ago and recently reread. It just really 
impressed upon my mind how often we get away from this whole 
idea in government when we are making important decisions 
that can affect individuals and businesses across the country.
<P>
	I remember reading in a book by an economist by the name of 
Henry Hazlitt about how often one of the greatest failures of 
economists and people who are making decisions that affect 
economies is to not foresee the secondary and unseen effects of 
the measures they are proposing. With respect to my hon. friend 
in the Bloc I think that is what we have done in Bill C-237, an act 
to amend the Bankruptcy Act.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the unseen effects of the legislation-and other 
members have referred to it-is the kind of incentive there 
would be for banks and providers of capital to continue to 
provide that capital to businesses.
<P>
	Banks are already very reluctant to provide capital to 
businesses for a number of reasons. My hon. friend from 
Kootenay West went through a litany of the things that banks 
require before they will lend a business money. Now the 
amendment to Bill C-237 is proposing to put one more 
impediment in place that would cause banks to think twice about 
funding a business.
<P>
	That is a great concern to me. It is a great concern to the 
government across the way and I believe to the Bloc. As has 
been referred to many times in the House, the great engine of the 
economy in Canada is small business. Small business creates 85 
per cent of all jobs in the country.
<P>
	On one hand the bill appears to be protecting employees. On 
the other hand we do not see all the jobs it would prevent from 
being created because banks and other providers of capital 
would be reluctant to lend the money knowing their loan is not 
secured under the proposal.
<P>
	That is something we have to be conscious of, particularly in 
the competitive environment we have today not only within 
Canada but within North America and certainly around the 
world. There are all kinds of different advantages that other 
countries have and will try to use against us to get their share of 
the market.
<P>
	We are a relatively wealthy country. We can attribute that to 
the small and medium sized business to a great degree. We have 
to be conscious of the types of burdens we impose upon them 
when we propose to do what seems on the surface to be a very 
good thing. Canadian businesses, small business in particular, 
are the creators of jobs and all that wealth out there.
<P>
	I am not certain the hon. member has really taken that into 
consideration. Banks and anybody else who provides capital 
have many options when they think about where they want to 
invest their money. Capital is very fluid. It flows to where it gets 
the highest return and where the risk is the least. One thing that 
may happen if the bill were passed would be that banks would 
start saying that they do not want to fund small businesses 
because they are not going to be a secured creditor. Another 
thing that could happen is that they would fund them but raise 
interest rates. They would put on a risk premium because they 
are concerned about losing their money.
<P>
	We already have a problem in the country where we have 
some of the highest real interest rates in the world, which again 
hurts our competitive position. We have to think long and hard 
about the repercussions. If we are in that position where 
businesses are forced to pay higher interest rates then we will 
have a situation where there will be less jobs created.
<P>
	Those are the things we never see and are never reported in the 
newspapers: the jobs that are not created and the businesses that 
are not started because of legislation. It is very easy to point to a 
plant closing somewhere and say: ``Is it not a shame those 
people did not get their two weeks' pay?''
<P>
	Is it not also a shame when people do not go into business 
because they know the bank is going to turn them down? The 
bank is not confident it will get its money back because it is not 
at the highest level on the list of claims; it is not a secured claim.
<P>
	We can take a look at what the government is proposing in 
many areas. Infrastructure would be a good example. Any time 
the government prepares to intervene in the economy we have to 
think about the secondary and unseen effects.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	There is another aspect that I would ask hon members in the 
House to consider. What if a supplier to a business is barely 
hanging on and has a lot of employees who are trying to keep 
their jobs? They do not want to end up on the unemployment or 
welfare rolls, yet all of a sudden the position of the struggling 
business is not secure any more. The government has extended 
the misery a little further down the line. The next guy down the 
line is in a position where he may be forced into bankruptcy and 
people may be out of a job because of the situation the 
government has imposed by approving Bill C-237.
<P>
	There are effects that go beyond the banks and interest rates. 
There are also the effects on suppliers. Suppliers may be very 
reluctant to extend supplies or inventory to anybody but the 
most secure businesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7219"> 7219 </A></B>
<P>
	In this environment in this day and age we know that no such 
businesses can be completely guaranteed against failure. Over 
the last recession we saw businesses fail that were in operation 
for not only tens of years but in some cases over a hundred years. 
That speaks volumes about the competitiveness of the 
environment and perhaps a bit about the instability of the 
business environment. Even in the best of times businesses 
cannot be counted upon to survive because they always have 
more and more competition.
<P>
	I know members of the Bloc are supporters of free trade. We 
now have trade deals with the United States and Mexico. I am 
not aware of any such legislation in either the United States or 
Mexico that would parallel this legislation. In other words, we 
would be putting a burden on Canadian businesses, Canadian 
suppliers and Canadian providers of capital that does not exist in 
some other countries around the world, in this case particularly 
the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	A couple of things could happen. First, businesses in the other 
countries will have a competitive advantage over Canadian 
businesses. Entrepreneurs from this country and Quebec can go 
south of the border. Perhaps they can go to Mexico if they have 
any type of business idea that will prosper no matter where it 
starts up. They can go there to escape the type of legislation we 
are talking about here.
<P>
	Another thing that can happen is that capital can flow out of 
this country to more friendly environments where capital is 
treated with a little more respect. Maybe another way to put it is 
that the business environment is a lot more friendly. As I pointed 
out a minute ago, capital always flows to where it can get the 
best return and where there is the least risk.
<P>
	In this day and age in this environment in Canada we have a 
$535 billion debt and we are going into debt at a rate of $40 
billion a year or perhaps even more than that. We have some of 
the highest interest rates in the world. We have some of the 
highest taxes in the world. We have all kinds of competitive 
disadvantages. We have hot competition because of free trade 
with the United States and Mexico. Through GATT we have 
more trade pressures from around the world. Given all these 
factors I think it would be foolhardy to support the legislation. 
Therefore I will be voting against it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise in this House today, October 25, 
1994, a year after the election. I would like to thank the people 
of Trois-Rivières for having placed their confidence in me and I 
hope that I have been worthy of it. I can assure my constituents 
that I will do everything in my power to keep their trust.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to briefly thank my organizers at the time, 
800 party workers who, on October 25, 1993, worked for my 
election under the capable leadership, I  would like to point out, 
of Diane Talbot to whom I paid tribute this morning.
<P>
	I am pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-237, An Act 
to amend the Bankruptcy Act (priority of claims). The bill's 
explanatory note reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this bill is to change the priority of payment of claims in case of 
the bankruptcy of an employer, in order that the wages, salaries and pension plan 
contributions of an employee, up to a limit of nine thousand dollars, be paid in 
priority to any other class of claims.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	At this stage, I wish to commend my colleague, the member 
for Portneuf, for his determination, insight and courage in 
presenting this very socially-oriented bill, it must be said. Some 
societal choices are implicit in such a bill, in such a way of 
looking at things.
<P>
	This issue was discussed in Parliament for the first time in 
1919. However, even though most of the discussion on this idea 
of priority or super priority of wage claims has occurred over the 
last 20 years, the bank lobby always seems to win out, at the last 
minute. That is obvious in all the documents one can read on the 
issue.
<P>
	When a bankruptcy occurs, there are secured creditors, 
preferred creditors, and then common creditors. Workers rank 
fourth among the preferred creditors.
<P>
	We have to realize that a bankruptcy means something painful 
and sad which someone has to pay for. Since we can identify at 
first glance four types of major players that are always there: the 
government, the suppliers, the lenders and the workers-there 
are always four types of players-we must ask ourselves who is 
in the best position to assume the loss. Who is the most 
vulnerable? We could quickly analyse this.
<P>
	Is it the government that has the most to lose? If it assumes 
some losses, despite the disastrous budgetary situation that it is 
in right now, this will always represent, in terms of revenue, of 
shortfall, a drop in the ocean. If ever the situation that is 
advocated became as dramatic as that in terms of lost revenue, 
the government could always change the act, since it has this 
legislative authority as well as being a player in the debate.
<P>
	There are the suppliers who can pay, and they are increasingly 
better protected by the new Bankruptcy Act that was changed 
last year. If they sustain losses, they can file them as bad claims 
which will reduce their income tax accordingly.
<P>
	There are lending institutions, particularly banks, for which 
these are bad claims, first on the accounting level. They could 
see here a means of improving their social responsibility, of 
improving their follow-up advice on the case, and perhaps a 
means of better disciplining themselves, knowing that they will 
now have something to lose if they pull the plug, as was 
mentioned earlier.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7220"> 7220 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, there are the employees, who have no leeway 
whatsoever to make up for the loss that they fall prey to in the 
case of a bankruptcy when we decide, under the present act, that 
they will have to pay. They have no way out.
<P>
	I will put forward a principle that has not been proposed yet, 
the principle of the most vulnerable. Who is the most 
vulnerable? A quick analysis shows that in a case of bankruptcy, 
it is obviously the workers, who foot the bill, and not only 
directly, since they will not receive any salary and wages and 
they will have incurred expenses during that period. I am talking 
about expenses in terms of transportation, meals, clothing and 
even housing in some cases. And then they find out one, two, 
three or four weeks later that they will not get any wages, they 
will not be able to provide a decent living for their family for 
that period. Moreover, they will have spent money to go to work 
for an employer who is not able to pay them, which is contrary to 
the intent of our legislation where a service is provided for a 
salary.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	They say that from now on, banks would be very reluctant to 
loan money. I take this opportunity to invite people to read the 
report the industry committee has just tabled. It mentions that 
the Small Businesses Loans Act will be broadened to include 
exporting businesses. The Bloc Quebecois made a special 
recommendation to the effect that the Small Businesses Loans 
Act should apply to all businesses with respect to loans and 
working capital. If our recommendation were to be accepted, it 
would make banks feel more secure when things go sour, since 
the loans would be guaranteed by the government, which would 
lessen their losses.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to say that this is an excellent piece of 
legislation and that, contrary to those who would like to narrow 
its scope, I, for one, claim that if we were to review this act 
which guarantees bank loans, we should make a cost-benefit 
analysis, taking into account the jobs it creates, the taxes it 
generates, and the savings in unemployment insurance and 
welfare it represents.
<P>
	Once again, I congratulate my colleague. Mr. Speaker, I am 
quite sure that you would like to know that the sovereign Quebec 
of tomorrow will be a little bit like this. It will respect 
individuals who are the driving force of any activity, be it 
economic or otherwise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 3 I asked the Minister of the Environment a question 
about the toxic substances policy she announced on September 
27. I asked her when the measures on pesticides would be 
implemented and what the timeframe for the policy was.
<P>
	The minister replied that she had the intention of introducing 
implementing legislation in the early spring. Some suggestions 
might therefore be in place here tonight.
<P>
	The goals of this toxic policy are as follows. First, to virtually 
eliminate from the environment substances that are the result of 
human activity, persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Second, 
to ensure that all other substances of concern are adequately 
managed throughout their use so that there is minimum impact 
on the environment and human health.
<P>
	Those substances which are persistent, bioaccumulative and 
toxic are to be virtually eliminated from the environment 
through a management program that ensures ``no measurable 
release'' of each substance. However, when it comes to 
substances which cannot be controlled, measures will be taken 
to prevent their generation and use. The onus will be on industry 
to demonstrate that the proposed management program will 
ensure that there is no measurable release of the substances into 
the environment.
<P>
	The first point that I need to make here tonight is that if we are 
to have a sound toxic policy in Canada we must ensure that it is 
based on sound concepts. Clearly pollution prevention is at the 
crux of this policy. Is it adequate to say that pollution prevention 
is the control of the release of toxic substances rather than the 
reduction in their generation and use? Will control of release be 
adequate to protect human health and the environment?
<P>
	Second, the term reverse onus is used throughout the 
discussion paper. Reverse onus is actually intended to mean that 
no production or use of substances is allowed until it is proven 
that these substances are not toxic. This burden is intended to 
fall upon industry and not on the government. Therefore I would 
suggest the proposed reverse onus should be expended so as to 
apply to proving the safety of the substances first and then to the 
management plans.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="7221"> 7221 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Third, the definition of toxicity. It is based on the 
Environment Protection Act definition which states that the 
substance is toxic if it is present in the environment and in a 
quantity or concentration that may have a harmful effect on the 
environment or may cause an endangerment to human health.
<P>
	Why not then adopt a definition of toxicity that does not have 
thresholds so high that the scope and effectiveness of the policy 
is thwarted? For example the policy proposed by the 
government is intended to apply to all substances used and 
released into the environment. Is this definition broad enough? 
Should it not include threats posed to human health on sites 
where these substances are used prior to the release of the 
substance into the environment?
<P>
	Fourth, the concern that for a substance to be considered toxic 
it must meet certain threshold levels in three different criteria; 
persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. For some reason the 
proposed policy contains threshold levels that are often higher, 
less stringent than those proposed by the Ontario government, 
the priority substance list of the Environment Protection Act. 
Should we not ensure that we have stringent threshold levels to 
ensure the safety of human health and the environment?
<P>
	To conclude, the success or failure of the proposed toxics 
policy rests on definitions and criteria. If they are too weak then 
the rest of the policy will be ineffective.
<P>
	My question to the minister is will the proposed definitions 
and levels be re-examined and brought up to levels required to 
protect all life in the long term?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in reply to the hon. member for Davenport I would 
mention that a toxic substances management policy was 
released on September 27 and given a period of 60 days for 
consultation and comments from the public and other interested 
bodies.
<P>
	This period is going to end on November 30, 1994. Obviously 
among the comments I expect to be received include the key 
questions raised by the hon. member such as what really 
constitutes pollution prevention. Today the minister alluded to 
pollution prevention in a statement in the House as part of the 
very basis of our objective in trying to pursue environmental and 
sustainable development goals.
<P>
	The question of pollution prevention, the definition of 
toxicity, the whole concept of reverse onus, the whole question 
of levels raised by the hon. member are obviously going to come 
up. These concepts or ideas require co-ordination with existing 
instruments, as rightly underlined by the member, with CEPA 
and with the other policies and programs of government.
<P>
	What I strongly suggest to the hon. member is given the high 
regard in which he is held by all his colleagues in regard to 
environmental questions, including by the minister herself, is 
that he provide his input into the consultation process on these 
very issues that are so crucial to a reliable toxic substances 
policy.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that between now and 
November 30 he let the minister have his thoughts and I can 
assure him they will be taken with very serious and constructive 
consideration.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FOREIGNAFFAIRS">FOREIGN AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ron Fewchuk (Selkirk-Red River, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on October 19 I rose in the House to ask the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs what leadership role Canada would undertake to restore 
the Ukrainian economy after decades of economic and 
environmental mismanagement under the former Soviet regime.
<P>
	I was very pleased to hear the minister indicate to this House 
that last July in Naples the G-7 countries endorsed the proposal 
of the Prime Minister to host a conference on economic reform 
in Ukraine.
<P>
	As a Manitoban and a Canadian of Ukrainian descent I am 
very proud that the economic conference will take place in 
Winnipeg on October 27. The meeting will be attended by 
officials from the G-7 countries.
<P>
	I understand that a proposal at this meeting is to discuss 
Ukraine's plan for economic reform and international support 
for Ukraine's economic transformation. I know that it is 
important that Canada and the G-7 countries encourage Ukraine 
to implement an economic reform program in co-operation with 
international financial institutions.
<P>
	I was very pleased to hear that Canada is totally committed to 
Ukraine and has committed over $41 million to over 70 projects. 
It has been brought to my attention that Canada will further 
pledge up to $20 million in aid to help Ukraine transfer its 
economy to a western style market system.
<P>
	I strongly believe that these projects are an investment in the 
future of Ukraine and an investment for Canada. These projects 
will be beneficial for all parties involved. This will open up a 
whole new market for Canadian businesses. Presently Canada 
and the United States are the only countries which have pledged 
their assistance.
<P>
	During the Winnipeg meeting officials are expected to 
encourage the G-7 countries to pledge aid. I would very much 
like to get clarification on exactly how Canada is investing in 
the future and fostering better ties with Ukraine.
<P>
	I am also very concerned about the environmental 
mismanagement that occurred under the former Soviet regime. 
Therefore I would like to know exactly what is going to be done 
concerning the environmental cleanup and the prevention of 
further pollutants being released into our environment.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7222"> 7222 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Selkirk-Red River for raising this issue and a number of 
issues especially when the President of Ukraine is visiting here 
in Canada.
<P>
	Canada's special relationship with Ukraine is based on the 
close ties established with the 1 million strong Ukrainian 
Canadian community. The Prime Minister has worked to put the 
G-7 focus on Ukraine.
<P>
	Canada is hosting, as the hon. member has already said, a 
conference on partnership for economic transformation in 
Ukraine in Winnipeg on October 27 which will include 
representatives not only from the G-7 countries but the 
European Union, IMF, World Bank, European Bank, Russia and 
Turkmenistan.
<P>
	Canada has encouraged the Ukrainian government to adopt 
genuine economic reform that would be supported by IMF and 
World Bank lending. We welcome President Kuchma's new 
reform program which represents a bold step forward.
<P>
	Canada will continue to play a leading role in supporting 
reform in Ukraine. Canada and the United States were the only 
two countries to make pledges during a recent IMF meeting 
which considered Ukrainian financial needs for the fourth 
quarter of this year.
<P>
	During the visit of President Kuchma to Canada this week 
several new initiatives have been announced. This package 
includes $23.8 million in technical assistance initiatives which 
target policy advice on reform, private sector development and 
nuclear safety issues; $13.5 million in balance of payments 
support and a new $20 million EDC line of credit.
<P>
	Protection of the environment is of critical importance to 
Ukraine, and Canada is demonstrating its leadership in this area 
through a number of technical assistance initiatives targeting 
water resource management and nuclear waste management.
<P>
	Canada was the first donor country to implement a major 
environmental project in Ukraine.
<P>
	We are currently supporting a $5 million, three-year project 
to assist with the rehabilitation of the Dnipro River, the source 
of drinking water for 70 per cent of Ukraine's population and 
one of the country's most pressing environmental problems.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank hon. members for their interventions.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
