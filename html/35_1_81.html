	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week 
across the country Canadians of Portuguese origin are hosting 
Portugal Week, a festival of celebration and good cheer. The 
highlight of this week is June 10, the Portuguese national day, a 
celebration of the many accomplishments of the Portuguese 
Canadian community. This day has historic significance as well 
for it is the anniversary of the death of the great poet, Luis Vaz 
de Camoes.
<P>
	In my riding of Trinity-Spadina, the week's festivities are 
organized by the Alliance of Portuguese Clubs and Associations 
of Ontario. Among the events scheduled are a soccer 
tournament, art exhibits, a parade, as well as numerous concerts 
featuring internationally recognized Portuguese entertainers.
<P>
	I would like to salute members of the Portuguese community 
in my riding for their contribution to the cultural life of Toronto 
and of Canada during this their week of celebration.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, on June 6, 
the Deputy Prime Minister challenged the figures quoted in <I>Le 
Devoir</I> to the effect that officer cadet training at Kingston's 
military college was more costly than the training provided at 
the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister did so in spite of the fact that the 
Ministerial Committee on Canadian Military Colleges tabled a 
report in May 1993 containing figures which support the claim 
that the cost of officer cadet training is higher in Kingston than it 
is in Saint-Jean. Training costs were assessed at $71,291 at the 
Kingston facility, compared to $58,356 at the college in 
Saint-Jean. Training costs are, therefore, 22 per cent higher in 
Kingston.
<P>
	This government refuses to reconsider its decision to close the 
Collège militaire de Saint-Jean. We can only conclude that its 
decision must be politically motivated.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Kemano completion project in British Columbia is currently 
under review by the B.C. Utilities Commission. However the 
terms of reference of this commission do not address reduced 
water flows into the Nechako and Fraser River systems and the 
subsequent impact on fisheries, municipalities and industry.
<P>
	A petition from 1,100 constituents of Comox-Alberni shows 
the deep concern that this project has the potential of becoming 
the worst environmental disaster B.C. has yet encountered. The 
only way to avoid this potential disaster is to ensure a full 
federal environmental review is carried out on this project. Until 
this review is conducted, there is no process where all activity 
that occurred behind closed doors among the previous 
Conservative government, the B.C. government, DFO and 
Alcan is out in the open.
<P>
	I encourage the government to order a full environmental 
review of the Kemano completion project in order to alleviate 
the concerns of many British Columbians.

Fredericton-York-Sunbury's latest public consultation 
meeting held last Sunday. Over 100 participants gathered to 
debate gender related issues ranging from housing and child 
care to abortion and same sex spousal benefits.
<P>
	This marked the fourth in a series of riding forums since 
February. The first dealt with health care, the second, national 
defence and the third, human resources development. I wish to 
thank my colleagues from Perth-Wellington-Waterloo for 
participating in the defence forum, from York North for 
contributing to the HRD debate and from Halifax for input on

congratulations go out to Katie Johnson, the grade one pupil at 
Centennial Central elementary school in Arva who recently 
placed first in a CBC radio story writing competition with her 
story entitled ``Henry''. Katie exemplifies the importance of the 
ability to read and write and the personal rewards they can bring.
<P>
	As an educator, I recognize there are people in every walk of 
life who, through no fault of their own, may not be able to read to 
their children or be able to fill out a job application.
<P>
	I wish to commend the work of the organizers of the National 
Adult Literacy Database which is located in my riding of 
London-Middlesex. I praise the efforts of all of the individuals 
who are working hard to provide literacy training to thousands 
of Canadians. Their work and the restoration of the national 
literacy fund by the government will significantly improve 
literacy skills.

ACFO intends to reach out and grasp the hand extended to it last 
Friday by the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois.

for refusing, in spite of the pressure put on it by Liberal 
franco-ontarian members and ministers, to allow a partisan line 
to be dictated to it and for its desire to remain faithful to 
franco-ontarian interests.
<P>
	We encourage leaders in the rest of Canada to follow ACFO's 
example and to come to the realization that their relations with 
Quebec are about to take on an entirely different complexion.

	Betty has recently been awarded the 1994 Kinsmen

also worked extensively with the Salvation Army's Red Shield 
Appeal, Meals on Wheels, the United Way, the community's 
senior home and her local church.

Oceans Day, we celebrate our oceans, the source of life on our 
planet. First declared in Rio, Oceans Day inspires and 
challenges us to become caretakers of our ocean environment.
<P>
	Oceans supply the world's people with more animal protein 
than any other source. The sea has given us anti-leukemia drugs 
from sea sponges, bone graft materials from coral, and 
diagnostic chemicals from red algae. The ocean is the economic 
lifeline for coastal communities and fish workers by the 
millions.
<P>
	For this reason we must keep in mind that human activities 
have a direct impact on coastal waters. For example, activities 
which take place inland account for nearly 80 per cent of marine 
pollution. Inshore dams can cause declining coastal fisheries. 
Oil spills from ships are to be prevented.
<P>

oceans.

planning process which will create the blueprint for its 
development into the next century.
<P>
	The university's planning process allows for consultation 
with university and non-university participants. The eight task 
forces will study a number of issues, including identifying 
external factors, assessing its values and culture, and 
identifying the strengths and weaknesses of existing programs 
and resources.
<P>
	The University of Guelph is an important part of 
Guelph-Wellington. Its remarkable international reputation 
can only be enhanced by this process.
<P>
	I congratulate the president of the university, Mordechai 
Rozanski, on this important initiative. This process will result in

have the opportunity this afternoon to commend the activities of 
National Transportation Week to the House.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	As Canadians we are all aware of the major importance 
transportation has in the life of a nation that borders on three 
oceans and ranges across mountains, tundra, prairies and rolling 
countryside.
<P>
	On the export market 18 to 45 per cent of the price of 
Canadian primary products such as coal and forest products is 
transportation costs. For manufactured goods at least 5 per cent 
of the price is the result of transportation and in some cases that 
figure can be as high as 17 per cent. Domestically the cost of 
transporting goods is equally important. An estimated 40 per 
cent of provincial exports are sold in regions other than where 
they are produced.
<P>
	Government and industry must work together to build the 
operational links that will ensure the seamless transportation 
systems that will do justice to the professionalism, dedication 
and hard work of the hundreds of thousands of men and women 
who keep our transportation systems running safely, efficiently 
and effectively.
<P>
	Please join me in a salute to these Canadians workers during 
National Transportation Week '94.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
percentage of women in the labour force has been decreasing 
since 1990. Women between 15 and 24 are the main victims. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development claims that his 
Youth Service Corps will help turn the situation around by 
allowing participants to spend $2,000 on child care when this 
money has already been earmarked for other purposes.
<P>
	This measure discriminates against women since it is 
primarily women who have custody of children and nearly 60 
per cent of these women live below the poverty line. Without a 
specific program to help them find jobs or go back to school, 
these women will not be able to get out of this intolerable 
situation. What is the government waiting for when it should be 
formulating a job-creation policy that takes these women's 
reality into account?

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
price of gasoline has gone up again in Regina and other parts of 
Canada with no explanation. There have been no new taxes and 
the price of crude has declined from one year ago.
<P>
	The price of gas jumped three cents a litre for no reason 
except to make oil companies richer. Energy consumers are 
angry and want an investigation into why they must pay more to 
line the pockets of big oil giants.
<P>
	The government must put an end to the gouging at the pumps 
now. Canadians need an energy price review commission to 
encourage fair competitive pricing and to review monopoly 
pricing.
<P>
	Last year Esso Canada made a profit of $582 million and 
75 per cent of that money went to the U.S. as dividends. 
Companies like Esso show little respect for the consumers in 
this country. Huge profits do not mean fair prices but higher 
prices. Why? We want to know why.

price gouging. I look forward to seeing what action the

to hear the Leader of the Opposition yesterday make a 
commitment to respect the democratic process guaranteeing 
everyone the right to express themselves freely on our country's 
future. He said that the last 30 years have led us to a dead end. 
What a gross misstatement! In the last 30 years, Canada and 
Quebec have enjoyed the highest rate of economic growth and 
the highest standard of living of all OECD countries.
<P>
	Just imagine what this country would be like if instead of 
splitting up, we joined forces. It remains to be seen whether Mr. 
Parizeau shares the ideas of his friend and ally in opposition 
regarding the democratic process. It is ironic that the Bloc 
leader tries to pass himself off as a champion of democracy 
when his own troops and his separatist confederate threaten to 
boycott and retaliate against any group or institution daring to

social security because the present system is not working.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect, I believe that I must apologize to 
the Deputy Prime Minister, who told us yesterday that 
ministers' trips to Europe were worthwhile.
<P>
	In fact, this trip has brought out the truth, an admission of 
failure, since in this moment of sincerity, the minister admitted 
abroad that the government's job-creation program, the one in 
the red book, is not working and will be replaced.
<P>
	I would ask the minister to continue to own up and tell us 
whether her government intends to review its budget strategy, 
which involves reducing the deficit on the backs of the poor by 
taking food from their mouths, as the finance minister himself 
said, the very man who imposed an unprecedented cut in 
unemployment insurance benefits.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

in the truth, perhaps I can read exactly what the minister said, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The message is that it is time for a change and we must move toward a very 
strong approach to relieving structural unemployment. It is very much a part of 
our unemployment strategy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Obviously the reason for the social security reform is because 
there are too many unemployed people who have not found jobs 
for weeks, months and years. We have a structural problem and 
that is what we are going to try and solve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the Prime Minister should not send the 
Deputy Prime Minister to Europe; it seems that things are 
clearer in Europe when Canadian affairs are discussed.
<P>
	I would ask the Deputy Prime Minister if she admits that the 
substantial cut in unemployment insurance benefits penalizes 
even more heavily local communities in several regions of 
Quebec and Atlantic Canada, where a large proportion of 
seasonal workers face conditions that restrict their eligibility for 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, trips to Europe were 
mentioned. It seems to me that the hon. member, when he was in 
Europe a long time ago, was a federalist.
<P>
	While things are happening in Europe, it is also obvious that 
the reason the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
now adopting a new social policy is that workers in Matapédia, 
Matane, Lac-Saint-Jean and Roberval have not found work for 
years. That is why the system must be changed.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the last 
few days, the federal government demonstrated on numerous 
occasions that it was constantly improvising when negotiating 
with the Quebec government regarding the future of the military 
college in Saint-Jean. This is evidenced by the project proposed 
by the president of the Université de Sherbrooke, who is 
anxiously waiting for an agreement between the two 
governments.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs aware that each 
day that negotiations with the Quebec government are delayed 
jeopardizes the implementation of a project such as the one 
proposed by the president of the Université de Sherbrooke, since 
the teachers at CMR may make commitments to other 
institutions and no longer be available? Is the minister aware of 
that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the object of the ongoing negotiations with the 
government of Quebec is to adequately solve the issue of the 
military college in Saint-Jean. It is much more important to find 
the right solution and solve the problem for good than to make a 
hasty decision which might leave some issues unresolved.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the teachers at CMR can find jobs in 
Kingston and elsewhere, but there is no great need to hurry. The 
hon. member should not worry about imaginary problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, how must we 
interpret the minister's comments? He says that there is no great 
need to hurry, but his government is shutting down the military 
college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	After creating all kinds of problems for the region with the 
unjustified and unjustifiable closure of the college, does the 
minister not realize that people in Saint-Jean and in Quebec are 
tired of his apathy, his lack of initiative and his inability to 
propose any solution to that issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, getting carried away will not help solve the issue. The 
military college in Saint-Jean will remain open until the spring 
of 1995. Consequently, the important thing to do right now is to 
arrive at a solution which solves all the problems regarding the 
college, and which meets the needs of both the province of 
Quebec and the federal government. There is no doubt that the 
spending cuts which were made in the defence budget have 
served Canada well, since they allow us to put our budget back 
in order. This issue is of much greater scope than the problems 
related to the military college in Saint-Jean.

my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Canadian government has already approved a deal to sell 
helicopters to Columbia and is now considering the sale of 
coastal frigates to Taiwan. Concerning these sales the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs said last week that we have a process of 
reviewing our sales of arms abroad. We are doing it only under 
very specific conditions and every sale is reviewed carefully 
before being allowed.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister explain whether the 
guidelines used in reviewing these sales are the guidelines 
established and employed by the previous government or 
whether this is a new set of guidelines developed by the present 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
Absolutely no consideration is being given by the government to 
sales of Canadian patrol frigates to Taiwan right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that was an interesting reply but it had nothing to do with my 
question.
<P>
	Maybe I can repeat the question. We are simply asking if the 
guidelines that are being applied to these arms sales are the 
guidelines that were developed and used by the previous 
government of which many members were critical or are these 
new guidelines developed by the current government? If they 
are, could the parliamentary secretary tell us what they are.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that is a hypothetical question but I will answer 
part of it.
<P>
	The sale of military equipment to Taiwan is subject to 
standard export control procedures and policies. We consider 
any such sales on a case by case basis and consistent with our 
one China policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
further supplementary question.
<P>
	The sale to Columbia involves so-called civilian versions of 
the Bell model 212 helicopter. This civilian distinction avoids 
the necessity of gaining approval under federal defence export 
regulations. Concerns have arisen however because it is 
relatively easy to convert the model 212 into a military attack 
vehicle.
<P>
	In light of these facts can the parliamentary secretary please 
explain what the guiding philosophy of the government is 
regarding international sales of arms, especially to countries 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4989"> 4989 </A></B>

like Columbia whose military has a history of human rights 
violation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs I am pleased to notify the hon. member that 
these helicopters are certified as civil by Transport Canada. 
They are not certified as military helicopters.
<P>
	This was raised in our foreign affairs review policy by some 
witnesses. It came out that some of these helicopters will be 
used to fight the drug trade which is affecting our society in 
Canada. The hon. member also knows the country has just gone 
through an earthquake so these helicopters will come in handy 
for rescue and humanitarian relief.

<P>
	In 1987 the Conservative Minister of Finance, Michael 
Wilson, excluded his home town of Toronto from the list of

Liberals opposed this exclusion and the mayor of Toronto, now a 
Liberal cabinet minister, initiated a lawsuit against the federal

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

ask cabinet to change this decision, as provided under Section 
18(1) of the Broadcasting Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr.

question from the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	I read the papers, of course, including the article that attracted 
the attention of the hon. member. I said that I was waiting for the 
Quebec Minister of Culture and Communications to get in touch 
with me. Yesterday, I mentioned that I had asked for an analysis 
of the CRTC's decisions. Once I have heard from the minister 
and the analysis is ready, I will be able to make some decisions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question, please!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
supplementary. Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage think it 
is acceptable and fair for the CRTC to have granted eight 
licences out of ten, all to English-language channels, which 
means that once again, Francophones will have to pay for 
channels whose programming does not reflect their cultural 
interests?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I trust that I expressed myself clearly in French. I said 
that as soon as the minister is approached for his views on 
changing the CRTC's decision, the minister becomes a judge 
and it is therefore inappropriate for the minister who may have 
to act as a judge to give his views before hearing all sides of the 
case. That is where the matter stands now, and I hope I made 
myself sufficiently clear in my answers to previous questions

they are very concerned about the way this deal is put together

	I have no doubt that whatever decision is arrived at with 
respect to compensation for out of pocket expenses precluding 
any compensation for lobbyist fees or foregone profits, the 
Auditor General of Canada as well as Canadian taxpayers will 
want to scrutinize in a very careful way every penny if in fact

from programs from the ministry of heritage, which is under my 
jurisdiction, and I am not going to proceed with this request.
<P>
	The reason why I am not doing it is that, as I said in this 
House, I am profoundly against discrimination as a principle.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister is so profoundly disturbed by discriminatory practices 
as evidenced by this conference I find that funding it is a very 
strange way of addressing what he has just stated.
<P>
	Further to this, two departments in the ministry have been 
approached for funding but neither of those departments has 
made a decision at this point regarding its financial support.
<P>
	Expecting that the minister will do the right thing, will he also 
direct the organizations in his ministry not to fund the racist and 
discriminatory conference that will take place in Vancouver at 
the end of this month?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I conclude that as I am not funding from departmental 
resources I am doing the right thing.
<P>
	As I tried to explain, the Canada Council is an arm's length 
institution and the meaning of arm's length is precisely that the 
minister does not issue instructions concerning specific 
decisions taken by the board of directors.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, for

Canada are in force, despite a contrary opinion from the legal 
service of the Department of Transport.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Transport. As the one

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Canadians have been constantly demanding that the 
government abolish the current MP pension plan which allows 
members to collect benefits after only six years of service.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated that his government is 
reviewing this overly generous plan but that we have four or five 
years to deal with it.
<P>
	We do not need a commission to tell us what needs to be done. 
We have already suggested changes that can be implemented 
immediately.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister commit to bringing the MPs' 
retirement compensation package in line with the private 
sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the House has been previously informed, as hon. members 
know, that there was a study commissioned by the previous 
government that was brought to a committee of the House and is 
now under study by a committee of the House as provided for by 
the Parliament act with respect to compensation including 
pensions for members of Parliament.
<P>
	The government has made it clear that it intends to bring 
about revisions to the pension plan for MPs. As soon as the 
Lapointe commission submits its report, which I understand will 
be about mid-July, we will examine the results. We will look at 
the recommendations. We will then proceed to deal with the 
matter of MPs' pensions and other compensation factors.
<P>
	I have indicated previously to the House that we expect to deal 
with the matter of MPs' pensions prior to the end of the year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	Mid-July simply is not good enough. It has become public 
knowledge that the Leader of the Official Opposition, a man 
dedicated to the break-up of Canada, will become eligible for 
his pension on June 20.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister not agree that this alone 
constitutes a good enough reason to reform this extravagant MP 
pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
any member of this Parliament is to receive a pension, first of all

this commitment and are producers taking part in the process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

Winnipeg with 40 or 50 farm organizations from across the

shape of a national safety net system based upon the whole farm 
concept that was described in the red book at the time of the 
election.
<P>
	A national safety nets committee involving these 40 or 50 
farm organizations is now in place. They have been working 
hard through the spring and early summer. Producers are very 
much leading the process. Their work is augmented by and 
co-ordinated with the ongoing work of federal and provincial 
officials. Their work has also involved consultations with all 
members of the House who have on occasion expressed an 
interest in making representations about the safety net system.
<P>
	The objective is to have recommendations in place to present

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to inform 
members of the House of the government's plans to address 
several problems experienced during the current crop year in the 
transportation of western Canadian grain to market. These 
actions are intended to help clear up this year's difficulties. 
Even more important, they will help ensure that those 
difficulties are not repeated in the next or subsequent crop years.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	Members of the House will be aware that significant delays 
were experienced this year in getting western Canada's grain to 
market. The reasons for this were several. The flooding of the 
Mississippi River system forced United States' shippers to turn 
to other modes of transportation. This tied up rail cars in the 
United States that would normally have been available for lease 
to Canadian rail companies. The turnaround time on rail cars in 
the United States is longer than in Canada. A severe winter 
limited unloading at country elevators and slowed the 
movement through the system. A labour dispute on the west 
coast 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4995"> 4995 </A></B>
<P>
added to the congestion of ships waiting in harbour to take on 
Canadian grain.
<P>
	While I was on a trade mission to the Pacific rim earlier this 
spring, I was told in no uncertain terms by our customers that 
their purchases of grain and oilseeds from Canada were not 
being delivered on time and that this was disrupting their own 
operations. While Canada's reputation as a quality grain 
producer helped the country through this year's difficulties, our 
customers told me that unless we improved our delivery record 
they would begin to look elsewhere for more reliable suppliers.
<P>
	While I was in Asia the subcommittees of the agriculture and 
agri-food committee and the transport committee of this House 
were working in Ottawa to produce valuable recommendations 
to help alleviate several of the problems we were experiencing.
<P>
	As soon as I returned from the Pacific rim I called an urgent 
meeting of key players in the western grain transportation 
sector. The meeting was held in Winnipeg on May 16. There 
were representatives from the grain companies, the railroads, 
the Canadian Wheat Board, the Canadian Grain Commission, 
the Grain Transportation Agency, the unions, and the maritime 
employers. I presented them with a list of initiatives including 
many of the subcommittees' recommendations. I asked that 
group in Winnipeg for their input and advice.
<P>
	Shortly before that meeting was held, members of the Grain 
Workers Union and owners of the west coast grain terminals 
reached an agreement that allows for weekend unloading, thus 
reducing some of the bottleneck at the ports.
<P>
	From a backlog of 41 vessels waiting for grain on the west 
coast when our problems were at their height late in the winter 
and earlier this spring, we now have that number of waiting 
ships down to 15 as of this week. That is the number which is 
considered close to reasonable for the efficient use of the ports. 
The railways also will have increased their fleet this month to 
more than 30,000 grain cars, compared to 24,600 in 
mid-February.
<P>
	What is critical though is that we cannot afford a repeat of this 
past year. I want to congratulate the labour and industry 
representatives and the members of the two subcommittees of 
this House for their dedication to solving the myriad of 
problems that have plagued western grain transportation these 
past several months.
<P>
	Incorporating the work of those subcommittees, the industry 
leaders, the labour representatives and advice from Transport 
Canada, Human Resources Development and my own 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-food, I wish to announce 
the following measures with the support of my colleagues the 
Minister of Transport and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	First, the system of back hauling grain from Thunder Bay as 
far as Winnipeg just to qualify for subsidies under the Western 
Grain Transportation Act is going to end. This practice which 
has crept into our system in the last period of time is nothing 
more than a waste of our resources and an inefficient use of our 
rolling stock.
<P>
	Second, a system of demurrage and storage charges for rail 
cars will be developed. Currently there is no system of penalties 
or incentives in place to encourage shippers of grain to use and 
return rail cars to the general fleet expeditiously.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	These two changes require amendments to the Western Grain 
Transportation Act. We propose to make these changes with an 
implementation date of January 1, 1995. Thus those who may be 
entering into contracts now have notice that changes are to be 
expected.
<P>
	Third, if the railways do not deliver sufficient rolling stock in 
the future to accommodate grain shipments, the government 
will use provisions of the Western Grain Transportation Act that 
apply to sanctions and hold backs where necessary.
<P>
	Fourth, a policy will be developed to define the circumstances 
under which private cars could be added to the general grain 
fleet for western grain movement, if we are again faced with 
severe rail car shortages.
<P>
	Fifth, we will end the maximum elevation tariffs at the west 
coast and Thunder Bay to increase competition among elevator 
companies and to allow them to charge at sufficient levels to 
cover the increased costs of weekend loading at port.
<P>
	Finally, the forecasting of rail car requirements will be 
improved, as will be the co-ordination of inland loading and 
movement of rail cars with vessel arrivals at the ports.
<P>
	We will be working with the group of key leaders who met in 
Winnipeg on May 16 to make sure that these changes are in fact 
implemented as quickly as possible. We will be looking beyond 
that group as well for input on longer term measures to prepare 
our western grain transportation system for future challenges.
<P>
	In that spirit I have spoken today by teleconference with 34 of 
the senior leaders of relevant farm organizations, businesses and 
institutions who are the stakeholders in these processes for both 
the short term and the long haul.
<P>
	Through the changes we are beginning to make, we fully 
expect Canada will be able to restore its reputation as a reliable 
supplier of quality grain. Nothing less is acceptable.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
issue of western grain transportation is not a new one. The crisis 
that just occurred is the result of the apathy of the federal 
government which, for over 20 years now, has never done 
anything to solve this problem. Contrary to comments made by 
the Minister of Agriculture, the increase in American demand 
for grain was not the primary cause of the crisis in grain 
transportation in Canada. This factor merely helped show the 
lack of planning and flexibility of the grain transportation 
system in Canada. The problem is not a temporary one.
<P>
	This year, the Grain Transportation Agency will not be able to 
deliver more than 30 million tonnes of grain, compared to over 
35 million in the past. Major changes must be made to meet the 
needs of foreign importers as well as of Canadian and Quebec 
buyers. Indeed, it is disappointing to see that it will have been 
necessary for the Minister of Agriculture to go to Asia to realize 
how serious the problem of grain supply is, while right here 
several buyers have suffered major losses because of grain 
shortage or delays in delivery.
<P>
	Something must be done urgently. The estimated $35 million 
in demurrage charges in the West, as well as sales of 2 million 
tonnes of grain which were either lost or delayed, confirm the 
existence of a crisis. In fact, Canada's credibility and reliability 
as a major grain exporter are being questioned. I am pleased to 
see that the Minister of Agriculture intends to make changes in 
the grain transportation system. However, I would have 
preferred to hear him tomorrow, since he is meeting the 
Sub-Committee on Grain Transportation this evening.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	This would have helped, among other things, clarify some 
conservatively worded recommendations, and add other 
changes to those intended. The minister says that the system of 
back hauling grain shipped from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg, 
merely to be eligible for subsidies provided under the Western 
Grain Transportation Act, is going to disappear.
<P>
	I fully agree with this decision, which should have been made 
a long time ago. Having to take rail cars to Thunder Bay results 
in high costs, since the turn-around time for those cars is 
extended by several days. Each year, close to 2 million tonnes of 
grain use that itinerary.
<P>
	But what is really serious is the fact that, during the crisis, 
when there was a shortage of cars and when Canada was losing 
buyers, the National Transportation Agency did not even have 
the common sense of abolishing this obligation. This is a prime 
example of the system's lack of flexibility.
<P>
	And what about grain transiting through the Panama Canal on 
the way to Europe? I raise this issue because the problem goes 
far beyond the waste which results from the system of back 
hauling grain. The minister does not deal with the issue of the 
under-utilization of the Port of Thunder Bay and the St. 
Lawrence River. The  Sub-Committee on Grain Transportation 
recommended to the Minister of Transport to ask the Canadian 
Wheat Board to ship more American-bound grain through 
Thunder Bay.
<P>
	The same recommendation could be made regarding grain 
exports to Europe, through the St. Lawrence Seaway. Indeed, the 
under-utilization of the St. Lawrence Seaway has now reached a 
critical level. Since 1984, the Seaway has lost more than half of 
the volume of exported grain. Obviously, the Minister of 
Agriculture shows little concern for this issue; yet, this is a 
totally irrational utilization of our transportation network.
<P>
	Moreover, the minister gives no indication as to his intentions 
regarding the subsidy for Western grain transportation. I remind 
the minister that the Bloc Quebecois will oppose any transfer of 
the subsidy which might result in an unfair competition between 
farm producers.
<P>
	The minister must propose concrete measures to improve 
forecasts regarding the need for rail cars, and to co-ordinate 
domestic loading and the movement of rail cars with the arrival 
of ships. The minister must not merely make pious wishes. The 
problem is not a new one and we can no longer wait and risk to 
once again paralyse our supply system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to provide a brief response to the hon. 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food's statement on the grain 
transportation system of today.
<P>
	The minister explained for us in the House what in my 
judgment was not just a problem or series of problems this year 
but a real crisis in the grain transportation system. While some 
of the stakeholders in the transportation industry did not see it as 
a crisis, I believe most did; certainly farmers who could not get 
their grain moved.
<P>
	Granted, a unique set of problems did occur this year with the 
weather and farmers know a lot about weather problems. I 
believe we should be able to develop a system that can adjust to 
extreme weather problems. We must try to be prepared for 
eventualities of all kinds.
<P>
	The minister also clearly articulated the repercussions of the 
marketplace to our problems. Our reputation as a reliable grain 
provider was questioned by our customers. Essentially they 
issued an ultimatum to us: ``Improve your delivery record or we 
will be shopping somewhere else''. That is very serious.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4997"> 4997 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister then outlined some of the ways we have been 
trying to deal with this crisis, including referring the work of the 
subcommittee which had two days of emergency hearings and 
the May 16 meeting of concerned parties in Winnipeg.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	We on this side concurred with the report of the co-chairman 
of the subcommittee, believing that some good solutions were 
proposed. In all honesty I do question the impact or benefit of 
the May 16 meeting in Winnipeg when the subcommittee had 
just heard some of the same witnesses and when certain 
stakeholders, including farmers, were not at the meeting.
<P>
	Once again farmers are left out of the problem solving 
equation and yet they are the ones who bear the brunt and the 
cost of a crisis such as this. I would implore the minister to get 
farmers more directly involved in issues that directly affect 
them.
<P>
	I have said before and will say again that farmers can fix 
almost anything if they can get their hands on it.
<P>
	The minister noted developments which have helped alleviate 
the situation. A west coast labour settlement occurred, although 
it does not seem to be entirely satisfactory and in fact may only 
be temporary. The railways have also increased their fleets.
<P>
	One amazing thing that many of my colleagues who sat on the 
subcommittee were incredulous over is why the turnaround time 
for rail cars on a trip to the ports is not any faster than it was 
80 years ago. Surely there must be room for improvement there.
<P>
	The minister also stated for us today the lessons that we have 
hopefully learned from this crisis and announced a list of six 
steps that he and the Minister of Transport will implement by 
January 1, 1995. Generally we believe they are good and we 
believe we are on the right track. We would urge, however, that 
the entire system be overhauled so that there are commercial and 
financial incentives on the part of all to improve efficiencies and 
services. If each stakeholder in the entire system held up their 
end of the bargain and were rewarded for doing so and penalized 
for not doing so, the system could move toward more 
excellence.
<P>
	Farmers are held responsible for their actions, and so should 
everyone else in the system.
<P>
	What is also needed is legislation to prevent labour disputes 
from holding up product movement while still allowing for a 
collective bargaining processes. My colleague from Lethbridge 
and I are presently bringing forward legislation to address this.
<P>
	We on this side of the track are willing to work with those on 
the other side of the track to ensure that this crisis does not 
happen again, to revitalize our world-wide reputation and to 
help farmers get their grains and their goods to market.

	I am pleased to table today a bill whose purpose is to change 
the way the Auditor General of Canada is appointed. The Prime 
Minister now appoints the Auditor General without consulting 
the House, and I would like the act to contain a provision 
whereby, in the event of a vacancy, the House of Commons 
Committee on Public Accounts would consider the proposed 
candidates and submit to the House of Commons a report 
recommending the appointment of a competent person. In my 
opinion, after the House of Commons receives the report from 
the committee, it should be up to the Board of Internal Economy 
of the House of Commons to choose the next Auditor General of 
Canada.

is my pleasure to support the motion of the President of the 
Treasury Board that vote 1 in the amount of $26,952,000 under 
the heading Parliament-The Senate be concurred in.
<P>
	It would be appropriate for me, speaking on behalf of a 
government that is committed to fundamental institutional 
change and modernization designed to update our institutions 
for the economic and other problems at the end of the century 
and the beginning of the next, to comment on the role of the 
Senate as an institution in our governmental system. One of the 
first things to recognize is the antinomies presented by the 
Senate in its present operation.
<P>
	On the one hand, and I quote from the beautiful wood carvings 
in the office of the president of the Senate from the Roman saga 
<I>Seneca</I>: ``Nothing is well ordered that is hasty and precipitate'' 
which of course indicates attention to the conventional role that 
senators talk of themselves today, a House of sober second 
thought.
<P>
	It is balanced by the quote from the great Roman tribune 
Cicero which translated says: ``It is the duty of the nobles to 
oppose the fickleness of the multitudes''. Horace, who is a more 
popular poet, put it a little better when he said: ``Odi profanum 
volgus et arceo!''I hate the profane mob, I keep aloof from them.
<P>
	The Senate has always had this particular problem that you 
are exerting a power historically of correction and revision of a 
lower House that over the centuries had become increasingly 
more representative and fully democratized by the opening of 
the 20th century with the expansion of the franchise. Yet it is a 
House that over the centuries became increasingly more 
representative and fully democratized by the opening of the 20th 
century with the expansion of the franchise and yet the Senate 
has remained with a constitutional system that is wholly 
non-elective and that by the beginning of the 20th century had 
become anachronistic in historical terms. Indeed, the great 
House at Westminster, in light of which the Canadian 
Constitution Act in 1867 was framed and which members of this 
House refer to reverently and probably appropriately in that 
sense, abolished the powers of the House of Lords, the upper 
House, effectively in 1911.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The Parliament Act of 1911 reduced the powers of the House 
of Lords to a suspensive veto of two years. This was in 1911. It 
was a reform measure introduced by a dynamic Liberal premier, 
Mr. Asquith, and his lieutenant, Lloyd George. It was changed 
after World War II by the Attlee government through reduction 
of the suspensive veto to three months.
<P>
	There was a recognition that the principle of constitutional 
legitimacy which is one of the hallmarks of western and western 
derived constitutional democracy requires that large 
discretionary powers be based on an electoral mandate or some 
species of electoral confirmation.
<P>
	So there is the dilemma for the Senate today, one which we 
have lived with for a considerable number of years and for which 
we have not as yet made the steps taken by the House at 
Westminster, the model for the Canadian Parliament.
<P>
	I had the pleasure of addressing a seminar of eastern European 
parliamentarians who were here last week seeking advice from 
the Canadian Parliament, seeking to benefit from our 
experience. One of the Polish members of Parliament, a 
thoughtful gentleman who is also a professor of law at the 
University of Warsaw, said to me: ``You have unconstitutional 
constitutional provisions in your constitution''. It sounds like an 
oxymoron and yet it is there. He said: ``Look, I have read in the 
Constitution Act that to be a member of the Senate you have to 
have property worth $4,000''. He said: ``Is that democratic? It 
would not be constitutional in Poland''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5001"> 5001 </A></B>
<P>
	My friend, who is a senator and whom I respect was with me, 
explained that in 1867, $4,000 was a fortune. You could buy a 
carriage with four horses and various other things. Today 
perhaps it buys several cups of coffee or more. The comparison 
was perhaps a little bit far-fetched but nevertheless the point 
was made to our Polish colleague. He said: ``Nevertheless, it is 
not a healthy part of a constitutional charter to have this in. Why 
do you not get rid of it?'' Then we had to get into the intricacies 
of how you change the Constitution of Canada since the time of 
the Constitution Act of 1982, which put us in a constitutional 
straitjacket in relation to direct constitutional amendment but 
which would leave, nevertheless, possibilities of change by 
more pragmatic and ingenious methods.
<P>
	I would like to add something and I did this in conversation 
with a very thoughtful senator today. We were talking of 
unconstitutional constitutional norms which is a European 
concept really devised in the belief after World War II that there 
must be provisions on which you can challenge Nazi or 
communist constitutional provisions that are in denial of 
constitutional principles in the constitutional charter itself.
<P>
	One of the points I raised with him, because he was 
approaching retiring age, was: ``Do you think it is constitutional 
in Canadian terms to have mandatory retirement at the age of 
75?'' Of course the answer is that it is not. This would be another 
point to consider.
<P>
	I would raise the basic point whether a non-elected House 
today is constitutionally legitimate and therefore constitutional 
in the large sense. Obviously I am not suggesting that we rush 
out to the Supreme Court to obtain a declaratory judgment or 
advisory opinion on this point, although I do think that the most 
recent ruling in 1979 by the Supreme Court of Canada on reform 
touching the Senate was somewhat wide of the mark even then.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Today, granted changing public opinion controls so much in 
public law and the evolution of the public conscience which 
affects the content of constitutional norms, I would wonder 
whether that 1979 decision is not worth re-examining. 
Nevertheless in the context of the Senate today, and granted the 
difficulties of amending the Constitution by the front door 
methods the Trudeau patriation project introduced-we do have 
to face this issue-is the fact that we have a non-elected second 
chamber, part of the widespread public disaffection with 
constitutional institutions and processes today. I think the 
answer is yes.
<P>
	What can we and the Senate collectively do with this? By the 
way, one of the suggestions I have always considered is that the 
courts should be used more fully. Could a constitutional ruling 
be obtained and, following the example of litigants in 
far-reaching constitutional matters of this sort before the 
United States Supreme  Court, could one not ask the court to 
delay application of any ruling for enough time to allow a 
corrective constitutional amendment or other change to be 
made?
<P>
	Let me, however, return to the more practical and immediate 
issues that could control our approach to the Senate. The Senate 
can be changed without its own assent. This is one of the 
changes made by the Trudeau constitutional patriation act of 
1982, the Constitutional Act, 1982. Only a certain time delay is 
involved.
<P>
	There are areas in which change could be made without 
necessarily involving the provinces constitutionally and 
therefore touching the power of the federal Parliament alone, 
which then would require the Senate's assent or delay.
<P>
	I hasten to say that I advanced some of these propositions in 
evidence as an invited expert witness before the Senate and the 
House in previous years. I have said in other committees on 
which I saw one of my learned colleagues opposite, a pox on 
expert witnesses or self-styled expert witnesses. I have to say 
with all humility that when I have been summoned as an expert 
witness by the Goldenberg committee, an excellent committee 
of the Senate, and by the Molgat-MacGuigan committee and 
others I offered these suggestions with all modesty.
<P>
	One of the issues would be whether the Senate would not 
better assume a role, as the United States Senate has, in 
confirmation or review of executive power rather than in review 
of legislative power in which its lack of legitimacy through 
direct election limits it. The public appointing processes in the 
United States are subject to Senate confirmation, as to the 
Supreme Court, ambassadorial appointments and what we 
would here call crown corporations. This is an important and 
democratic role in the United States and one that ensures the 
better functioning of the public services.
<P>
	The Senate role in foreign affairs, the two-thirds Senate 
majority necessary to confirm a treaty made by the United 
States, gives a role for a body removed at once from the 
executive power making the treaties and from a house often 
subject to too much sectional pressure.
<P>
	These are the sorts of powers one proposed to the Goldenberg 
committee, to the Molgat-MacGuigan committee and to others 
under condition that the Senate be reformed and be elected.
<P>
	One further role would be the election of the head of state, the 
Governor General. There is a case to be made for this and for 
providing a further constitutional legitimacy for that office. 
Once again this is a condition precedent. A condition precedent 
would be electing the Senate or in some way legitimating it by 
some other process.
<P>
	In western Canada there is a strong body of opinion associated 
with a former Social Credit minister, Rafe Mair, known for 
broadcasting and other activities, that the Senate should be a 
states house, very much like the German Bundesrat. The 
Bundesrat is really a body for  federal-provincial co-operation 
in the practical administration and application of legislation. It 
is not really a second chamber in the North American or British 
sense. It is an interesting model.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5002"> 5002 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I raise these areas in which change in Senate powers, new 
powers, could be introduced and provide a worthwhile and 
valuable role, a necessary countervailing power granting 
conditions at the end of the century to an executive power that 
many feel has become presidential and therefore without the 
checks and balances however applied to presidential power in 
the United States and some other countries.
<P>
	How would we change the Senate? Granted there are the 
difficulties of amending it and expecting that we are not going to 
have a fundamental act of constituent power that usually occurs 
only after revolutions or great military victories in other 
countries. Certainly some changes could be made by 
convention, by custom.
<P>
	The Government of Alberta proceeded to elect somebody 
whom it designated as a candidate for appointment to the 
Senate. In one case the Prime Minister of Canada accepted that 
advice and appointed the person so elected. If that were 
followed it could create a general practice.
<P>
	More interestingly, the Mulroney government, after the 
failure of the Meech Lake accord, proceeded to name four 
Quebec senators following the procedures outlined in the Meech 
Lake accord of consultation with the provincial attorney general 
and premier. Some would say that those are better Quebec 
senators than the usual type of nomination; interesting persons 
in any case.
<P>
	In the meantime, though, the Senate itself can exercise 
self-restraint in its powers. Again to quote our Latin scholars, it 
probably would better to use the Fabian tactic of delay and 
conciliation without it trying directly to defeat measures.
<P>
	I say this in welcoming the role of the Senate, a discreet role 
in relation to Bill C-18. I am not speaking of the confrontation 
with the House which I think would be unacceptable according 
to my constitutional thinking, but of the quiet conversations by 
individual senators with members of the House that seem to 
have produced a felicitous accord between the two 
Houses-maybe I am being premature-as to whether and how 
Bill C-18 should be adopted in its revised form.
<P>
	This sort of process of interaction between two houses, a 
dialectical process, is very much in accord with the evolution of 
democratic constitutionalism. It produces a sensible and 
pragmatic approach to revising, updating and modernizing an 
institution that was honoured in its origins but has failed to keep 
pace with the changes in Canadian society, with the views on 
political representation and political constitutional legitimacy 
flowing from that and with the changes in other countries.
<P>
	I commend to members, in voting on this measure which has 
my full support, that we keep in mind an agenda for 
constitutional change involving the upper house; that we keep in 
mind that the constitution is not simply an issue of the place of 
one or more provinces in Confederation, renewed or otherwise, 
but that there are larger issues involving the relationship 
between the citizen and the state; that we keep in mind that there 
are better functioning and more modern institutions that 
correspond more exactly to the main trends in democratic 
constitutionalism. This sort of change would do much to restore 
public confidence in our parliamentary institutions and in the 
people who serve them.
<P>
	On this basis I am happy to support the motion as introduced.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to what was said by the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra, and I would appreciate his comments on the 
Legislative Council of what was then known as the Legislative 
Assembly in Quebec City. In 1967, Premier Daniel Johnson 
senior abolished the Legislative Council. Well, you know how 
these things work. There was the usual wheeling and dealing, 
and finally the councillors agreed to be voted out of existence.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to recall for the benefit of the hon. member 
and this is another point, that I used to live in one of seven 
so-called protected ridings in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Protected under the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Yes, under the Constitution. I 
lived in Wolfe, where there were about 6,000 voters at the time, 
compared with nearly 100,000 in Westmount. There were six or 
seven protected ridings, and to revoke their protected status 
required a unanimous resolution of the Quebec National 
Assembly. So the members for these ridings agreed to vote their 
ridings out of existence and themselves out of a job. Of course, a 
number of mutually acceptable arrangements were made.
<P>
	I think that is the price we have to pay, because after going 
back in time several hundred years during the very interesting 
overview the hon. member gave us earlier, when we get back to 
the situation today in 1994, and soon in 2000, well, the Senate- 
In any case, when I mention the Senate in Frontenac, people tend 
to laugh. I will not repeat everything they said, but they do not 
take the Senate very seriously.

	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question and I will make the following comment.
<P>
	I regret that it is almost impossible to change the Constitution 
directly with a law, as far as the Senate is concerned. If it is 
possible, we can consider it, but it will take the senators' 
consent.
<P>
	But without changing the role of Parliament, of the elected 
House, I do not think that we can simply abolish the Senate. 
Legislative committees absolutely must have an increased role 
and the House must have a much more sophisticated system than 
the Constitutional checks and balances than what we now have.
<P>
	As for Senate reform, in the 1980s, we considered the 
possibility of a sort of Constitutional counterweight, a body that 
would oversee executive decisions, confirm appointments, 
review treaties and international agreements, things like that. 
We are faced with this dilemma that it is almost impossible to 
abolish the Senate without its consent, except as far as details 
and particular powers of the Senate are concerned.
<P>
	I agree that we must work with the Senate and try to obtain 
their co-operation. If not, I am quite prepared to accept an 
increased role for legislative committees and even to consider 
the possibility of an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too listened closely and with a great deal of interest to 
the speech given by our colleague from Vancouver Quadra who 
is an expert in constitutional matters.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The Senate is, by definition, the chamber which represents the 
interests of the provinces. Now is not the time to debate how 
well it actually does this job, but the fact remains that this is one 
of its many duties, namely to counterbalance the representation 
by population in the House of Commons.
<P>
	In light of these considerations, does the hon. member not 
consider it highly unusual, as I do, that a party which claims to 
have provincial interests at heart all of a sudden attempts in this 
federal chamber to abolish a mechanism which belongs to the 
provinces, without even bothering to consult them, and what is 
more, attempts to do so by cutting this institution's budget? 
Does he not find this the least bit odd? I do. The member 
opposite claims that Canadians do not really care all that much 
about the Senate.
<P>
	If my colleague from Vancouver Quadra will recall the 
Charlottetown constitutional debate, he will remember that the 
Senate did indeed matter. Once the debate had begun, the people 
argued over whether their province should have one more 
senator, or one less. Would he not agree that the Senate seemed 
to matter then, that Canadians should at the very least be 
consulted before the Senate is abolished and that such a decision 
should not be made if that is not what the provinces or the 
Canadian people want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question. It is important to recognize the 
distinction made by the renowned Austro-Hungarian jurist by 
the name of Ehrlich between written law and the actual practice 
of law. I cannot consider the Senate as it is today as representing 
the provinces, unless major changes are made to its make-up. 
You cannot really say that the Senate represents the provinces.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, it is very important to change the 
representation system applied to the Senate so that it can play 
the role it was originally set up for, but which does not reflect the 
social reality in Canada any more. That is why I would be 
tempted to make these changes, even though I am not very 
optimistic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the member for Richmond-Wolfe and on behalf of my 
colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois and of all the people we 
represent in the House of Commons, I will speak to the notice I 
gave to this House objecting, on behalf of the Official 
Opposition, to the vote in the amount of $26,952,000 under the 
heading Parliament-The Senate.
<P>
	The Bloc has always spoken out against the existence of a 
Senate, and I would like to demonstrate that this institution is, in 
our opinion, as archaic as it is useless. This institution is nothing 
more than an excuse for the government to reward its friends, be 
they Liberal or Tory, who will then work-in true partisan 
fashion-for the government or for the interests they represent. 
Several of my colleagues will prove it in several ways during 
this debate.
<P>
	I listened to the speech made by the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra and I will go over the issues he dealt with. He 
will probably not like my arguments. I note at the outset that the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra must be feeling lonely 
because, first of all, he looked at the issue of maintaining the 
votes through the objective of revamping and improving the 
Senate. He must be feeling lonely because, first, his own leader 
does not want to address in any way the constitutional issue and, 
second, the Senate itself would have to scuttle its own ship.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5004"> 5004 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I would like to remind you that the current distribution of the 
104 Senate seats is provided for in Section 22 of the 1867 
Constitution Act. As Canada is divided into four regions, these 
regions must be equally represented. Ontario and Quebec get 
24 senators each; New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, six each; 
Prince Edward Island, four; the four Western provinces, six each 
for a total of 24; in 1948, Newfoundland got six; finally, the two 
territories have one each.
<P>
	Senators are appointed by the Governor General who, 
according to tradition, acts on the initiative and advice of the 
Prime Minister. Everyone recognizes that they are in fact 
appointed by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Since senators are not elected, and the hon. member directly 
alluded to that fact, the Bloc Quebecois feels that the other place 
is an anachronism, as the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra 
put it so well, given the modern criteria which underly the 
political management of a State.
<P>
	So, on behalf of my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois, I 
denounce this unacceptable waste in the form of a credit of 
$26.9 million, plus statutory expenditures of some $15.7 
million, for a total budget of $42.6 million, not including the 
services provided. This is an unacceptable expenditure for an 
archaic political institution which plays a useless role for 
Quebecers and Canadians at large.
<P>
	Let me remind you of the origin of senates in the various 
political systems, and of the objectives of the Canadian Senate 
when it was created. This will give you a better idea of how that 
institution is a miserable failure in the Canadian political 
system.
<P>
	Let us take a look at history. In ancient Greece, more than 
500 years before Christ, the legislators formed a council of the 
500, whose role was to control the possible excesses of 
democracy. The very ancient societies had the wisdom to create 
a political body to monitor decisions concerning society as a 
whole. The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra alluded to this 
earlier. On one of the walls of the Canadian Senate, there is a 
maxim by Cicero, who was a thinker in Ancient Rome, to the 
effect that it is the duty of the noble to oppose the instability of 
the people. How pretentious!
<P>
	From time immemorial, when democracy was still in its 
infancy, people sought to give an aura of wisdom to the Senate, 
in order to legitimize this institution, whose mission is 
fundamentally a conservative one for society.
<P>
	The Senate is like the British House of Lords; it is a House for 
very important people. True to the British tradition, the accent is 
on sharing legislative power among the two Houses, which 
represent two different social classes, that is the people and the 
nobility.
<P>
	The first objective of the Senate, like its British model, is to 
review and think, thus monitoring the House of Commons. This 
is very close to the perception that prevailed in antiquity. Senate 
members are supposed to counterbalance the executive side of 
Parliament. Moreover, the Fathers of Confederation also wanted 
to follow the American model and created a Canadian Senate 
similar to a federal Chamber whose objective was to protect the 
rights of the regions and provinces, and to ensure its 
participation in the legislative process of the Federation.
<P>
	The founders of the Canadian Upper House took their 
inspiration both from the British House of Lords and the 
American Senate, two models that were clearly incompatible 
and light years away from any historical affinity. The House of 
Lords, anchored in the medieval myth of the monarchy, and the 
Senate, with its modern North American dynamics firmly 
anchored in the twentieth century. This was a highly unsuitable 
marriage between a modern American Senate and a medieval 
British system.
<P>
	We must not forget that the criteria for representation from 
Quebec and Ontario, at the time the Canadian Constitution was 
drafted, were included at the behest of Lower Canada-in other 
words, Quebec-in exchange for agreeing with the principle of 
proportional representation in the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In the minds of the founding fathers, the Senate was intended 
to provide equitable representation for the regions. However, it 
was never intended as a house of the regions. Today, there is no 
reason why the House of Commons should appropriate funds to 
a political institution that is ineffective and totally useless.
<P>
	Considering the state of the economy, with a debt of over 
$550 billion and unemployment and poverty in Quebec and 
Canada, the total budget of $42.6 million allocated to this 
institution would be better spent on economic recovery and job 
creation.
<P>
	To continue this discourse on the failure of successive federal 
governments to provide for responsible management of public 
funds, as they sank millions into an institution that is utterly 
useless, I would like to give two examples of a functional 
Senate; the U.S. Senate and the German Bundesrat referred to by 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	Unlike the Canadian Senate, the American model-the first 
federal model on this continent-is unique in its simplicity. In 
the House of Representatives, representation is based on 
numbers, while in the Senate, it is based on absolute equality 
among the States.
<P>
	A description of the duties of U.S. senators demonstrates how 
ineffective and useless members of the Canadian Upper House 
really are. Here is why American senators have specific 
legislative duties that are essential to the proper functioning of 
the American presidential system. Thus, in conjunction with the 
House of  Representatives, they pass bills previously approved 
by the President. If no compromise can be reached, the bill is not 
passed. They also have executive functions whose importance is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5005"> 5005 </A></B>
<P>
still growing, such as the approval of appointments made by the 
President, appointments of judges, ministers and ambassadors 
which are often subjected to rigorous inquiries by the U.S. 
Senate.
<P>
	Ratification of international treaties is another major 
executive power held by the Senate within the American system. 
The American presidential system is efficient in that, among 
other things, the Senate produces prestigious members well 
known for their legislative skills, and let me remind you that 
they are elected by the people, which is not the case in Canada. 
They are elected by the people.
<P>
	The U.S. Senate alone has attracted the most talented minds of 
the nation and constitutes an intellectual centre of indisputable 
superiority compared with the legislative dynamics of the 
Canadian Senate.
<P>
	The United States Senate has really brought to the fore, 
through a real and constant practice of politics, the spirit of 
wisdom and reason which inspired people from antiquity when 
they set up the early senates.
<P>
	Let us talk about the Bundesrat. As for the German Bundesrat, 
or Federal Council, it is another Senate-like democratic 
institution, but contrary to the Canadian Senate, it works. The 
Bundesrat, which was created by the Constitution of the German 
Empire in 1871, was a major legislative body of the Empire. It 
was originally an assembly of ambassadors from member states. 
It is the ancestor of the second German House, the Assembly of 
the Landers' Executive members or, if you prefer, of the 
federated provinces representing the various territories, either 
provinces or regions.
<P>
	Simply to explain how the Bundesrat works, it is formed by 
45 members of the government of Landers and each Land is 
allowed at least three votes. To illustrate the process, when a bill 
is introduced, for instance, it must be submitted to the approval 
of the Bundesrat, the equivalent to our Senate, which has a veto 
it can use within one week, provided there is a majority of two 
thirds of the votes. The head of the government of a Land 
automatically becomes a member of the Bundesrat. The central 
government designates as many ministers as the number of 
votes the Lands are entitled to.
<P>
	I should add that the approval of the Bundesrat is required 
when an issue deals with administrative or financial interests of 
the Landers, the equivalent of the provinces and regions in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	In Germany, federalism finds its true meaning. Eleven 
Landers are directly represented by the members of each Land's 
government. Therefore, Canadian federalists cannot decently 
talk in Quebec or elsewhere of the merits of a viable federalism 
that does not even respect its own components. Federalism has 
never existed in Canada. There is a central government that tried 
by all means to  grab as much power as possible at the expense of 
provinces and regions. The Canadian Senate plays no significant 
role in the defence of regions and minorities, one of the reasons 
why it was created, which leaves the Executive of the House of 
Commons a maximum of powers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> We must admit it is not 
easy to deal with two legislative houses in a British type of 
parliamentary system. Parliamentary systems, clearly 
dominated by the executive, give their Upper House very 
limited if not meaningless powers. Given that such is the system 
in Canada, the Senate is reduced to an anachronism since it has 
no weight in the country's political balance and lacks legitimacy 
because its members are not elected but simply appointed by the 
Prime Minister. Since the executive is accountable only to the 
House of Commons, the Senate loses any influence it might have 
over the government. The parliamentary system requires that 
the Lower House have greater powers than the Upper House 
because the government comes from the former and is elected 
and, therefore, is accountable only to it.
<P>
	That problem does not exist within a presidential system like 
the one in the United States since the executive is politically 
accountable neither to the House of Representatives nor to the 
Senate. The separation of powers is more strictly established in 
a presidential system than in a parliamentary system like ours 
where the Senate is useless.
<P>
	In the third part of this demonstration, I would like to touch on 
the question of administrative responsibilities associated with 
the allocation of $26.9 million for the operation of an Upper 
House within the Canadian parliamentary system and, with your 
permission, I will explain how the Canadian Senate is unable to 
accomplish various tasks which, in theory, are part of its 
obligations.
<P>
	For example, it is difficult to justify the existence of an Upper 
House based on the principle of legislative review. The idea that 
the Canadian Senate could reflect soberly on the legislative 
measures of the House of Commons flows from the conservative 
prejudices that existed earlier under the monarchy. The 
Canadian Senate is a remnant of a traditional and elitist 
representation opposed, in a way, to the monopolistic 
embodiment of a democratic legitimacy already more than 200 
years old in the western world. The Canadian Upper House, the 
Senate, accepts its secondary role by undertaking activities that 
have nothing to do with its legislative role. In fact, senators are 
named by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5006"> 5006 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister to play a partisan role, red or blue, or to 
represent pressure groups. What they do is lobby.
<P>
	Here is the truth: Over the last 50 years, the Senate used its 
veto power only to delay, as was pointed out by my friend, the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. Between 1943 and 1964, 
only two bills were rejected by the Senate and since 1964, only 
one, and under circumstances which were not really significant, 
considering that on the rejected bill, C-43 about abortion, MPs 
and senators were free to vote according to their conscience. 
Before the Constitution Act of 1982, the Senate always bowed to 
the desires of the government and the Commons. It did not 
exercise its veto power because it was continuously controlled 
by the party in power.
<P>
	When the Canadian Senate was created, the idea was to enable 
the senators to distance themselves from the partisan positions 
taken by the members of the House of Commons. The idea was 
to have a House of sober second thought which would be above 
the bursts of passion of the people.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	In Canada, the Fathers of Confederation were in favour of 
nominating senators to preserve the independence of the 
members of the Upper House. One could have expected that 
senators, who hold office until they turn 75-quite the job 
security at a time when unemployment rate is so high, both in 
Canada and Quebec-and are not subject to the whims of the 
people, would have shown their independence towards the party 
in office.
<P>
	On the contrary, the Upper House members have been 
staunchly partisan, with little regard for their role as impartial 
law-makers. It needs to be stated again, senators are appointed 
on a strictly partisan basis.
<P>
	For the Bloc Quebecois, which is concerned not only with 
Quebec's interests, but also with the democratic values dear to 
all Canadians, the contradiction between the myth of a House of 
sober second thought and the reality of a partisan Canadian 
Senate, is reason enough to oppose any kind of subsidy for this 
useless institution and to advocate its abolition.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> What a waste!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> The principle of equal 
regional representation has become increasingly more tenuous 
as the regions have evolved, as the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell mentioned in his question. I 
submit that the original regional distribution, which dates back 
to the negotiations surrounding the 1867 Constitution Act, is no 
longer representative of today's population nor of present 
regional borders. Fortunately, provincial assemblies quickly 
took over the Senate's role regarding representation of regional 
interests.
<P>
	Finally, we must mention the dismal failure of the Canadian 
Senate as the protector of minorities. One of the Upper House's 
important roles, which is enshrined in this country's 
Constitution, is not only provincial or regional representation, 
but also the representation and protection of interests less well 
protected by the House of Commons.
<P>
	Since linguistic duality, the notion of two founding nations, is 
a fundamental characteristic of Canada, such duality should 
normally be manifested in the Senate and be a fundamental 
element of its make-up. I am referring here to the 
double-majority mechanism, which ensures a more adequate 
protection for French-speaking minorities outside Quebec.
<P>
	But, never ever has the Upper House stood up for these 
minorities' interests, and this is a proven fact. Take, for 
example, the problems encountered by all French-speaking 
communities in Canada, and that was evidenced again today. 
The Senate's action in all its spheres of activity fails miserably.
<P>
	In fact, Canada's Upper House has a very clearly defined 
mandate, which is to represent partisan interests, Tories or Grits. 
A majority of the senators appointed by the Prime Minister have 
some political experience, in fact approximately half of them, 
and the others usually have rendered well-recognized services 
to the party in power. The Senate does allow a golden retirement 
for politicians and others who are long-time supporters of 
Liberal and Conservative members and who have always been 
close to the corridors of power in Canada.
<P>
	From 1925 to 1963, the average age of senators was 69. In 
1975, it was 64 years. A seat in the Senate is a true reward at 
carreer's end, since one does not have to fight anymore to keep 
one's seat until the age of 75. For the government, it is both a 
reward and a way to control its institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with some of the hon. member's comments but 
certainly not with all of them. First, the hon. member claims to 
be the champion of regions in Canada. He said a few moments 
ago that his party and himself are protecting the interests-these 
are his exact words-the interests of Quebec and those of the 
other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Should he be reminded that the premier of Alberta, for 
example, wants the Senate not only to be maintained but to be 
even more powerful? How can the hon. member suggest 
abolishing an institution which some premiers want not only to 
keep but to strengthen?
<P>
	Second, as for the French-speaking senators from outside 
Quebec, well, the hon. member does not seem to be very well 
informed. At this very moment, Senator Eymard Corbin is on the 
official languages committee, defending the interests of 
francophones outside Quebec. It is not the first time that Senator 
Corbin has defended the interests of French-speaking minori-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5007"> 5007 </A></B>
<P>
ties. Furthermore,  he is a former chairman of the Assemblée 
internationale des parlementaires de langue française and he 
played many other roles.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite may not have been here for long, 
but he should take a little look at the background of our 
French-speaking parliamentarians from outside Quebec. The 
late Senator Bélisle was Mayor of Sudbury and a minister in the 
Ontario Legislature before being called to the Senate. Did the 
hon. member forget the history of Senator Bélisle, one of the two 
francophones outside Quebec to have been in municipal, 
provincial and federal government? The other one is me.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> At the same time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No. Not at the same time.
<P>
	Third, he said that the senators were almost all appointed to 
their position as a political reward. Does he forget the work done 
by Senator Beaudoin, a constitutional expert who was not 
appointed to represent my party or his own? Senator Beaudoin 
speaks in defence of francophone minorities.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member opposite should apologize to those 
three parliamentarians I just mentioned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell will certainly not 
succeed in making me cry.
<P>
	In response to a comment that the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell made earlier, the hon. member 
for Vancouver Quadra told him that provincial representation in 
the Senate simply does not exist. So, you can just forget about 
regional representation.
<P>
	Second, I will tell my colleague that his party is in a catch-22 
situation. The Liberals are defending the allocation of funds to a 
Senate which, according to the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra, must be reformed and improved. My colleague does not 
realize that, to do so, we have to amend the Constitution, and it 
so happens that his own leader has said clearly that amendments 
to the Constitution were absolutely out of the question. Do these 
people talk to each other sometimes? It seems that they do not 
talk to each other at all.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not hear what his leader says here in 
the House? Each time he is asked a question about constitutional 
matters, the Prime Minister says that he does not want to talk 
about the Constitution. Yet, the argument invoked by the hon. 
member to defend the allocation of funds to the Senate is that we 
must improve the Senate, change the name of the game, and so 
on. Such comments cannot be serious.
<P>
	We know full well that the Senate has no power. Senators are 
appointed by the Prime Minister and they have a particular job 
to do, a job that is partisan in nature. Everybody knows that. The 
Senate costs a fortune to administer, more than $42 million to be 
exact, and yet, as mentioned by the Auditor General in his last 
report, it sits only a little over 40 days a year, with absenteeism 
running at between 20 and 25 per cent. It is  ridiculous to invest 
millions of dollars in such a useless institution when there are so 
many unemployed and so many people on welfare in Quebec and 
across Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question to the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	He has pointed out the constitutional contradictions in our era 
of transition. He has quoted two models, but they are completely 
divergent. The American model is not a House of sober second 
thought, like the one in Westminster. He admitted that. It 
operates equally as a House of sober second thought and as a 
body working as a constitutional check and balance vis-à-vis 
the executive power. In comparison, the German Bundesrat is 
certainly not a House of sober second thought. It is essentially 
an intergovernmental committee of high-ranking officials.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Is he then advocating one or the other as a model, for example, 
for a revision of the Canadian constitution?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Vancouver Quadra for his question. We have frequent 
discussions in committee. I know that he is very learned and that 
he has great concern for democracy and parliamentary 
institutions.
<P>
	The hon. member noticed that I made reference to two 
different systems in my remarks. I meant to compare our 
Canadian Senate, which is completely ineffective, with two 
different models that do work, each in its own way. They get 
things done, they wield some power, and play specific roles. My 
colleague had mentioned a few models, and I just added a few 
more.
<P>
	Our fundamental goal is always to increase the powers and the 
role of members in this House so that they can really begin to 
carry out their duties as soon as they are elected and do so 
completely.
<P>
	I do not advocate any model for the Senate. What we are 
doing, Mr. Speaker, is examining an ineffective institution, and 
pointing out that this government does not want to change the 
rules because it refuses to reopen the Constitution. It does not 
want to hear a single word about the Constitution, even though 
some of its members would like to bring about improvements 
and propose amendments.
<P>
	I do not advocate any specific model. All I said is that the 
Senate just does not work, and that it does not need that much 
money.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in response to the Bloc 
motion. I am happy to stand before the House and say that I and 
the Reform Party certainly oppose the Bloc motion. We believe 
the intent of this motion obviously is to eliminate spending on 
the Senate and thereby achieve the de facto abolishment of it. 
The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5008"> 5008 </A></B>
<P>
Reform Party is and always has been an advocate of a reformed 
Senate, certainly not of its abolishment.
<P>
	In large countries where the population is unevenly 
distributed there is a fundamental need to balance 
representation by population with representation by province. 
This is especially true in a parliamentary system like Canada's 
where regimented party caucuses engage in bloc voting under 
the direction of party leadership. In other big federations like 
the United States and Australia this balance has been achieved 
by establishing two levels of government and a bicameral 
legislature in which the provinces are effectively represented in 
the upper House and representation by population prevails in the 
lower House.
<P>
	The Fathers of Confederation intended to provide this type of 
balance in the Canadian Parliament, but the Senate as currently 
constituted has failed to play this role and it simply needs to be 
reformed.
<P>
	First, the Senate must be popularly elected. In a democratic 
age an appointed upper House will always lack legitimacy and 
hence political power. It is time to take democracy seriously.
<P>
	Second, the Senate must be equal, in the sense that each 
province must have the same number of seats, such as in the 
Australian and United States models. In such a Senate the thinly 
populated areas, provinces of Canada, would have a majority of 
seats in the Senate, just as the heavily populated provinces hold 
the majority of seats in this House of Commons.
<P>
	Reformers will not be misled into supporting a counterfeit 
regional version of equality according to which the west, 
Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada will each have the same 
number of senators. This is approximately what Canada has now 
and it simply does not work.
<P>
	Third, the Senate must be effective. It must have adequate 
power to balance the House of Commons. There is some room 
for fine tuning here. Reformers do not believe that the defeat of a 
government bill in the Senate should lead to the defeat of the 
government. However, the Senate must not be shorn of power so 
that it becomes unable to amend or veto regionally offensive 
legislation emanating from the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Reformers believe that only a triple-E Senate, elected, equal, 
and effective, can balance the interests of less populous 
provinces with those of the more populous provinces in this 
Canadian Parliament.
<P>
	When I talk about regional fairness I like to relate it to some 
of the things I have been involved with, one of which is my work 
on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food. 
Certainly we live in a country with diverse interests and diverse 
problems and certainly agriculture is no exception to that.
<P>
	Recently Reformers proposed at the committee level a 5 per 
cent reduction in the overhead costs of the Department of 
Agriculture. The reason we proposed this was that we believed 
there was a need for cuts in the department other than those 
which would come on the backs of farmers or the people who 
work in that area. I relate this to the regional fairness issue 
because with the diverse differences in this country only 
regional fairness and equality in an elected Senate would 
compensate for those differences.
<P>
	The Reform Party made the first step toward a triple-E Senate 
when it pressured the Government of Alberta into holding 
properly constituted Senate elections in 1988. Most recently the 
Reform Party asked the Alberta government to pass a resolution 
which would request the current appointed senators in Alberta to 
resign so that sanctioned elections could be held in conjunction 
with the next Alberta provincial election. The Reform Party 
would herald the accomplishment of Senate election for all 
senators, both inside Alberta and throughout Canada as a 
significant leap toward the goal of a triple-E Senate.
<P>
	There have been many reasons, many arguments, many 
pressures by politicians and people of all stripes for the 
abolition of the Senate. The Reform Party favours and has been 
advocating for many years now the abolition of those features of 
the Canadian Senate which render it useless and repugnant to 
voters and taxpayers, namely: Abolish the patronage 
appointments to the Senate. Elect all senators. Abolish 
exorbitant perks, pensions and privileges. Establish an 
independent commission to recommend a pay and pension 
package for senators and members of Parliament comparable to 
what is available in the private sector. Abolish inequitable 
representation in the Senate. Elect equal numbers of senators 
from each province.
<P>
	If the Senate is abolished completely, Canada will 
immediately be governed by a one House Parliament in which 
the heavily populated centres would have an absolute majority 
of seats. In such a Parliament it would be virtually impossible to 
secure effective representation of the interests of the thinly 
populated parts of the country, namely the west, the north, 
Atlantic Canada, northern and rural Ontario, and northern and 
rural Quebec.
<P>
	The members of the current House of Commons who are 
suddenly advocating Senate abolition have no interest in 
establishing any checks and balances on themselves, in 
particular the regional checks and balances which a reformed 
Senate would provide. They are simply seeking to consolidate 
power in their own hands.
<P>
	If the Senate is completely abolished it is also highly unlikely 
it would be replaced in the foreseeable future. The premiers who 
are most loudly advocating Senate abolition simply want to 
maintain their own monopoly on representing their provincial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5009"> 5009 </A></B>
<P>
interests rather than sharing their responsibility with a reformed 
Senate.
<P>
	If the Senate is simply abolished therefore there is very little 
likelihood a reformed Senate would ever be established. The 
Canadian federal system would fail to balance representation by 
population with representation by province, an essential 
characteristic for any federal system, particularly in a large 
country with an unevenly distributed population.
<P>
	It is therefore the position of the Reform Party that the useless 
and offensive features of the current Senate should be and must 
be abolished and that an elected, equal and effective Senate 
created in its place.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	In the short term, representatives of an elected body would be 
more responsive to the desires of the provinces of Canada and it 
would not require a constitutional fight to accomplish the 
changes we are suggesting.
<P>
	In the longer term, Canadians should continue to demand an 
effective regional federal body to ensure that all Canadians are 
adequately represented in the Canadian Parliament. The long 
range interest of Canadian federalism, Senate reform, must be 
put ahead of the short term expediency of Senate abolition.
<P>
	As has been mentioned by many members today, we talk a lot 
about drastic changes in the way this place and the entire federal 
system operate. Certainly we have been talking about fiscal 
responsibility, getting government spending under control and 
cutting government spending.
<P>
	There are two ways to look at this. One is to cut federal 
spending; the other way is to prioritize federal spending. We 
want to take the approach of prioritizing federal spending and 
we talk about that in many areas and in many programs. 
Certainly the Senate must be one of them. We must prioritize our 
spending. If an elected, effective and equal Senate is a priority 
as we believe it is, then we must use those funds in our Senate 
and make cuts where there is excess in programs or 
non-productive programs.
<P>
	I look forward to questions and comments from hon. 
members. I appreciate very much having had this opportunity to 
speak on this subject.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us say 
that, for only a few minutes, I agree with my colleague and that I 
support the Senate. It is only for a few minutes, because I do not 
really agree with him, but it is a figure of speech. I would like to 
ask my colleague, since the Senate is so important, if he can say 
who is the senator representing his region.
<P>
	I would also like to ask him, in the case of an elected Senate 
such as the one proposed by his party, the triple-E Senate, which 
House would make the final decision on passing bills? Would it 
be the elected House of Commons or the elected Senate? Let us 
take, for example, a bill on the right to abortion.
<P>
	My last question is: does he believe that having bills passed 
by only one House in his province is wrong or harmful?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the member's first 
question about who would make the final decision on a bill, it 
really is a very simple process, almost too simple to believe it 
could work. Many times in the past ordinary rank and file 
Canadians have had ideas that seem too simple to work, yet they 
do.
<P>
	When talking about where the final responsibility would be 
for a bill, what would happen under a triple-E Senate would be 
as is the normal process in the House. We would vote on and pass 
a bill, send it to the other place and the Senate would then have 
the opportunity to either accept or defeat it and send it back.
<P>
	The other part of the solution is that the defeat of a 
government motion or bill would not necessarily bring down the 
government. That is the safeguard in sending a bill back from 
Senate which was not passed in the Senate. The bill would come 
back to this House, we would deal with it again, make it better 
and make it acceptable to the Senate. The process would work 
very well.
<P>
	As far as the second part of the member's question about one 
House by itself in a province, I assume he means Saskatchewan. 
Certainly on a provincial level it is an entirely different issue, or 
at least it is in my province which is thinly populated, with fewer 
than a million people. There is no need for an upper and lower 
house in that type of process. Certainly in a Canadian-wide 
process where there are 10 provinces, much diversity and many 
different areas, there is certainly a need for an effective Senate.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with enthusiasm to the member opposite with 
regard to his presentation. However, I find that having been here 
the same length of time that he has we must be attending 
different meetings of this House.
<P>
	As I remember we have had some free votes. I think the 
member opposite was likely here when we voted on Bosnia. We 
have had other discussions that are going to lend to free votes. 
Yet there seems to be the impression that the 35th Parliament is 
not going to provide that mechanism.
<P>
	I would like to know from the member opposite if he was in 
attendance. Has he seen that happen? Is he aware of the fact that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5010"> 5010 </A></B>
<P>
yes we have changed in this House? I feel the operation of the 
other place is likely going to change as well.
<P>
	I would like to know from him what his feelings are with 
regard to this whole implementation of the 35th Parliament and 
the voting procedure and free votes that will come forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and his questions. I think they are valid comments. 
Certainly there has been significant change in this House. I 
believe there could in fact be significant change in the other 
place.
<P>
	I have to agree however with some of my colleagues from the 
opposition party when they talk about a policy and the Senate. I 
believe and we believe that we have to abolish some aspects of 
the Senate such as the appointments, the perks, the pay and 
pensions and those types of things.
<P>
	Yes I was in attendance for the free vote the member speaks 
of. I congratulate the government for those types of initiatives. I 
think that is long overdue in this country. I do applaud that.
<P>
	I look forward to more of those same types of things. If we 
openly look at the Senate, how it is created, what the process is 
and how it works I really do not see any other answer other than 
to make the thing effective. That is the only hope I see for thinly 
populate areas of this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party member who just spoke about the Senate 
expressed very interesting views. His determination to stand up 
for the regions was one aspect of his speech that I found 
particularly striking.
<P>
	I have here the list of Quebec senators with their mailing 
address. At the moment, Quebec is lucky enough to have 
21 senators. Being myself a representative of a large riding far 
from the big urban centres, I insist on the rights of regions. If 
really the Senate is that important, our 
regions-Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the North Shore, the Gaspe 
Peninsula-should also have a senator to represent them 
adequately. According to this list, of these 21 senators, 13 are 
from the Montreal area. There is one whose address is 
Laval-sur-le-Lac. I wonder if he would not also be from the 
Montreal area.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is in the Montreal area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> I am told it is in the Montreal 
area. In Quebec, 14 senators represent the Montreal region. Is 
this a good regional representation?
<P>
	Could the member tell us if, in his home province, regions are 
well represented in the Senate? I can tell him that in Quebec, I 
seriously question the value of the Senate as champion of the 
regions. I think it is not very effective, on that score.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really do appreciate this question 
and comment from the hon. member. In fact he makes my case 
exactly. I would rest my case saying that has been the problem 
with the Senate. There is very unequal representation.
<P>
	Fortunately for the member there are 21 senators from 
Quebec. We do not have that luxury in Saskatchewan simply 
because we are a thinly populated area.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Having said that, I also believe that an equal number of 
senators for each province will rectify that problem. Certainly 
the member will know that if there were to be two to four 
senators from his province that he should have equal or good 
representation, the same number as Ontario, Saskatchewan or 
any other province would have.
<P>
	I understand the problem with the regional unfairness and the 
regional representation that is currently not happening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to advise the House that as of 
now, the official opposition will be splitting its time into 
ten-minute, rather than twenty-minute periods.
<P>
	I would like to begin my presentation by recounting an 
anecdote which, to my mind, clearly reflects Quebecers' 
feelings about the Senate, because it is a fact that virtually the 
entire population favours and indeed has long been advocating 
the abolition of the Senate.
<P>
	This anecdote involves the one-time Quebec legislative 
council which my colleague from Frontenac referred to 
moments ago and which was abolished in the late 1960s. 
However, while the council still existed, more specifically 
during the 1950s, Maurice Duplessis who was then premier 
appointed Mr. Patrice Tardif, a member of the legislative 
council, to the Senate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> From 
Saint-Méthode-de-Frontenac.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Tardif, who represented the riding of Frontenac at the time in the 
National Assembly, or as it was known, the legislative assembly, 
had a rather unusual way of talking in that he pronounced the 
letter s like a z. One day, several months after his appointment, 
he encountered Premier Duplessis in the halls of the Quebec 
parliament.
<P>
	Mr. Tardif asked the Premier what the people were saying 
about his appointment. The Premier answered in French ``Ils ne 
dizent rien, Pâtrice, ils rizent.''
<P>
	This answer speaks volume about the way Quebecers felt at 
the time about the Upper House. I think we can safely say that in 
1994, their opinion has not changed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5011"> 5011 </A></B>
<P>
	On a more serious note, I would like to use my few remaining 
minutes to speak about the effectiveness of the Senate, 
commonly referred to as the Upper House. When our colleagues 
in the Reform Party talk about the importance of a Triple E 
Senate, I would simply say to them, with all due respect, that to 
my mind, we already have a Triple E Senate, a Senate with zero 
effectiveness, zero efficiency and zero elected members.
<P>
	In fact, we could even qualify the current Senate not as a 
Triple E Senate, but instead as a Triple I Senate, the I standing 
for ineffective, inefficient and inane. You may tell me, Mr. 
Speaker, that I am the only one who thinks this way.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	You may think that the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead is too harsh on the Senate. For 
the benefit of all my colleagues, I will refer to the report of the 
Auditor General, who is a serious and reputable man whose 
competence is recognized by all members of this House. The 
situation has not changed since he wrote his March 1991 report.
<P>
	This is what he wrote: ``The Senate is unique and operates in a 
rapidly changing environment. Managing the Senate is different 
from managing a department, a public organization or a private 
business. As a legislative body, the Senate can establish and 
adopt most of the regulations impacting on its conduct. It is not 
necessarily subjected to the same laws as the administration. It 
may not even be bound by the Financial Administration Act. The 
usual accountability mechanisms therefore do not apply. 
Without these mechanisms or appropriate alternatives, the 
Senate, just like the population, cannot be as certain as most 
other institutions that its administration is sufficiently 
concerned with economy and efficiency''. That is what the 
Auditor General said in his report tabled in this House in March 
1991.
<P>
	He goes on to say: ``A distinctive feature of Senate 
administration is that senators are collectively responsible. 
Senators are themselves responsible for their own 
administration. They are accountable only to themselves''. He 
adds: ``We noted that the Senate did not, either officially or 
unofficially, delegate clear responsibilities to the 
administration or clearly indicate what the administration was 
accountable for''. In other words, the administration of that 
chamber resembles a free-for-all. They do what they want with 
public money, as the Auditor General pointed out.
<P>
	He goes on to say: ``The Senate does not report adequately on 
its administrative and financial record and its management of 
human resources. It does not have sufficient information to do 
so systematically. As far as senators' expenditures are 
concerned, we noted that the amounts declared in public 
accounts were incomplete and not informative enough to enable 
us to determine whether they constitute Senate operating 
expenditures under the Parliament of Canada Act. Neither the 
Senate's policies nor its practices provide assurance that all the  
amounts reimbursed were spent for the operation of the 
Senate''. That is a damning judgement of the Upper House, the 
Senate.
<P>
	That year, the Auditor General made 27 recommendations to 
improve the operation and efficiency of the Senate. I will give 
some of them. These recommendations just as they are show that 
the Senate is ineffective, inefficient and useless.
<P>
	Recommendation No. 1 is that the Senate should define more 
clearly the mandates of the Committee on Internal Economy and 
its subcommittees. Recommendation No. 2 is that the Senate 
should publish its expenditures of public funds and the 
performance of its administration. The Senate should regularly 
publish a summary of the activities and expenditures of its 
committees. Mr. Speaker, it goes on like that for 27 
recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I ask my colleagues on both sides of the House to refer to this 
report of the Auditor General from 1991. I am told that this 
situation still goes on; according to all the information now 
available, the situation is still the same.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will simply convey some facts on the Senate's 
spending as reported in an article by Claude Picher in <I>La Presse</I> 
of February 3, 1994. He drew on a report by Gord McIntosh in 
the <I>Financial Post</I>, which reported some Senate expenses like 
changes or improvements for $125,000 to Senate premises. As 
was said right here in this House, a senator had his floor raised 
so that he could have a better view outside.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is disgraceful!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if you allow me, I will conclude with this. The Senate 
sat only 47 days in 1993, so each sitting day cost about $1 
million on average.
<P>
	I repeat, this Senate is ineffective, inefficient and useless.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask for 
unanimous consent to defer all divisions on this debate to 
10 p.m. tonight.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the Official Opposition whip. Do hon. members 
agree?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The five-minute period 
for questions and comments to the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead will now begin. The 
Parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the government in the 
House.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="5012"> 5012 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was very interested in the comments made by the hon. member 
for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, but I was surprised by his 
attack on the Senate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I remember in the last Parliament that the House was not full 
but had a great number of Conservative MPs from the province 
of Quebec sitting on the other side who were staunch supporters 
of the Senate. My recollection is that members of his party who 
used to be Conservatives-apparently they either saw some 
light or went blind, I am not sure which; either way they fell off 
the path and landed on another-or supporters of Mr. Mulroney 
and his government supported the Senate. They supported it so 
much they stuffed it full of good Tories.
<P>
	We know this happened during the last Parliament. We know 
it was supported by Conservative members of Parliament, many 
of whom were from the province of Quebec and never said a 
word in the House about their electors wanting to get rid of the 
Senate. Now we hear this is the popular rage in his province. I do 
not recall hearing raised during the last election campaign 
anywhere in Canada that the Senate was the subject of extensive 
discussion, either in Quebec or elsewhere.
<P>
	I am very surprised to hear the hon. member telling us today 
that everyone in his province is in favour of abolition of the 
Senate when this patently was not the case until at least October 
25, 1993. Has something happened that has changed the minds 
of Quebecers? I am interested to know what it is that in his view 
has resulted in this-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-about-face, as we say, which changed the opinion of all his 
constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
for his very pertinent question regarding the comments I just 
made and the fact that the vast majority of Quebecers, if not all 
of them, are in favour of abolishing the Senate. The hon. 
member says that he has doubts about my statement, since the 
Conservative members who formed the previous government 
were in favour of the Senate, and in fact their government 
appointed many Conservative senators to protect its interest in 
the Upper House.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The answer is quite simple: You only have to look at the 
results of the election held on October 25, 1993. There is only 
one Conservative member left in this House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> No, I 
mean to represent Quebec. Quebec has only one Conservative 
member who, somewhat like senators, was appointed leader of 
the Conservative Party without being elected to that position. 
There is the answer. On October 25, 1993, Quebecers made a 
choice based on their interests; they made a choice based on 
what they really thought of federal institutions, and this is why 
they sent 54 Bloc Quebecois members to represent them in this 
House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> I can see 
why the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands may have 
some doubts. This is exactly what we said during the election 
campaign, last October, and what we are repeating day after day 
in this House. For over 125 years now, Quebecers have been 
elected to represent their fellow citizens in this House and to 
talk to the rest of Canada. This time, there are, in this House, 
people who do not want to be appointed to the Senate under any 
consideration. We simply want to tell our friends from English 
Canada what Quebecers want. And what they want is to have 
their own country; they want to set up their own institutions, and 
this is why I say once again that Quebecers in general are not 
only in favour of abolishing the Senate, but are even in favour of 
abolishing their own representation in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity to speak on the subject of the appropriation of 
certain votes, and especially the $26.9 million allocated to the 
Senate for the 1994-95 fiscal year. I think it is high time this 
government realized that sound government management starts 
with more prudent and especially more efficient management of 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	I think it is useless to allocate $26.9 million to the Senate for 
program spending, an amount that will be added to the 
$15 million it will receive directly in the course of the current 
fiscal year and to another $12 million in services provided by 
various federal departments and agencies to maintain an 
institution that has absolutely no connection with how a modern 
democracy operates.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Leader of the Government, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel I must refer to Standing 
Order 18, because I am afraid the hon. member went too far. The 
text reads as follows, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5013"> 5013 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>18. No Member shall speak disrespectfully of the Sovereign, nor of any of the 
Royal Family, nor of the Governor General or the person administering the 
Government of Canada; nor use offensive words against either House, or 
against any Member thereof.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the rule under the Standing Orders. This is very 
important, and I hope the hon. member will speak respectfully 
of the Senate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to thank the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands for his comments. In 
fact, I have the text of Standing Order 18, from <I>Standing 
Annotated Orders</I> right here, because I want to be vigilant at all 
times.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	However, I must admit I was taking some notes in the chair, so 
I cannot comment on what was said by the hon. member for 
Joliette, who nevertheless caused the hon. member on the 
government side to raise his point of order.
<P>
	I do want to make it clear to hon. members that I will remain 
in the House until the end of the debate. And I want to thank the 
hon. member for his remarks, because members must behave in 
a parliamentary fashion, as has always been the tradition in this 
House, and I am confident that we will continue to do so.
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I promise to show respect in my 
choice of words, but I must admit that it is sometimes frustrating 
to hear people speak against things you hold true and which are 
dear to you. If I talk about these institutions, it is not because I 
do not appreciate them, but rather because I believe that they 
should be modified, if not abolished.
<P>
	I was going to say that the government claims that it wants to 
take steps to save money. Allow me to suggest an excellent way 
to do just that. As I said a moment ago, cancel the estimates for 
the Canadian Senate.
<P>
	The men and women who are in the Senate, the other House, 
or more respectfully, the other place, were not sent there by the 
people; they are not accountable to the people for their 
decisions, therefore they are not democratic representatives of 
the people.
<P>
	I will admit that they are people of considerable merit-as 
you can see, Mr. Speaker, I have the greatest respect for 
them-but no matter how much merit they have, the Senate is 
still a very costly institution for Canadians and Quebecers, 
especially given our present economic situation.
<P>
	One must ask what was the reason for giving Parliament two 
houses back in 1867? And why today, more than 125 years later, 
we still have this non-elected House called the Senate?
<P>
	Since 1960, 52 different bills have been introduced in this 
House with a view to changing either its role or its operations, or 
even questioning its very existence. This proves that the 
Commons had realized that the Senate  urgently needed to be 
updated. In 34 years, there has been 52 attempts, some 
successful, some not, to change the way the Senate operates.
<P>
	At the time the Senate was created, it was meant to be a House 
of sober second thought. Its members were to serenely review 
legislation, free from popular pressure. That could be justified 
in 1867, but nowadays, the Senate's role has changed drastically 
due to the practical limitation of its authority.
<P>
	In those days, the Senate used to be a place where the 
members of the Federation could be heard. It allowed for the 
protection, at the federal level, of provincial and regional 
interests. In today's context, the only link between senators and 
their province is the fact that they own property and reside there.
<P>
	Nowadays, the Senate remains an institution without a basis, 
which derives its authority solely from the merits of its 
members.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Above all, the Senate provides a legal framework for political 
rewards. In fact, I believe that, in its present form, the Canadian 
Senate is an anachronism as a legislative body, a mistake that 
costs millions of dollars in public funds.
<P>
	Communications being what they were in 1867, the public 
was informed of decisions taken by the legislator long after the 
fact. In such a context, one could understand the existence of a 
Senate comprising people having reached the age of wisdom, 
having acquired an experience recognized by everyone; one 
could understand the usefulness of such an Upper House in 
protecting the taxpayers, the voters, against sometimes 
emotional or hasty decisions by legislators. Since the taxpayers 
were sometimes informed 30, 60 or even 90 days after the 
decisions were made, it was difficult for them to react and exert 
pressure on their member of Parliament.
<P>
	But with our modern satellite communications, with the 
advent of television, people can exert pressure every day on 
their legislator, on their member of Parliament, and can tell 
them that they think he or she is making a mistake by supporting 
one bill or another, with the opportunity for all the wise people 
from each of our ridings-I think that there are 104 members in 
the Senate-in each of our ridings I can find at least a hundred or 
so wise men and wise women who can very ably advise each 
member of this House on the relevance of supporting one bill or 
voting against another one.
<P>
	That safeguard is already guaranteed by our modern means of 
communication. We no longer need this Upper House to protect 
taxpayers from the mistakes that a single House, voting too 
emotionally or too hastily, could make.
<P>
	Of course, some still think that this group of non-elected 
people must have a permanent right to veto decisions made by 
elected representatives of the House of Commons, that senators 
are here to restrain members of  Parliament in their decisions 
and to correct their errors. It is true that members of Parliament 
can make mistakes. However, we are accountable to our 
constituents and they are the ones who will judge us. Not six 
months later. They have an opportunity to judge us every week 
when we go back to our riding and even before because, when an 
error is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5014"> 5014 </A></B>
<P>
too blatant, you can be sure that taxpayers back home call their 
member in Ottawa to pressure him or her into reconsidering his 
views.
<P>
	Yet nobody will judge the actions of the senators in the Upper 
House. These individuals are there, appointed by the 
government in a partisan way and often for services rendered. 
They stay there until their retirement at 75. We then must pay 
them a pension on top of having to pay the full salary of their 
successors.
<P>
	You will understand that I cannot consider such a treatment to 
be in accordance with the principle of democracy. You will 
therefore better understand my opposition to the payment of 
$26.9 million for program expenses to an institution that is in no 
way representative of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	The five provinces that once had an Upper House abolished 
that political institution. That was the case in 1968 in Quebec, 
which was the last province to abolish the Senate because it no 
longer served a need that once existed. The same question arises 
for the Canadian Senate.
<P>
	Can we consider abolishing the Senate? For almost 30 years, 
the question of the further existence of the Senate has constantly 
been raised. The Supreme Court gave a break to the Senate when 
ruling in 1980 that Parliament could not abolish the Senate 
without having a law passed by the British Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Yet, at patriation time in 1982, the main aspects regarding the 
powers of the Senate, its regional and provincial make-up and 
its non-elected nature were enshrined in the new Constitution, 
which opened a door for the government.
<P>
	Rather than taking steps and solving once and for all the 
Senate issue, the government preferred to focus on Senate 
reform, with the results that we now have. How can senators 
justify being allocated $54 million a year when the Senate does 
not sit for long periods of time, when recess periods are 
numerous and long and when absenteeism is very high even 
when the Senate is sitting?
<P>
	Do people know that 450 employees had to be hired to work 
for the 104 senators. This is an average of 4,3 employees for 
each senator? Do people know that $54 million represents a 
yearly average of $520,000 for each senator? We could create a 
lot of jobs with $54 million.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I wonder why we have to add to 
the burden of the taxpaying population of Canada and Quebec an 
extra $26 million to maintain a non-democratic institution that 
does not represent at all  the regions and has not been given any 
mandate by the people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the passionate speech of the hon. 
member. Much has been said about the Senate already.
<P>
	During the election campaign, many people asked me to do 
something about the Senate. I believe we all have the same 
problem, we want to improve the Senate. My question is about 
the Senate. Most civilized countries have a Senate, but I heard 
the opposition party's members say that they want it abolished.
<P>
	What kind of checks and balances do they think we should 
have for the House of Commons? Do they think we have to 
abolish the Senate to improve the system, or would they 
consider an improved Senate which would work the way it 
should?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat to the hon. 
member that the provinces which did away with their upper 
houses never regretted it. The province of Quebec, where the 
Legislative Council was abolished in 1968, never regretted that 
decision, and the laws are not worse than they were.
<P>
	The people of Quebec barely noticed the disappearance of the 
Legislative Council. If it had not been for the headlines in the 
dailies, a good part of the population might never have known 
that the Legislative Council had ceased to exist.
<P>
	I repeat, the modern means of communication are the 
watchdog of the people. When the Prime Minister of the former 
government announced his intention to pass legislation to limit 
old age pensions, a little lady, very shy, very modest, rose up in 
front of television cameras and said to the Prime Minister: 
``Charlie Brown, you broke your promises''.
<P>
	It did not take long, it did not take a Senate to make the Prime 
Minister realize that he was about to do something that the 
people did not approve. It took only a single and modest 
taxpayer to tell the Prime Minister, in front of the cameras, that 
the bill he was about to pass was unjust for a good many people.
<P>
	It did not take a Senate, the Prime Minister backed down and 
the bill was never voted on.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I challenge the present government to try to pass, tomorrow, a 
bill which would be against the best interest of the people, and 
then try to enforce it despite the opposition of the population. 
The Senate would be of no help in such a case.
<P>
	Senators themselves had to be called to order a few months 
ago when they asked for a pay raise. It is not the House of 
Commons that made the senators reconsider their position, it 
was public opinion. Senators were told that they had not shown 
enough wisdom to realize that in a recession everybody had to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5015"> 5015 </A></B>
<P>
tighten their belts. It is not the Senate, in its wisdom, which 
understood it had gone too far, it is public opinion alerted by the 
media. The  House of Commons told the Senate to show more 
wisdom. All this goes to prove that our democracy is well 
protected, even without a Senate which costs $54 million a year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it 
is absolutely essential that this House question the relevance of 
the Senate. This Upper House made up of members who are 
nominated and not elected-it bears repeating-goes against 
our democratic system in which we take so much pride. In fact, 
it is against any form of democracy to give important 
decision-making powers to a nominated House. That is why I 
rise today against this fossilized institution that costs taxpayers 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	I want to remind my colleagues opposite and the House that, 
on January 28, 1957-a long time ago-a member, I think he 
was a Liberal, suggested the following-and I quote in view of 
my colleagues' lack of memory: ``We will call a meeting 
between the federal and provincial governments and, taking 
their recommendations as a starting point, we will make the 
Senate into an efficient instrument for Parliamentary 
governance''. Liberals are probably still studying the issue, 
which is probably still a priority for them, 37 years later.
<P>
	The federal Senate is the only non-elected House still in 
existence in Canada. Having understood what a nonsense it was, 
provincial legislatures abolished theirs. Unfortunately, on the 
threshold of the 21st century, we are still debating the issue in 
this House.
<P>
	The Senate was created in 1867 to quietly review legislation, 
free from the glare of public pressure. However, over time, 
practical limitations were imposed on its powers. The Upper 
House long ago abandoned its practice of introducing bills. 
Furthermore, it can, even if it only rarely does so, block bills 
that the people's elected representatives have democratically 
brought in. Such an opportunity arose in 1961 in connection 
with a bill respecting the dismissal of the Governor of the Bank 
of Canada, and again in 1964 over the bail-out of the 
unemployment insurance fund. More recently, we saw the 
Senate block bills concerning the GST and the NAFTA. Rarely 
does the Senate invoke this power akin to the sword of Damocles 
dangling over the House's head to block government bills, the 
reason being that Senate appointments are basically partisan in 
nature.
<P>
	Appointments are handed out to acknowledge services to the 
party in power. That is an undeniable fact. The Senate 
legitimizes the practice of doling out political rewards. This is 
an aberration of the federal system which purports to be 
democratic. The appointment process is the reason for the 
passive role now played by the Senate. It also explains why a 
party newly in power like the Liberals is in such a hurry to gain a 
majority in the Senate.
<P>
	One patently obvious example of the kind of partisanship 
which prevents the Senate from making objective decisions is 
the speed with which Senator Jacques Hébert, without 
mentioning any names, opposed unemployment insurance 
reform during the Conservative reign. So concerned was he for 
the unemployed that he had gone on a hunger strike four years 
earlier to show his support for young people and the jobless. 
Well, Senator Hébert does not seem to be quite as perturbed this 
time around by the Liberal reform which reduces unemployment 
insurance benefits. At least he has not shown any signs yet of 
being perturbed. Surely his lack of passion has nothing to do 
with partisanship. Or does it?
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Getting back to the role of senators, each one is appointed to 
represent a region of Canada. One of the objectives in creating 
the Senate was to ensure regional representation. However, we 
would be deluding ourselves if we believed that today's Senate 
provided real regional representation. Speaking about regional 
representation, how can we forget the passion with which 
Senator Gigantes who represents the senatorial division of 
Delorimier in Quebec cautioned Quebecers-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take the time to 
check but, as far as I know, the members of this House should 
not refer to other members or to senators by their names but by 
the names of their ridings. I will check but I would still ask the 
hon. member to keep this in mind in his comments as much as 
possible. I will come back to this if necessary.
<P>
	The hon. member for Terrebonne.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this 
clarification. I checked and I thought we could use names but I 
will refrain from doing so.
<P>
	The senator I just mentioned, who represents Delorimier, in 
Quebec, warned Quebecers against the possible failure of the 
Charlottetown Accord. He even predicted such a failure would 
lead to a crisis similar to what happened in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Do you see tanks in Quebec, senator? 
Who did the Delorimier people vote for in the last election, 
senator? We wonder who you represent today, senator.
<P>
	This senator recently did it again, predicting a civil 
war-what a wise man he is-in Quebec if that province ever 
becomes independent. This senator represents Quebec. Is this 
wise senator acting like a good regional representative when he 
accuses Bloc members democratically elected by the Quebec 
people of being traitors. I doubt that this senator really 
represents his region. As I said earlier, the fact that he represents 
Delorimier, which was named after a Quebec patriot, is one of 
the system's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5016"> 5016 </A></B>
<P>
absurdities. I repeat, who did the people of Delorimier vote for 
on October 25, senator? Again, who do you represent?
<P>
	I would like to shed light on something. I would like to quote 
from two articles that appeared in <I>La Presse</I> to show the 
intellectual rigour of this senator from Delorimier. In September 
1992, this senator said about the Charlottetown Agreement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A no vote in Quebec would not be a return to the current status quo. Under the 
current status quo, all the premiers from English Canada approved the agreement 
which, as Professor André Tremblay said, contains all the concessions that 
English Canada would be prepared to grant to Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Two months after the Charlottetown Accord failed, this 
senator said: ``Obviously, if the rest of Canada could not 
swallow the Charlottetown Accord, Quebecers now have only 
two choices, namely the status quo and independence without 
previously negotiated economic association''.
<P>
	Two months earlier he was saying that the status quo was not 
an option and two months later, that it was the only option. What 
a wise man!
<P>
	In the wake of the Charlottetown Accord he said this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The rest of Canada will never allow the Bloc Quebecois to wield influence by 
holding the balance of power.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Someone who was appointed in a non-democratic fashion and 
who represents a Quebec division dares to speak against 
democracy. That is the Senate for you!
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Against duly elected representatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Against duly elected representatives!
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Let us now look at these exorbitant costs of this other House, 
by the way. According to the Auditor General's report of 1991, 
the Financial Administration Act could not apply to the Senate. 
The Auditor General says that the usual accountability 
mechanisms do not apply to the Senate. Without such 
mechanisms or appropriate alternatives, neither the Senate nor 
the people can be sure that it is managed with sufficient concern 
for economy and efficiency.
<P>
	Moreover, the expenditures declared by senators in the public 
accounts are incomplete. The Auditor General's report tells us 
that neither the Senate's policies nor its practices provide 
assurance that all the amounts reimbursed were spent for the 
operation of the Senate. The Senate administrators cannot 
distinguish the Senate's operating expenses from the senators' 
personal expenses.
<P>
	That is serious, Mr. Speaker. But what are the Senate's actual 
expenses? In 1990-91, the total budget of the Upper House was 
$40 million and today it is $43 million. Need I say that this is 
public money, funds provided by the taxpayers, and the Auditor 
General's report tells us that there is no control over this 
spending. Forty-three million dollars with which we could 
create jobs for the unemployed is wasted.
<P>
	The senators have a very busy schedule but they still have 
plenty of free time. They sat for 29 days in the four months from 
February to May 1993 and they collect an annual salary of 
$64,400, which is public, plus a $10,000 non-taxable expense 
allowance, which is also public, to which we must add 64 travel 
points to which they are entitled and this is also public.
<P>
	This is a little more than the average salary of taxpayers who 
work 40 hours a week. We could go on talking for a long time 
about what journalist Claude Picher in <I>La Presse</I> calls a list of 
horrors.
<P>
	For example, based on the Auditor General's report for 
1990-91, I would like to ask you a question now, Mr. Speaker. 
Because I do not know her division, can I name Senator 
Cochrane or not?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to clarify some 
points at the end of your comments, for the benefit of the House.
<P>
	I simply want to say that your 10 minutes have now expired. 
However, I will recognize you for another minute if you want to 
conclude your remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So, a public report 
released by the Auditor General refers to Senator Cochrane, not 
to mention any names, who, on top of her $60,000 salary, as I 
was saying earlier, and her expense allowance of $9,000, cost 
Canadian taxpayers $35,000 in travelling expenses and $49,000 
in office-related costs. Canada does have its own museum of 
horrors and its own villains in that museum.
<P>
	In the minute I have left, I want to point out how absurd it is, 
in a democratic system, to have a house of non-elected members 
with decision-making power. Canadian dignitaries who are so 
proud of their democracy have no lesson to teach to other 
countries. When will they abolish that House which costs 
Quebecers and Canadians $43 million every year, even though it 
is ineffective and non-democratic?
<P>
	We are in the midst of an economic crisis and our debt 
increases by thousands of dollars every minute. The federal 
government cannot continue to waste public money on a useless 
institution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding to the 
period of questions and comments following the intervention 
from the hon. member for Terrebonne, I would like to bring 
some clarification to the issue of naming either members of 
Parliament or senators.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Those comments are from the Annotated Standing Orders and 
refer to Standing Order 18(3): ``What is acceptable depends 
largely on the circumstances, but personal attacks, insults, 
obscene language or words which question a Members' or a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5017"> 5017 </A></B>
<P>
Senators' integrity, honesty, or character are not in order. To 
reduce the possibility of personal references, convention further 
requires Members to refer to each other by title, position  or 
constituency name. Likewise, the Senate is usually ``the other 
place,'' and Senators, ``members of the other place''.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I simply wanted to make this clarification for the benefit of 
the House during the rest of the debate, until 10 p.m. this 
evening. Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to question the previous speaker and the one prior to him on 
a couple of things.
<P>
	First of all, I want it perfectly clear that I stand firm in the 
belief of a truly triple-E Senate, and I also believe that what we 
presently have is ineffective and truly a waste of dollars for a lot 
of reasons.
<P>
	One area that I am familiar with is the United States, as that is 
where I came from, and although the systems are slightly 
different the Senate has a significant purpose in that country and 
that is to protect the districts and regions from exploitation from 
larger regions. That is primarily its purpose.
<P>
	For example, the state of Montana, with one representative by 
population, is protected by two senators, as all states. Montana 
could have been exploited on a great number of occasions had it 
not been for that set-up.
<P>
	First of all, if we had no means of protection from exploitation 
by larger regions for smaller regions, what process would we use 
to make certain that does not happen? I am going to assume that 
he is going to answer in the same way as the previous speaker, 
that the people would take the appropriate action and put a stop 
to it. If he believes that, would he believe that the people of 
Canada as a whole should be able to take appropriate action if 
Quebec decides to separate?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> I would like to thank the hon. member for his 
question, as is the tradition here in this House. First of all, I want 
to say that, before their independence, the Americans promoted 
a philosophy which resulted in the fact that their Senate, 
although quite effective, is not representative. It is 
representation by population. We often heard about Loyalists 
demanding rep by pop and the United States having rep by pop. 
Of course, it is all right to have two senators per state, but then 
you do not have rep by pop. However, this is not the place to 
review the U.S. Senate, so I will try to give a more direct answer 
to the hon. member.
<P>
	About the triple E Senate, we believe that an elected House 
can undoubtedly make responsible decisions, because we 
support ministerial responsibility. An elected House could and 
should be able to make decisions concerning some legislation. 
Two elected Houses, if the Senate were to be a triple E Senate, 
could create confusion about which House must make the 
decision. The ten Canadian provinces, which do not have two, 
but only one House, show us how one House can make decisions, 
and very sensible decisions at that.
<P>
	For example, the province of Quebec, with a population of 
about 7 million, got rid of the legislative council in 1968, that is 
nearly 30 years ago. No one in Quebec has any regrets about that 
decision. Other provinces also got rid of their legislative 
councils and I do not think they have any regrets about it. So, in 
Canada, an elected House where hon. members would abide by 
the principle of ministerial responsibility could give proper 
consideration to the decisions they are about to make.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	And if Quebec were to become sovereign, I hope Canada will 
respect the democratic principles it has been advocating since 
1867.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague and friend, and also neighbour, the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe, clearly explained why he is against 
spending $26,952,000 for the Senate. I totally agree with him, 
given that such a measure would, in the long run, abolish a 
costly but far from essential institution, namely the Senate.
<P>
	It is a well-known fact, and has been for quite some time, that 
Quebecers do not see why they should pay to maintain the Upper 
House. The country is going bankrupt. Social programs are 
being slashed. In senior citizen centres, soup portions are being 
reduced from four ounces to two ounces, but we can still afford 
to appoint senators.
<P>
	In my riding of Frontenac, every Friday, I receive a call from 
Mrs. Lessard, from East Broughton in my riding of 
Frontenac-and she must be listening now, because I informed 
her-, and she asks me the same question: ``Hon. member, when 
will the government increase old age pensions? I have not quite 
paid my heating bill yet''. She said that only last week. She also 
asks the following question: ``When will the government 
abolish the GST? They promised to do so. I have some purchases 
to make, but I am waiting for them to abolish the GST''.
<P>
	How can I explain to Mrs. Lessard the government's delay in 
abolishing the GST, which they would rather hide than abolish? 
How can I explain to Mrs. Lessard that she will only get a $1.28 
monthly increase in her old age pension, while, in the other 
place, some are handsomely paid, appointed, not elected, to 
serve until they reach 75 years of age? If we had jobs like that in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5018"> 5018 </A></B>
<P>
the riding of  Frontenac, I am sure the list of applicants would be 
very long.
<P>
	To prove to you to what extent the Senate is unknown in 
Quebec, I will give you the results of a poll I conducted in my 
riding, in July of last year, with some of my assistants. We asked 
some people in the riding about the Senate, to find out what they 
knew. We crisscrossed the riding of Frontenac, from Thetford to 
Plessisville, from Coleraine to East Broughton, via 
Saint-Jacques-de-Leeds, Sainte-Agathe and Saint-Sylvestre. 
We visited grocery stores, credit unions, shopping centres, gas 
stations, etc. In fact, we went everywhere we could find people.
<P>
	We wanted to measure how voters reacted to the Senate, and 
to find out whether they knew any senators. I can tell members 
opposite that I heard many sighs and saw many skyward looks.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Many told us straight out that the Senate was useless, or that it 
was a circus manned by people appointed by the government as a 
reward. We asked those who were more receptive whether they 
knew any senators and could name some. Only two names out of 
104 came up, and not very often. They were Solange 
Chaput-Rolland and Jacques Hébert. Considering their past 
achievements, it is clear that their notoriety did not come from 
the fact that they were senators.
<P>
	Ordinary people do not see how the Senate could possibly 
help them. They only see a group of individuals appointed for 
reasons sometimes obscure, on whom they never call to defend 
their interests. As one of my constituents pointed out to me, it is 
difficult enough for people to know if they have to go to their 
provincial or their federal MP for a particular problem. They 
just do not want to bother finding out what a senator can do for 
them.
<P>
	Last year, I polled the people of my riding on their knowledge 
of the Canadian Senate and on their reactions to the $6,000 
non-taxable raise that the senators had voted for themselves, as 
hon. members will all remember, especially the members 
opposite. A $6,000 non-taxable increase is worth about 
$12,000. Do you know that, in my riding, many people work 50 
weeks a year and barely earn $12,000? It is outrageous.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Joliette was saying earlier, public 
opinion has been the senators' watchdog. During the three 
weeks following this shameful decision by the senators, public 
opinion in Quebec and in Canada ran heavily against them and 
they had to undo what they had done.
<P>
	My colleague from Terrebone gave some examples of 
outrageous expenditures, like the senator who had his office 
remodelled at a cost of more than $100,000. I built myself a very 
good house for about half that amount. There are some Canadian 
families, and I use the word Canadian to please the members 
opposite, who cannot  afford a $60,000 house. Yet, the senator 
had his office remodelled for double that amount and more.
<P>
	We will have a provincial election in Quebec in a few months 
and I invite my colleagues across the way to come and defend 
the Senate during that election campaign. They will see what 
Quebecers think of the Senate.
<P>
	To illustrate my point, I will tell you that when the hon. 
Marcel Masse was representing my riding in the House, I 
phoned his office to inquire about the name of the senator 
responsible for our region. Of course, I did not talk to Mr. Masse 
personally, but I talked to highly qualified individuals with eight 
or nine years' experience since that was at the end of the 
Conservative regime. Believe it or not, no one in his 
constituency office could give me an answer. After waiting for 
many days, someone finally called me back to give me the name 
of my representative in the Senate, but I have since forgotten 
that name.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Again last night, my assistant here, Manon Genest, called the 
Senate communications service to know which senator was 
responsible for my riding, Frontenac. ``We will call you back'' 
was the answer. This is a fine example of the active involvement 
of senators in political life! When even the communications 
service of the Senate itself cannot give the name of our 
representative right away, frankly, I must tell you that that does 
nothing to give me confidence in the other Chamber.
<P>
	If I ask the hon. member sitting next to me what riding he 
represents, I am sure that it will not take him 20 minutes to give 
me the answer. He knows. If I call the House of Commons to 
know what riding Antoine Dubé represents, they will tell me 
immediately.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The hon. colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac): </B>My hon. colleague, to be more 
precise.
<P>
	We also asked the people we met to tell us what they 
remembered the most about what the Senate did. Among the 
older age group, some people mentioned Senator Hébert's 
hunger strike. That stayed in people's minds.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have to interrupt to 
indicate whether names are to be used or not. Early in the hon. 
member's speech, I agreed that names be mentioned since he 
was conveying the results of a survey he had done in his riding. I 
thank him for the fact that in a later part of his speech he did not 
mention parliamentarians by their names but by their 
designations instead. I hope we will abide by this rule up till the 
end of this debate. The hon. member for Frontenac.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank you for the patience you always show and for the 
thoughtful manner in which you correct us. You do it so well that 
in my turn I would like to beg your pardon for having mentioned 
the senator by name. I will therefore skip a few paragraphs to 
conclude with the way our famous senators are appointed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5019"> 5019 </A></B>
<P>
	I finally learned the name of my senator, and the reason for 
that appointment. When we look at the list of Quebec senators, 
the 21 left, most of whom live in Montreal, we find that one is an 
organizer for the Conservative Party, one is a fundraiser for the 
Liberal Party-I know him-another was a top adviser to the 
former premier of Quebec who just left office, yet another is an 
organizer for the Conservative Party, and another is a good 
Liberal, yes, and has been a Liberal MP for a long time. The 
letters P.C. are added to his name.
<P>
	So, Mr. Speaker, I have a list of 21 senators and none of them 
is truly representative of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for Frontenac for his co-operation and understanding.
<P>
	Questions and comments. The hon. member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is something I do not 
understand. I am really confused. If the hon. member and his 
party want to leave Canada, why are they so interested suddenly 
in the future of Canada? If the member wants to destroy our 
country, what importance does all this have for him?
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Why should he talk about the future of Canada if he has no 
interest in it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend 
my colleague in the Reform Party for asking his question totally 
in my language.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebecers, every 
year, pay 24 per cent of all taxes to the federal government. As 
long as Quebecers are part of this country, we will defend their 
interests here.
<P>
	The members across the way and those in the Reform Party 
are probably thinking: Why do so many Quebecers wish to leave 
the Canadian family? My hon. friend in the Reform Party is 
happy in the present regime, and so are his children. As for me, I 
am sad and unhappy to be part of Canada, and I wish Quebecers 
would finally wake up and decide to give their children who are 
listening to us on television a country to which they are entitled: 
Quebec.
<P>
	We see senators who are defending the regions. But when I ask 
what senator represents my region, which is made up of three 
ridings, nobody knows. He never comes to the ridings of 
Frontenac, Lotbinière or even Bellechasse. There are three 
ridings in my region. But we never see our senator. He is a 
Conservative senator who was appointed by the preceding 
government.
<P>
	I tell you this: we pay, so we have our say. The present Senate 
is just a bunch of patronage appointees, people who were 
appointed for services rendered. And we have no confidence that 
they will defend Quebec's interests.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like raise a question about the role of a Senate in an ideal 
world. Most countries have found that the idea of a totally 
sovereign legislature in the form of a House like ours is not 
adequate in protecting the interest of the people as a whole.
<P>
	What we have at the moment costing $27 million a year is not 
the ideal kind of chamber that we see around the world. This was 
brought out by hon. members today and I agree. It is essentially 
a chamber which is serving the purpose of a sober second 
thought. We should not be too harsh on it because it has done a 
very good job.
<P>
	For example, the amendments it has proposed recently to the 
bill on redistribution served a useful function. There was some 
partisanship which served the country in bringing out debate 
over the GST, over free trade. These served useful functions.
<P>
	However, $27 million a year may be a bit expensive. The role 
we should strive for is that the Senate take the other functions 
that we see in similar chambers around the world, namely the 
protection of regional minorities and for senators who have a 
longer election-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret, but it is very 
difficult for chair occupants when members choose to split their 
time, in fact speak for 10 minutes and only have five minutes for 
questions and comments.
<P>
	I hesitate when there is only a minute left because I appreciate 
that all members want to make their point leading up to their 
questions. I would ask the member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
whether he wants to leave the comment as is or if he has a short 
question to add.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time constraint. I 
am sorry if I went on a little long. I did not keep track of time.
<P>
	With a reformed Senate, one which is modelled after 
successful upper chambers around the world, I wonder whether 
there is not a chance that the member who spoke so articulately 
against the present system might be willing to consider that a 
reformed Senate might be in the interest of all Canadians, in 
particular the people of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, back in 1968, 
Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson abolished the provincial 
equivalent of the Senate, the legislative council. Is Quebec 
worse off today because of the elimination of that council 26 
years ago? Quite the contrary. The National Assembly in 
Quebec is much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5020"> 5020 </A></B>
<P>
more effective. The legislative process is shorter. Is it not true 
that the $65 million we spend for the Senate would be a great  
help to create jobs? I would like to hear your views, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Frontenac for his invitation. Time permitting, I could have 
accepted, but I am afraid I cannot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity as the member for Lévis and above all as the official 
opposition critic for training and youth to report on 
consultations I have had carried out with young Quebecers 
concerning the Senate. They have been most revealing.
<P>
	Let me explain the context of those consultations. Last 
February, young Quebecers participated in a youth Parliament 
experiment. I noticed that one of the motions passed as a matter 
of priority concerned the abolition of the Senate. I found that 
concern interesting and, later on, asked a few young assistants to 
help me with a survey of young people on that issue. I feel that 
my findings make a suitable follow-up to remarks made by the 
hon. member for Frontenac on the point of view of senior 
citizens in his riding.
<P>
	What do young people think? I asked them first of all what 
they thought of people in the Senate. My first finding is that they 
do not know what the Senate is all about. Most of them do not 
know what it is. Very few of them know. I will quote the answer, 
such as it was, that they gave: ``It is a room full of older people 
who cost a lot of money to the taxpayers and whose work does 
not appear to be useful, in the eyes of young people''. Who could 
give even an approximate number of senators without counting 
the empty seats in the Upper House? The vast majority of young 
people, almost all of them, did not know that there were 104 
senators. As for determining the composition and the role of that 
other place, we can only get an answer by referring to the 
Constitution.
<P>
	A second question that was raised was: ``But who elects these 
104 people?''
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	These young people wondered, since these are not elected 
people, how they can get involved in various debates, 
supposedly as representatives of the Canadian citizens.
<P>
	In Quebec, for young people as well as older people who are 
familiar with the Senate and have read about it, such as young 
people who are studying political science or history, the Senate 
is the Mecca of patronage, with members from God knows 
where, but who surely have good friends in high places. Some 
young people believe that, once they have been appointed, 
senators are the people of Canada who benefit from the best job 
security, because we all remember that the age limit in the 
Senate is 75.
<P>
	The job situation today in Canada as well as in Quebec is a 
precarious one for young people. To them, job security is an 
unfamiliar concept. According to Statistics Canada, the 
unemployment rate for young people between the ages of 15 and 
24 is 17.7 per cent. According to the Conseil permanent de la 
jeunesse in Quebec, 4 out of 10 part-time jobs in Quebec are 
held by young people under 25; part-time jobs represent 33 per 
cent of all jobs held by young people between the ages of 15 and 
19; and more than two-thirds of young people under 25 who are 
working get minimum wages.
<P>
	Therefore we should not be surprised by the perception or 
position of young people regarding an institution that costs 
almost $1 million for every session day.
<P>
	Who are they? Very few young people can identify more than 
five. Since I cannot give any name, I will somewhat change my 
speech.
<P>
	Those who could identify some senators were able to do it by 
recalling current events. For instance, a very well-known 
person in Quebec has resigned because she was 75 years old. 
People finally realized that she was much better known for her 
novels and the books she had published than for her work in the 
Senate.
<P>
	It is the same thing for a senator known for his constitutional 
law expertise, who had a high-profile role at the time of the 
Charlottetown Accord. I know that by mentioning that fact only 
many people in Quebec will be able to identify that person.
<P>
	Besides, how can we blame young people for not being able to 
identify the senators? The best one of them could do was to name 
five out of 104. I have not put my colleagues on this side of the 
House through this test but I think it would be worth trying to 
ask new members for instance-because older members might 
find it easier-how many senators they can name.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How many senators could the Chair name?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé (Lévis):</B> I will not ask the hon. Speaker of the 
House to take part into this exercice because of his 
parliamentary responsibilities.
<P>
	The young people I consulted did not know that senators 
represented ridings, just like MPs. They did not know that. How 
can we blame them since I am convinced that adults themselves 
would not know any better. I must admit that I myself could 
absolutely not say which senator is representing my riding. It is 
not obvious. Perhaps I should have done some research but I 
realize after listening to the last speaker that I cannot tell the 
name of the senator who, among 21 others, is representing me. I 
did not have to do this research but I must say that she never 
called or dropped by.
<P>
	Nevertheless, how could we blame young people for not 
knowing their senators' names?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5021"> 5021 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Young people wonder how unelected senators can block bills 
like the GST. Remember that big debate. They blocked the drug 
patent bill, and once again very recently, we have the example of 
Bill C-18. The House of Commons and this government 
proposed postponing consultations on redrawing the electoral 
maps. The bill went to the Senate and the Senate asked us to 
reconsider our position. That is not the issue today, but we 
realize that it is a source of delay which slows down the work of 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	You know, this federal system is already complicated for 
Quebecers. They already see it as double representation and 
duplication. I will not take you through this whole scenario 
again, but you see that the Senate duplicates what the House of 
Commons is doing. The triple E was mentioned, but I see it as a 
threefold exercise of political power and you can understand 
that young people, who already find it difficult to be interested 
in politics in this state of affairs, find this situation triply 
complicated and even more repulsive.
<P>
	The Senate should act as a social conscience, but how can it 
play this role when senators are appointed by political parties 
and constantly surrounded by lobbyists. Some senators even sit 
on the boards of private companies. The various possible 
conflicts of interest are not considered. What about openness? 
Furthermore, senators now represent two political parties. 
Furthermore, the majority of senators currently belong to two 
political parties, one of which has almost been wiped out in the 
House of Commons. How can we explain such a situation to a 
young person interested in politics and tell him that the Senate is 
open to the future, when, in fact, the exact opposite is closer to 
the truth. I personally have difficulty explaining that situation, 
and I think it is also the case for any member of this House, 
regardless of the region which he or she represents, even outside 
Quebec. How can we claim that senators are representative of 
the different regions of Quebec and Canada when other political 
parties are present in those regions?
<P>
	In the minute that I have left, I simply want to remind 
everyone of the extremely difficult context in which young 
Canadians and Quebecers find themselves right now. Last year, 
Gilles Lesage, who is a journalist for the daily <I>Le Soleil</I>, referred 
to the Senate as a nuisance costing $50 million a year. This 
comment was not made by a politician, but by a journalist, an 
editorialist.
<P>
	Remember the debate held last July, when it was thought that 
Quebecers and Canadians were on holidays and that they would 
not notice anything. Senators wanted to vote themselves a futher 
$6,000 allowance.
<P>
	Our young people see that senators have very good pension 
plans and working conditions, while they themselves are 
unemployed and worried about their future. Under the 
circumstances, is it really a surprise that a resolution from a 
group of young people interested in politics proposed, at the 
beginning of February, that the Senate be abolished. I certainly 
can understand them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it rather 
surprising that Bloc members are telling us we should not have 
the other House and they are trying to remove the funding from 
the other House. They comment on how ineffective the other 
House is, when they sit here trying to destroy this House and this 
country. They talk about the ignorance of the people in Quebec 
and that they do not understand the other House.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Why do they not take the opportunity to go back to the 
province of Quebec and tell people what a wonderful institution 
this Parliament is in both Houses? Why not take the opportunity 
to tell people how much better off they would be if they 
remained in this country? Why not do that rather than saying: 
``We are not aware of what goes on there. Therefore it is 
irrelevant and does not matter, so why not set up our own 
institution in Quebec City?''
<P>
	Why does the hon. member and his colleagues not take the 
opportunity to make this institution work, both Houses that is? 
Why does he not take the opportunity to make this institution 
work, rather than thinking they are better off to pack their bags, 
walk out and destroy this institution and everything it stands for, 
thinking they would set up something better in Quebec City? 
What does the hon. member say to that?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my turn to be surprised. The 
questions and comments of my colleague from the Reform Party 
express a particular point of view.
<P>
	We have a debt of over $500 billion. In the six months I have 
been in this place, I have heard almost every day Reform Party 
members say that we must cut our expenses, that the way we are 
overspending does not make sense. On that I agree with you. We 
have to find ways to reduce expenditures.
<P>
	What we must consider today is not the abolition of the 
Senate, but rather the funds requested by the Senate. Until there 
is a referendum on sovereignty and until the majority of 
Quebec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5022"> 5022 </A></B>
<P>
ers support this idea, it is obvious that-since we are paying 
24 per cent of taxes-we must protect the interests of Quebec.
<P>
	Today, we are not requesting the Senate's abolition. We only 
oppose the funds allocated to it. We feel that, in these very tough 
economic times, these funds should be reduced. I am very 
surprised that Reform Party members do not agree with a 
measure aimed at reducing expenditures in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is necessary to ask a supplementary question 
to follow up on the one just asked by my colleague from the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	The member opposite says that he is not amending the 
Constitution when eliminating a vote in the Main Estimates. At 
least, I think that this is what he is saying. He is not abolishing 
the Senate, because an amendment to the Constitution would be 
required to do so, and I do not personally, and neither do my 
constituents, feel in the mood to amend the Constitution at this 
time.
<P>
	However, this seems more or less what the member wants to 
do. Does he think, since the two chambers, the Senate and the 
House of Commons, are under the authority of the Constitution, 
that the House of Commons has the right to abolish almost all 
the Senate votes? Does he also think that the Senate has the right 
to abolish all the House of Commons votes, including his own?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member usually asks questions 
that are, I will not say devious, but certainly clever from his 
point of view.
<P>
	Let me repeat: no, the purpose of the motion is not to abolish 
the Senate. It concerns budget votes. I think we have the right to 
say, to estimate, to declare that the amounts voted for the Senate 
are too high. That is why we are expressing such an opinion.
<P>
	A member of Parliament should, among other things, reflect 
the opinion of his constituents. I mentioned certain opinions, 
more particularly those of young Quebecers. Members from 
Quebec are here to say to the other side of the House: ``Here is 
what Quebec thinks, here is what Quebecers think of this 
situation''. That is the long and the short of it.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I think my time is up, but I feel any member should share my 
concern, he should find ways to attract young people to politics. 
I think we should propose alternatives to young people so that 
they get interested in the public life. Therefore, any member 
should be open to discussion on changes, even if these changes 
affect something that he considers to be very important today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to rise in the House today to defend the interests 
of Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, by demanding that votes for 
the Senate's expenditures be cancelled.
<P>
	I believe that this whole debate on the Senate is highlighting 
two aspects of Canadian federalism; it proves that it is not only 
inefficient, but also unable to renew itself to meet the challenges 
of the 21st century. As we all remember, on February 22 last, the 
Liberal government tabled its budget.
<P>
	We must remember that this budget made significant cuts 
affecting the unemployed and senior citizens. Moreover, it 
increased the tax base for the middle class. Therefore, this 
budget hit the unemployed, senior citizens and the middle class.
<P>
	When reviewing allocations in this same budget, one notices 
that close to $27 million are ear-marked for Senate 
expenditures. No cuts there. This very brief analysis of the latest 
budget tells a lot about the Liberal government's real priorities, 
and even more about the operation of this bankrupt Canadian 
federation.
<P>
	We do not want to play party politics, because we know full 
well that the previous government would have done just the 
same, and that the next one will do likewise. As we just saw, it is 
now simpler for the government of this country, regardless of 
the party in office, to hit the poor, those who are already reeling 
from the recession, than to ask its very rich friends, the senators, 
to do their share.
<P>
	A country where it is easier to let the deficit grow, signing 
away future generations' life, where the only cuts are made on 
the backs of the needy, where government patronage appointees 
do not reduce their extravagant lifestyles while the public is 
stuck in a very hard recession, is a very sick country. It could 
even be terminally ill.
<P>
	All in all, when we add indirect spending inherent in its 
operation, this Senate packed with the government's 
non-elected and non-representative friends, spends more than 
$54 million dollars over some forty sitting days a year, about 
twelve hours a month. Moreover, the absentee rate of some 
senators is around 66 per cent. All this is highly significant.
<P>
	Those nasty Quebec separatists are not the only ones asking 
that this House made up of non-elected members be eliminated. 
Somebody called Claude Ryan-maybe some of my colleagues 
have heard about him-proposed in 1980, in his beige paper, the 
elimination of the Upper House. That is why during the 1980 
referendum debate in Quebec, federalists were proposing the 
total elimination of the Senate.
<P>
	A few months shy of another important referendum, what do 
federalists suggest to Quebecers? The status quo. In other 
words, they want taxpayers to go on paying more than a million 
dollars a day to keep a House that represents no one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5023"> 5023 </A></B>
<P>
	Some Reform Party members could argue that, contrary to 
their unimaginative Liberal colleagues, they have a suggestion 
for Quebecers: the well-known triple-E Senate.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	This brings me to the second part of my speech in which I 
intend to demonstrate once again that Canadian federalism does 
not work and never will.
<P>
	The proposal for a Triple E Senate reflects a very poor 
understanding, not only of Quebec but of the history of Canada 
and of the purpose of our institutions. I would urge the Reform 
Party to examine the reasons and discussions that led to the 
adoption of the Constitution Act, 1867. At the time, 
francophones and anglophones decided to unite in a 
confederation that recognized the equality of its two founding 
peoples. It took some vigorous negotiating before these two 
founding peoples managed to agree on their choice of political 
institutions for this country.
<P>
	A constitutional expert, whom I will not name but who is also 
a member of the Senate, recalled, and I quote: ``Sir 
George-Étienne Cartier wanted parity between Quebec and 
Ontario for the Senate and he got it, in other words, 24 senators 
for each province''.
<P>
	We signed acts of union with a partner, English Canada, based 
on two houses, one with proportional representation and one 
with equal representation for Upper and Lower Canada. Over the 
years, as new English-speaking provinces were added and of 
course new senators for each province, Quebec's political clout 
in the Senate gradually diminished, so that today, Quebec is 
under-represented in the Senate in terms of its demographics, 
with only 23 per cent of the members in that house.
<P>
	As though this were not enough, our English Canadian partner 
now wants to marginalize us even further and consider us as only 
one of ten partners. I may recall that in 1867, the Fathers of 
Confederation felt that the presence of the Senate was also 
required to restrain the democratic excesses of members elected 
by universal suffrage.
<P>
	Perhaps the Liberal government still thinks it is necessary to 
restrain the democratic excesses of elected members. However, 
it should realize that times have changed and that Canadian and 
Quebec public opinion has changed as well.
<P>
	To sovereigntists from Quebec, English Canada's desire to 
make the Senate more effective, elected and equal is not a 
problem. However, there is no way we would agree to be 
included in this reform.
<P>
	We will not let the other provinces further diminish Quebec's 
political clout within our federal institutions. On behalf of all 
Quebecers, we say no, no forever to this kind of reform. Senate 
reform will happen without Quebec, or not at all. If the Reform 
Party or the other supporters of a Triple E Senate truly wants to 
provide  English Canada with a democratic legislative system, 
one that is less cumbersome and more efficient, then they should 
begin by ensuring a victory for the sovereigntist forces in the 
next Quebec referendum.
<P>
	Need I remind members that to reform the Upper House, the 
constitutional debate would have to be reopened? Pursuant to 
section 42 of the Constitution Act, the consent of the federal 
government and of seven provinces representing more than 50 
per cent of the population is required in order to alter the powers 
of the Senate or the way in which senators are appointed.
<P>
	After the recent failures of the Meech and Charlottetown 
agreements, to name only two, I think that Canadian federalism 
has proven itself to be inflexible and incapable of adapting to 
new realities.
<P>
	The members of this House who are concerned about the state 
of Canada's public finances must support the Bloc's motion. 
Canada can ill-afford from an economic standpoint the luxury 
of having a Senate. It is no longer dynamic enough or flexible 
enough to carry out in-depth reform. Until such time as they 
acquire institutions which correspond to the realities of Canada 
and Quebec, the members across the way sometimes enjoy 
pointing out that the official opposition is not truly 
representative of Canada as a whole.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would simply like to recall the findings of the 
latest Gallup public opinion poll which asked how Canadians 
and Quebecers felt about the Senate. On July 22, 1993, Gallup 
found that for the first time ever since it started asking this 
question, that is since 1944, a majority of Canadians said they 
were in favour of abolishing the Senate. Fifty-four per cent 
favoured abolishing the Senate, as the Bloc advocates, while 37 
per cent said it should be reformed, the option favoured by the 
Reform Party, and 4 per cent preferred the status quo, the option 
being defended today by the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The results in Quebec are even more revealing. Sixty-eight 
per cent said they were in favour of abolishing the Upper House, 
while 20 per cent would prefer to see the Senate reformed and 
4 per cent prefer the status quo.
<P>
	The numbers speak for themselves. All that remains for the 
government to do is to heed the will of Canadians and Quebecers 
and vote in favour of the Bloc Quebecois' motion.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the hon. member is engaged in giving the House a history lesson 
he might be well advised to include in his remarks the fact that 
long before Claude Ryan in 1980, or long before they asked the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5024"> 5024 </A></B>
<P>
first question in a poll in 1944, the predecessor of the NDP, the 
CCF, was calling for the abolition of the Senate since 1933.
<P>
	This is the longstanding position of our party with respect to 
the Senate and the effrontery over the decades at having an 
appointed body in the centre of our democratic decision making 
process. I have certainly found it very difficult on occasion to 
explain Canadian senators when I have been in other countries 
with them. They tend to be treated as if they are American 
senators. Everybody sort of oohs and ahs when they hear that 
someone is a senator. We have to take them aside and explain 
that they are not like American senators who get elected every 
six years, that these people are appointed for life and are 
thereafter untouchable except by the good Lord himself. It is 
something that most banana republics would not tolerate, the 
idea of having a body like this one appointed basically for life or 
until age 75.
<P>
	I wanted to say that we agree with the notion that the Senate 
should be abolished. It is certainly something that has been on 
the Canadian political table for a long time, long before the Bloc 
Quebecois came along. We have been open in recent years as to 
how the Senate might be reinvented on a more democratic basis 
to deal with some of the political problems that the country has 
experienced, and we continue to be open to that.
<P>
	As for the existing Senate, that appointed body, we 
continually take the same offence at it that we have historically 
taken. We therefore agree with the thrust of the motion to do 
away with the current Senate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Péloquin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
reminding me that his party and others before already debated 
the idea of the Canadian government abolishing the Senate.
<P>
	I would just like to make a short remark here, Mr. Speaker, if 
you allow me. I wonder why this state of affairs exists. We 
members of the House of Commons are asked to tighten our 
belts, cut our budgets and act like good representatives of the 
people. Members of this House travel economy class, you 
realize. The representatives of the other House always travel 
business class. Members of this House refused, with the consent 
of the Chair, which you represent, to continue accumulating 
frequent flyer points. All that was eliminated.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	However, members of the other House continue to use those 
points, which are a bonus. So I ask why members of the other 
House have special privileges that are better than ours, when we 
are just asked to cut the fat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
today's debate is most important since we are addressing the 
issue of the other place.
<P>
	Today's economic environment does not allow us to take for 
granted the amounts allocated to the Upper House, especially 
since we in the Bloc Quebecois have been defending, since the 
beginning of the session the entitlements of the most 
disadvantaged in our society. Given the difficult situation now 
faced by the people, that is, the insecurity and 
unemployment-there is 14 per cent unemployment in my 
riding-how can one support allocating money to the Senate, 
when all sectors are facing cutbacks? How can one justify the 
money spent on the other place with its 104 members?
<P>
	If I may, Mr. Speaker, I would like to give a few examples. 
Last year, the Senate paid a total of $125,000 for a new hall with 
mahogany and granite panels.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not cheap!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> The Senate only sat 47 days last year but it 
employs stenographers. Even when it is not sitting-and I will 
let you draw your own conclusions-these stenographers still 
get paid. They do not even have to show up at work. Some of 
them even fill their free time by offering their services to other 
firms, thus receiving two salaries. The total bill for taxpayers 
comes to $1.6 million.
<P>
	The senators also have their own $29,000 fitness centre when 
there are schools indire need of such facilities. Yet only one 
senator uses the centre on a regular basis.
<P>
	Between February and May 1993, the Upper House met for six 
days in February, 10 days in March, five days in April and eight 
days in May for a total of 29 days in four months. At least one 
day out of two, 17 senators or more were absent. They can miss 
21 days a year without penalty. After that, they must pay $60 for 
every day they miss. It is totally ridiculous.
<P>
	They also have their own furniture store. Eleven 
people-carpenters, cabinetmakers and even a professional 
framer-work there. As far as communications are concerned, 
each senator claims on average $10,000 per year in telephone 
charges. All these examples show how public funds are spent.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	We are not talking about individuals democratically elected 
by the population. No, senators enjoy privileges without being 
accountable.
<P>
	The existence of the Senate generates costs which Canadian 
and Quebec taxpayers can question in this difficult economic 
period, a period during which the government is targeting social 
programs. In that context costs related to the Senate have very 
little to do with the daily reality of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	People take an interest in the Senate because it generates 
costs, not because it plays a proactive role. It is the elected 
members who have democratic legitimacy. The public would 
not tolerate that a non-elected House, with members appointed 
by the central government, playing an interventionist role. 
Senators represent neither  the population, nor the provincial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5025"> 5025 </A></B>
<P>
public authorities; yet, every year, taxpayers have to pay for that 
institution.
<P>
	Those taxpayers have the right to ask themselves questions. 
However, it was not until 1991 that an audit was conducted for 
the first time. The Auditor General tabled a report on the 
administration of the Senate and made 27 recommendations. He 
said that the Senate is a unique institution operating in a rapidly 
changing framework. Senate management is different from that 
of a department, a public organization or a private business. 
Being a legislative body, the Senate can define and adopt most 
of the rules which have a bearing on its activity.
<P>
	Consequently, the usual accountability rules do not apply. 
Even if you argue that the budget has been decreasing in recent 
years, it is not enough. Only minor cuts were made to the 
1994-95 budget. For example, no Senate employee will be laid 
off, while thousands of positions are being abolished in the 
public service. There were 450 person-years in 1992-93, and 
there will be 447 in 1994-95. The numbers change only because 
of attrition, retirements and resignations. Six senators will retire 
this year. Unlike federal public servants, they will be replaced 
very quickly by friends of the people sitting on the other side.
<P>
	Quebec and Canadian taxpayers must pay for the Senate. Yet, 
more than ever before, public money should be spent in a useful 
way. We must ask ourselves if it is appropriate to maintain the 
Upper House, considering all the costs involved. Why is a 
non-elected House allocated public funds which could be better 
used? Why, in the present context, should we continue to pay for 
an institution which has no fundamental reason to exist?
<P>
	We live with a constitutional status quo. The situation is that 
the Senate continues to exist. How can we tolerate such a 
situation?
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	This status quo results in the continued existence of the Upper 
House, as well as the continued existence of major costs. This is 
what is happening. The Senate is the best example of the apathy 
of our federalism. That federalism is removed from the reality. 
In fact, discussions on a reform of the Senate began soon after 
Confederation, and, in the last 20 years or so, the number of 
studies, reports and proposals has increased significantly. The 
situation which persists is also the result of unacceptable federal 
proposals and is unaceeptable for Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, I firmly support the motion tabled by the hon. 
member for Richmond-Wolfe, opposing the vote of $26 
million under the heading Parliament-The Senate-Program 
expenditures.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to join in this very important debate. I 
would like to report to this House and to our listeners on what 
we, as a government and as members, have accomplished during 
the past months.
<P>
	On October 25, in the last election, Canadians voted 
massively for change. The hon. member said a change for the 
better, and that is true, we have had a Liberal government since 
October 25. In this massive vote for change, Canadians sent 
more than 200 new members to the House of Commons in 
Ottawa. For me as the Government Whip, it was a challenge to 
organize the allocation of offices on Parliament Hill as well as 
the proceedings of this House. At times it was a difficult task, 
but it was a challenge and a very important one.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5026"> 5026 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I must say that with the co-operation of my colleague, the 
Deputy Government Whip and member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, we managed first of all to 
ensure that each member had an office on the Hill. We 
negotiated with the whips of the other two political parties 
recognized in this House, we negotiated various budgets 
including research budgets and budgets for party leaders and 
House officials, so that by January 17, when the Prime Minister, 
the government called back the House, we would be ready to go 
and members would be ready to function and fulfil the mandate 
they received on October 25 as legislators.
<P>
	From my very first day as Government Whip, my objective 
was to reduce operating costs for all parliamentary activities and 
their administration. We started with the budget for the various 
caucuses, and after several meetings we managed to save a 
couple of million dollars, which is quite substantial.
<P>
	When allocating members' offices, we were determined to 
keep moving and installation costs to a minimum. In fact, I 
released the figures several months ago. We managed to save 
quite a bit of money. We saved about $1.1 million on moving 
costs alone here on the Hill. This was a reduction of 87 per cent 
over what was spent after the 1988 election.
<P>
	The purpose of this initial operation was to meet the 
commitments we made during the election campaign. In the red 
book we said that we wanted to set an example by starting right 
here. If we tell people they have to tighten their belts, we have to 
start by tightening our own here in this House. And we did that 
with our first operation, the allocation of members' offices. We 
told members and ministers: These are the offices you have been 
allocated and you take them as is, and if any repairs or 
improvements are necessary, we will make a report and ensure 
only the absolute minimum is done. There will be no abuse of 
the system. And the results are there.
<P>
	We did not want to stop there. Once all the members were 
accommodated on the Hill, we started looking at all the 
expenses, all the privileges, all the things provided to the 
members. That was the beginning of what people commonly call 
the Gagliano plan. I am pleased to note today-a few weeks 
before the summer recess-that the exercise was not just for the 
media, it was not simply a shopping list that we made as long as 
possible to take credit for it. We did not say we were going to cut 
five or six million from the operating budget of the House of 
Commons just to be able to brag about it afterwards. No, we did 
it because we believed in it. We did it because it was necessary. 
There were things which had to be changed, things which were 
no longer suitable, no longer necessary.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	We had two criteria. To save money, naturally, but also to give 
members services they really needed to do their jobs effectively. 
We did not cut for the sake of cutting, we analyzed each cut. I 
must, at this stage, thank the management of this House which 
provided me with the figures I needed, and put their knowledge 
and experience at our disposal. Of course, I also had the support 
of my caucus colleagues. As politicians, we must make choices. 
With the staff of the House I was able to define options, and then 
it was simply a matter of deciding which option to implement.
<P>
	We have only a few weeks left before we adjourn for the 
summer. Mr. Speaker, we are supposed to adjourn on June 23. I 
am proud to say that the Gagliano plan, that is the expenditures 
reduction plan which I announced to all Canadians on January 
16 in a press conference, has now been completed. There are still 
a few points left. This very afternoon, there was a meeting of the 
sub-committee on internal economy regarding parliamentary 
associations; a meeting is planned to adopt a plan to make the 
cafeteria and the restaurant more efficient and to save money. 
By June 23, my cost control plan will be in place. Some steps 
were already implemented in February and March.
<P>
	But, my plan is not part of the estimates we are going to vote 
on tonight. The savings do not appear in the grand total since, at 
the time we had to table the estimates for the House of 
Commons, our plan was not ready, of course, but we still had a 
deadline to meet, a deadline to cut government expenditures and 
table the results in the House, which had been set by the 
President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	I am sure that members have had a look at that booklet. The 
plan is mentioned in there and it will appear in the next 
estimates, but I want to ensure the House that the savings which 
were announced are real and that they are possible. Some 
savings have already been made, and will be carried over year 
after year. As we said in the red book, we want to be fiscally 
responsible, and will continue to be so. Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue. As I said on January 16, in the short time we had 
between the October 25 election and the opening of the current 
Parliament on January 17 and despite all the work involved in 
organizing the situation on the Hill and the offices of all 
members, we came up with a reduction plan in which we 
addressed what seemed at the time the most feasible and visible 
goals we could reach.
<P>
	We are currently considering other changes. There are more 
savings to be made. What is important is that we are willing to 
take our responsibilities and ready to announce and defend our 
positions. And when you take logical and fair decisions, you can 
only be confident like I am. I believe this expenditures reduction 
plan will work, because I have received several letters from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5027"> 5027 </A></B>
<P>
voters throughout the country who think that this is a step in the 
right direction and who encourage me to go on.
<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues 
in the government caucus. Without their support, I would not 
have been able to make these savings.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	My colleague, the deputy whip, and I are not the only ones 
responsible for these achievements. We were fortunate to have 
the support of all government members. I also want to thank the 
other whips and the members from the opposition who sit on the 
Board of Internal Economy and who approved our plan and 
made it all possible.
<P>
	We still have a long way to go. As I said, this is only the 
beginning. However, I would like to outline our achievements, 
so that everyone watching us tonight can realize what we have 
done so far. Some of these things might not seem important, but 
all together, they show how courageous and determined the 
government is.
<P>
	For instance, one of the things we did is look at the whole 
issue of members' special travel allowances. As everyone 
knows, each member is entitled to 64 trips from Parliament Hill 
to his or her riding and, according to the rules, these 64 trips 
could also be used to go anywhere else in Canada. We reduced 
this number to 20. This means that members are still entitled to 
64 paid trips a year but only 20 of them can be used to travel 
across the country. I think this will generate very significant 
savings. We also looked at the whole issue of printing services 
and mass mailings. The board has just adopted these new 
regulations that will allow us to save over half a million dollars a 
year.
<P>
	We did not cut services to members. They are still allowed 
four mass mailings a year, as they have been for a long time, to 
inform and communicate with their constituents. Although we 
kept these services allowing members to communicate with the 
public, we managed to save over half a million dollars by 
introducing new procedures.
<P>
	We are now looking at the whole issue of food services on the 
Hill. Many journalists wrote that taxpayers have been 
subsidizing sumptuous meals for members of Parliament. Mr. 
Speaker, you and I, as well as my colleagues and all those who 
had lunch or dinner at the parliamentary restaurant know very 
well that nothing is subsidized and that the prices we now pay 
are the same as in any establishment and are sometimes lower 
elsewhere because of competition.
<P>
	When we talk about the deficit related to food services here on 
Parliament Hill, let us not forget that we employ over 3,000 
people and, as you know full well, any employer of this size has 
a partly subsidized cafeteria or restaurant for its staff.
<P>
	We acknowledge that we have to make some cuts, that we 
have to save money. However, we also realize in this plan that as 
far as slashing expenditures is concerned, we have an obligation 
as an employer to ensure that a proper food services system is in 
place for our employees. We are in the process of finalizing our 
report. We have looked a little at what the private sector has 
done so that our system can be comparable and meet the target of 
savings in the order of $1.5 million to $2 million per year. We 
want to ensure that our employees have access to an adequate 
cafeteria at or near their place of work, as it the case everywhere 
else.
<P>
	The newspapers made quite a big fuss over the fact that our 
members had access to an exercise room and to the services of a 
masseur, all at taxpayers' expense. We also reviewed this 
expenditure. Since April 1, our members have had to pay a fee to 
use the gym. This was also something that was in the plan.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	We reviewed the matter of the barber shop and hair salon, two 
services which had also been the focus of some criticism and we 
rationalized these operations. Today, if a member or senator 
wants a haircut, he or she will pay the same price as shops 
located off the Hill charge their customers.
<P>
	The operation of messenger services was also rationalized. 
This was very important. Our aim was not to reduce service to 
members or to rationalize a service that had not proven useful in 
the past. In fact, we wanted to keep pace with new technology. 
There is fax, electronic mail and many facilities we now have as 
members that we did not have before. So in view of this, we 
rationalized our messenger service.
<P>
	We looked at the whole allocation for which we were 
criticized. Of course, the Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs studied all these issues and approved the plans. We saved 
nearly $2 million on printing the House agenda and other 
documents in order to streamline and save money, but still to 
ensure that hon. members have what they need to do their job 
and give our citizens the services to which they are entitled.
<P>
	So as I said at the beginning, this is an initial plan. I intend to 
continue and I am sure that in the weeks and months to come, 
with the co-operation of my caucus, my colleagues and the 
opposition parties on Internal Economy, we can make other 
savings and improve the operation of this House at the same 
time.
<P>
	When we said during the election campaign that we wanted to 
set an example starting with ourselves, that we wanted to regain 
credibility with Canadians, I think that we took a step in the 
right direction. We will continue as I said.
<P>
	You are signaling me that my time is up. I would again like to 
thank my caucus, my colleagues and the Prime Minister for 
letting me help reduce public spending and also improve the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5028"> 5028 </A></B>
<P>
services of this House and make it more functional and more 
credible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
evening to discuss the concurrence of the main estimates placed 
before this House.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the hon. whip on the government 
side for his fine speech and his Gagliano plan that he talked 
about. I was hoping that his Gagliano plan does not become a 
Galileo plan and they revert to star gazing rather than getting the 
job done.
<P>
	He also said that they want to give an example starting with 
themselves to demonstrate to the country that they are prepared 
to provide leadership. I cannot think of a better opportunity than 
this evening when they get the opportunity to provide leadership 
in the vote we will have later on the estimates because there are 
two things that concern us as Reformers. One is to give 
Parliament the opportunity to get back into its real role of 
passing its opinion on the estimates rather than rubber stamping 
what the government lays in front of the House.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	There are two elements that have denied Parliament the 
opportunity to fulfil its role. One is the convention of 
confidence which has prevented this House from being able to 
express its opinion on the estimates. The other is excessive party 
discipline by the government in power.
<P>
	These two elements when combined have led to the fiscal 
rubber stamping by the House of Commons once the estimates 
have been reported back to this House by the committees which 
were supposed to have examined them beforehand. I say 
supposed because quite often the committees do not even 
address the main estimates before they are tabled in the House 
and through convention and party discipline the House is forced 
to concur. Therefore it is a sham and a mockery of the role of 
Parliament to control the public purse.
<P>
	The traditional role which Canada inherited in many aspects 
and in many forms from the government and traditions of the 
British parliamentary democracy is that the Canadian House of 
Commons reviews the government's proposed expenditures. We 
inherited that tradition from the British parliamentary 
democracy. It is outlined and enshrined in the British North 
America Act, 1867.
<P>
	This theory goes back a long way and is based on certain 
principles. The crown must come to this House and request 
funds on the advice of the crown's ministers. In Canada, the 
requests originate from the Governor General on the advice of 
cabinet, which forms the government, to this House of 
Commons in the form of recommendations. As in Britain, it is 
the House of Commons which grants or denies-and let me 
emphasize or denies-the requests for funds after having 
reviewed them.
<P>
	In theory this House has the authority to grant or deny the 
elected government's request for funding of expenditures it 
wishes to make in the upcoming year. Unfortunately, as I said, 
because of the convention of confidence and excessive party 
discipline we have made a mockery and a sham of the process. It 
has been many a long year since we have seen this House 
exercise its prerogative to express its real opinion on the 
estimates laid before it.
<P>
	The record of this House in making reductions to the 
government's expenditures at this stage in the estimates process 
has been a complete and dismal failure. It is a fiscal disgrace and 
an abomination. Since 1969 the House of Commons annual 
review of the estimates has resulted in a reduction on percentage 
terms of only one-millionth of one per cent. By one-millionth 
of one per cent have we in this House reduced the estimates in 
the last 20-odd years that they have been laid before this House. 
That is an absolute disgrace and my colleagues agree with me. 
Listen to them over here.
<P>
	The last time this House exercised its prerogative was in 
1973, 21 years ago. It was a Liberal government, albeit a 
minority government, and that is when conventions of 
confidence really do matter. The government at that time, when 
confidence really did matter, allowed a reduction in the 
estimates. Ever since then Liberal governments and Tory 
governments-the only governments we have had-have 
refused to allow any further reductions in the estimates.
<P>
	Tonight the government said, and I quote the hon. government 
whip: ``Give an example starting with ourselves''. That is a 
direct quote of what he said. Now is a wonderful opportunity for 
government members to say that the convention of confidence 
and strict party discipline need not necessarily apply any more 
and this House is going to demonstrate the open government 
they so liberally campaigned upon last fall. This is their 
opportunity to realize upon that commitment they made to 
Canadians, to express the will of this House and reduce the 
estimates as laid before us.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	The amount was $20,000 out of the entire government 
expenditure which was around $60 billion at that time. The 
government cut $19,000 from the Department of Labour for an 
information program. We talk about advertising and polls today 
and I think we should cut them as well, but it cut $19,000. It cut 
$1,000 out of the salary of the president of the CBC. There must 
have been a tiff with him at that point in time. I think Reformers 
have a tiff with the CBC today and maybe we should cut more 
than $1,000 out of his salary, but we are not recommending that 
at the moment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5029"> 5029 </A></B>
<P>
	For the record, back in 1973 when the government allowed the 
estimates to be reduced, albeit by $20,000, the member for 
Shawinigan, our current Prime Minister, voted against the 
motion. He refused to allow the reduction. Here is a great 
opportunity for him to make amends by allowing this motion to 
go through this evening. The Liberal government has a great 
opportunity to change and redress the problems of history and 
the things that have gone on in the past.
<P>
	The confidence convention has traditionally been interpreted 
to mean that any motion to reduce the vote on the estimates 
would be viewed as a test of the confidence of this House in the 
government. We are saying that if there is a reduction in the 
estimates the government need not necessarily have to resign. 
We are not going to go that far.
<P>
	The confidence convention reinforced by excessive party 
discipline leads to fiscal rubber stamping and fiscal 
irresponsibility by the House of Commons and the committees 
when it considers the estimates at this stage. The result has been 
an extremely modest reduction since 1973, as I said, 
one-millionth of one per cent.
<P>
	We would like to see that changed. The negative implications 
of those two things have contributed to the fact that we are now 
$500 billion in debt. This House has never been able to express 
its real opinion as we rack up $40 billion deficits every year. 
This year is going to be no exception.
<P>
	We have never been able to express our opinion on the lavish 
and excessive government spending which has gone on unabated 
now for over 20 years since we last had a balanced budget. Why? 
Because there has been no genuine parliamentary safeguard on 
government spending and there has been insufficient scrutiny by 
this House on these changes. Change and reform are required 
and are long overdue.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party has offered an alternative. There 
has been a longstanding Reform policy that says we want to 
modernize the confidence convention. We are saying to allow 
this House to express its will freely and democratically on the 
estimates. If there are reductions, then let there be a motion after 
it has all been debated and voted upon. If reductions are 
approved then let a motion of confidence be placed in this 
House. If that is approved as well then the government knows it 
still enjoys the confidence of this House and can continue to 
govern.
<P>
	These are the things we are talking about as Reformers 
bringing a fresh new face to Parliament, a new opportunity to do 
things so much better. For the government whip who said earlier 
to give them an opportunity to show they are prepared to make 
an example of the government, here is a great opportunity for 
them to start now by allowing the reductions.
<P>
	We are talking about a reduction in money spent by the Board 
of Internal Economy. The main estimates according to the 
President of the Treasury Board indicate they are going to spend 
$164,985,000 in the administration of the House of Commons.
<P>
	The government whip has told us of his plan which has 
already led to specific reductions in this fiscal year of over 
$2 million. We are saying to this government, since that amount 
has already been reduced and eliminated from spending by this 
government in this year, which was acknowledged by the 
previous speaker, then surely it is not a threat to the convention 
of confidence that we amend the main estimates to reflect the 
new reality.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	The point we want to make is that these reductions are already 
in place. They have been approved. The government whip has 
acknowledged that point in his plan. We are saying there is no 
threat of confidence by recognizing that and putting them back 
and changing the main estimates to reflect the reality.
<P>
	We will be talking on other motions about minuscule amounts 
like $20,000. Out of the total expenditure of $163.6 billion this 
government is going to spend this year, what is $20,000? Is 
$20,000 a threat to convention? Does the member think the 
government is going to fall on that? No. That is the point I want 
to make.
<P>
	Another point is the Liberal platform that cuts the grants and 
subsidies. We are concurring with that point because we also 
believe in cuts to grants and subsidies. We knocked 5 per cent off 
that as well.
<P>
	There are three great opportunities where those members can 
concur without any threat whatsoever to them and to their 
government by acknowledging that a cut has already been made. 
The main estimates should be amended to reflect that reality. 
The minuscule amount of $20,000 based on all the inflation 
caused by the Liberal government in its past life and the Tory 
government is not what it used to be. It is worth a lot less than in 
1973. How on earth could that affect the confidence this House 
would express in the government?
<P>
	Liberal policies say cuts to grants and subsidies. We concur so 
let us just do it. That is all we ask. That is the point. My 
challenge to the government and to all members on the other 
side of the House is to recognize what they have been saying 
which was reiterated by the government whip: ``Give an 
example starting with ourselves''. A direct quote of five minutes 
ago.
<P>
	Here is a great opportunity to do so. I challenge government 
members to stand up later this evening and vote according with 
what they have said in the red book and in accordance with the 
platform on which they were elected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5030"> 5030 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to thank the hon. member for his good comments about me, 
but I regret he is turning this debate into something it is not. We 
are debating budgets and not free votes or recalls. I am sure the 
hon. member knows that.
<P>
	Yes, I said that the plan of reducing the expense is in effect. It 
was announced in January. The board took a decision on the 
global plan. Some decisions were taken on individual items and 
some are already in effect. Some are entering, for example, the 
July 1 householder. The restaurant section has not been decided 
on.
<P>
	I said at the beginning that we had to adopt a budget. We had a 
deadline to prepare a detailed budget of expenses that the 
government wanted to introduce and have passed by the House 
according to the rules. There is nothing wrong. Next year we 
would show a reduction in expenses instead of what the member 
is proposing.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	If I am correct, he is proposing to reduce the budget expense 
by $2.471 million. The difference between the member and I is 
that everything we accept is detailed. I do not know what he is 
counting in the $2.471 million. He should tell the House which 
items they are because the motion is on the House budget. He 
should do a service and tell us about them.
<P>
	I thank all my colleagues in the 35th Parliament. We started in 
good will and displayed good decorum. We have done very well 
so far. However I do not think this is a case for a free vote. In an 
administrative way we do not know the exact effect of the plan I 
announced on a yearly basis. For this fiscal year, and being the 
author of the plan, I do not know exactly how much it will reduce 
this budget.
<P>
	The member says that we should reduce it by $2.471 million. 
He should start by giving us the details. Did he check the figures 
with members of the administration? We enact policies but on a 
daily basis they keep the books.
<P>
	From the beginning I have approached this issue on a 
non-partisan basis. If the member checks with his colleagues on 
the Board of Internal Economy who have been working with me 
on the matter, I am sure he will concur. The purpose here is not 
for each party to make political points. It is to make sure we save 
money for Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the question. 
The member sits on the Board of Internal Economy and tells us 
that he has a plan.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a secretive board that nobody can get 
into.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> ``It is a secretive board that nobody can get 
into'', according to my colleague. The Reform member who sits 
on the board advised me that certain savings have been 
introduced, passed and are being  implemented at this time. This 
year there will be a savings of that amount of money.
<P>
	The point I made during my speech was that it was a 
confidence convention. I never mentioned a free vote. I am just 
saying that we should allow the House to recognize that savings 
have already been approved by the Board of Internal Economy 
in the amount of $2.4 million. Why do we not collectively 
recognize that already exists and change the main estimates to 
reflect the new reality?
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board comes into the House any 
time he exceeds a budget and asks for more money. All I am 
saying is that now we recognize the Treasury Board is not going 
to be spending the money, let us make that recognition in the 
House. That is the point I am trying to make today.
<P>
	I know the government whip concurs with our idea of saving 
money. They have gone along and made these changes. Let us 
recognize that and change the estimates now to reflect that.
<P>
	What signal are we sending to other departments to save 
money if we say that we do not care if they save money, that they 
have been allocated money and we are not going to change it, 
that we are not going to take it back from them, that they can go 
ahead and spend it anyway? This is a great opportunity for them 
to reduce the estimates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask a question of the member who tells us to 
reduce the budget by this amount.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	Does he have a list to prove what he is saying now, that it is in 
fact the amount of savings realized by the government whip's 
plan? Or, is it not true that those figures are concocted and he has 
no idea what the savings are? If it is true that he has such savings 
in mind with a detailed list, I say to the hon. member that I am 
ready to give him unanimous consent to table the list now. If he 
does not have such a list, why does he not just withdraw the item 
from the Order Paper?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a list in my office. I do not 
have it in front of me at the moment. I was advised by our 
member who sits on the Board of Internal Economy, although it 
is a secretive board and we do not know what really goes on 
there until the minutes are tabled long afterward, that these 
payments-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That is 
an unfair statement about the board because it has passed a 
policy wherein the minutes are tabled once they are approved. In 
the past few months we have been tabling minutes in the House 
every two weeks because the board meets every two weeks. 
Before the member makes such a statement he should check his 
facts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5031"> 5031 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must inform the 
government whip that I do not believe that is a point of order. 
Certainly as we all know there is representation from the various 
official parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, my point is that our 
representative on the board has assured us of these savings. The 
cuts are effective for this particular year. Therefore we are 
asking the House to recognize the savings and amend the 
estimates accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a quick comment that has more to do with the member's 
remarks on the question of party discipline and the question of 
confidence.
<P>
	I would like to say to him as a member of the Reform Party 
that members of the Reform caucus should be careful not to 
think that this kind of debate about free votes, party discipline 
and the confidence convention came to the House with them.
<P>
	I recommend the member read the McGrath committee report 
on parliamentary reform tabled in the House in 1985. It was an 
all-party report, headed by Jim McGrath, a former long time 
Conservative member and then lieutenant-governor of 
Newfoundland. I was a member of that committee in which it 
was said that the Canadian parliamentary system was far too 
dominated by party discipline, that there needed to be a broader 
range of issues on which members of all parties felt free to vote 
as individuals rather than as party members.
<P>
	I made my first speech calling for more free votes in the 
House in 1981. By way of advocating a little humility, I just say 
there were people advocating this kind of flexibility in the 
House of Commons before those guys came along. If the 
member wants to read the McGrath report, I would recommend 
it to him.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret the member's 
time for questions and comments has elapsed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
today to speak about the main estimates for budget year 
1994-95.
<P>
	These estimates represent the fulfilment of the government's 
commitments to Canadians. They also represent a balanced 
approach to promoting economic growth in jobs while taking 
steps to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	These estimates reflect the fact that there are no quick and 
easy solutions to the financial issues which confront Canada. It 
is essential that Canadians understand this in order that they 
may be able to make with us the difficult choices which lie 
ahead. I am therefore pleased to have the opportunity to talk 
about some of the highlights and significance of these estimates.
<P>
	First it is important to set these estimates in the context of the 
government's fiscal plan. When the minister tabled his budget in 
February of this year he said that it represented the first stage of 
a two-stage budget. That budget has set the country on the road 
to economic recovery, but there is still a great deal of work now 
being done to prepare for the second stage of the budget.
<P>
	As we promised, the government has launched a number of 
initiatives and reviews which will enable us to accelerate our 
progress down that road to economic recovery.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important that the government take action but it is also 
important that the government take the time to take the right 
action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, the President of the Queen's Privy Council and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal is reviewing 
the programs of every department. He is also reviewing the 
structure of every commission and federal organization. 
Moreover, he is co-operating with the provinces to find ways to 
reduce overlapping and duplication. These measures will ensure 
more efficient and affordable government services to 
Canadians.
<P>
	As for the Minister of Human Resources Development, he is 
currently conducting the most comprehensive review of the 
social security system in Canada since that program was put in 
place. It should be clear to everyone that the government intends 
to do what is necessary, and to do it in a responsible way, from a 
financial point of view. The results of these reviews and other 
initiatives will be made public as early as this fall, so that they 
can be discussed in the most open budget process ever put in 
place by a government.
<P>
	Canadians will have a say in the critical decisions which will 
have to be made. At that point, we will have reached the second 
stage of the budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the President of the Treasury Board said in the House when 
the main estimates were tabled in February, the estimates set out 
the details of $160.7 billion in planned expenditure for this 
fiscal year. Overall program spending, which is total spending 
less debt service charges, is increased by just 0.7 per cent.
<P>
	Spending on most government programs has been reduced. 
The operating budgets of government departments have been 
reduced by $400 million, with further reductions of 
$600 million to come in the next two years. Defence cuts total 
$745 million this year alone, with more to come. Grants and 
subsidies to business have been substantially reduced. The 
government has frozen the wages of public servants for a further 
two years. This action has reduced the cost of providing 
necessary services 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5032"> 5032 </A></B>
<P>
while making it possible to  protect jobs and meet job security 
commitments to our employees.
<P>
	At the same time as taking these necessary reduction 
measures, the estimates provide for $700 million for the 
implementation of the national infrastructure program. This is a 
key element in fulfilling our red book commitment to create 
jobs. We know there are two sides to the ledger. There is the 
expenditure side and there is the revenue side. With so many 
Canadians out of work the revenue side of our ledger book is not 
in good shape either. We are paying attention to both sides of the 
ledger book.
<P>
	It was the Prime Minister who launched the infrastructure 
program in his December 1993 meeting with the premiers. 
Within eight weeks agreements had been signed with every one 
of the provinces in Canada. In spite of those who said it could 
not be done, a three-level program was put together in a matter 
of weeks. The municipalities have found the money to 
participate and all three levels of government are working 
co-operatively.
<P>
	Furthermore the federal government came up with its 
$2 billion share of the program without increasing the deficit. 
As we promised, funds were reallocated from other less 
productive, less high priority federal programs.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to say that we expect 80 per cent of the 
project funding will go toward core infrastructure such as water 
and sewer systems, roads and bridges. We are committed to 
funding projects with the municipalities that are their priority. 
Some of these projects are non-traditional but nevertheless are 
innovative and worthwhile.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	When the budget discussions take place this fall it is 
important that Canadians understand where their tax dollars go, 
what benefits and services are provided and who receives them. 
It is important because I believe that many Canadians have been 
given the impression that with a few minor changes here and 
there, a bit of tinkering we could balance the budget and live 
happily ever after and nobody would be hurt.
<P>
	This is nothing but a fairy tale. We can and we will return to 
full economic health but difficult choices lie ahead and making 
the right choices requires that the public be fully informed and 
involved.
<P>
	When the main estimates were tabled in the House in 
February both official parties in opposition predictably 
expressed their disappointment and claimed that the budget did 
not go far enough to eliminate waste in government.
<P>
	We recognize that we must constantly find more efficient 
ways of delivering services to Canadians and we are doing that. 
The Treasury Board secretariat is pursuing a variety of 
initiatives to improve efficiency, including a number which take 
advantage of the exciting potential of new information 
technology. These  initiatives promote responsive and 
affordable government services.
<P>
	In one of many examples 18 government departments are 
together establishing 10 Canada business service centres, many 
of them with the participation of the provinces and local 
authorities. These centres reduce complexity and overlap for 
business clients and provide one stop shopping with no increase 
in costs.
<P>
	A wide variety of initiatives to improve service and reduce 
costs is described in part I of the estimates. It makes good 
reading for those want a current picture of what the government 
is really doing to improve efficiency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I certainly recognize that, in a parliamentary system, the role 
of the opposition is to oppose government's measures. 
Moreover, it may be that the two sides truly disagree as to which 
policies would best serve our country. However, we are not 
doing Canadians a service by implying that the deficit could be 
reduced overnight if only someone had the courage to take the 
bull by the horns.
<P>
	Last February, the hon. member for La Prairie said that there 
was some fat and some waste in the government operations, and 
that billions of dollars could be saved if only the government 
eliminated waste and poor management practices. The fact is 
that if these simple measures were enough to solve the problem, 
we would already have taken them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the main estimates show, the cost of operating the entire 
Government of Canada, excluding defence, is just 12 per cent of 
the total expenditures of $160.7 billion, about $19 billion. If the 
government were to shut down all of its operations, cancel every 
one of its programs, fire every one of its employees, there would 
still be a deficit of more than $20 billion.
<P>
	There would be no food inspectors of course, no air traffic 
controllers, no prison guards, no scientists working for 
Canadians in the fields of health and the environment, and no tax 
collectors either. Some of us might like that, but then the deficit 
would be even higher. That there would still be a deficit without 
any government operation assumes of course that there would be 
somebody to write cheques for the other 88 per cent of 
government expenditures.
<P>
	The other levels of government receive transfer payments of 
almost $29 billion, most of it going to health care, to social 
services, to post-secondary education and the equalization 
payments which ensure that from coast to coast to coast in this 
country the less wealthy provinces have an opportunity to 
provide comparable services to their citizens.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5033"> 5033 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1950 ) </B>
<P>
	There is another $20 billion that the Minister of Finance 
perhaps would need some help in writing cheques for if we had 
no public service, no government operations; $20 million to 
Canadian seniors for old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement as well as another $19 billion to the unemployed.
<P>
	Perhaps people who complain about fat and waste could tell 
us how we can possibly solve the deficit problem by getting rid 
of the government.
<P>
	Canada has just recently been rated by the United Nations 
once again as the best place in the world to live. This is 
something all Canadians should be proud of. It has not happened 
by accident. It has not been achieved without a cost either. We 
have been borrowing to finance our programs, programs which 
many Canadians have come to view as a right of citizenship.
<P>
	The public accounts of Canada show that in the 10 years from 
1984 to March 1993 the debt of the federal government has more 
than doubled to just over $500 billion. As a result this year's 
main estimates provide for interest charges of $41 billion or 
25 per cent of the budget on that debt.
<P>
	If we add another $11 billion for defence and $5 billion for 
crown corporations we begin to get a picture of where the money 
goes. We spend money on what Canadians want and need and 
that is what these estimates are all about. That is also why we 
have a deficit.
<P>
	Part I of the estimates provides a comprehensive overview of 
the government's expenditure plans. I recommend it to all 
Canadians who want to know how their money is spent. I 
recommend it to all Canadians who want to participate in a 
meaningful and positive way in the budget consultations that 
will take place this fall.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So it is not being honest to tell taxpayers that we only need to 
cut some fat to alleviate the tax burden, or that it is possible to 
significantly reduce spending with no one feeling any real 
adverse effect.
<P>
	To try to make Canadians believe that there is a quick fix and 
that the government is not prepared or able to apply it, 
undermines the confidence of Canadians in their democratic 
institution. When they hear about these so-called quick and 
simple solutions, Canadians are less apt to realize that some 
hard and vital decisions must be made.
<P>
	My comments may sound somewhat like propaganda, but I 
want to tell this House that the government intends to ask 
members from all parties, as well as the general public, to 
participate in a comprehensive discussion on the importance of 
the budget. To that end, we must question the very nature of 
government spending. I would like to conclude, for the benefit 
of those who might still be sceptical, by referring to some 
comments made by the Auditor General.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his 1991 annual report the Auditor General said that he had 
an impression that a dedicated, competent public service is 
dealing with complex problems that have developed over the 
years. He also stated: ``The deficit is not a result of bureaucrats 
burning the taxpayers' money but rather the reasons for the 
deficit are profound, complex and difficult to solve. I sense that 
there are few easy fixes''.
<P>
	In his 1992 report he went on to say that the reality is that 
governments alone do not create deficits. International forces 
beyond our control and the needs and demands of the electorate 
also contribute to deficits.
<P>
	I would like to conclude with a final piece of advice from our 
Auditor General also from the 1992 report: ``There is a need 
today for full and frank discussion about deficit, debts and 
related public policy choices''.
<P>
<B>(1955 ) </B>
<P>
	I invite members of the House today to begin that frank, 
honest, open discussion and I assure Canadians that this 
government will give them the opportunity to be part of that 
debate as well, well before the budget for 1985-96 is prepared, 
well before the tabling of the next version of these estimates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
a couple of comments.
<P>
	We all realize that to eliminate the deficit like that is an 
impossibility. One does not have to have the brains of a rocket 
scientist to figure that one out. However, what puzzles me is 
when we hear the rhetoric from that side of the House. Surely we 
are not ready to give up prison guards, food inspectors, air 
traffic controllers. We know the difference between essentials 
and waste.
<P>
	However, how come when we hear speakers from that side of 
the House we do not hear such things as contributions to MP 
pensions which are somewhere in the neighbourhood of 
$17 million per year? How come we do not hear about 
Challen-ger jets that ought to be gone? How about blue 
limousines that we could do without? How about free residences 
and all the other things of that nature that amount to several 
millions of dollars? Why do we not ever hear that?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know if the member 
came in late, if he was not listening, if he was too busy talking to 
his colleagues over in the corner or if he has not read the 
estimates that he is now preparing to vote on later this evening. 
Had he and had he been listening since he walked into this House 
in January he would have seen our government tackling virtually 
every one of the issues he just mentioned and many more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5034"> 5034 </A></B>
<P>
	We are not looking at saving money by the millions. We have 
looked at saving money by the billions. The member really 
should know that if he has been paying attention. I do not know 
if he is attempting to mislead people. He knows very well that 
the matter of MPs' pensions is in the hands of a commission 
established specifically by law after every election for that 
purpose and that report will be coming back and we will be 
taking action on that report.
<P>
	He also knows perfectly well that I said very clearly that the 
finance minister in tabling his budget said this is a two-stage 
budget. This is step one. We have done more cutting in this 
budget than in previous budgets. We have also closed some tax 
loopholes and he knows that very well. We paid attention to that 
side of the ledger as well by making sure that there is some 
increase in revenue and that tax breaks that certain people were 
getting are no longer there. However, we have done five times 
more in cutting expenses than we have increasing revenues 
through closing those tax loopholes.
<P>
	The member knows perfectly well that these estimates on 
which he is voting today represent billions of dollars of cuts in 
government expenditures. I think he should be saying that 
honestly to the Canadians who are listening to us tonight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a very brief 
comment.
<P>
	I think we are making some progress in this House. I noticed 
the hon. member has recycled very large portions of a speech 
that I heard the member for Calgary Southwest giving about a 
year ago with the respect to the fact that of course you cannot 
balance the budget by tinkering, of course you cannot balance it 
merely by cutting fat. We know that. We still would like to see 
some cuts but the bottom line, as members will see, in our zero 
in three plan with which I hope members are familiar is that if 
one is ever going to get the finances of this country under 
control, deep substantive cuts have to be made.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall: </B>Mr. Speaker, I notice the Reform members 
always get up and say that without ever saying where they are 
going to cut or who they are going to hurt.
<P>
	We know perfectly well in the analysis of their three-year 
deficit reduction plan that it tabled during the election campaign 
that that could not be done without hurting 1.5 million children 
in this country who live in poverty, without hurting senior 
citizens who depend on their pensions, without hurting single 
parents, two-thirds of whom live in poverty with their children. 
Their plan was not realistic. Their plan would have destroyed 
the social fabric of this country. Their plan would have 
destroyed any sense of justice in this country.
<P>
	The member opposite has said there were not cuts. From the 
moment our government took office we have been reducing 
unnecessary expenditures. The Prime Minister was the first to 
set an example by getting rid of his limousine. Members know 
the actions that have been taken to cut the use of-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, gee.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Good.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry but this is ridiculous. I 
am saying to Canadians that we have done exactly what the 
Reform Party is telling us we should do and those members are 
sitting there saying ``ah, gosh, gee''. Members cannot have it 
both ways.
<P>
	Do they want these cuts made or do they not want these cuts 
made? When these cuts are made, they should be giving credit. 
We started at the very top with our Prime Minister, then with 
reducing the number of cabinet ministers, with reducing the 
budgets that those cabinet ministers have to operate on, and with 
reducing our own expenditures here in this House of Commons 
because we know that Canadians are counting on us to set the 
example. We are doing that.
<P>
	To suggest that we are tabling estimates that do not include 
several billion dollars in cuts is simply not accurate or quite 
honest.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Questions or comments? 
Resuming debate. I am waiting to recognize someone who wants 
to speak on this motion. The hon. member for Kenora-Rainy 
River.
<P>
	Let me see if I can be of some help to my colleagues in the 
House. When we began the debate on the motion, we began with 
the government whip. We recognized people from other parties 
and then came back. In this instance as we continue this debate, 
the last spokesperson being the parliamentary secretary, I did 
look to see if there was a member from the Official Opposition 
who wanted to speak. Not having taken notice, I then looked to 
this side of the House, the government side. I recognized the 
member for Kenora-Rainy River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I suggest to my colleagues across the way that I was not trying to 
jump in front of them as far as the speaking order of the House.
<P>
	As my colleague from Beaver River would know, having sat 
beside her for a number of months in the last Parliament, this 
member would not at all be interested in doing that sort of thing.
<P>
	Tonight I would like to talk about issues that are very close to 
my heart as they relate to the estimates. Those who have had the 
opportunity to spend some time with the member for 
Kenora-Rainy River know that my interests are the interests of 
a very large rural riding. In that large rural riding there are some 
issues that I think need to be discussed in this place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5035"> 5035 </A></B>
<P>
	Those issues of course are the issues of what northwestern 
Ontario is all about. That basically is forestry, mining, tourism 
and a small amount of manufacturing along with the retail 
sector.
<P>
	Like the rest of Canada, my riding is dependent on a very 
small business sector to create and maintain valuable jobs. The 
small businesses in Kenora-Rainy River can be found 
servicing, complementing and drawing on the strengths of major 
resource sectors. The viability of small and medium sized 
businesses in my riding is typical of the diversity needed to 
build secondary industries in Canada.
<P>
	There is no doubt that main estimates' spending in 1994-95 in 
the federal budget is geared to reinforcing a solid small business 
sector to create jobs and spark the economy. It is because of the 
dependence on small business that I am pleased to see the 
initiatives in the 1994-95 budget addressing stability and 
growth for small business.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	As I have said before, as a member of the opposition in this 
House in the previous Parliament, one of the major concerns that 
I focused on was the lack of initiative for small business, the 
lack of help that we as parliamentarians gave to the small 
business sector.
<P>
	In Canada we must ensure sustainable and viable resource 
based industries are supported. But in order to build an 
economic foundation for the long term we must diversify our 
economy to take advantage of our raw materials and our 
technological development. Perhaps nowhere in Canada is that 
more evident than in northwestern Ontario where diversification 
and secondary industry development are the keys to opening 
tomorrow's doors.
<P>
	The small business working groups recently established by 
this government are examining the initiatives needed to foster 
an environment for growth and give business the tools to 
expand.
<P>
	I am happy to see that the government is making access to 
capital and appropriate training a priority for the small business 
sector. I have risen in this House on previous occasions and 
lamented on the sad state of the relationship between small 
businesses and the financial institutions.
<P>
	I sincerely hope a new code of conduct between small 
businesses and banks provides a more fruitful relationship than 
we have seen in the past. Entrepreneurs need capital investment 
in order to expand and start up new ventures which provide the 
jobs this country is looking for. Expansion of the Small 
Businesses Loans Act will also enhance the flow of capital to 
legitimate business operations in Canada.
<P>
	Small business also needs the expertise to explore export 
markets and utilize new technology. The budget speaks well to 
these concerns. The Canada investment fund for example will 
help companies access leading edge technology. As well, the 
business centres will help make information on government 
programs and services more readily available as well as 
providing insight into strategies for exploiting export markets.
<P>
	The remote locations of many businesses in Canada have 
historically made it difficult to access pertinent information. 
Federal government spending on information services will give 
these businesses the knowledge they need to explore new 
technology and make inroads into international markets.
<P>
	I am anxious to work with the business community in 
developing this government's objectives. Believe me, we have 
many ambitious and capable entrepreneurs in Kenora-Rainy 
River if only given half a chance simply by doing very key and 
very elementary things.
<P>
	Let me give a couple of examples of those. One of those of 
course is replacing the GST. Reducing red tape and the burden 
that is on small business as it relates to red tape and harmonizing 
federal and provincial regulations are just some of the things 
that I find to be extremely important to creating the right 
environment for our business sector to flourish.
<P>
	Such federal initiatives are a breath of fresh air to our small 
business community and something that I wait anxiously for in 
order that we can start creating the jobs. The small business 
sector is the key and what we as parliamentarians should not lose 
sight of if we are to see this economy start to grow.
<P>
	Other measures such as changes to the social security system 
and new job training strategies for young people are essential to 
changing the fundamental structures in this country that will 
help lead the way to practical training for people entering our 
workforce. An expanding small and medium sized business 
sector needs a talented and appropriately trained workforce.
<P>
	I am confident federal spending on innovative training 
programs will help accommodate this objective.
<P>
	Realistic job oriented training, better financial, technological 
and information resources for small business are essential to 
building a strong economy in my region and across the country. 
However, to take advantage of these enhanced resources for 
small business my region in particular needs the very basic of 
infrastructure networks.
<P>
	I feel we are on the right track with spending on the 
infrastructure projects. Not only are we creating jobs to 
jump-start the economy, small that it is, we are also providing 
the basic foundation for a competitive national economy. Basic 
infrastructure involves roads, buildings, transportation and 
water and sewer services.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5036"> 5036 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	I invite the members of this House to come and visit 
northwestern Ontario. Members will truly be impressed with the 
beauty of our natural surroundings, our forests, lakes and our 
famous sunsets. I am sure they will enjoy their visit. I am also 
sure that discerning individuals with attention to economic 
development will witness certain inadequacies in infrastructure.
<P>
	They will see that our highways still need improvements. 
Some members will be dissatisfied that they cannot travel to 
certain areas simply because there are no roads at all. Some 
members will see and be surprised that growing municipalities 
do not have adequate sewer and water treatment facilities. One 
or two visits to First Nations communities will likely leave 
members disenchanted with current conditions.
<P>
	The federal infrastructure works program speaks to these 
conditions. But I emphasize that northwestern Ontario and other 
regions in Canada need improved infrastructure. The north, 
remote areas of my riding such as First Nations communities, 
require basic infrastructure such as roads to open up economic 
opportunities. A road network where there is currently nothing 
will create the opportunities for trade within the region as a 
starting block.
<P>
	Further road links such as the highway I have talked about in 
this House on many occasions from Red Lake in my riding to 
Winnipeg, which I have been requesting for some time and more 
reasonable air transportation connections, will then lead to 
enhanced trade outside of the region.
<P>
	This trade will not only be in goods and commodities but also 
people themselves. Although tourism is a strong component of 
economic development in my riding there remains many 
untapped opportunities mainly because of poor transportation 
infrastructure.
<P>
	Finally, I return to where I started, the resource sector. First I 
would like to comment on the mining industry which as most 
people are aware is a struggling industry in Canada. It is 
encouraging that the federal budget makes contributions to trust 
funds for mine reclamation tax deductible. This deduction will 
help mining companies utilize cash flow for other operating 
costs as well as making it convenient to ensure mine sites are 
rehabilitated after operations cease.
<P>
	Certainly market trends have not been favourable recently for 
the mining sector in Canada. That is why it is all the more 
important for this government to seriously consider tax 
incentives or other measures to help stimulate mining activity. 
We need to encourage grassroots exploration and investment in 
Canadian based mineral companies.
<P>
	I understand the Minister of Finance is open to the concept of 
mining incentives and I look forward to contributing to the 
process of renewing this policy.
<P>
	Furthermore, I acknowledge that environmental guidelines 
for the mining industry are necessary and it is our responsibility 
to protect the environment. However, the procedures in place are 
convoluted and confusing, resulting in unnecessary delays to 
legitimate mine start-ups. As a result we are losing mineral 
investment dollars to foreign nations.
<P>
	We must stop this leakage and support mining projects in 
Canada by established, concise and efficient environmental 
assessment procedures. We can protect the environment and 
ensure mining operations are safe without frightening away 
investment due to red tape and uncertainty from within the 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	I can say from talking to the Minister of the Environment and 
the understanding that I have within the government that we are 
now in the process of dealing with that very difficult and 
complex issue of duplication of environmental policy across the 
country. I hope to be able to stand up here very soon and share in 
the announcement of this government that we now have one 
process for mines, one process for forestry, one process for 
Canadians as it relates to the environmental assessment process 
and not have to spin our wheels going from one department to 
the next, municipal, provincial, federal and God only knows 
wherever else we have to go before we can get economic 
development within our regions.
<P>
	Second, I would like to directly address the forest industry in 
Canada which is by far the primary economic activity in my 
riding. The federal government as we all know does not have 
direct jurisdiction over forestry practices. The federal 
government instead contributes to research and scientific 
development through federal-provincial forestry development 
agreements.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	I feel it is the federal government's responsibility and should 
remain an eminent priority to lend as much support as possible 
to the development of sustainable forestry practices. A viable 
and environmentally responsible forestry sector will provide a 
launching board for the growth of diversified businesses in 
northwestern Ontario and other forestry regions.
<P>
	In the estimates there are many things involved, as I have 
talked about, relating to forestry and mining. It is so obvious to 
those of us who have been around this House for awhile, the 
opposition, where I was before this Parliament, that it is very 
easy to stand up and pick one or two issues to criticize the 
government on. I hope the members opposite get the opportunity 
to be on the government side, as some of them have. It would be 
of benefit to not hold their breath, but if in fact it were their wish 
to get the opportunity to create policy they would look at 
initiatives like this in a very favourable light as I have.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5037"> 5037 </A></B>
<P>
	Coming from a region that is one-fifth of Ontario, almost the 
size of the Atlantic provinces put together, that fits in my riding, 
people have to understand that there is tremendous potential for 
economic growth given the right kind of policies. These are the 
policies that I am trying to relate tonight.
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying that there are many decisions 
reflected in the budget estimates which hold promise for me and 
a renewed and vibrant future within the small business 
community which I talked about extensively in my speech.
<P>
	Although I have expressed concerns for northern 
infrastructure and certain resource sectors, I want to stress 
again, as I have said to my colleagues opposite, that I am 
confident that if this government does not do what the previous 
government did, and that is lose its way and forget why we are 
here and why the people put us here, we will put the kind of 
policies in place that even the members opposite will cheer.
<P>
	I know the member for Beaver River will stand up and cheer 
with me as she has done on numerous occasion when we were in 
opposition and did get our way on occasion.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, now that 
my name has been mentioned I feel I should stand up and say 
something.
<P>
	I do appreciate the hon. member's comments. I realize what a 
huge geographic area he has to represent. He is quite right when 
he states that we did sit together for some months or even years I 
think at the beginning of the last Parliament, and I did appreciate 
that.
<P>
	I want to address a couple of things which he talked about. We 
in the Reform Party caucus said that we have one or two areas 
that we want to cut. Let me make it very plain that we would only 
start with one or two areas. There are dozens and dozens of areas 
in all of these main estimates that need to be cut; not just that it 
is a good idea, but it is absolutely necessary. Only then will 
forestry, mines and all these other things be able to take first 
place, as they should.
<P>
	However, if there is no money left in the federal coffers then 
there is going to be nothing to help out any sort of social 
programs that the member needs in his area. We know that there 
are certain things absolutely necessary there.
<P>
	If we focus on one part of the red book and not on the other 
part of the red book in which he refers to and the Liberals always 
refer to the fact that we need to cut spending to make sure that 
there is money available, we are not just talking about one or two 
areas that we need to cut but dozens and dozens in order to save 
those social nets and in order to make sure that programs and 
policies in his constituency are going to go ahead.
<P>
	With the debt rate going up at an incredible rate of thousands 
and thousands of dollars every minute that will do more to harm 
any social programs or any forestry or mines or infrastructure 
programs that are going on his riding. Perhaps he could respond 
to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am much better in debate than I am 
at making speeches. I appreciate that the member would entice 
me to get involved in the debate.
<P>
	One of the things that concerns me about the Reform Party's 
continued approach of the zero in three, which was part of its 
main plank in its campaign, that it could reduce the deficit in 
three years, is the fact that Canadians did not believe it.
<P>
<B>(2020 ) </B>
<P>
	If in fact they did believe the Reform Party, it would be sitting 
over here and I would be sitting over there. Let us face it, there 
are times when members in the opposition, when members of 
Parliament continue to suggest things that may appear to be a 
good political tool to get governments to react to certain issues. 
We lay down the facts and give the numbers as the Reform has 
done. I am one of those who has read the direction you would 
like to go as far as reducing the deficit in three years.
<P>
	For example, if it reduced $20 billion, which is what it 
suggested roughly during the campaign, if you take the very 
conservative estimate of a reduction of a billion in an export 
economy, a billion dollars relates to 15,000 jobs of reduced 
activity per billion. It does not take a rocket scientist, as has 
been mentioned on the opposite side, to figure out how many 
jobs would be lost if we reduced that quickly out of an economy 
that is used to having $20 billion creating economic activity.
<P>
	What I am suggesting is that we would not have 11 per cent 
unemployment, we would probably have somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of 17, 18 per cent unemployment.
<P>
	I am a history buff and my colleague who sits on the 
committee opposite me will know that in the thirties there was a 
Conservative by the name of Bennett who tried the same thing, 
who used the approach that the quicker you slash everything the 
quicker you will get more economic activity. He drove the 
economy of Canada right into the ground completely within a 
period of three or four years. He said: ``It is an international 
recession, we cannot do anything about it''.
<P>
	My understanding, and the history books will prove this, is 
that as soon as the Liberal government came back in after Mr. 
Bennett and reversed those programs, the economy took off and 
we started to make money again, people started to pay taxes and 
we started to pay our debt off.
<P>
	That is the only issue that I am relating to members on the 
opposite side. People do not believe that if you were in govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5038"> 5038 </A></B>
<P>
ment you could reduce this massive deficit that  we inherited in 
three years. You should stop kidding yourselves about that.
<P>
	The issue is we believe that a balanced approach is a better 
approach. We were elected on that platform. We are going to 
reduce the deficit. We are going to make some very tough 
choices. I want to suggest to the member from Beaver River, if I 
am mistaken, and I would hope that my colleagues will back me 
up, you will be one of those who will be very happy to see the 
next budget in February of next year when we will be making 
more severe cuts to make sure that when we get our fiscal house 
in order it is done in a very balanced and structured way.
<P>
	That is why you have to negotiate with the provinces and not 
do as our friend Brian Mulroney did and say to the provinces it 
really does not matter what they think, this is what we are going 
to do. We know how many seats the Conservatives have.
<P>
	The opposition members should stop suggesting to Canadians 
that the zero in three is the way to go, because it is not. Nobody 
believes it. As a member I know that it will not work and they 
should revamp that strategy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was interested in hearing the hon. member for 
Kenora-Rainy River attempting math. Math is a very precise 
science and I know that our zero in three got us from one to 52. 
That was in five years, but give us another four years and there 
may be very few opposition members in this House when the 
Reform Party forms the government.
<P>
	It is interesting that the hon. member's own finance minister 
indicated that by reducing unemployment insurance premiums, 
a type of tax, jobs would be created. How can the hon. member 
then suggest that by cutting government spending we would be 
reducing jobs rather than creating jobs? He is not exactly lining 
up with some of the logic or the math of his finance minister.
<P>
	I have a young family and I am quite concerned about taking 
this national credit card that we have and continually running up 
a debt, year after year, deficit after deficit, to the point at which 
we are over half a trillion dollars in debt, and then at the end of 
my life presenting that credit card to my kids and asking them to 
pay it off.
<P>
<B>(2025 ) </B>
<P>
	I notice that the hon. member is approximately the same age 
as I am. I expect that he either has some similar concerns or 
knows friends who have similar concerns. I wonder how he can 
justify running up this debt for his children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is somewhat of an insult since I 
am much younger than the member who just spoke.
<P>
	My family is so young, not even a year old. During the 
campaign I ran against a Reformer and it was a very enjoyable 
experience, I might add. One of the things that gentleman said 
over and over again is that government is wasteful and we have 
to clean up the government and make sure that we tune it in 
right.
<P>
	We know in this place, because we see the expenditures, that 
total government operations, everything that we do from RCMP 
to buildings we own across the country, are $20 billion. The fact 
remains that we could shut the whole government down. The 
member talks about selling the odd jet and doing this and that.
<P>
	This government is talking about a fundamental restructuring 
of the economy, fundamental changes in the right direction, not 
tinkering around with one jet or a limousine versus a Chrysler, 
or a Honda versus a Tempo. We do agree that there have to be 
significant changes and cuts. We are not arguing that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> That is what Mulroney said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> The member suggests that is what Mulroney said. 
What Mulroney said and did are two different things, as we all 
know. He played around on the fringes. He liked to play around 
and pretend he was making cuts while he sat there with 
40 ministers along the benches. There were so many of them and 
so many limousines around they had trouble getting to their 
offices after question period.
<P>
	We do not see that in this government. There is a dramatic 
change in how we do things and how the Prime Minister is trying 
to use a more common man approach because that is where he 
comes from. We do not have a presidential kind of atmosphere 
around here any more. We have a House of Commons attitude 
with which we are going to slowly work our way through this.
<P>
	I have said to my constituents that we need, and what I think 
we are following as a government, is about a 10-year plan, not a 
3-year plan in which we slash and trash everything that is not 
nailed down and then say: ``I cut the deficit but everybody is out 
of a job, but are we ever doing good''. What we want to do is 
build the economy over a 10-year period. I certainly believe that 
I will still be in this place if I am so fortunate as far as my 
constituents are concerned to prove to members opposite that we 
have done the right thing and have the right policies in place.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we resume debate 
I would like to take the opportunity to set the record straight.
<P>
	Just before the member for Kenora-Rainy River spoke, at 
the same time the member for Fraser Valley West and the 
member for Kenora-Rainy River sought the floor. I gave an 
explanation at that time on why I came to the final decision to 
recognize the member for Kenora-Rainy River when in fact 
upon further verification with the table officers I have been 
made aware that my decision was not consistent with the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5039"> 5039 </A></B>
<P>
precedents of this House. In recognizing the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley West I also add my apologies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
good to see that the person in charge is always willing to admit 
an error from time to time. It is too bad the government in charge 
would not follow in line with that.
<P>
	I had a great speech prepared tonight, but there have been so 
many quotes I have to address them and change everything.
<P>
	The government whip talked previously about re-establishing 
our credibility. That was the comment he made. One wonders 
why the Liberal government has to re-establish its credibility 
rather than establish it. Could it be that this was the very 
government that started borrowing money on the backs of our 
youth in the first place and now it is back to try to re-establish 
credibility?
<P>
	The question about why Reformers are in this House of 
Commons is quite obvious. The government did not quite 
re-establish the credibility it thought it did, and so here we are.
<P>
<B>(2030 ) </B>
<P>
	There was some prior discussion about tabling a list. I think 
one of the members opposite suggested that one of our members 
did not have a list. He was referring to the list of restraint 
measures to be reflected in future estimates, the reductions from 
the House of Commons budget. That was the list he was 
referring to. I intend to put forward an amendment to the motion 
based on that list. It is not as though he were coming up with 
something out of thin air. It is not a list this government needs; it 
needs a conscience. This government has to do a little soul 
searching on how to balance budgets.
<P>
	We are asked time and time again what specific cuts could be 
made. We divulged a great deal of cuts during the election. 
Nowhere in these estimates have we see anything like reducing 
non-salaried items by a certain percentage, not even 2 per cent, 
not 3 per cent, not 10 or 12 per cent. If members look at some of 
the non-salaried issues in this government today it would not 
take very much to figure out there is some money to be saved. 
One wonders how hard they are looking.
<P>
	I would like to get back to my old dilemma of how much we 
are spending to promote the official languages policy. The 
$650 million we have established could be anywhere from 
$650 million to $2 billion or $3 billion. No one is certain in this 
government. There are a lot of places to find cuts. It is just a 
matter of getting at it and doing it.
<P>
	I have tried to put these reductions into the House of 
Commons budgets we are talking about here of about $2.4 
million. By the time we put this in perspective, it is interesting 
that in the period of a 20-minute speech we have already spent 
$1,767,600 in interest on the debt. Here we are this evening 
debating probably ten times that amount.
<P>
	Today the cost to our young people, each and every one of 
them, is about $26,000 per annum to pay the interest. This is 
transferred to the young people listening and watching tonight. 
It is not this party that brought this upon these next few 
generations. It is the government of today and that previous 
party from Jurassic Park, wherever it is. I am sorry, I did not 
mean to point to the hon. member from the NDP. They are not 
Jurassic Park, yet.
<P>
	There was a quote a little earlier from the government whip 
who said that we do not want to get into this discussion on a 
partisan basis. Unfortunately these discussions about dollars are 
partisan. They are biased. Many people are very angry at 
politicians and government. Reformers have come to this House 
in part to address some of those concerns people have. We have a 
right to speak about these things and we intend to do so with 
vigour.
<P>
	Just imagine for a moment in any country in the world a 
government which spends $160 billion a year. This factitious 
country overspends by $40 billion a year. In other words the 
money it takes in just is not enough, so it borrows to spend 
$40 billion a year. This government borrowing that much each 
year then says: ``We want to get more jobs. We want to show 
people up front we are going to get them jobs. What will we do? 
We will buy them some jobs. Let us spend $2 billion more, even 
though we are only borrowing $40 billion. Let us borrow 
$2 billion more and let us go to the municipalities and get them 
to throw in $2 billion and why not ask the provincial government 
for $2 billion as well. We have $6 billion, but there is only one 
taxpayer. Fancy that''. Here is a government borrowing on the 
backs of one taxpayer at three different levels of government. 
This is the same government which is spending $160 billion a 
year, of which $40 billion is borrowed.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	A member opposite said a little while ago: ``If this 
government does not lose its way''. I suggest this government 
has started to lose its way, it is on a different path than the day it 
started. It is already borrowing money to show politically it can 
create jobs when at the end of the day what is going to happen is 
there will be more people unemployed and we will owe more 
money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The Canadian people voted for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The Canadian people voted 
the Conservatives out. They did not vote a red book in.
<P>
	Government members say: ``Why not spend $6 billion of the 
taxpayers' money on infrastructure jobs? Let us find something 
else to spend our money on. After all we are only borrowing 
$40 billion. Why not create 150,000 child care spaces if the 
economy goes to 3 per cent of GDP? That is a good idea, but we 
do not want to show the people out there that we are borrowing 
$1.5 billion to do that. Therefore we will spend $750 million 
federally and we will ask the provinces to spend $750  million''. 
Here we go again spending another $1.5 billion on the backs of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5040"> 5040 </A></B>
<P>
the taxpayers. And it is in that silly red book if you do not 
believe me.
<P>
	Where is this government going as far as spending money? In 
actual fact it is spending $3 billion more this year than last year. 
Yes, it has made some cuts. I am going to go through some of 
these cuts, but they are surface cuts and it has really not touched 
the problem at all.
<P>
	By the way, I should not forget to mention it did give about 
$3 million to the Prime Minister's riding to help build a museum 
of industry. I think there was another $33 million given to 
Quebec City for a conference centre. So maybe the government 
is looking at cutting back somewhere somehow.
<P>
	What do you say to a government that comes up with 
estimates and we debate them when in fact it is spending more 
money than it should? How does one get excited about 
discussing estimates? Why is it that we have not had a reduction 
in the estimates in the last 20 years? Just what is wrong with 
governments in this day and age, in particular this federal 
government? What is wrong with these folks that they do not 
understand that people want them to cut back, not spend more?
<P>
	The government is cutting some surface things and spending 
more on other things. It is amazing how these governments 
continue year after year to justify their existence and justify the 
spending of more money.
<P>
	We are the directors of Canada corporation. All 295 members 
are the directors. If you were a director of any corporation and 
you said to your shareholders: ``Well we sort of overspent this 
year but it is only $40 billion. Next year we are going to 
overspend by $30 billion'', what would the reaction be of the 
shareholders? I suggest that in private industry, in the real world 
out there, the directors would not be directors any longer. And 
this government sanctimoniously stands up and talks about 
cutting $2.4 million? It is not really a cut. Surface spending is all 
it is.
<P>
	Changes have been made in some of the House of Commons 
expenditures. Why is it that it might be seen as a vote of 
non-confidence if the estimates were more reflective of that 
fact? What we have asked for is to have these estimates amended 
and sent back.
<P>
	I am going to go through some of the changes as the 
government whip did. However, I am going to put another side 
to the story because the warm fuzzies that were presented are not 
so warm at all. In fact, even some of these small cuts would not 
have happened had the Reform Party not been here. We pushed 
this government to make cuts in all of its perks and it still came 
up with some surface stuff.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	The suggestion has been made that we give ourselves too 
much credit, but we probably do not give ourselves enough. We 
will give ourselves more credit when we oust that motley crew.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the reductions. It was talked about that 
we are going to save approximately 15 per cent of $98,000 and 
what is that on? The shoeshine service has been eliminated. The 
number of the barbers has been reduced from three to one. I am 
not a fan of barbers, as you might have guessed. However the 
facts are it is really despicable that any government would have 
the unmitigated gall to stand in this House and say: ``We have 
done you a favour, Canadians. We have cut back on three barbers 
to one and on the shoeshine service''. It is despicable and there 
is no other word for it.
<P>
	However the government did save on the messenger service 
and some office renovations. As I say, the whole list of savings 
the government whip talked about amounts to just a little more 
than 20 minutes' worth of interest on our debt. I do not know 
how you can get in this House and really talk high on something 
like that. The people of this country should be ashamed of what 
is going on here.
<P>
	I notice that we did leave something in the House of Commons 
budget. There are all kinds of things in there. Let us talk about 
the $9.2 million it cost for information services. It is still in 
there. You know what that is besides a PR exercise. It is more 
paperwork than Mount Baker which is very close to my riding. If 
you piled the paperwork up in this place you could probably 
build a small mountain out of it. It would not take a brain 
surgeon, as my colleague from Wild Rose says, to figure out 
there is a lot more money to cut in here. To throw some of these 
little numbers out as government is doing is really incredible.
<P>
	I could go on about many of the costs in here, but there is a 
point to be made. This government has not got the idea yet that 
Canadians by and large, regardless of their political affiliation 
are looking for significant reductions, a sign that government is 
in control of itself. Two separate Auditor General reports said 
specifically that the government is out of control financially. I 
would be one who concurs with that and I think the greater 
number of Canadians agree. In fact I probably would guess even 
people who vote Liberal might think that, although the people 
they elected seem to have walked away with a different 
philosophy.
<P>
	The bottom line is that we do want a change. We are desperate 
for a change. This country is going broke. We have to stop 
borrowing money. We have to stop the facade that it is okay to 
spend more of taxpayers' borrowed money to show people that 
there is a little blip in employment. That just will not do in the 
long run.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5041"> 5041 </A></B>
<P>
	In line with that, I would like to move the following 
amendment to the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the amount of $164,985,000 and 
substituting $162,514,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That amendment reflects the fact there were some commitments 
on behalf of this government to make some changes. That is the 
list my colleague was referring to earlier.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox 
and Addington):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for all the information, but I am not sure we really 
gained much.
<P>
	He mentioned that we on this side of the House might like to 
re-establish our credibility. That was certainly re-established 
on the date of the election. I certainly notice in the polls from the 
west that we are doing very well in an area represented by a very 
regional party.
<P>
	Our party has established confidence in the country. 
Confidence is something that we need. Certainly many of his 
constituents are very much more in favour of where we are 
headed today. There is a lot of confidence in the oil patch in the 
west. Prairie grain producers recognize what our ministers are 
doing and what we are doing around the world to protect the 
interests of our people. Things are certainly looking much 
better.
<P>
	In Ontario small business is feeling better. Small business is 
starting to hire. The major employer in my riding is Goodyear 
Canada, the most modern tire plant in the world. It has just hired 
a few more people. It has gone over the 700 mark. It is investing 
in eastern Ontario and is shipping to auto manufacturers in 
Quebec, in western Ontario and right into Michigan. Its tires are 
being shipped all over North America. Why did Goodyear build 
a new modern plant in eastern Ontario? It is because it believes 
in the country.
<P>
	The other day I was in the northern part of my riding. Georgia 
Pacific, one of the largest lumber companies in North America, 
has just invested several million dollars in a GP waferboard 
plant. Money is coming from the States and it is to hire 85 
people next month. Certainly there is confidence there.
<P>
	Our party is not like the party opposite. We do not want to cut 
the legs off the working people. We want everybody to be able to 
go to work.
<P>
	You mentioned a $26,000 debt per person. Let me ask you: 
How many people in North America-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I have been 
seized by the member's enthusiasm, but I remind all colleagues 
to address their colleagues opposite through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> I would like to ask a question of the hon. 
member opposite. How many people in the world today would 
like to pay $26,000 or $50,000 and be able to move into this 
country? The world has recognized that we are living in the 
world's greatest spot. Many people would like to move here 
tomorrow.
<P>
	The member opposite mentioned infrastructure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Was that my question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> The member will get his question. I want to 
let him know that infrastructure is an investment in the country. 
We believe in Canadians and we invest for tomorrow.
<P>
	Does the member opposite believe he would like to cut at 
random affecting the lives of innocent people? Does the member 
opposite not believe in investing in tomorrow? Does the member 
opposite not believe in Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, there were 
three questions. I will back to the first one.
<P>
	The member opposite talked about how the Liberal 
government had established confidence in the people of the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> They are clapping, I say to 
those who cannot hear it.
<P>
<B>(2050 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me just cite a couple of things that have not established 
any particular amount of confidence, some things that I have 
tripped over lately. The government gives CPP, old age security, 
the old age security income supplement and GST rebates to 
criminals in prisons. Does that give a lot of confidence to people 
out there? I have received hundreds, if not thousands, of 
telephone calls from senior citizens across the country since we 
divulged that. Does that give people confidence?
<P>
	Our people are overtaxed. Does that give people confidence? 
The Young Offenders Act so weak that it is just a plain, poor job. 
I do not know where the confidence is coming from. It is not 
oozing from my riding. Perhaps it is somewhere along the line.
<P>
	There was a question about $26,000 per person. To have the 
unmitigated gall to justify that debt to our young people because 
they would like to live in the country is pretty poor justification 
indeed. It is future generations that we have to try to help. 
Because we live in such a great country does not justify Liberal 
borrowing at all or borrowing by the other party from Jurassic 
Park.
<P>
	The final question was whether or not we could justify cutting 
at random. We produced during the election zero in three. We 
justified it. For a new party with 52 elected people, a lot of 
people understood it. The reason why the zero in three does not 
quite work right now and we have to amend it is that the debt 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5042"> 5042 </A></B>
<P>
charges have risen so high. The government refuses to cut back 
on its budgets. What  are we stuck with? Now we have to go with 
a higher number of zero in something.
<P>
	It is a shame the government cannot understand what the 
people want. It will not take the bull by the horns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I go back to the issue my colleague raised as it relates to 
infrastructure.
<P>
	There seems to be an underlying motive in the Reform Party's 
attitude that money should not be spent on infrastructure 
because they are part time jobs and that when there is a debt, the 
money should not be spent or used toward the development of 
infrastructure.
<P>
	Even though we have financial and fiscal problems-we all 
admit it; we are not suggesting otherwise-his party is 
suggesting that we should not bother with infrastructure in 
regions like mine which of course are huge. There are 800,000 
square kilometres with virtually no roads that have tremendous 
potential, as I mentioned before.
<P>
	Should we hold off on trying to develop regions like that until 
some day when we may be able to get our debt back to zero? It is 
going to take a significant amount of time if we are reasonable 
about it. I need to know from the member whether he is 
suggesting that we should put everything on hold and let 
infrastructure crumble and fall apart as is the case in other 
countries around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we 
have to go back a way on this one. We are in debt. It is so hard to 
get it through over there. We are borrowing $40 billion a year. 
The reason there are no roads or some infrastructure is breaking 
down in the first place is that we have been borrowing money on 
the backs of the taxpayers for years. They do not have it through 
their skulls yet that they have borrowed, borrowed and 
borrowed. We cannot afford these programs any longer.
<P>
	I might add that I talked to several mayors about the 
infrastructure program. Basically in many cases, and I am not 
suggesting all of them, there may be some areas that require 
purposeful funding for infrastructure. In some cases the mayors 
said that these were jobs they were going to do in the first place. 
Their costs have been cut. Instead of having 100 per cent 
infrastructure costs coming out of the residential taxpayer 
dollar, the provincial government will pick up some and the 
federal government will pick up some.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	All the government has succeeded in doing is borrowing more 
money on the backs of the taxpayers. That is the philosophy we 
have here. It is smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise 
this evening to speak on this most auspicious occasion, the 
debate on the first main estimates of the government.
<P>
	Other members have talked about how the government has 
demonstrated its resolve to restore order to Canada's fiscal 
house. I would like to talk about another pledge that we made to 
Canadians: to provide government services that Canadians want 
and need in an affordable and efficient manner. We promised to 
work to eliminate overlap and duplication with other levels of 
government and to ensure that the Canadian taxpayer is not 
paying twice for the same or similar services.
<P>
	The government is very serious about keeping these pledges 
and about restoring the faith of Canadians in their government 
institutions. It is equally serious about ensuring that a public 
service that has been cut repeatedly over the last 10 years is still 
able to deliver quality, responsive services to their clients.
<P>
	I would like to talk about some of the many management 
initiatives of the government that will enable us to keep our 
promises to Canadians. As the February budget announced, the 
government will release a declaration of quality service by the 
end of the summer. This declaration will be a service scheme for 
all public servants to follow. It will describe what the 
government views as good government service. It will tell 
Canadians what kind of service and treatment they can expect to 
receive when they telephone a government number, visit a 
federal office or write to a government agency.
<P>
	This declaration will provide clear direction to all public 
service employees about the kind of service the government 
wants Canadians to receive from all federal offices. While we 
may not be able to deliver all services in line with the 
declaration right now, an achievable but challenging target is 
one way of getting there.
<P>
	The declaration is only one part of the government's plan to 
tell Canadians what they can expect when they use a government 
service. It will be a broad government-wide vision of quality 
service.
<P>
	Just as important as the declaration are the service standards 
that each department and agency of government are expected to 
produce. Service standards will build on the quality pledge 
included in this declaration and go even further. Written in plain 
language they describe the particular services and programs of 
each department. They will talk about the actual level of service 
that Canadians should expect to receive, such as how long 
before the telephone is answered, applications are processed or 
letters are responded to. They will include some measures of the 
cost of the service or program so Canadians can judge if they are 
getting value for money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5043"> 5043 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, service standards will include simple, easy to use 
complaint mechanisms so Canadians have an effective avenue 
of redress if they are not satisfied with the service they are 
receiving.
<P>
	Service standards should be developed in consultation with 
the program's clients and employees. The government believes 
consultation with Canadians is an important step in restoring 
faith in federal institutions. To this end we are determined to 
develop an effective consultation process.
<P>
	By talking to the people who actually use or deliver the 
service, government managers get a better idea of what is most 
important to their clients. When asked clients generally offer 
worthwhile suggestions on how the service could be improved. 
By finding out what Canadians value, government managers can 
concentrate their energies and efforts where the return in terms 
of increased client satisfaction is the greatest. They can use the 
information to eliminate or reduce services that no longer meet 
the needs of today's clients.
<P>
	Service standards are real. Mr. Speaker, when you filed your 
income taxes this year you will have noticed in the guide the 
declaration of taxpayers' rights. This is not new. What was new 
was a statement by the department that even at the height of 
income tax processing in April and May returns can normally be 
processed and cheques or assessments returned within four 
weeks. This gives Canadians a very concrete idea of what they 
can expect.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	Enquiries Canada, part of the Canada Communication Group, 
has a number of service standards in place. For example, phone 
calls are answered, with a bilingual greeting I might add, in 
three rings or 16 seconds 85 per cent of the time. Any inquiry 
requiring further research is answered by the research team 
within 24 hours and the research officers do the callbacks to the 
clients themselves.
<P>
	Correspondence received by Enquiries Canada is answered 
within 48 hours.
<P>
	As we can see, this is a real and concrete description of the 
services that are being offered, something Canadians can 
monitor to see if the organizations are continuing to meet these 
targets.
<P>
	The inspections branch of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans has developed draft standards that are based on 
consultation with clients and staff. One set deals with how the 
department will handle complaints. Complaints involving 
health and safety of fish products will be investigated 
immediately. Trade complaints or complaints involving quality 
or consumer fraud will be investigated within three working 
days.
<P>
	This is an example of how the department is becoming more 
sensitive to the service needs of its clients.
<P>
	My final example of the service standards comes from 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. The department has 
established a single access food labelling service for the 
Canadian food industry. The service consolidated food labelling 
activities involving the former departments of consumer and 
corporate affairs and agriculture under four different pieces of 
legislation. The new service will complete a label assessment 
within 10 working days.
<P>
	These are all examples where federal departments and 
agencies have clearly spelled out for Canadians the level of 
service they can expect to receive. We can monitor their 
performance and see if they are meeting their targets. We can 
discuss their targets with them. For the first time we will know 
what response we should expect from a government department 
or agency.
<P>
	Of course, developing service standards is only one step in 
more efficiently delivering effective and affordable programs. 
One way to really improve the services that Canadians are 
receiving is to eliminate the stovepipe mentality resulting from 
separate government departments. Based on clients' 
perspective, related services from a number of departments and 
agencies can be provided in one location. That is what the 
Canada Business Service Centre concept is all about, one stop 
shopping for the business client.
<P>
	CBSCs provide a comprehensive access point for 
information, assistance and referrals on all federal programs 
and services to business.
<P>
	In the last budget this government made a commitment to 
open at least one centre in a major urban area in each province 
this year. Furthermore, we are working with the provinces and 
the private sector to develop a single access point for federal, 
provincial and community-based programs and services of 
interest to business clients.
<P>
	Clients have access to CBSC services by telephone and 
facsimile transmission, in person and in future electronically 
from home or business. Aside from some start-up funds to offset 
technology investment, CBSCs are being established within 
existing operating resources.
<P>
	Since these estimates were tabled on February 24 the 
Canada-B.C. Business Service Centre has officially opened, 
this in addition to three CBSCs in Halifax, Edmonton and 
Winnipeg which have been up and running for some time. Four 
new centres will open in the early summer in Montreal, 
Fredericton, St. John's and Charlottetown. Most of these will 
operate in conjunction with provincial services and one will 
even have the participation of the local chamber of commerce. 
The remaining centres will open in the early fall.
<P>
	Harmonizing federal and provincial services in one location 
is a giant step forward. However, it is even more important to 
determine that the programs and services that we are delivering 
are still relevant to the needs of today's Canadians. To that end, 
the budget announced a series of program reviews. The most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5044"> 5044 </A></B>
<P>
fundamental and far  reaching of these is the government's 
review of Canada's social security system.
<P>
	The Minister for Human Resources Development is leading 
this review. He has already launched a dialogue with Canadians 
and the provinces on our social security system. The entire range 
of social programs and issues will be covered in this review. 
They include unemployment insurance, training and other 
employment programs, the Canada assistance plan, security for 
families and children, assistance for persons with disabilities, 
post-secondary education and student loans.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
will begin consultations on the action plan in the very near 
future. Members of this House will be invited to undertake their 
own consultations.
<P>
	Redesigning services and programs to meet the real needs of 
Canadians is absolutely imperative to ensure that the most 
valued services and programs are delivered efficiently and 
affordably. However, it is just as important that public servants 
are ready and equipped to deliver these services.
<P>
	As part of this broader re-engineering effort, the government 
released the blueprint for renewing government services using 
information technology. The blueprint contains a vision of how 
the government can use today's information technology to 
deliver responsive and affordable services. It identifies the need 
for a government wide electronic information infrastructure to 
support service delivery renewal.
<P>
	The common infrastructure will allow the development of 
knowledgeable employees free from organizational constraints 
and able to answer questions and deal with the programs of a 
number of federal governments.
<P>
	The blueprint is one of many approaches to advancing the 
one-stop shopping concept and eliminating the stovepipe 
attributable to government organizations.
<P>
	The government is taking other measures to ensure that 
taxpayers' money is spent wisely, with true consideration given 
to real need. For example, with the introduction of operating 
budgets managers were provided with one sum of money to 
cover employee costs and operating and maintenance costs. This 
eliminated the person year control system. This person year 
control system often acted as a barrier to improving services to 
Canadians by not allowing managers to achieve the right input 
mix of staff, services and equipment.
<P>
	To cut down on the wasteful year end spending practices that 
we often read about in the Auditor General's annual reports, 
departments were allowed to carry forward from one fiscal year 
to the next 2 per cent of their operating budgets. There was 
therefore no need to rush out and purchase computers or lab 
equipment  that departments did not need right away but knew 
they were going to need in the next fiscal year.
<P>
	This government is currently evaluating whether the 2 per 
cent carry forward has been effective in eliminating the 
so-called year end spending binge or whether it needs to be 
increased to 5 per cent. I am confident that the President of the 
Treasury Board will advise us of the results of this study in due 
course.
<P>
	Departments and agencies that are closely located are starting 
to share common services like meeting rooms, libraries, internal 
mail distribution, to free resources that have been used in this 
kind of duplicative and costly overhead. To date there are over 
200 such initiatives being discussed or implemented in every 
province across the country.
<P>
	We are streamlining and updating our payments and 
procurement processes through the use of modern technology. 
This will have tremendous benefits both in terms of cost 
avoidance and in terms of better service to those firms that want 
to sell goods and services to the government.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me assure hon. members of this House that 
the government intends to keep its pledge to deliver the services 
Canadians want and need in an affordable and efficient manner.
<P>
	I have talked today about a number of management initiatives 
the government is pursuing. The list is just a start. It is just a 
beginning. As we look at how we are serving Canadians and 
delivering our programs, as we continually strive to learn and 
improve, other such initiatives will follow.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my colleague's comments. I would like to ask a 
question related to the infrastructure program.
<P>
	Canadians will remember that recently the United Nations 
had a study which said that Canada was number one in the world 
to live. However, if you looked more closely at that study, when 
the status of women in Canada was factored in Canada dropped 
to ninth place of the most favourable to live in the world. The 
same study also cited that women's net income is 51.5 per cent 
of that of men in Canada which is one of the reasons that we 
scored so low in terms of the status of women in Canada.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program was certainly in our jobs plan. The 
New Democratic Party supported having an infrastructure 
program. We think it is very important.
<P>
	It is true however that the majority of jobs in that 
infrastructure plan will provide jobs for men. I think this is 
good. I am not suggesting that we should not be doing that but I 
would like to ask the member if in his government's plans, in his 
own looking into the infrastructure program or other 
employment programs, he would both support and perhaps give 
some examples  of how the Liberal government has directly 
decided to address the very serious issue of poverty among 
women and increasing unem-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5045"> 5045 </A></B>
<P>
ployment among women which is reducing the standard of 
living for women in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. I certainly concur that we are very committed to 
helping the status of women and certainly through a number of 
initiatives that we have come forward with we will certainly be 
doing that.
<P>
	I have gone into my riding and talked on many occasions in 
high schools, encouraging young women to get involved in 
science and technology programs, indicating to them that this is 
the future. We need to rely on training and providing incentives 
to women to participate in science and technology and certainly 
to give them opportunities both in the private and public sector 
to display the skills they have.
<P>
	Certainly the Liberal government is committed to providing 
opportunities for women both through this infrastructure and in 
all other areas.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two different kinds 
of infrastructure. One is the physical infrastructure of roads and 
sewerage systems and so on which are very important to the 
development of Canada. There is another kind of infrastructure 
program and that is our social infrastructure.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member about that aspect of 
infrastructure because his government said in its election 
promises that when growth in the economy reached 3 per cent it 
would institute a national child care program.
<P>
	This would provide I am sure quality child care for many 
children who are without it in Canada. It would also provide a 
number of jobs for people working in that sector. Can the 
member comment on that given that growth in the economy is 
now projected to be over 3 per cent in this year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see that the hon. 
member has read the red book and has read our commitments. 
Certainly as a Liberal Party we are going to meet our 
commitments.
<P>
	The national child care program we are certainly committed 
to is outlined in the red book and that would be once the 
economy reaches 3 per cent. I understand that we would actually 
be initiating that one year after the growth in the economy.
<P>
	We certainly do support the national child care program and 
we would be implementing this program one year after the 
economy reaches that 3 per cent growth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that a number of members 
still want to speak on several of these items that are left and that 
the time for debate will end in one hour. Therefore I would like 
to see if there is unanimous consent to cut the speeches to 
10 minutes with no questions or comments from anyone, thus 
permitting more members on all sides of the House equally as 
per usual formula to get on.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask you to put that proposition to the House and 
seek such consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the government deputy whip. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
<B>(2115 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We are resuming debate 
on the amendment by the member for Fraser Valley West to 
Motion No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured today to speak on full supply for the 
1994-95 main estimates.
<P>
	Many of us are participating in the consideration of the main 
estimates which are prepared in support of the government's 
appropriation bill for the first time. I would like to take this 
opportunity to summarize for members the significant features 
of the 1994-95 main estimates and to describe the relationship 
between these estimates and the government's expenditure plan 
which was presented in the February 1994 budget.
<P>
	The 1994-95 main estimates set out details of $160.7 billion 
of planned government spending. This represents a decrease of 
0.2 per cent over the 1993-94 main estimates. It is important to 
note that almost 70 per cent of the $160.7 billion has been 
authorized by Parliament through substantive legislation. These 
statutory expenditures in the amount of $112.2 billion include 
the following: major federal government social transfers to 
Canadians, including old age security, guaranteed income 
supplements, spouse's allowance and unemployment insurance 
benefits, transfers to provinces under the fiscal equalization 
program, transfers to the provinces for health, post-secondary 
education and social assistance and public debt charges.
<P>
	Therefore through these estimates the government is seeking 
Parliament's approval to spend $48.6 billion for those programs 
which rely on annual appropriations. Planned expenditures for 
these voted programs represent a decrease of $330 million or 0.7 
per cent from 1993-94.
<P>
	What is the relationship between these main estimates in the 
amount of $160.7 billion and the total budgetary expenditure 
forecast in the amount of $163.6 billion projected in the 
February 1994 budget? Allow me first to identify those items 
which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5046"> 5046 </A></B>
<P>
are included, followed by a description of items we were unable 
to include for various reasons.
<P>
	As the member for Dauphin-Swan River, I am pleased to 
note that the 1994-95 main estimates incorporate a number of 
significant expenditures reductions set out in the February 1994 
budget which amount to $1.2 billion. These savings are 
comprised of reductions in areas such as operating budgets, 
$400 million; ministerial offices, $13 million; defence, $350 
million; cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter program, $395 
million; and international assistance, $91 million.
<P>
	These reductions clearly demonstrate the government's 
ability to follow through on its plans and policies to restore 
fiscal responsibility. We are keeping our word.
<P>
	Items not included which total $2.9 billion essentially fall 
into three categories: adjustments, reserves and allowances for 
lapses. With reference to adjustments, some elements of the 
planned spending could not be incorporated in the main 
estimates because of the timing of the budget decisions or 
because they depend on the passage of separate legislation.
<P>
	However, let me reaffirm the government's intention to 
deliver on the fundamental policy reforms and expenditure 
reduction measures involved. Major items in this category, all of 
which are decreases, announced in the February 1994 budget 
and not reflected in the 1994-95 main estimates include: 
changes to the unemployment insurance program, $725 million; 
reductions in subsidies to businesses, $117 million; reductions 
in non-statutory grants and contributions, $45 million; 
suspension of annual salary increments for public service 
employees, $50 million; and a reduction in the House of 
Commons budget, $5 million. The total savings anticipated 
from these adjustments in 1994 are $942 million.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	The second item which was provided for in the expenditure 
plan of the Minister of Finance but not included in the main 
estimates is reserves. Reserves are excluded from the main 
estimates because they are used to meet spending requirements 
which cannot be detailed but are likely to arise during the year 
and appear as supplementary estimates.
<P>
	Supplementary estimates A, which were tabled in the House 
of Commons on May 27, 1994, are an example of the use of 
reserves, in this case to allow the government to deliver the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy. Reserves in the 1994-95 estimates 
amount to $4.7 billion.
<P>
	The third and final item which was included in the total 
budgetary expenditure forecast presented by the Minister of 
Finance but not included in these estimates is the provision for 
an anticipated lapse of $875 million in spending authority; that 
is, spending authority that will not be exercised by departments 
and agencies.
<P>
	Lapses can occur due to many factors which are difficult to 
predict, ranging from contractual delays with outside parties to 
weather induced delays on construction projects.
<P>
	Thus far in discussing these main estimates I have focused 
entirely on the significant features of the government's planned 
spending and direct budgetary action to reduce expenditures. In 
addition, I would draw members' attention to the fact that main 
estimates documents also contain information on numerous 
initiatives which the government has under way to improve 
service delivery to Canadians and to make government more 
efficient. Highlights of these initiatives are provided in part I, 
chapter 5 of the main estimates.
<P>
	Improving service delivery to Canadians can be accomplished 
without increasing expenditures through greater co-operation 
with other levels of government, redesigning service delivery 
mechanisms and establishing a regulatory regime that 
encourages competitiveness and economic growth.
<P>
	For example, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal is 
co-ordinating and steering a process to examine overlap and 
duplication and to clarify federal-provincial roles and 
responsibilities through co-operative intergovernmental 
arrangements.
<P>
	The federal government has invited the provinces to examine 
such areas as securities regulations, environmental assessment 
regulations, food inspection, access to government business 
programs and services, student aid administration, drug 
prosecutions, social housing and labour market programs.
<P>
	Another initiative designed to improve service delivery to 
Canadians is the establishment of Canada business service 
centres. CBSCs provide a comprehensive access point for 
information, assistance and referrals on all government 
programs and service to businesses. CBSCs are also intended to 
improve co-ordination and co-operation among federal 
departments and agencies that offer programs and services that 
interest or effect the business community. Aside from start-up 
funding to offset technology investments, CBSCs are being 
established without new operating resources.
<P>
	In conclusion, as the member for Dauphin-Swan River, I 
would note that the 1994-95 main estimates reflect the 
government's resolve to implement measures which it believes 
are necessary to restore fiscal responsibility while remaining 
responsive and innovative to ensure quality and efficiency in 
public services.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On a point of order, the 
hon. government deputy whip.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been further 
consultations among the parties in the House and I think if you 
were to seek it you might find that there is unanimous consent to 
have 10-minute speeches and five minutes questions and 
comments starting right now so  that we could accommodate 
more members on both sides of the House to participate in this 
important debate.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion, the suggestion by the government deputy 
whip. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
closely to my colleague's comments on the main estimates.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to ask her a question about the cuts in the budget, 
and especially in the social programs envelope. As the hon. 
member said, the budget contains a number of cuts, especially in 
unemployment insurance, and in fact more than 50 per cent of 
the cuts in the budget affect social programs.
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree with these cuts in social 
programs, especially when they attack the unemployed instead 
of attacking unemployment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question.
<P>
	I should remind the hon. member that we are going through a 
process of review for the social security programs and it will be 
up to the people of this country to make that decision. We are 
listening through that consultation process and I am assured that 
the people of Canada will tell us what they believe is the right 
thing to do with respect to social programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to my colleague from Dauphin-Swan River, I am very much 
interested in issues that relate to the expenditures in the 
estimates and the budget.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will understand this being of the same bent, 
in the old hockey days I used to play in Dauphin. Dauphin is a 
small community very much the same as Kenora and places in 
my riding like Kenora, Dryden and Fort Frances. The thing that 
impressed me the most was the agricultural land that was 
available for production.
<P>
	One thing in this budget the member could fill us in on is the 
issue of whether the government is listening regarding farmers. 
Farmers have had a very difficult time in the last few years. As I 
do not have a large agricultural sector and am not well versed in 
agricultural issues, I would like to know if she could tell me if 
we are on the right track as it relates to agricultural issues. Are 
there initiatives in the budget that she thinks are going to help 
the farmers in her area and across the west?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question with respect to agriculture.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member that for those of us who 
come to this House from a farming background, we have a 
number of issues around agriculture that are going to keep farm 
families in this country alive and well. I would like to mention a 
few of those.
<P>
	One is the whole farm support program. I believe that the hon. 
minister of agriculture should be congratulated for taking the 
incentive to listen to farm families through a consultation 
process again and bringing forward those issues which are dear 
and near to the hearts of farm families.
<P>
<B>(2130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to participate in this debate tonight and 
to make a few comments, a few well-researched comments I 
might add. I have had a lot of time to prepare.
<P>
	I listened with interest to a number of members who spoke 
earlier this evening. I was particularly concerned and tried to 
respond earlier in the form of a question and comment to Reform 
Party members who had been talking in the context of their 
remarks about the confidence convention in the House. I am 
very glad to have this opportunity to pick up where I left off at 
one point earlier.
<P>
	I wanted to say and had an opportunity to partially say to 
Reform Party members that they should be a bit more humble 
about the whole tradition of advocating more free votes, less 
party discipline and less respect for the confidence convention 
in this House. I ask them to be cognizant of the fact that the 
special committee on reform of the House of Commons which 
was struck after the 1984 election and which was chaired by the 
Hon. Jim McGrath made a number of recommendations along 
the very lines the Reform Party members are in the habit of 
getting up and suggesting to the House.
<P>
	I would suggest to my Reform Party colleagues that they read 
the McGrath report, if they have not already. Maybe some of 
them have. In there they will find recommendations about the 
confidence convention, about party discipline, about free votes. 
What they will find is a recommendation that there be a wider 
range of issues on which members of Parliament should feel 
freer to vote their conscience, or that of their constituents, or 
whatever they want to do, but that they not be bound by party 
discipline.
<P>
	We received a lot of advice at that time from eminent 
constitutional and parliamentary scholars, like the late Eugene 
Forsey and others, that the confidence convention is given far 
too much weight in the Canadian political tradition. Even in the 
mother of Parliaments at Westminster will be found many more 
examples of backbench members of Parliament on the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5048"> 5048 </A></B>
<P>
ment side for instance, voting against government measures. It 
means that the cabinet and the Prime Minister have to be  much 
more sensitive to backbench opinion and that is a good thing.
<P>
	I also want to say to Reform Party members that with respect 
to the rules of the House there is nothing more left to be done. As 
a result of the McGrath committee report all the technical 
language of confidence was taken out of the standing orders.
<P>
	Prior to 1985, the word ``confidence'' did appear in the 
standing orders with respect to allotted days, supply days, et 
cetera. What that committee recommended was that all the 
language of confidence be taken out of the standing orders so 
that from that day forward nothing would be technically or 
procedurally a matter of confidence. The only things that would 
be matters of confidence would be things that were declared at 
the political level by the government to be matters of 
confidence.
<P>
	There is nothing in the rules of the House of Commons at this 
point that prevents the government or any other political party 
from having free votes. It is all a matter of the culture of the 
particular government or the political party. As members will 
have noticed even among themselves this is a difficult thing to 
overcome.
<P>
	As far as I know even the Reform Party itself has tended to 
vote as a party. You tend to have similar positions, but when you 
do not there should be the freedom to express the variety of 
opinion that exists within the caucus, particularly on the 
government side. I say that because it is harder on the 
government. There is no reason on earth why government should 
regard everything as a matter of confidence.
<P>
	What the McGrath committee recommended was that unless 
the government explicitly declares something to be a matter of 
confidence, it is not. It is a matter of political culture in the final 
analysis. It is not a matter of procedure. It is not a matter of 
rules. It is related to the media and how they treat division 
within parties, et cetera. It is a question of trying to change our 
attitude around here. Procedurally we can lead the horse to water 
but we cannot make it drink. It has to drink by itself.
<P>
	The government has to drink from the river of diversity within 
its own ranks, just as other political parties do, and that takes 
courage. It takes courage on the part of political leaders and it 
takes courage on the part of political backbenchers no matter 
what party they belong to.
<P>
	In the final analysis, there is not a member of Parliament here 
who is not free to get up and vote differently than his party or his 
leader, or her party or her leader, any time they want.
<P>
<B>(2135 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore I think there is a mistake in approach on the part of 
my Reform colleagues who keep insisting there is something the 
government must do. There is nothing the government could do. 
All the government needs to do is to set its own members free. 
There is nothing procedurally or legislatively or anything like 
that that needs to be done.
<P>
	It is not clear when they are speaking. I am not making this up. 
Their argument sounds as if there is something the government 
should be doing. The thing they could do best, if they are really 
serious about this, is to demonstrate it in their own practices.
<P>
	I just wanted Reformers to know that this call for less party 
discipline, for more distance from the confidence convention 
and for less domination by parties in the House of Commons 
precedes their arrival. I am sure it goes back a long time. It goes 
back to the non-partisan movements of the 1920s and 1930s to 
the Progressive Party and various other things. But its most 
recent incarnation here happened in the 1980s as a result of the 
McGrath committee report. Even before that there was the 
Lefebvre committee which was chaired by the late Senator Tom 
Lefebvre when he was a member of this House. That committee 
made recommendations on this.
<P>
	There has been progress. When you come here as a member, 
you think things as they are are the way they have always been, 
but prior to 1985 we could not even vote on private members' 
bills unless there was unanimous consent. There are a variety of 
other ways in which individual members have been given more 
power to express themselves as individuals, not just in private 
members' business but in committees.
<P>
	Prior to 1985 a committee could only study what the 
government asked it to study. Committees had no independent 
power to decide to study this or that. If I had the time I could go 
on and list a number of other things. I just say this because there 
is, I would say, a certain kind of hubris on the part of my Reform 
colleagues that there were no parliamentary reformers before 
they arrived.
<P>
	There have been reforms and there have been a lot of us who 
have been advocating these kinds of reforms partially 
successfully and partially without success. Let us carry on, but 
let us not act as if nothing happened before we got here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona's comments with interest and I agreed with very 
much of what he said. In fact his own party was born from a 
reform tradition. We in the Reform Party have made many 
comments about Canada's reform tradition not only in western 
Canada but in the province of Quebec, at that time it was Upper 
Canada. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5049"> 5049 </A></B>
<P>
Even in Atlantic Canada there were some Reform movements 
that have sprung up.
<P>
	The problem is not the fact of understanding what reform is 
all about and the changes that need to be made. I think we all 
understand that. We even understand, in spite of what the hon. 
member said, that some changes have been proposed and 
adopted by this House that would relax the confidence 
convention. However, the Prime Minister has not seemed to 
relay that message to his caucus and that is what concerns us.
<P>
	We have seen the same problem in provincial legislatures. In 
fact, provincial legislatures which are governed by the hon. 
member's party, the NDP, exercise extremely strict party 
discipline.
<P>
	One other matter that needs to be clear, and I would like to get 
the hon. member's comment on, is that we are not talking about 
free votes as being free spirited endeavours on behalf of 
individual members. We are talking about the members' 
freedom to vote the wishes of their constituents. There is quite a 
difference between voting how I might feel I should vote as an 
individual and in fact voting the wishes of my constituents.
<P>
	We in Reform have not come here and promoted just a bunch 
of free spirits voting however they please on every issue. We 
have been talking about difficult or divisive issues where in fact 
the party's position may differ from that of a member's 
constituents. I am sure it happens on the government side where 
the government has proposed legislation which individual 
member's constituents are definitely opposed to.
<P>
	We know what happened in the last House with the GST where 
members were told not to support the GST and they came into 
this House and stood with the government on the GST. Through 
their hands they said to their constituents: ``You don't count. We 
don't care what you say. We have to vote with the government'', 
even though these reforms apparently were in place.
<P>
<B>(2140 ) </B>
<P>
	The matter is not that the reforms are not there to be used. The 
problem is in acting them out in this House. I would ask the hon. 
member to respond to that and in fact even with regard to the 
provincial legislature where his party is the governing party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said that I thought Canadian 
politics was dominated too much by party discipline. I mean that 
as an across the board comment.
<P>
	I would point out to the member that there is a free vote in the 
Ontario legislature tonight sponsored by an NDP government. It 
is a counter example to what the member is saying. But I agree. 
When the McGrath committee recommended that there be a 
broader range of issues on which people should feel free of party 
discipline it meant that for all parties. When I signed that report 
I meant that for all parties.
<P>
	With respect to the other issue the member raised-I see you 
rising, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps the House would just allow me to 
respond to the final point about what is the role of members of 
Parliament when we are freed up from party discipline. Are we 
then freed up from party discipline to vote our conscience, or to 
vote with the majority of our constituents, or perhaps they might 
overlap, or perhaps they might be in conflict.
<P>
	It is a much more complicated matter than what Reform 
members tend to argue is the case because they argue that it is a 
question of respecting the majority view of their constituents.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret the hon.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Vote 30, in the amount of $330,938,000 under the heading 
Transport-Payments to Via Rail Canada Inc., in the main estimates for the fiscal 
year ending March 31, 1995 (less the amount voted in interim supply), be 
concurred in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the opposition has raised 
this matter for debate. As all members know there are many 
pressing issues facing the railway industry and Canada is at a 
crossroads with respect to the industry's future.
<P>
	Before dealing specifically with VIA I would like to put the 
rail passenger services into the larger context of the national 
transportation system. The hon. Minister of Transport set out a 
clear vision for the government's national transportation policy 
on June 3 in Thunder Bay.
<P>
	Obviously transportation is as important now as it was in the 
past. We need a realistic achievable vision, and new 
partnerships to move the Canadian transportation system into 
the 21st century. We should respect the past but by doing so we 
must meet the challenges of the future.
<P>
	We believe that the role and structure of crown corporations 
such as VIA Rail and CN must be reviewed. Because of the 
current uncertainty in the rail sector and concerns over its long 
term viability, the Minister of Transport intends to convene a 
meeting of industry leaders to discuss the problems railroads are 
facing and to search for solutions.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	We must be pragmatic and focus on what will work. We must 
ensure that the common sense realistic needs and affordability 
are among the criteria driving Canadian transportation policy of 
the future. Passengers must have a multimodal transportation 
system that is safe, reliable and affordable. VIA has a role to 
play as we put the system in place.
<P>
	Because of the need to reduce the government expenditures 
VIA has been required to operate within lower funding levels. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the funding to VIA has been 
reduced and its network restructured in 1990 we now have a 
streamlined and more efficient rail passenger carrier. The 
corporation has been able to complete cost studies of its 
operations that show where opportunities exist to make cost 
effective changes. Identification of such opportunities 
prompted VIA for example to introduce new service frequencies 
in the Montreal-Ottawa triangle while reducing further its 
requirements for government subsidies.
<P>
	The government is pleased with what the corporation has been 
able to accomplish with the introduction of its silver and blue 
service on the western transcontinental trains. Public response 
has been outstanding. With both revenue and traffic increasing, 
on time performance is now at 90 per cent.
<P>
	VIA has demonstrated that it is capable of meeting the 
challenge of subsidy reductions. That has been accomplished 
with the use of better equipment, improved productivity and a 
quality of on board services.
<P>
	Recent years have seen VIA management exercising greater 
flexibility and control over the planning, development and 
operation of rail passenger services. With our government that 
trend will continue.
<P>
	The 1993 budget reduced VIA funding over a three year 
period beginning in 1994-95 from $343.4 million to 
$235 million in 1996-97. The recent budget exercise further 
reduced annual funding over the next five years by a total of 
$9.6 million.
<P>
	As my colleague, the Minister of Finance, has already told the 
House, Canada has been building up a mountain of debt. We 
simply cannot allow this trend to continue. This was the reason 
behind our decision to confirm the VIA funding levels 
announced in the 1993 budget. VIA has met its challenges in 
moving to a more efficient customer oriented company.
<P>
	This government is now asking the corporation to assist the 
government in reducing our national deficit. VIA's ability to 
meet this challenge is fundamental to its long term viability. The 
government's decision to confirm VIA's reduced funding was a 
necessary one and the right one for Canada. We cannot put the 
decision aside and look to the past. In my opinion that would be 
the wrong course. Rather we must now look to the future and 
forward building on VIA's successes.
<P>
	There has been much discussion concerning the level of 
government subsidy to passenger rail service. In particular 
comparisons have been made with other modes of public 
transportation in Canada: buses, aeroplanes and the automobile. 
While the automobile and air modes have received more funding 
overall, each passenger on the rail mode receives a far greater 
subsidy than any other mode of transport.
<P>
	Since its creation in 1977 the government has spent more than 
$7 billion on VIA's operating and capital expenditures. Despite 
these government subsidies rail passenger service retains only 1 
per cent of the total Canadian intercity passenger traffic. In 
comparison the air mode has a market share of 6 per cent. The 
automobile enjoys the lion's share of the market at 89 per cent. 
Even the bus mode enjoys a greater share of the market at 4 per 
cent.
<P>
	These figures reveal that Canadians have a definite preference 
for passenger modes other than rail and they have sent a clear 
signal of that preference.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5051"> 5051 </A></B>
<P>
	Like all Canadians we must ask ourselves what is it that we 
can afford. We must make choices based upon utility and value. 
We cannot say to Canadians: ``You must continue to pay more 
and more for something you rarely use''.
<P>
	I would encourage the opposition to recognize that we must 
face the reality of our economy, of our modes of travel, in 
particular the cost and benefits of rail passenger service.
<P>
	If I may, I would like now to address the issue of where VIA is 
today. At the outset it would be helpful to briefly review some of 
the facts on VIA's performances in 1992. For the system as a 
whole the operating subsidy was $332 million. This translates 
into an average total subsidy of $92 per passenger. For the 
corridor, the most heavily travelled segment of the network, the 
operating subsidy was $171.8 million for an average subsidy of 
$56 per passenger.
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	As we move to the other categories of service we see that the 
level of subsidy rises dramatically. For example, it rises from an 
average of $254 per passenger for Trent Continental service to 
$454 per passenger for services to the remote communities.
<P>
	It is also interesting to look at the level of cost recovery. It 
ranges from a high of 38 per cent on the corridor to a low of only 
8 per cent on the remote routes. Nevertheless, VIA has not stood 
still since the 1993 budget announcement. To help meet the 
funding targets it embarked on a major restructuring of its 
corporate and management expenses last November. We as a 
government must respect the taxpayers' ability to pay. That is an 
important first step.
<P>
	Unfortunately, with even bigger streamlining and a pared 
down corporate structure VIA cannot achieve viability unless at 
the same time it addresses its cost base. For example, labour 
costs represent approximately 46 per cent of the corporation's 
operating costs. These are in fact the largest single cost items in 
VIA's budget.
<P>
	The decisions facing both VIA and its labour unions in the 
current contract negotiations will be difficult. At the same time 
it will be necessary for them to work together to find a resolution 
of their differences which is within the final financial 
constraints.
<P>
	VIA is currently evaluating the effect on its operations of the 
budget funding cuts. As well, the negotiations between VIA and 
its employees will have a significant impact on future levels of 
service.
<P>
	In addition, the corporation is reviewing every aspect of its 
operations to maximize all expenditures which do not impact 
directly on services to the travelling public.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe it is important to tell this House and 
Canadian taxpayers, who are in fact funding VIA to the tune of 
$323 million this year, that a resolution and a solution can be 
found. It lies within VIA itself coming up with some additional 
efficiency gains  and the workers and labour components of VIA 
working co-operatively with the company to ensure greater 
efficiencies. Passengers and the travelling public who have a 
great desire for using passenger rail service-at least that is 
what they tell us-at the same time jump in their cars and drive 
down the 401. Ninety per cent of passengers do that.
<P>
	I think the solution for passenger rail service, and there is no 
doubt that there is one in this country, lies with the passengers 
utilizing VIA more, the labour component part helping, and VIA 
looking for greater efficiencies. We believe that we can have a 
viable affordable passenger rail service in this country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the member and his comments on the importance 
of rail and the decreased utilization of rail in this country.
<P>
	I think we should put this into perspective. Following the 
changes to the rail system, to VIA Rail, we cannot on the one 
hand chastise people for not using rail when in fact the service 
and the funding to that service have been radically decreased 
and the quality of the service not upgraded. Certainly the 
proposals that have been around for quite some time on a 
high-speed train in the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal corridor 
clearly would serve a very important transportation service both 
for passengers and produce.
<P>
	I was recently in Japan. While I realize there is a much larger 
population there, their high speed trains are utilized fully 
because it is a good service.
<P>
	Certainly the whole question of transportation is a major one. 
One of the debates during the Canada-U.S. and NAFTA free 
trade agreements was the impact on transportation, a further 
north-south investment into transportation routes of all kinds as 
opposed to the east-west links which had provided to the regions 
of this country, our farming communities and communities in 
the maritimes and Newfoundland, a substantial part of the 
development of this country.
<P>
<B>(2155 ) </B>
<P>
	I appreciate the member's comments specific to VIA Rail as it 
is now, but would it not make more sense from the 
environmental and utilization of best technology points of view 
to look seriously at a high speed-train in large quarters with 
large population?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is very appropriate. 
The member will know that the three governments, the federal 
government, the province of Ontario and the province of 
Quebec, have spent $6 million on a further study of the 
high-speed proposal. That high speed proposal will come before 
the House and before the government some time this summer, at 
which point the House and the government will have an 
opportunity to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5052"> 5052 </A></B>
<P>
look at the viability of high-speed trains through the corridor 
from Windsor to Quebec and Montreal.
<P>
	We believe there could be a future for high-speed trains in the 
country provided there is a willingness for the partners to work 
toward that resolution, the partners being the provinces, 
communities, other modes of travel and the private sector 
investing greatly in infrastructure which may cost somewhere 
between $8 billion and $10 billion.
<P>
	The member is right that the European communities and 
Japan have decided to go the route of high-speed trains. We 
believe this country should look at those opportunities, but we 
will have to await the report for that to happen.
<P>
	Let me say another thing about VIA. The member is right that 
the Conservative government slashed services some three years 
ago but the ridership has come back. I can only say that it is not a 
question of whether we will have VIA in the future but what it is 
we can afford. I will give one example. A person can purchase a 
ticket from VIA for $78 to go between Jasper and Prince Rupert. 
The subsidy for that one passenger for that one trip is $701 to the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	We believe we can have a viable passenger rail service, but we 
need to look to the communities, to passengers, to the labour and 
to VIA to come up with a viable and affordable system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very 
historic evening. Twenty years ago the House decided that it 
would change an estimate, and it changed two estimates. One 
was with regard to the Department of Labour wherein it cut 
$19,000. The other was a $1,000 cut to the president of the CBC. 
Those two cuts were accepted by the House at that time.
<P>
	Based on that I should like to move an amendment before the 
House based on the same principle. If we can repeat history 
tonight I think we will have achieved success. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the amount $330,938,000 and 
substituting $330,918,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the proposer of 
the amendment. We acknowledge that VIA has done its part, but 
I am not sure how the member came up with this magic $20,000.
<P>
	Is he suggesting that we cut service to his riding or any 
particular riding? Is that the contribution the Reform Party 
wishes to make to the subsidy? If that is what the Reform Party 
stands for, less passenger rail service in this country, perhaps the 
member can explain that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the 
hon. member, I think he understands. He has been long enough 
in this Parliament to understand that is not the kind of rationale, 
the reason put in place by people who are responsible members 
of Parliament. That kind of argument is for people who want to 
argue in the gutter, who want to debate the issue outside the 
House in an arena that does not earn the respect of this 
Parliament.
<P>
	It is very unfortunate what the hon. member has just done. If it 
takes a reduction in some expenditure in the constituency of 
Lethbridge of $20,000 to symbolize a very important change 
where we are going to reduce the budget, then the people of 
Lethbridge would be willing to accept that responsibility.
<P>
	I know this member will not be making that decision. I know 
the members of this government, the Prime Minister, the Deputy 
Prime Minister, would make a rational, reasonable, priority, 
responsible decision on a matter such as that and it would not be 
done in a crass manner. That is why I can accept that 
responsibility on behalf of my constituents.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 10 p.m. it is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 81(18), to interrupt the 
proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the business of supply.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to the division on Motion No. 1. 
Call in the members.
<P>

the following division:)

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I declare the amendment 
negatived. The next question is on the main motion.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The next question is on 
the amendment to Motion No. 3.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe you will find 
unanimous consent to apply the results of the last vote on this 
motion in reverse.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify with the 
government whip. Is he sure he means in reverse? It is the 
motion of the hon. member for Fraser Valley West with respect 
to Parliament. Now it is the motion of the hon. member for 
Lethbridge with respect to VIA Rail. My understanding is that 
we would want the same vote. Am I mistaken? It is not in 
reverse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand from the 
negotiations we had that the vote we were to take is on the 
amendment to the motion. Therefore the government side is 
voting against the amendment. That is why I said in reverse of 
the vote that we took before. If I made a mistake at this hour, 
maybe there is confusion. Maybe we should take the vote.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
<B>(2255 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, to avoid confusion I think you 
would find there is unanimous consent to apply the second vote 
that was taken, that is, the vote on the previous amendment to a 
motion, not on a main motion, to this particular vote on this 
particular amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The next vote is on 
Motion No. 3.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5055"> 5055 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Let us try 
again and maybe this time we will get it straight.
<P>
	I believe and I would like to ask my colleagues to check their 
voting lists, that the results of the vote on the first motion, the 
first vote we took that now because of the results of the vote we 
could apply the first vote to all the remaining concurrence 
motions, second reading of the bill, concurrence and report 
stage, third reading of the bill and all the clauses of the 
committee of the whole should be adopted on division.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I am sorry but 
that was not my understanding. I was waiting for the whip to get 
up after this particular motion. If we were to do what he 
suggests, we would end up voting in a way we do not wish to 
vote, so I cannot agree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I understand 
what the hon. member is saying. What happened was that on the 
first vote the Reform did not vote the way we were told they 
would vote. That is why we could apply the first vote to the other 
five votes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we could apply the results 
of the first vote to this one, and the hon. member could apply the 
same reasoning to the two votes on which they want to vote 
differently from the series of votes on which we will vote. Our 
agreement still stands, provided he makes it clear that a negative 
vote on the fifth vote applies to all votes except two. If he says 
which two, there is no problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, far be it from me to have been able 
to predict what the Reform Party would do, or for that matter the 
government whip.
<P>
	Whatever is going on here, Mr. Speaker, I just want it to be 
absolutely clear that the NDP caucus wants to support the 
motion of the Treasury Board allocating money to VIA Rail and 
to Industry grants. Then we want to be recorded as voting 
against the main estimates in their entirety.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The votes described by 
the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona will be recorded 
according to his statement.
