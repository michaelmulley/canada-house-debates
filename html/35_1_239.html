	The House resumed from October 5 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-64, an act respecting employment equity, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing that 
makes me most proud about being a parliamentarian is the 
opportunity to be a part of the passage of legislation like Bill C-64.
<P>
	When each one of us makes the decision to run for public office 
it is because we have certain agendas, certain policies we want to 
put forward. Seven years ago next week, when I was first 
nominated to run for public office, I had an agenda and I still do. 
That agenda has a great deal to do with human rights. It has a great 
deal to do with regional disparity. It has a great deal to do with 
feminism and it has a great deal to do with fairness. Bill C-64 is a 
piece of legislation that certainly fits into my agenda. It fits into 
one of the reasons that although I was born into the great Liberal 
Party I chose it again as a student in university and later when I 
decided to run.
<P>
	There are frequently misunderstandings about the expression 
employment equity. For example, there are people who confuse 
employment equity and affirmative action. Employment equity and 
affirmative action, while complementary, are not the same.
<P>
	I used an analogy when I spoke at report stage and I will do it 
again because it bears repeating. At report stage I talked about the 
fact that we could use a medical metaphor. Employment equity is 
preventive. It is a preventive measure. It ensures that we do the 
right thing from the beginning. Affirmative action is curative. I 
might add, for those people who through misunderstanding find 
affirmative action repugnant, that affirmative action is enshrined in 
the charter of rights and freedoms and as such is something 
Canadians have  taken to most strongly, not just Canadians of this 
political stripe but the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	Affirmative action would not be necessary if employment equity 
were the rule rather than the exception.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	A couple of phrases and a couple of taglines have arisen 
throughout the debate that need to be dealt with. The one I have to 
talk about is the usage of two words together in the English 
language whenever we talk about employment equity. Those two 
words are competent and woman. When I hear my colleagues say a 
competent woman should be allowed, another word I truly love, to 
advance as far as anyone else, I sit here in vacant and in pensive 
mood and wonder why we never use those words together about 
competent men.
<P>
	Why are we always so afraid that some woman might slip 
through and might not be competent? With the greatest of 
respect-and I have already said on several occasions in this debate 
how fond of men I am in general-there are some incompetent 
men. We have seen them and they have not suffered in the 
employment equity wars as have perhaps legions of competent 
women.
<P>
	The hissy fit I just had was a little patronizing. I did it 
deliberately. We can argue the merits of employment equity. 
Certainly these expressions irritate a number of women on this side 
of the House-and I look at my colleagues from Oakville-Milton, 
Windsor-St. Clair and Etobicoke-Lakeshore-as much as they 
irritate me. Perhaps it is not as much as they irritate me but they 
certainly are irritating. Perhaps I have become more irritable in 
these discussions. It may be because I have been having these 
discussions in the Chamber longer than my three aforementioned 
colleagues.
<P>
	Whether we are patronizing, whether women or men are 
competent or incompetent, whether there is a feminist agenda, 
whether there is a Liberal agenda-and of course there is a Liberal 
agenda called the red book-it is important that the bill continues 
the legacy of fairness. It must continue the legacy of sound social 
policies which have made this country the envy of the world, which 
have made this country the country rated number one in the United 
Nations survey. Everybody here knows that in their hearts, in their 
minds and in all their lives. It has been a great blessing for all of us 
either to choose to come here or to have been born here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	We enjoy longer life expectancy, higher educational levels and 
a greater real income than anyone else in the world. This is an 
outstanding record of which anyone in Canada can and should be 
proud. However, it is based on a history of fair legislation, human 
rights legislation and employment equity legislation.
<P>
	It began back in the days of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. It followed 
through with Mackenzie King, to Louis St. Laurent, to Lester 
Pearson, to Pierre Trudeau and now to the current Prime Minister. 
It is a legacy we in the Liberal Party are justly proud of and it is one 
that we will continue to further.
<P>
	It would be dangerous, however, to sit back, to rest on our laurels 
and say that because of this history Canada is somehow a perfect 
place. It is not a perfect place. It is not a perfect place if one 
belongs to a visible minority. It is not a perfect place if one is a 
woman. It is not a perfect place if one has a disability. It is not a 
perfect place if one falls under any of the prohibited heads in the 
charter of rights and freedoms. We know that discrimination is still 
a fact of life; every one of us knows it. The whole reason for 
discrimination is fear of the unknown, fear of people unlike us, fear 
that somehow people who are unlike us will take something away 
from us or away from our children. However there is a Canadian 
tradition that rises above fear.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	We are only now emerging from one of the worst recessionary 
periods in our history. Most of us in the House of Commons belong 
to that amorphous mass known as the post-war baby boom. This 
recession was the first real attack on our very privileged lives. 
Many of us were lucky enough to weather it without huge injury 
but many of us were not.
<P>
	I stood in the House on many occasions in opposition and talked 
about the cost in human terms of the recession. I talked about the 
rate of bankruptcies, the small business losses. I talked about the 
number of young people, both men and women, who were not 
getting jobs and did not have any hope.
<P>
	We are recovering. We know it and we see it. It is not coming 
perhaps as fast as we would like but it is coming. Consequently, 
because Canada is coming back to its accustomed prosperity, the 
time has come for legislation like Bill C-64 to shore up our 
employment equity promises and to ensure that all Canadians have 
fair opportunity.
<P>
	There are times when it is important to deal with questions of 
gender equality with a relatively light touch. Members of the 
female gender remind male colleagues that life is better from 
womb to tomb for the Lords of creation.
<P>
	I said in the House the other day that in spite of the fears of some 
of our colleagues in opposition, white males get 50 per cent of 
federal government jobs. They  get 60 per cent of the jobs 
nationally in both the private and public sector combined. Even 
more overwhelming, white males get 90 per cent of the 
promotions. With figures like that I believe it would be safe to say, 
and I do not think anyone would argue with me, probably the white 
male is not exactly an endangered species in the economic climate.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is if we keep drinking the water.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> That may well be. I have spoken frequently to the 
hon. member for Edmonton Northwest about the amount of water 
he consumes in the House of Commons. I will not make any 
comments about the amount of air he deals with or the temperature.
<P>
	However there are people in the country who suffer because the 
federal employment equity act does not have teeth until we pass 
this amendment. It cannot really be enforced. Bill C-64 brings in 
needed enforcement measures.
<P>
	I talked about the fact that in opposition I was the vice-chair of 
the committee to review the employment equity legislation. We 
heard witnesses from all over the country. I remember in particular 
a group from the province of Saskatchewan that fell under federal 
jurisdiction and had taken to heart most seriously the whole 
question of employment equity.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	These people very proudly showed us that their employee roster 
reflected the demographics where they lived and effectively the 
national demographics. There was probably a higher demographic 
percentage of aboriginal people because it was the province of 
Saskatchewan, but on a gender basis, disabled basis and so on, the 
demographics were extremely reflective of the society where they 
did their business. They also showed us the excellent quality of 
their labour relations and profit margins.
<P>
	I do not understand what it is people fear from legislation that is 
clearly put on the books to ensure fairness for people who for 
generations, for thousands of years since the dawn of time have 
been systemically discriminated against because they are female, 
they are black, they are aboriginal, they are disabled, or for 
whatever reason under the blanket condemnation of discrimination 
enshrined in the charter of rights and freedoms. Why do people fear 
legislation that promotes fairness?
<P>
	Why do people fear something which says if there are two 
equally qualified people and one of them comes from a 
disadvantaged group that it is time to give the benefit to the 
member of the disadvantaged group? Why is that a frightening 
thing? Is it because there is a lack of confidence in their own ability 
to succeed? Is it because there is that fear of the unknown which I 
spoke of earlier, the fear that someone with a different skin colour, 
or a female of the species, or someone who needs  extra help 
because of a disability will surpass you and show you that in spite 
of the perceived disability or the perceived discrimination that 
person is possibly a finer or a more productive person than you are? 
That kind of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15331"> 15331 </A></B>
<P>
response is unworthy of Canadians. It is unworthy of a society that 
is held up as an example to the world.
<P>
	All of us have unworthy thoughts. All of us have fears. We all 
have great trepidations about what the future will hold, not just for 
ourselves but for our children and for the generations to come. All 
of us here in the House have a particular responsibility which is to 
somehow get over those fears and to deal with those fears. We have 
to look at the larger picture of Canadian life and do our very best to 
legislate in a way that will benefit the largest number of Canadians.
<P>
	I said at the beginning that all of us came here with an agenda, 
with things we wanted to see accomplished. I said that one of the 
things I wanted to see accomplished as a member of Parliament 
was a furtherance of human rights and fairness. Bill C-64 again is 
one of the reasons I am proud to be a member of Parliament. I 
support this bill and I will be delighted to see it pass.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the official 
opposition has given its support to this most praiseworthy bill. We 
have been listening to the comments of the third party since 
yesterday, and I do appreciate what the members across the floor 
have had to say, something the opposition can rarely state.
<P>
	I would, however, like to ask the hon. member the following 
question. Eloquent words are good, very eloquent words even 
better, but better still are not words but concrete actions and 
accomplishments.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Let me give the example of the wage inequity that exists at this 
time for women in the federal public service. It has been evaluated 
at 72 per cent. How can that be remedied when Treasury Board has 
undertaken to cut 45,000 positions?
<P>
	How will the legislation be implemented so that, in the public 
service for example, there can be a move beyond mere words to 
concrete actions toward restoring the balance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. However, he may be confusing his apples with his 
oranges.
<P>
	The member first talked about the fact that 72 per cent of the 
Public Service of Canada is female. That is true, but in talking 
about the public service-and I do this in spite of my great respect 
and affection for the President of the Treasury Board-we still 
have a way to go in ensuring that women reach higher echelons in 
the public service. They must be able to break through glass  
ceilings. The federal government has a responsibility to be an 
example to the private sector.
<P>
	I believe that with the passage of Bill C-64 and the other projects 
and policies of the government we will see the federal government 
continuing its role as an example to the rest of the country. One of 
the ways it has to be an example to the rest of the country is to put 
its financial house in order.
<P>
	I am not exactly sure where the hon. member's riding is in the 
province of Quebec but I can tell him that I represent the third 
largest public service town in Canada. The largest is of course 
Ottawa. The second largest is Montreal. Halifax is the third largest. 
I have shared with the hon. members for Dartmouth and Halifax 
West in excess of 30,000 employees of the federal government. 
With the greatest of respect to the hon. member, I do not need 
anyone to tell me about the problems and concerns of public 
servants.
<P>
	With the downsizing which we all know has to be done the 
public servants in Halifax who are going are taking retirement 
packages and are finding that the federal government is dealing 
with them in a fair and open way. This project is moving along at an 
even faster rate than a number of people had thought. Thus far I 
have received little or no complaints from my constituents who, I 
can assure the hon. member, are extremely vociferous and quick to 
get in touch with me if there is something they are unhappy about 
or something they feel is not going their way.
<P>
	If the hon. member is worried about public servants, perhaps he 
would like to come to Halifax. They would tell him that they are 
not quite so badly off as he might think.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the dissertation by the member 
opposite representing Halifax, the bastion of public service in 
Canada.
<P>
	I remind the member opposite that Canada is not a perfect place 
for the people she listed in her dissertation, all of the groups that 
were designated. It is not a perfect place for men either. The world 
is not a perfect place.
<P>
	In my experience the drive to perfection is better achieved 
through education rather than legislation. We cannot legislate 
tolerance; we can educate tolerance. We cannot legislate wisdom; 
we can educate wisdom. There are some things the government just 
plain cannot do. I leave this aside and recognize that this legislation 
will pass.
<P>
	Why, if this legislation is so good and so necessary for the public 
at large, are there two sets of rules? Why do we ask Canadians to do 
one thing while we do another? Why do we ask Canadians to do 
with less when we are prepared to accept our pensions the way they 
are? If this legislation is so good, why does it not extend to the 
House of Commons?
<P>
<B></B>

<B><A NAME="15332"> 15332 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, there were several questions and I will 
be delighted to deal with each one.
<P>
	First and foremost, I have to disagree with my hon. friend from 
Edmonton Southwest, one of my favourite members of the third 
party. On the question of education for tolerance as opposed to 
legislation, the point is that we have to do both. I think my hon. 
friend from Edmonton knows that.
<P>
	Sometimes we do have to legislate. That is why we have human 
rights acts with which I am sure my hon. friend would not disagree. 
That is why western democracies have frequently had to drag 
portions of their populations kicking and screaming into the latter 
part of the 20th century. Sadly but truly, part of that is in the area of 
human rights law in all its ramifications. If we have to do that, we 
have to do that.
<P>
	On the question of pensions, I do not think we are debating 
pensions, but yes, I opted into the pension. I am proud to do so and 
I will continue to be proud to do so because, in the words of that 
Clairol commercial, I am worth it.
<P>
	With regard to the question of why the employment equity 
legislation does not relate to the House of Commons, there is an 
option for the House of Commons. I too agree with the hon. 
member but with legislation, one of the things I have learned in my 
seven years here is that sometimes we must crawl before we walk. 
This is a great step forward from the old act. The improvements 
and amendments will keep on coming in all areas of policy while 
the Liberal government, our Prime Minister and the cabinet make 
the policy for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as my colleague from Lévis has already said we support 
Bill C-64, on which I believe we have worked very hard in 
committee. We heard a number of witnesses and tried in good faith 
to improve the bill.
<P>
	It is worthwhile keeping in mind, I think, that the bill before us 
on employment equity goes back as a concept to 1983 and the 
Abella commission. The Abella commission provided us with a 
very clear understanding of the fact that, while individual 
discrimination still exists, often in the form of prejudice or 
negative attitudes toward certain social phenomena within our 
society, a more systemic discrimination still exists as well, related 
to the system and to certain practices, rules and usages which are 
still sanctioned and upon which it is not easy, as an individual, to 
make any impact to bring about change.
<P>
	What Bill C-64 asks of us is to ensure that the composition of the 
labour market reflects the composition of the Canadian population. 
I do not see  anything in such an objective that is unreasonable or 
beyond our grasp as a society. 
<P>
	When it comes to systemic discrimination, discrimination within 
the system, which is most certainly the hardest to get rid of, four 
categories of individuals have the most difficulty claiming their 
rightful place in the work force. First and foremost in the four 
groups listed in the bill are women, and we shall come back to this, 
since they make up more than half of the Canadian population and 
still lag considerably behind in the workforce, particularly where 
wage policies are concerned, as the member for Lévis mentioned.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The second group is visible minorities. They say we live in an 
increasingly cosmopolitan society. This implies there are more and 
more people who do not belong to the majority, who are not white, 
and these people also have specific problems such as getting 
promoted and getting a job with managerial responsibilities in the 
workplace.
<P>
	And of course we have persons with disabilities. This has 
become a fact of life. Our society can expect to have an increasing 
number of people who are functionally challenged. There is 
certainly a connection with the increase in people's life expectancy, 
especially among women who seem to have a philosophy of life 
and a knack for taking care of themselves from which men would 
have a lot to learn.
<P>
	The last group covered by this bill is aboriginal peoples. 
Aboriginal peoples represent approximately 4 per cent of the 
Canadian population but have managed to occupy only 1 per cent 
of the jobs available.
<P>
	In federally-regulated companies with more than 100 employees 
and throughout the public service-more on that later-we are 
being asked to find ways to ensure better representation of these 
four groups in the labour market.
<P>
	We asked ourselves two questions when considering this bill. 
First, whether other groups or individuals in our society suffered 
systemic discrimination.
<P>
	It was pointed out that older workers may have been 
discriminated against, since it is not easy when you are laid off and 
lose your job, and you are 40, 50 or 55 years old, to find a job 
somewhere else. I think we can safely say there is some hidden 
discrimination against this group.
<P>
	The question also arose whether in our society young people, the 
under thirties, also have that problem. We tried to get some 
statistics to have a better picture of the problems facing these 
people. We concluded on the basis of the information we had in 
committee that there was no specific indication that young people 
and older workers had suffered systemic discrimination during the 
past few years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15333"> 15333 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the employment equity bill, it is also possible to invoke 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The charter is a 
mixture of the best and the worst. The best being, of course, the 
will to ensure that every citizen, irrespective of his income, 
origins, or profession, has certain rights. I would say the worst 
part is the provision which attempts rather awkwardly, without 
reflecting much concern for the interests of Quebec, to support 
multiculturalism. But that is another issue. In any case, section 
15(2) of the charter allows for specific measures aimed at the same 
designated groups we find in Bill C-64.
<P>
	Why do I mention this? Because very often there is an 
assumption that employment equity legislation, and this includes 
federal as well as provincial legislation, may not be compatible 
with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Upon closer 
scrutiny that is clearly not the case, and as I said before, section 
15(2) of the charter allows for measures to deal specifically with 
designated groups.
<P>
	The overall picture, before we get into the details, is the 
following. There seems to be a pretty standard profile of economic 
discrimination on the labour market against women, persons with 
disabilities, aboriginal peoples and visible minorities, and the 
situation is not improving. I would say there are four 
characteristics that are a constant in access to employment for the 
four designated groups.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Generally speaking, the unemployment rate is higher for women, 
aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities and persons with 
disabilities. The level of unemployment of people in these groups 
is often higher than the national average, despite the fact that we 
have had employment equity legislation since 1986. This is the first 
characteristic of a general economic profile.
<P>
	Also, generally speaking, we can say that these people are in 
poorer paying jobs, that is, again as compared with the national 
average.
<P>
	When we look at the employment profile and the type of jobs 
these people hold, we realize that they often occupy lower level 
positions, not executive or management ones. For certain groups, 
and I am thinking particularly of women and aboriginal peoples-I 
was very surprised to learn-the lower level positions are often 
clerical jobs, junior positions. Here again, nothing has changed 
since 1986.
<P>
	The final characteristic of this general profile is that the people 
in the four designated groups are employed in jobs with low growth 
potential. This means that, in the course of the changes the job 
market will undergo in the next few years, these are the jobs that 
will be threatened, because of their low level of specialization.
<P>
	I think it important to keep this profile in mind, because, once we 
realize the situation, it is impossible to rise, like some of our 
Reform colleagues have done, and  state that everyone is equal in 
the labour market. It is not true that everyone is equal, and it is not 
true that everyone has an equal opportunity to occupy the same 
jobs.
<P>
	But that does not mean that progress has not been made. I think 
we would be misinformed as parliamentarians if we did not 
acknowledge what has been achieved since 1986.
<P>
	I would like to outline for you the percentage of jobs held by 
each of the designated groups in relation to the jobs held by the 
population as a whole.
<P>
	Let us take members of visible minorities, for example. We are 
told that, as of the last census, they represented 9.4 per cent of the 
population. In 1987, one year after the Employment Equity Act 
came into effect, they occupied 5 per cent of the jobs in the labour 
market. Between 1987 and 1993, with the legislation still in effect, 
progress was made, because members of visible minorities now 
represented 8.9 per cent of the labour force.
<P>
	Obviously, 8.9 per cent is lower than the absolute proportion of 
the population they represent, which is 9.4 per cent.
<P>
	Women, of whom the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration spoke so eloquently, represent 52 per 
cent of the population of Canada. As we know, this is a widespread 
phenomenon, there is no hiding it. Just think, in 1987, they 
occupied 40 per cent of the jobs available on the labour market in 
Canada. By 1993, things had improved and women held 45 per cent 
of available jobs.
<P>
	Nevertheless, when we analyze the figures a bit,-and this is 
where we realize it-we see the need for employment equity 
legislation. I wonder, in the case of the pages, whether we have 
achieved a balance between men and women. I would guess from 
what I have seen that, in this session, the women outnumber the 
men. But we will get hold of the statistics on this.
<P>
	The aboriginal peoples represent 4 per cent of the Canadian 
population. In this case, things are really dramatic. In the case of 
the aboriginal peoples and persons with disabilities, progress has 
been particularly pitiful and there is the greatest cause for concern 
for us as lawmakers.
<P>
	The aboriginal peoples represent 4 per cent of the Canadian 
population. In 1987-hold on tight, Mr. Speaker, you are in for a 
shock-they held .66 per cent, that is, not even 1 per cent, of jobs 
on the labour market. In 1993, they occupied 1.4 per cent of the 
jobs.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	This is a recovery. There is a pressing need to change course. 
Handicapped people, who represent 15 per cent of the Canadian 
population, were holding 1.59 per cent of jobs in the work place in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15334"> 15334 </A></B>
<P>
1987 and 2.56 per cent in 1993. Even today in 1995, we see 
discrimination, a gap,  an imbalance between the importance of 
some designated categories and their place in the labour market. 
This is what Bill C-64 is designed to correct, and I do not 
understand how a member of Parliament, a representative of the 
people cannot subscribe to these principles.
<P>
	One thing surprised me throughout our numerous committee 
hearings. Of course, I do not deny that there is a cost and some 
paperwork attached to employment equity, but I was pleasantly 
surprised to note that what employers came to tell us is that an 
employment equity strategy is now part of a sound staff 
management policy.
<P>
	Removing employment barriers against certain people is in 
everyone's interest. In a context where businesses are asked to be 
good corporate citizens, to maintain close links with their 
communities, striking just the right balance between a business and 
its environment is in everyone's interest. This is a provision of Bill 
C-64 on employment equity.
<P>
	Unlike in the first few years when it was enforced, the law is no 
longer perceived strictly as an anti-discrimination device. It is seen 
as an important component of sound management and enforcement 
of a human resources management policy.
<P>
	When we stop to think about it, there is a cost attached to 
delaying employment equity. If it is true that handicapped people, 
people with functional limitations who can hold a job are denied 
this opportunity, if it is true that these people represent 15 per cent 
of the Canadian population and that 60 to 80 per cent of them are 
unemployed, we must realize that there is a cost attached to this 
because the productivity they could contribute to Canadian society 
is lost to us as a society.
<P>
	Provisions like this one in the employment equity bill are to be 
commended.
<P>
	What pleased committee members the most-and this was also 
one of the recommendations adopted by the previous committee in 
the previous Parliament during the five year review-is that the 
Employment Equity Act will now apply to the public service of 
Canada as a whole.
<P>
	The act previously applied to perhaps 5 per cent of employees 
working for some 300 employers. This act will now apply to twice 
as many workers, since the entire public service of Canada, which 
employs close to 300,000 people, will now be subject to it.
<P>
	Of course-and we agree with this-, provision has been made 
for some organizations that will now be subject to Treasury Board 
regulations because of certain strategic imperatives concerning 
them. These organizations include the Communications Security 
Establishment, the RCMP, the Canadian Forces and the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	All committee members expressed the wish to be subject to the 
Employment Equity Act once the amendments have been made.
<P>
	I heard on several occasions a fallacious, hypocritical, deceitful 
and dishonest argument from our Reform colleagues, who told us 
that employment equity meant hiring incompetent people.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	That is the basic argument that was used throughout our 
deliberations by our colleagues from the Reform Party, who do not 
support Bill C-64. This argument does not stand up to analysis 
however, because the legislator provides in the bill, more exactly in 
clause 56, that this is not employment equity.
<P>
	It provides for three things. Employers to whom the legislation 
will apply because they have 100 employees or more are told that 
employment equity does not entail opening new jobs. We can 
appreciate that, in the current economic conditions, not all 
industrial sectors are experiencing growth.
<P>
	In fact, you must admit that the government's financial plan is 
rather shabby, despicable and mediocre. One cannot ask that new 
jobs be created for the sake of implementing an employment equity 
policy. Employment equity does not mean creating new jobs, no 
more than it means setting quotas. There is no mention of this in 
the bill and I think it is ill-advised to say otherwise.
<P>
	How will all that work in everyday life? What employers are 
asked to do is to prepare an annual employment equity plan and file 
it by June 30 with the human resources directorate. This plan must 
contain three things, more or less. It will have to set out how the 
workforce composition will be assessed. Having assessed the 
composition of the workforce within his business, where 
underrepresentation has been identified, the employer will be 
required to set out what measures he intends to take in order to 
remedy the situation both qualitatively and quantitatively.
<P>
	That is a major change introduced by the bill. Not only is the 
employer required to assess quantitatively the composition of his 
workforce, but he can also provide qualitative information, which 
was not the case previously.
<P>
	We are dissatisfied with certain aspects regarding the 
employment equity plan. Personally, I would have liked this plan to 
be prepared and implemented jointly by union and management, as 
a requirement. We have presented amendments to make this a joint 
responsibility, a mandatory and binding responsibility, because we 
do not think that employment equity is possible unless it is 
something that all parties want and agree to.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated and I think that the 
government made a major mistake there because there was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15335"> 15335 </A></B>
<P>
consensus among the interested parties about this provision. In 
addition, we would have liked that a copy of the employment 
equity plan be distributed to each employee and the contents of the 
plan to be posted in common display areas, as provided for in the 
Canada Labour Code for instance, where the employer is required 
to post his policy regarding sexual harassment.
<P>
	We believe that the bill would have been greatly improved as a 
result, had the government bowed to the opposition's arguments. 
Unfortunately, this has not been the case and we were told, quite 
wrongly I would say, that the employment equity plan would 
contain strategic information, information which, by virtue of its 
highly confidential nature, could put the businesses' competitive 
position at risk. To this, the unions and our party naturally replied: 
``But if all employers are subject to the same requirements and all 
of them have the same plan and are willing to make it available 
within the organization, it is hard to believe that some of them 
could be penalized, since this standardized policy would be 
implemented across the board''.
<P>
	To conclude, let me say that it is with great pleasure that we 
support a bill which, without being perfect, is a major step forward 
as far as employment equity is concerned.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have worked with the hon. member for Hochelaga for 
the last couple of years and I know him to be a very earnest, honest, 
hard working and credible person. I know that when he speaks 
about this employment equity legislation he is speaking from the 
heart, that he really does think this will improve society in Canada 
and prevent discrimination.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member what he thinks will happen as a 
direct result of this legislation when people who are just as 
qualified, not more or not less qualified, are denied a job or 
advancement because of the colour of their skin, because of their 
race, because of their gender. Does the hon. member feel this will 
contribute to hard feelings, contribute to discrimination and plant 
seeds of dissension that would not otherwise be in our society?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his good words. I think exactly the same of him. It was a pleasure to 
work with him, because he seems to represent the progressive wing 
of his caucus. That wing is not as important as it should be, but that 
issue will not be solved at this level.
<P>
	I want to give him an example. It goes without saying that if we 
agree with employment equity, we support the objective of making 
more room for designated groups.  Let me give a concrete example 
which is related to my personal life.
<P>
	I have a twin brother who suffers from cerebral palsy, and I am 
convinced that he wants to earn a living, just like I do. He is as 
intelligent, hard working and willing as I am. Had it not been for 
the fact that a number of organizations have specific policies 
urging employers to hire persons with disabilities, my brother 
would probably never have found work. We have to recognize that 
it is not a natural tendency for an employer to hire handicapped 
people. Nor is it a natural tendency to hire members of a visible 
minority group. Employers are still very reluctant to hire women 
who might give birth in the near future.
<P>
	When my twin brother was hired, had he been chosen instead of 
an able-bodied person, that person might have resented the fact and 
that would have been understandable. However, we must go 
beyond such considerations, which means that, in a number of 
cases, preferential treatment should be given to the four designated 
groups mentioned in the legislation. I agree with that principle.
<P>
	The minor distinction which I would make is that, in order to 
achieve genuine and real employment equity, it is necessary that 
when people apply for a job, their application be reviewed based on 
their ability to do that job. When my disabled brother was hired, he 
had the basic skills required to perform the duties involved.
<P>
	The bill includes a very explicit provision which provides that an 
employer is not required to hire unqualified persons. It can be 
assumed that, given personnel management policies, employers 
conducting interviews to recruit staff will reject applicants who are 
not deemed qualified. However, when a number of people have 
equal skills, including persons with disabilities, then a collective 
effort should be made to help these persons get the job.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the hon. member if this employment 
equity legislation will address an issue of discrimination by using 
discrimination itself.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	Although the legislation as he interprets it may not be doing that, 
we do have a situation in which those who are not covered by 
employment equity legislation are being told not to even bother 
applying for some of these positions that are open because they 
happen to fall outside of the categories of this protection.
<P>
	How fair is it to not even be considered for a job? I am referring 
to the RCMP as a prime example. I have had a number of young 
men complain because they have been turned away at the door 
from even applying because they do not fit into this little category. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15336"> 15336 </A></B>
<P>
How fair is it to those  individuals to be denied even the 
opportunity of applying to see if they are equally capable of doing 
the job?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, like my colleague, I will admit that 
some people are being frustrated. Let me say this to her.
<P>
	It seems to me that it would be a great deal easier as 
parliamentarians to reach a consensus on the justification for an 
employment equity act if we were in a context of job creation. 
Surely, we must hope that there are enough jobs to go around. The 
misfortune at this time, the reason there has been the heavy 
backlash on employment equity, is that there are too few jobs 
available and that the jobs available are not accessible to everyone.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member on this. Where our opinions 
diverge is that over here in my seat for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve I 
feel that a full employment policy is not possible in a country that 
stretches across a whole continent, as Canada does. Those 
countries that have adopted successful employment 
policies-because trade is a worldwide affair, but unemployment is 
not, and I would be delighted if we could have the 5 or 6 per cent 
unemployment they have in Austria and other countries-are small 
countries with populations of seven, eight or ten million and 
countries with great cohesiveness. And Quebec possesses those 
characteristics.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5), we will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I pay tribute to a program in my riding called the 
Community Academic Services Program, CASP. It is a community 
program dedicated to upgrading adults in English and math up to 
the grade nine level by setting up classrooms in community 
facilities such as church basements, Lion's clubs and schools. It is 
province-wide and has been very successful in helping people gain 
new skills.
<P>
	CASP was recently awarded the UNESCO international award 
for literacy at the Beijing world conference on women. The 
importance of literacy cannot be overstated. It is an essential tool in 
increasing employment opportunities and improving the quality of 
life for people across the country.
<P>
	I congratulate Maryanne Bourgeois and her staff from Literacy 
New Brunswick in particular for their hard work and dedication. As 
a member of the Fredericton Community Literacy Committee and 
as someone who has  been involved with CASP from the beginning, 
I am encouraged to see the program is getting international

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this National AIDS awareness week has given us 
members the opportunity to reflect on this significant problem for 
society, as between 42,000 and 45,000 Canadians and Quebecers 
are now infected with HIV.
<P>
	It is our duty to step up our efforts to eradicate HIV transmission 
and to ensure that infected individuals receive the support they 
require. The battle against AIDS, however, also includes a battle 
against homophobia, and that is precisely the theme of the 1995 
awareness campaign.
<P>
	Putting an end to homophobia requires a positive atmosphere, an 
atmosphere of solidarity toward those who are seropositive, and a 
positive representation of homosexuality. My closing wish is that 
all members of this House will contribute to overcoming 
homophobia and thus to winning the battle against AIDS.

Liberal members who have really stood out in this session.
<P>
	First, we would like to thank all of those unknown backbenchers 
for filibustering the government's own pre-referendum stay asleep 
``snooze bar'' legislation.
<P>
	Second, we would like to thank the Minister of Finance for his 
Walter Mitty, feel good, two-year revolving target approach to 
fiscal forecasting which if nothing else will make weather

<P>
	Third, we would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for 
helping us put together a working definition of the term racist. 
Thanks to her we now know that a racist is an individual who is 
winning an argument against a Liberal.
<P>
	Finally, thanks go to the minister of HRD whose job creation 
initiatives have ensured that thousands of young Canadians will 
utter the words ``do you want fries with that'' upon graduation from 
university.
<P>
	We would like to thank the Minister of Justice for his unwanted

environmental groups will soon begin a cross-country tour of the 
United States to gather support for the declaration of the Arctic 
national wildlife refuge as a United States national monument and 
for the protection of the area from exploitation.
<P>
	The wildlife refuge is a primary calving ground of the Porcupine 
caribou herd which migrates across the Yukon-Alaska border. This 
herd is unique and constitutes an irreplaceable national treasure 
while providing subsistence for First Nations people.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the American president have said they 
support the protection of the herd. In recent statements the 
president has said he supports the establishment of a national 
monument. However the U.S. Congress wants to open the area to 
oil and gas development.
<P>

public support for the national monument declaration and by 
reaffirming Canada's commitment to protect the herd.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I 
gave a flu shot to Bob Marks, director of the Canadian Lung 
Association. With that one shot Bob got protection for the whole 
winter. However Bob alone does not benefit from that shot; all of 
society does.
<P>
	Over 2,000 Canadians a year die from pneumonia and influenza. 
The number of work days lost due to flu and the cost to business 
and the health care system are exorbitant. Yet only 33 per cent of at 
risk Canadians take advantage of this protection.
<P>
	During October, National Immunization Month, we are changing 
that. We are asking Canadians to do themselves a favour by getting 
a flu shot.
<P>
	Polio used to paralyse our children. Not any more. Diphtheria 
and whooping cough caused death among our young. Not any 
more. National immunization programs put an end to those days. 
Now we are on guard against influenza. In every province 
thousands of at risk seniors, the chronically ill, children and HIV 
positive patients can get free flu shots because it is good preventive 
medicine.
<P>
	As a physician I ask every member of the House to recognize 
National Immunization Month by getting a flu shot. I will give it to 
them personally. Let us all say no to the flu.

Speaker, today I wear this red ribbon in remembrance of those who 
have died of AIDS and for the approximately 16,000 Canadians 
who have been diagnosed with the HIV-AIDS virus.
<P>
	The AIDS virus has most seriously affected the homosexual 
community. However the virus does not discriminate on the basis 
of gender or sexual orientation as many women and children have 
died of the virus in addition to the thousands of men.
<P>
	While our views may vary one thing is very clear. Those who 
suffer from AIDS are human beings. They deserve our support and 
compassion.
<P>
	I applaud Canadian researchers for their relentless search for a 
cure. While progress is being made every effort must be made 
through education and lifestyle change to stop the deadly 
transmission of the disease.
<P>
	As we take time this week to support AIDS awareness and 
education programs, I encourage every member of the House to 
inform themselves about the disease so as to eradicate prejudice 
and homophobia and treat those suffering with AIDS with the 
dignity and compassion they so rightly deserve.

commend the auditor general on his study on environmental 
management systems and its recent release. The co-operative effort 
of the many government departments involved in the project 
should be acknowledged. It is a good example of the wide range of 
initiatives in which all parts of the government are sharing 
information and best practices to green government operations in 
as rapid and cost effective a manner as possible.
<P>

operations initiative, has established guidelines for all federal 
departments to follow in order to integrate environmental 
considerations in their operations.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>

	The auditor general has provided us with a useful study. 
Implementing an environmental management system is a vital first

commitment to Canadians to make sustainable development a

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the secret document prepared for Operation Unity by 
Industry Canada, that, in the event of Quebec sovereignty, because 
the aerospace industry worldwide maintains close relations with 
their respective governments, if the governments of Quebec and 
Canada can maintain co-operative relations in this sector, the 
aerospace industry will not be affected. The document also 
indicates that partnership is more the rule than the exception in this 
industry, throughout the world generally. It seems clear that, in the 
country's national interest, Canada will try to negotiate a 
partnership with Quebec in the aerospace sector.
<P>
	The blackmail, intimidation and threat of reprisals have to stop. 
It is time Quebecers were told the truth, and the truth is that a 
partnership is not only possible but desirable for both Canada and 
Quebec. Canada will negotiate a partnership agreement with 
Quebec not out of charity for its former province, but because it is 
in the national interest to do so.

Men received $10,000; the prisoners with HIV-AIDS support

$117,000; and let us not forget that pauper of the financial industry, 
the Royal Bank of Canada that received $55,000.
<P>
	The only thing that Canadians are asking is that their tax dollars 
be spent responsibly. This is a minute part of the $10 billion of

Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan was officially opened in Saskatoon 
to serve businesswomen in rural and urban communities across the 
province.
<P>
	Women entrepreneurs enjoy an enviable success rate in business. 
In spite of this they have historically faced obstacles which often 
prevented them from getting started in the first place such as banks 
demanding a  husband's signature on a loan, high interest rates or 
excessive collateral. We must factor in as well fear of the unknown 
and isolation resulting from lack of business networks.
<P>
	The women entrepreneurs office, funded by western economic 
diversification, will go a long way to breaking down the barriers by 
providing loans at market interest rates, advisory services, 
mentoring and seminars related to entrepreneurship and business 
skills.

should there be a breakdown in the co-operation between federal 
research institutions based in Quebec and those located in the rest 
of Canada, the scientific and technological efforts of the two states

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, contrary to what the hon. member for Roberval says, we 
are not hiding a thing. We announced our schedule for transfers to 
the provinces at the beginning of our mandate. We gave them three 
years. We told them from the outset: we will continue to increase a 
little bit next year, and that was 1994, and then in 1995 we will go 
on increasing, and the cuts will come in 1996 and 1997.
<P>
	However, next year the subsidies we pay will still be higher than 
they were at the time we formed the government. The Minister of 
Finance explained to the provinces that he would give them time to 
adjust and that he would even continue to increase payments during 
the first two years. However, they were told to expect adjustments.
<P>
	The provinces were aware of this and initiated their own cuts. 
For instance, last year in December, Quebec's health minister 
announced cuts totalling $500 million. We still gave slightly more 
than the previous year, but he made cuts. Obviously, everyone has 
to make adjustments. Provincial governments across Canada are 
making  adjustments. The Government of Quebec has started to do 
so as well, and it will have to make more adjustments after the 
referendum.
<P>
	We told all provincial governments ahead of time what to expect. 
I think this is all very fair and very open and shows a government 
that has absolutely nothing to hide before, during or even after the 
referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> In fact, Mr. Speaker, it 
is the future we want to talk about. The Prime Minister seems to 
appreciate talking about that.
<P>
	We know that in the future, the federal government is planning 
cuts in unemployment insurance and old age pensions. We found 
that out last week here in the House, but the bad news will not come 
until after the referendum.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister agree that by attacking the most 
vulnerable members of our society with cuts in his own programs 
that are targeted to the needy, he is hitting them twice with cuts in 
payments to Quebec that will total between $1.9 and $2.5 billion in 
two years' time, which will force the Quebec government to add to 
the cuts made by the federal government? Does he not realize he is 
hitting the neediest in our society from both sides?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, the unemployment insurance program was 
explained in the budget, and we are preparing legislation that will 
be tabled very shortly.
<P>
	Just this morning I received a call from a provincial premier who 
wanted to see me to discuss the legislation, and who begged me not 
to go ahead immediately because he had a number of 
representations to make.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	I told him: ``Fine. As soon as I have time, we will have a 
meeting, and we will table the bill as soon as possible, because we 
want people to have time to discuss it''.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to senior citizens. I made it clear here 
in the House that we have no intention of affecting senior citizens. I 
made that quite clear. But I also said that we will have to make sure 
we can still pay the old age pensions of the people who will retire in 
2005 and 2010. Good government means planning for the future. 
And people who are retired now do not have to worry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15341"> 15341 </A></B>
<P>
	We want to be able to pay old age pensions in 2005, 2010 and 
2015 because many of us will still be here, although there may not 
be that many on the other side, and we have to consider the future. 
As far as pensioners are concerned, they do not have to worry, I 
made that clear, and old age pensioners will not be affected, not in 
November and not in the finance minister's next budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
Prime Minister admit that at the rate the federal  government says it 
will cut transfers to the provinces, in other words, money used by 
the provinces for social programs and education, at the rate the 
federal government plans to cut these expenditures, according to 
our most accurate estimates-although the criteria have not yet 
been released, but we tried a series of criteria that seemed 
likely-we can say that in four years time, if Quebecers say no in 
the referendum and decide to stay in the federal system, in four 
years time the federal government will no longer pay a cent in 
transfer payments for social programs, education and social 
assistance, and on top of that, under the tax points system, 
Quebecers would again have to send part of the province's tax 
revenues to Ottawa to help fund social programs in the other 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, under the present 
system, there is a decline in the amounts to be spent on transfers to 
the provinces.
<P>
	That being said, one of the reasons we decided to proceed with 
these reforms, and this was explained by the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Health, and I said it myself here in this House, was 
to reverse this trend while maintaining a certain level of money in 
these transfers. In other words, we intend to freeze these amounts 
to stop this decline, for reasons we discussed with the provinces, in 
other words, the federal government firmly intends to remain 
involved in improving social programs in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the documents attached to the last federal budget mention 
that transfers to the provinces will be cut by $2.5 billion in 1996-97 
and $4.5 billion in 1997-98. In 1997-98, if the federal government 
distributes the Canada social transfer on the basis of population, as 
suggested on page 40 of the federal budget speech, Quebec alone 
will absorb over 40 per cent of the $4.5 billion in cuts.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that, on the eve of the 
referendum, he has a duty to stop hiding his intentions from 
Quebecers by disclosing publicly how the federal government 
intends to distribute among the provinces the $4.5 billion in cuts 
planned for 1997-98, so that Quebecers will know the real impact 
of federal policies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and I intend to sit down with 
provincial officials to determine how the country and the provinces 
can restructure their finances.
<P>
	That said, the hon. member has just quoted figures that have 
been used by other separatists. As I said before in this House, they 
are basing their arguments on something that is quite preposterous.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a revelation. I did not know that the Minister of 
Finance was a separatist, as these are his figures.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister confirm that, whatever the distribution 
criteria adopted, in 1997-98 alone, Quebec will be deprived of 
between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion for the funding of its social 
programs? The PQ government was not the only one to predict 
these cuts. His friends in the Liberal Party in Quebec, including his 
colleague, the current Minister of Labour, said the same thing when 
they were in power.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I said before, the 
hon. member's analysis is quite preposterous. It is quite clear that 
no decision has been made on distribution. Second, I think that the 
hon. member should also consider equalization, which is a very 
important factor.
<P>
	The hon. member seems unwilling to talk about it, but let me tell 
you that, in 1996-97 for example, equalization payments to Quebec 
will amount to $4 billion or 42 per cent of federal equalization 
payments to the provinces.

The government's record on Somalia is not terribly open, but 
openly terrible.

	This week we have seen evidence that national defence

investigate itself. We have evidence that Lieutenant-Colonel 
Kenward destroyed evidence and obstructed justice. The

Labbé uttered unlawful commands. His punishment, he has been

disappointed that he would ask that sort of a question. He talks 
about openness. The government has no axe to grind. We want the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government has gone kicking and screaming into 
the Somalia commission. We in the Reform Party are the ones who 
demanded a commission of inquiry.
<P>
	The Somalia commission, which the minister called only after 
pressure from this party, is headed by top-notch people and will 
come to its conclusions in due course. There is a complete 
abdication of leadership within the Department of National 
Defence. The Prime Minister's expression of confidence in the 
minister and the chief of defence staff cannot change that fact.
<P>
	Officers are named in police reports. They are implicated in 
criminal activities, falsifying documents and offering incentives to 
subordinates to commit murder. Does the minister consider these to 
be examples of good leadership?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am surprised, disappointed and somewhat disillusioned 
not only by the tenor of the question but by some of the

<P>
	The members of the third party talk about calling for this inquiry. 
I happen to have personal knowledge and I will inform the House

for this inquiry in April 1993.
<P>

it wanted an internal investigation. It was only under our pressure 
that the government opened up the investigation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that these troubles occurred under the 
previous government. Yet after two years nothing has been done to 
fix the problems. If the minister knew previously of the evidence

like that.
<P>
	The member talks like that about the Canadian Armed Forces 
which have been an honour to all Canadians. Those Canadians have 
been doing a great job in Yugoslavia for the past three and one-half 
years, yet a former member of the armed forces is using those kinds 
of words about his colleagues who were with him in the army, who 
have always been a great part of the Canadian strength. We have 
the best soldiers in the world.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The federal government reallocates to the Quebec government, 
in the form of transfer payments, a portion of the taxes collected 
from Quebecers. As a result of the numerous cuts made by the 
federal government, the amounts handed back to Quebec are 
constantly being reduced, and transfer payments have become an 
unstable and inadequate source of funds for Quebec.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance confirm that, since 1980, the 
proportion of Quebec's revenues coming from federal transfer 
payments, including equalization, has dropped by 28 per cent and 
that the situation will get progressively worse as a result of the last 
federal budget given that, by 1997-98, transfer payments from 
Ottawa will account for only 12.7 per cent of Quebec's revenues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, again-and this is 
unfortunate-separatists do not have a firm grasp of figures.
<P>
	At present, while receiving approximately $29 billion from 
Quebec, we give that province approximately $41 billion, which

	Since it is becoming increasingly obvious that, within four years, 
Quebec will no longer receive any money from Ottawa for social 
program funding-I repeat, social program funding-how can the 
minister justify his plans to set up new structures and implement 
new manpower training initiatives that will increase duplication, 
when these structures and initiatives are to be funded from

repeat the same thing. The government, the Prime Minister, the

set the amount to be transferred to the provinces, including Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development on behalf of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	A new poll shows that only 19 per cent of Canadians under age 
50 expect to get anything out of the Canada pension plan when they 
retire. Their confidence in the plan has gone down since the 
Liberals replaced the Tories in 1993.
<P>
	Does the government have any plans at all to correct the Canada 
pension plan problem? What will it do to assure Canadian workers 
and employers that the money they are contributing to this plan is 
not just going down the tubes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a curious question about 
money in the Canada pension plan going down the tube. The money 
goes to provide for retirement security for senior citizens. It goes to 
provide for a basic income benefit for disabled Canadians. It goes 
to provide a basic benefit for widows and their children.
<P>
	The Reform Party's proposals as it puts them forward would 
mean a substantial reduction for disabled Canadians, a substantial 
reduction for widows, and a substantial reduction for 1.8 million 
pensioners. How can the hon. member stand up and tell us to do 
something to  protect the system when his own party is proposing a 
way of slashing the program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the difference 
between the Liberals and the Reformers is that we would have a 
plan that would be actuarially sound. This one has never been 
sound. The Liberals were informed of that when they first brought 
in this plan. They fired the adviser who gave them that advice 30 
years ago.
<P>
	I ask again: What will the government do specifically to make 
the Canada pension plan actuarially and mathematically sound and 
sustainable? That is what Canadians demand.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member well 
knows, we announced in the last budget that we would be 
presenting a paper containing a series of proposals as to how we 
can deal with the sustainability of the Canada pension plan. The 
Minister of Finance will be meeting with his counterparts later this 
year to talk about this. As the hon. member should know, this is not 
just a federal government plan but one we share with the provinces. 
It is a joint plan and therefore we have to make those kinds of 
arrangements.
<P>
	Let me give the member one very quick example of the kind of 
measures we are taking. On July 1, I announced a series of changes 
to the Canada pension plan that will allow those with disabilities to 
go back to work so that they can have a bigger incentive to be 
employed and not simply draw the benefit. It once again goes to the 
very heart and soul of what we are trying to do in our reform which 
is to provide for economic security by giving people a good chance 
at a job.

dip in unemployment after ten months of zero net employment 
growth in Canada, we find that the unemployment rate among 
those under the age of 25 has again increased. Even those who 
manage to find work are often in an extremely precarious position. 
In fact, this is the lowest level of youth activity in the labour market

situation has deteriorated since the Liberals came to office, with 
27,000 fewer jobs for young people since November 1993. Is he 
prepared to acknowledge this?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

not correct. The unemployment rate has gone down for young 
people but not sufficiently so. Looking at the figures, one of the 
reasons is that still far too many young people are dropping out of 
school far too early and therefore do not have the required skills to 
get a job.
<P>
	That is the reason the government introduced the youth 
internship program. It is a partnership with the private sector to 
create opportunities enabling young people to move from school to 
work with a full transition in a partnership way. This year over

why?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought 
my question was why we are ferrying immigrants around town in 
limousines, not about open government.

Immigration spent $200,000 at Big Bill's Furniture and Mattress

settlement services and what we do for immigrants coming to

	This shows that the fear of the jobless recovery is not quite 
accurate. The reality of the Canadian economy, through the kind of 
stimulus that has been provided by the Minister of Finance in his 
budgets and in other areas, is that manufacturing and exports are 
leading job recovery in this country. That is why we have to 
continue to provide that enormous support and confidence. That is 
the most important key to creating jobs.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
earlier in question period I think that most Canadians would have 
been appalled to see the Prime  Minister defending some of the 
things going on at DND by wrapping himself in the name of the 
peacekeepers and the job they are doing, putting their lives in 
danger, trying to defend the country.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister really think that when we read about the 
stonewalling of police investigations, about the cover-up of 
criminal activity, and about the falsifying of documents this in any 
way does any service to the men on the ground who are defending 
Canada and trying to keep peace in foreign countries?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have said to the House many times that we initiated the 
public inquiry into the matter. Now I see the Reform Party is taking 
credit for that.
<P>
	I was in opposition when the parliamentary secretary was on his 
feet asking for an inquiry. We are having a public inquiry and all 
the documents are available.
<P>
	Of course there are problems in the army. In any department 
there are problems. We are working to solve them. We will accept 
the recommendations if they are valid and we will change what has 
to be changed.
<P>
	To try to create the impression that we have a terrible army in 
Canada when it is lauded by everybody around the world I think is 
going the wrong way.
<P>
	The young member has a lot of personal ambition. He should tell 
his colleagues to slow down, because there will not be much of a 
Reform Party very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
Canadians know it is not the army that is terrible, it is the Minister 
of National Defence's running of that portfolio.
<P>
	We have been pursuing this inquiry. The opposition Liberals, as 
he knows, called for this two years ago. We had to call for it for 
nearly two years before we got it.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is the Minister of National 
Defence has been sitting on this material, which has been under his 
nose for two years. Was there complicity in this? Did he know this 
was happening, or was he simply incompetent and did not provide 
this material in the first two years of this administration?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence got up many times in the 
House and explained that under the laws of this land when there 
were cases in front of the military courts we could not proceed with 
an inquiry because it could have invalidated trials that were going 
on. It is the way we operate. There were some charges against some 
military people and we could not have a public inquiry on the same 
element of proof because it would have been used by the different 
lawyers or the prosecution to destroy the case.

With time, when he gains experience, he will know the law of the 
land a bit better and perhaps one day he will be ready to take over 
what will be left, if anything, of the Reform Party.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. In Quebec, there are 25 federal 
research facilities employing 3,000 workers, which represents 13.4 
per cent of the jobs in federal facilities of this type in Canada, 
whereas, in Ontario, the Chalk River nuclear research centre alone 
employs 2,227 people. Overall, federal centres employ 11,000 
researchers and technicians in Ontario.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal 
government has consistently penalized Quebec in the area of 
research and development, undermining its scientific and 
economic development? Would he also explain why, under such 
conditions, he is cutting funding for research in the DIPP program, 
which is crucial to the aerospace industry located primarily in 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as regards the DIPP, the hon. member should be aware 
that, in recent years, nearly 50 per cent of funding has gone to 
Quebec, to business in Quebec.
<P>
	We have to be realistic when we talk about the DIPP, because we 
have long known the size of the defence industry in Quebec. When 
the transition was made with the DIPP funds, almost 50 per cent of 
these funds were in fact paid to businesses in Quebec.
<P>
	As far as research and development is concerned, we 
acknowledge that the proportion spent in Quebec is approximately 
25 per cent, which is still very close to the proportion of the 
population.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
Quebec we receive only 17 per cent of funds intended for research 
and development. According to the Minister of Finance, the figure 
is 13 per cent.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister justify this imbalance between 
Quebec and Ontario in the distribution of federal research 
facilities, whereas Hull, Gatineau and Aylmer are within the 
National Capital Region and could have received a greater 
proportion of these facilities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has 
repeatedly explained, there are a whole lot of people in the greater 
metropolitan area of Ottawa-Hull working at research and 
development centres. Let us leave this aside.
<P>
	The hon. member should note that, even though the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Government of Quebec claim 17 per cent of 
federal funding for research and development goes to Quebec, we 
contend and are prepared to show proof that approximately 25 per 
cent of the Government of Canada's funding for research and 
development goes to Quebec.

they are in favour of having the freedom to sell their wheat and 
barley to any buyer, including the Canadian Wheat Board, into 
domestic and export markets-yes or no?
<P>
	In response, the federal minister of agriculture states the Alberta 
plebiscite will not be the last word on this issue. When will the

have a plebiscite across the whole Canadian Wheat Board area to 
settle this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister of 
agriculture has made it very clear for a number of months that 
farmers will be involved in the future of the Canadian Wheat Board 
in Canada.
<P>
	To emphasize that, he has recently put in place a very expert 
panel to go right across western Canada to talk to farmers, chat 
with farmers, and consult with farmers in all of the industry about 
their views on the future of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	We will continue to deal with everyone and consult with 
everyone in the industry in order to talk about and deal with the 
future of that great wheat board.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, panels, 
studies, commissions and reports, and it has been two years and 
nothing has been done.
<P>
	Alberta farmers are being asked for their opinion on the issue 
because the Alberta government believes that farmers have the 
right to make this decision. Who will have the last word on whether 
farmers should have the freedom to sell their wheat and barley into 
all markets? Will it be the farmers or will it be this father knows 
best minister of agriculture?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. 
member that farmers will be consulted. I also remind the hon.

supports them in this.

<P>
	Although I recognize that there has been a substantial increase in 
exploration expenditures in the mining industry in the last few 
years, there are still some serious impediments to investment. 
What does the government intend to do to help Canada's 
investment climate in mining?
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. First, it gives me an opportunity to express our 
condolences to the families and friends of those nine people who 
lost their lives in the helicopter crash in Kyrgyzstan. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with them at this very difficult time.
<P>
	Second, it gives me an opportunity give some good news to the 
House. We are having excellent results as far as mining is 
concerned in Canada, with exploration expenditure up 32 per cent 
in 1994 and it looks like it will go to $675 million this year. Twenty 
mines are opening and only two closing permanently, and there are 
2,000 to 3,000 new employees in the mining industry.
<P>
	This is all due to the excellent financial position the Minister of 
Finance has set out for the country, the Whitehorse mining 
initiative, and the efforts of the government to build a more 
innovative society and remove the overlap and duplication in our 
regulatory regimes. Science and technology is leading the way in 
this industry.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, since the inception of the Canadian nuclear program, 
the federal government has spent over $12 billion on nuclear 
research and development, mostly in favour of the Ontario nuclear 
industry, of course. Through its subsidies worth $175 million a 
year, the federal government has created an industry that now 
employs, directly or indirectly, 60,000 people in Ontario.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. How does the Prime 
Minister explain the fact that the federal government has provided 
such large subsidies for electricity generation in Ontario, when 
Quebec has never  received anything from the federal government 
to generate its own electricity?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the development of a nuclear industry in Ontario came 
about because that province had fewer hydroelectric resources than 
Quebec. Canada's development is based on potential, resources and 
population. I am sure that some provinces did not receive anything 
for nuclear energy development because they do not have the 
necessary resources.
<P>
	Quebec received federal assistance. Hydro-Quebec has nuclear 
facilities in Gentilly. Quebec got its share, but the fact is that it did 
not need as much nuclear energy as Ontario. That is the way it is in 
Canada. This is a diversified country. Although we are trying to 
distribute everything among the various parts of Canada, some 
things cannot be distributed solely on the basis of population, as I 
was saying the other day. We are not about to start digging rivers in 
Saskatchewan so we can give that province its share of the national 
ports budget.

Canadians.
<P>
	The Krever commission is investigating the state of our national 
blood supply. Recent reports have revealed deep organizational 
breakdowns within the system.
<P>
	Canadians want action now. Their health continues to be 
threatened by leaks in the blood supply system. Last week here in 
Ottawa about 1,800 units had to be recalled because of a 
breakdown in that system after it was learned that some units had 
not been tested for hepatitis B.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Now Canadians are outraged to hear through the Krever inquiry 
that a U.S. drug company was allowed to distribute AIDS tainted 
blood products in Canada that affected six British Columbians 
including five children.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House and Canadians what plans if 
any she has to reform the system and implement the commission's 
recommendations in order to restore confidence in our national 
blood supply system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member will know that we have not waited for the Krever 
commission to begin to do some work within the blood supply 
system. We are nevertheless funding the Krever inquiry.
<P>

resources in the Bureau of Biologics. We have increased the

a year. We have made it possible  for the results of these inspections 
to be made public. We have set up an advisory committee on blood 
issues so we can keep ourselves informed.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTEQUITYACT">EMPLOYMENT EQUITY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-64, 
an act respecting employment equity, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
my comments today on Bill C-64 I want to focus on one important 
point. This employment equity legislation is a Canadian answer to 
a Canadian reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That Canadian reality is that persons in designated groups are 
not doing as well as they should in our labour force, given their 
qualifications.
<P>
	That Canadian reality is that many instances of systemic 
discrimination can still be found.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I refer to a study released only last week by Simon Fraser 
University which states very clearly that male immigrants who are 
members of a visible minority earn 15 per cent less than white 
males born in Canada with the same education, in the same 
industry and in the same city.
<P>
	We have heard a lot of debate on Bill C-64 that seems to deny 
that there is a problem, that action is necessary and that leadership 
by the Government of Canada is necessary. While it is a lot less 
nasty, to quote the same study, white immigrants still earn 2 per 
cent less than native born Canadians.
<P>
	The figures become quite substantial. Let me quote: ``Mean 
earnings of immigrant male members of visible minorities were 
down 22.6 per cent from those of Canadian born white males''.
<P>
	We could talk about each of the designated groups and make it 
clear that in the private and public sectors being well qualified is 
not enough if a person happens to be a member of a visible 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15350"> 15350 </A></B>
<P>
minority, a woman, an aboriginal or a person with a disability. 
Those things work against them. They seem to cloud perception of 
their ability to  do the job and to take on more senior 
responsibilities. It happens throughout every sector of the 
economy.
<P>
	Let me come back to the Canadian reality. The Canadian reality 
is that our citizens want and deserve a country that breaks down 
these barriers to success. Two years ago that is what our country 
offered to Canadians and ever since we have been living up to our 
commitment.
<P>
	Let me go back to the red book. It offered a vision of Canada 
with the economic strength it deserves and the social strength that 
draws us together as a community. At the beginning of the red 
book, the man whom Canadians chose as their Prime Minister and 
whom they continue to support wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The result is a Liberal plan for Canada firmly anchored in the principle that 
governing is about people, and that government must be judged by its 
effectiveness in promoting human dignity, justice, fairness, and opportunity. 
This is our approach, and this election is about presenting that choice to 
Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Our platform was based on jobs and growth that would enrich 
everyone. We understood that people have expectations for their 
society, not just for their own wallets. That was why one of our 
commitments was a stronger employment equity act. We were 
determined that the federal government should do what it could to 
ensure that Canadians have a fair opportunity to get ahead in life. It 
draws on the willingness of employers to take a hard look at old 
practices and to move to a workplace that welcomes the talents of 
all our citizens.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Quite simply, this bill is about identifying and knocking over 
barriers that keep some people on the outside looking in or on the 
bottom looking up. It rests in the best tradition of opening the doors 
to full participation in Canadian society for all our citizens with all 
their diversity.
<P>
	That puts the members of the Reform Party in a bit of a bind as 
they debate Bill C-64.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They know that incompetent members of designated groups will 
not take over the workplace. They know that no arbitrary quotas 
will be imposed. They know that this bill takes into account the 
concerns voiced by small business. And they know that the bill is 
fair and reasonable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They are reduced to appealing to the worst in people instead of to 
the best. They are reduced to philosophical musings that are 
irrelevant to the case before the House and worst case, individual 
stories pulled from the murky depths of the American right wing. 
They cannot even get the name of this process right in their efforts 
to score political points. They seem to believe that if they use the 
term affirmative action they can polarize the debate.
<P>
	One of the most destructive things that can be done in a society 
or in a Parliament is to polarize the debate, to pit one group against 
another, rather than to build ties and mutual respect among us.
<P>
	If they want to talk about the American system, let us look at the 
record there and then let us compare it to what the government 
wants to do in this bill so that Canadians, despite the Reform Party 
members, will know the difference between the American system 
and ours.
<P>
	Some 30 years ago the United States began to come to grips with 
the impact of centuries of racial discrimination. By 1970 Richard 
Nixon brought in the first affirmative action policies for the U.S. 
government. Let me remind my hon. friends that Richard Nixon 
would never be called a bleeding heart, but he did what he knew 
was right at the time and what his society needed. Other 
governments, public and private institutions took similar steps.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the <I>New York Times</I> noted recently, this process has yielded 
results. ``In the past 20 years, it said, a substantial number of black 
families have been able to climb the social and professional ladder. 
While positive action is not the only reason for this, it certainly 
played a major role''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Has the American process been perfect? Has it been what we 
want to model ourselves on? Absolutely not. In some cases 
arbitrary approaches were imposed. There were decisions that 
struck those of us at a distance as odd and unfair. In response that 
American system too has evolved but they too know there is still 
much to do.
<P>
	Ask anyone who watched the public reaction to the Simpson trial 
and to the ultimate verdict. Race is still an issue in American life. 
The right wing there and their junior auxiliary in the Reform Party 
here cannot wish it away.
<P>
	I believe that Canada begins from a better starting point than the 
United States. We do not have a clean history when it comes to 
racism and discrimination but we do not have the same burden of 
history that the Americans do.
<P>
	Nonetheless there are barriers still to the full participation of 
members of designated groups in the economy and therefore to 
their full participation in society. Creating opportunity through 
ensuring fairness is the point of Bill C-64. We have chosen a 
Canadian approach. We have been guided by what works.
<P>
	I had to go back to the dictionary. After listening to the debate 
for several days, I was starting to question whether I really 
understood what the word equity means. This is the Employment 
Equity Act, not the employment special preference act, as the 
Reform would have us believe, not the employment discrimination 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15351"> 15351 </A></B>
<P>
act, as  Reform would have us believe. It is the Employment Equity 
Act.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Let me quote from the dictionary: equity; fairness. If one goes to 
the second definition, it says the application of the principles of 
justice. Equity; justice. Those are Canadian words. Those are 
words that Canadians have taken to their hearts and have identified 
now for decades as a fundamental of what this country is all about.
<P>
	Let me go to the word equality: the state of being equal. It is not 
one better than the other, but equal. That too is a term that our 
society and our country has stood for not only at home but around 
this globe.
<P>
	Our approach in the bill is founded on a human resources 
planning approach to workplace issues. It is founded on creating a 
climate that encourages diversity through real action, not empty 
rhetoric. It is founded on a compliance process that has been based 
on those best Canadian values of negotiation and co-operation.
<P>
	It is founded on giving employers the tools, the information and 
the incentive to recognize the ability in everybody who comes 
forward and applies for employment, in everybody who is in their 
employ and is looking for opportunities to advance and to improve.
<P>
	My colleagues on this side of the House have talked about how 
this system will work. We do not have to rely on speculation. This 
is not new legislation. With some minor changes in applying it to 
the public service, it is the same employment equity legislation that 
has been in place in Canada since 1987.
<P>
	My colleagues have talked about employers who see the value in 
this legislation to do the right thing. These employers have spoken 
of the flexibility and realism that is the foundation of our approach.
<P>
	I sat through weeks of hearings of the human rights committee 
where numerous employers' organizations came before us in 
support of the legislation. They were not in support of every detail 
of it. They asked for some changes and most have been made. Not 
every equity group approved of every detail in the legislation. They 
asked for some changes and some of those have been made.
<P>
	In true Canadian spirit, we are trying to achieve a progressive 
goal for all Canadians, a goal that is good for our economy, good 
for our society and good for individuals within our Canadian 
society.
<P>
	We have not, as always, done what everybody would have liked 
but we have reached the best accommodation possible of the many 
different interests involved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have taken a made in Canada approach to employment 
equity. Admittedly, there are problems, but we can find effective, 
sensible and user friendly ways of  dealing with these problems. 
This means no quotas, no reverse discrimination and no arbitrary 
preferential treatment. This means creating a fair and rational 
workplace for all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I ask the hon. members opposite to quit falling back on the tired 
slogans of American politics, to quit pretending that the Canadian 
way is the American way. It is not. Look to this country. Look to 
our reality. Look to a better future and more opportunity for all 
Canadians, not just the select few. Look to a solution that makes 
sense. That solution, I believe, is found in Bill C-64 and the 
continuation of employment equity in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member who just made her presentation spent some time talking 
about discrimination in Canada, saying that members of the 
Reform Party deny that there is discrimination. I do not think one 
Reform member of Parliament could be found who would deny that 
there is discrimination and that it is not a problem. I do not deny it 
and I do not think any of my colleagues would deny it.
<P>
	If discrimination finds its way into the workplace, as members of 
the Reform Party have said, it should be dealt with in a tough 
manner. We do not tolerate it and we must not tolerate it.
<P>
	The member also gave statistics to show that legislation is 
needed. I present a few statistics and ask the member to respond to 
them. These are from the 1994 employment equity report. The 
report said that 570,000 people are currently regulated by the 
present Employment Equity Act. The member spoke about this not 
being new legislation, that there is an Employment Equity Act in 
place. Of this number 45.6 per cent are women. In the Canadian 
workforce about 45.9 per cent are female. The difference between 
those in the employment equity program and those outside is .3 per 
cent.
<P>
	In total, women occupy 47 per cent of government jobs, while 
47.3 per cent are available for work. Again, a .3 per cent difference. 
The civilian staff of the RCMP is 82.6 per cent female; Citizenship 
Canada, 74 per cent female; Transport Canada, 75 per cent male. 
What are we going to do in these departments? Are we going to 
make sure we get the right quotas, get rid of women in one 
department and get rid of men in the other? What are we going to 
do?
<P>
	The overall statistics in government and outside government 
show the employment equity program has very little effect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15352"> 15352 </A></B>
<P>
	Before the member responds to these statistics, the polls 
consistently show that Canadians are against employment equity. 
Approximately 70 per cent to 80 per  cent of Canadians are against 
employment equity programs, such as this Liberal program.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member how the Liberals can totally 
disregard the will of a large majority of Canadians and ignore these 
polls on the issue when they are so willing to accept the results of 
their own polls on other issues?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only repeat that the Reform 
Party obviously needs to educate itself. The member for Vegreville 
just said ``if discrimination finds its way into the workplace''. It is 
impossible to look at any statistics from the workplace and not 
accept that discrimination finds its way into the workplace.
<P>
	I will quote some additional statistics from a recent report by 
Simon Fraser University. Canadian born Greek males earned 16.2 
per cent less than Canadian born males of British background. 
Even those earnings paled beside the ones for black and Filipino 
immigrant males who posted earnings that were respectively 21 per 
cent and 20.2 per cent lower than those for Canadian men of British 
background. Double jeopardy operates for women. Visible 
minority immigrant females earned 7.2 per cent less than white 
Canadian females. I therefore ask the hon. member to please take 
the if out of his statements about discrimination in the workplace.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Employment equity is not about being able to get a job; it is 
about having an equal opportunity to get as good a job if the person 
is as good. It is true that over 80 per cent of employees in the 
clerical category in the Government of Canada are women. Those 
happen to be the lowest paid jobs. That may be why there is such a 
high representation of women. Employment equity is about giving 
all groups the opportunity to earn the same as anybody of similar 
competence. Within that group of clerks the top levels are more 
likely to be occupied by men. Even within that group of clerks 
women are not allowed to progress.
<P>
	The member referred to the fact that equity has been achieved. It 
has not. Notwithstanding the qualifications, we must look at the 
quality and the rate of pay, rather than simply being able to access 
the lowest paid jobs.
<P>
	I sat through a couple of months of committee hearings on this 
bill. There was only one poll which came forward which said that 
Canadians were not in favour of equality in employment and it was 
a flawed poll. If the Reform Party had more polls with more 
validity to bring forward at any time during those hearings, it had 
every opportunity to do so, but it did not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
country is managed by statistics. The hon. member pulled out 
statistic after statistic about who is where in our society. I wish 
government members would go to their ridings and talk to the 
people one at a time.  Maybe then they would understand more 
about what is going on in the country.
<P>
	I am very happy to speak to Bill C-64, the legislation of a Liberal 
perfect world. It was interesting to hear the debate over the last two 
days, but it is somewhat disheartening. Let me go back to an issue 
which is somewhat related to this. Let us look at what the Liberals 
know about the workplace.
<P>
	Today in Halifax we learned of how the minister of patronage in 
Atlantic Canada is meddling in the job market. Surprise, surprise. 
Once again the friends of the minister have mismanaged millions 
of taxpayers' dollars at Cornwallis Park Development Agency in 
what has been called potentially the biggest boondoggle in the last 
two decades.
<P>
	Jobs, jobs, jobs. What does it mean to the Liberal minister for 
Atlantic Canada, the minister of public works? Once again we see 
that the minister of public works has his own version of job equity. 
A person has to belong to one of two categories in this country: 
either donate to the Liberals or become friends with one. That is the 
only way to have an equal shot at a job in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I do not think the government has any idea of what job equity is. 
Who a person knows and whom they donate to are what really 
count.
<P>
	The seeds of dissension are here among our young. They are not 
there for lack of a job equity bill; they are there because many of 
them see themselves as not being able to get jobs because of 
quotas. Government will deny the use of the word quota. I will 
explain exactly where I get this terminology: right out of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	This is social engineering at its worst. Ontario has just elected to 
do away with it. We are not talking about America, as one of our 
Liberal colleagues over there said. This is Ontario. Apparently 
there is a mismatch now. The Ontario government says it will do 
away with it while the Liberal government in Ottawa is about to 
impose it on the rest of Canada.
<P>
	It is also interesting that the last speaker from the Liberal Party 
said that we in the Reform Party talk about affirmative action 
which is all wrong. However, the Liberal member for Halifax in a 
partial quote said this morning, ``affirmative action would not be 
necessary if employment equity were in existence'' or something to 
that effect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> What is the difference?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is exactly what she was 
talking about and the other one said: ``You are talking about it over 
here''.
<P>
	What is the answer? The answer is: ``We will fix it. We will fix it 
for everybody in Canada. We Liberals have the answer''. Let me 
show what their answer is. Goals  versus quotas, are they the same 
thing? Under the Employment Equity Act, section 6, an employer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15353"> 15353 </A></B>
<P>
is not required ``to hire or promote unqualified persons'' which is 
good, nor ``to create new positions in its workforce'', which is very 
good.
<P>
	Also under the Employment Equity Act, section 33, the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission cannot impose a quota on the 
employer where quota is defined as ``a requirement to hire or 
promote a fixed and arbitrary number of persons during a given 
period''. This is very good. People say: ``That makes a bit of sense 
to us. We could probably buy into this legislation''.
<P>
	What is not talked about by the Liberals is section 10. In 
circumstances where under-representation of designated groups 
has been identified the employer is required to prepare a plan in 
which short term numerical goals for hiring and promotion of the 
designated groups are established. We will be getting employers to 
look at short term numerical goals, but these are not quotas. Also 
longer term goals for increasing the representation of persons in 
designated groups are also established.
<P>
	If in the opinion of a Canadian Human Rights Commission 
investigator-there is an investigator; hire him like the ethics 
counsellor who is not used either-an employer has not made all 
reasonable efforts to implement the employment equity plan, 
including the goals, the employer may, if negotiations fail, 
ultimately be subject to an action by an employment equity review 
tribunal for contempt of process similar in nature to contempt of 
court leading to imprisonment until the directive is complied with. 
This is from sections 25 and 31, mark it down.
<P>
	An employer, believe it or not, can also be fined up to $50,000 by 
the responsible minister, who is yet to be determined, for failure to 
file an employment equity report, for failure to include required 
information in the employment equity report, or for providing false 
or misleading information in the employment equity report. This is 
from section 36, write it down.
<P>
	Tell me the Liberal government does not have quotas. Tell me 
this is all voluntary, completely voluntary. Then tell me what it 
means to have an investigator on staff checking them out.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Tell me what it means to force organizations to have short term 
numerical goals for hiring and promotion of designated groups and 
long term goals. If they tell the investigator they cannot make it or 
they cannot do this or that then they negotiate. If that does not 
work, there will be a tribunal. If that does not work, they will be put 
behind bars.
<P>
	Listen up. What is the government doing? This is not a fun 
exercise we are going through to get votes and spend money. What 
this government is legislating here is serious. It has nothing to do 
with racism but has  everything to do with rights and privileges in 
this country.
<P>
	Who will the government fine up to $50,000? Why will it fine 
someone up to $50,000?
<P>
	What will the government do when it has a quota in a town 
where perhaps there are not the right number of people? Is will get 
its investigator to find somebody to take to a tribunal? What if 
someone is found who is absolutely not suitable for the job? Will 
that person be placed in the job anyway? That is a great way to get 
Canada competitive in the global market. The brilliance of social 
engineering.
<P>
	Let us look at a couple of application forms. One of these forms 
was given to me by a backbench Liberal who is not very happy with 
what is going on here. Among the things asked on this application 
form is to self-identify. Look in the mirror or perhaps determine 
what kind of person you really are. Let us self-identify: cultural, 
racial or linguistic minority person. Explain that and define it. 
Lesbian, gay man or bisexual. What the heck does that have to do 
with employment? That is where social engineering hit. That is just 
one application.
<P>
	Here is the government's application. The longest thing on the 
application is the group with which one has to self-identify: Black, 
Chinese, Filipino, South Asian, Indonesian, Pakistani, Japanese, 
Korean, Southeast Asian, Burmese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai, 
Vietnamese, visible minority west Asian, North African, visible 
minority Latin American, Oceanic, Polynesian, Micronesian, 
Melanesian. What is the government doing to this country?
<P>
	These are application forms. The government is intent on social 
engineering quota systems. If something is found wrong then it will 
get its investigator out. He will chase it down, much like the 
investigator it has under the Official Languages Act. He makes his 
report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> That might answer the census question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Perhaps.
<P>
	This is the politically correct Liberal government days in our 
Canadian society. Government members will impose on the rest of 
us those things we do not necessarily want. Do they really think in a 
community like mine that many visible minorities do not get jobs? 
In fact they are the majority of employees in many businesses in 
my community. Do they think other people say that is not fair? We 
have to try to employ everyone in society regardless of race, colour, 
creed, religion or sex.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We cannot engineer society through legislation, but the Liberals 
will do it because they have a majority government. The mess will 
be there, which they will leave behind when they are turfed out of 
office.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15354"> 15354 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us talk about SMIP. Probably not one of them knows what 
SMIP is. Do they know? What is SMIP? They have no idea what 
SMIP is. That is special measures initiatives program, a new 
program just introduced by the Liberal government. What is it all 
about?
<P>
	It retains the successful elements of previous special measures 
programs. It has new initiatives to support the development and 
retention of designated group members. There is a recruitment 
component in SMIP that is similar to old programs but is directed 
at other groups such as aboriginals, visible minorities and so on.
<P>
	What does SMIP do? It spends money. It spends $768,000 on 
aboriginals; $508,000 on all employees; $992,000 on all 
employment equity groups; $838,000 on more than one but not all 
employment equity groups; $382,000 on women; and $225,000 on 
visible minority groups. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	There is not a person in the House today on that side who even 
knows what SMIP does. A lot of it buys votes; it enables the 
government under yet another program to go around the country 
handing out money.
<P>
	The Liberal government is involved in quotas. I have explained 
how and why. If someone would like to stand on the other side and 
explain what I said, if I were wrong about my discussion on goals 
and quotas, I would love to hear it. Am I wrong about sections 25 
and 31? Am I wrong about section 36? If I am, let us talk about it.
<P>
	How is it right to ensure fairness in an employment system while 
at the same time telling some people they need not apply because 
they do not fit into a category? The government will say that is not 
really so and they will get another portion of the workplace.
<P>
	Young people are saying to politicians all the time, not just 
Reformers but Liberals as well, that they cannot get in there, that 
they need not apply, that they need not submit an application form 
to the RCMP. I have had them in my office and I asked why not. 
They say that they do not fit, that they are excluded from the 
category. How does it make right on the one hand to exclude people 
and on the other hand say it is fair and equitable?
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is baloney.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> One member says that is 
baloney.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> It is absolutely accurate. I 
need not say much more about it. It is extremely frustrating to 
listen to Liberals on the other side giving their version of the 
Liberal world out there without a reality check with the rest of the 
country.
<P>
	When they refer to ``those bad Reformers'' it must be a racial 
thing with them. If they took a good look at who we are and what 
we represent in our  communities-people of all races, colours, 
creeds, religion and sex-they would be a little disappointed in 
themselves. They should look in the mirror and wonder what they 
said in the House of Commons about Reformers. That is probably 
the lowest we can get in debates like this one. It is fine if they wish 
to use it but they will not get it from over here.
<P>
	If the goal system is not a system of quotas, exactly what is it? 
What is it when we need an investigator to ensure these things are 
being done? What is it when people can be fined and become a 
criminal for not living up to a quota established by government? 
What is that?
<P>
	It is a frustrating exercise to try to get the debate on a level that 
the government will understand. Its members are intent on pushing 
this through. They are intent on having it their way. They are intent 
on giving average Canadians what they think is best for them even 
if average Canadians do not think it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be very brief.
<P>
	The Reform Party was born of a sense of feeling excluded from 
the power and the decisions made in the country. If I am wrong in 
that regard I would certainly want it be pointed out. However, it is 
my understanding that essentially the Reform Party was born of the 
notion that the west was feeling left out and did not feel it was part 
of it.
<P>
	That sentiment should cause the member to understand exactly 
the principles behind the bill. The desire to allow all people to feel 
a part of the system of government and so on is very important. 
Members representing that party opposite should be the first people 
to understand that notion, given where they were born.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member's 
first presumption is inaccurate. Not only the west wants in. He has 
it all wrong. The east wants in. Central Canada wants in. The 
difficulty is that people across the nation are alienated by the 
traditional tactics of that party.
<P>
	It was not just politics, for instance, that had us opt out of the MP 
pension plan. That traditional party at the trough will take the 
money and run, which alienates people across the country. It has 
alienated us here. The traditional approach to the Senate of that 
party and the other party that is gone is wrong. It has alienated most 
people in the country yet the Prime Minister continually appoints 
Liberals to the other place.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	It is not some Reformer coming out of Abbotsford, Langley or 
Aldergrove, British Columbia, saying that he is angry. We do a fair 
bit of travelling ourselves and we hear it across the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15355"> 15355 </A></B>
<P>
	That presumption the member just made will sink the Liberal 
ship. It truly will because they are basing the dissatisfaction of 
people on something they feel is western alienation and that is 
wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I attentively listened to the hon. member's speech. I was somewhat 
puzzled by some of the conclusions he drew from the bill we are 
debating.
<P>
	I should like to ask a question of the hon. member. Does he 
believe aboriginal Canadians, women and visible minorities choose 
to work in low paying jobs, choose alienation from the Canadian 
economic system and choose their lifestyle?
<P>
	We have lived for decades without employment equity and 
thanks to employment equity we are now seeing progress. We are 
seeing, for example, that women's salaries have gone up. Not 
enough. They are still not equal to men's salaries. The gender gap 
still exists.
<P>
	Since the hon. member seems to have all the answers, I will go 
back to the original question. Does he think that women choose to 
be ghettoized in certain sectors? Do visible minorities choose low 
incomes because they like low income jobs? Or, is it because there 
are systemic barriers in society that do not allow these individuals 
to achieve their full potential?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no 
one in this country or any other country chooses to make less 
money than anyone else. Males do not choose that. Females do not 
choose that.
<P>
	Everybody in this country has an equal opportunity. It is not 
necessary to legislate it. It is not necessary to imprison people or to 
fine people that do not abide by the rules.
<P>
	It is a lot like any other distribution within society. I stand beside 
the member from Coquitlam who is female. I do not think she 
makes less than I do. I do not think she has any particular 
advantage over me or I have any particular advantage over her. She 
got where she is today the same way I did; she worked hard for it.
<P>
	The presumption being made is that any inequity in the country 
can be legislated. They cannot legislate morality, although I am 
sure they will try hard enough. They cannot engineer a society. 
Have they not stopped to think about what has happened in Ontario 
and why? Is it just because the Ontario government is Conservative 
and they are not? Is that the reason they put it away?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Yes, exactly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> How many female leaders have they ever had and 
in how many years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> It is interesting to note the 
number of female leaders the Prime Minister's Liberals have had.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes, and after how many years?
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think this is a 
government of double standards. A few minutes ago I described 
what happened with the minister of public works in Atlantic 
Canada. Talk about double standards. Hiring friends. Does this guy 
look at employment equity? Only if you know a Liberal and donate 
to the party. That is employment equity to those people over there.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Most people call it patronage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> This is a party of double 
standards. Fortunately for Canada we only get their double 
standards once every few elections and then we throw them out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the member. He accuses others of 
having double standards. Yet he is against equity, the purpose of 
which is to ensure as much as possible that the double standards 
that exist are rectified.
<P>
	The member is beginning to understand a little. In another 120 
years, to use an expression he used, his party should have it down 
pat.
<P>
	The member said in previous remarks as well that he and his 
colleagues have travelled around the country and know very well 
what is going on. Is he aware of an article on today's Cornwall 
<I>Standard Freeholder</I> in which the Grand Chief of the Akwasasne 
community in my riding talked about the extensive travel of the 
member across the way: ``Three Reform Party MPs who toured 
Akwasasne Wednesday to check out smugglers alley should be 
arrested for trespassing, says the furious Grand Chief Russell 
Roundpoint''. He identifies the members for Calgary Northeast, 
Wild Rose and Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	I wonder if the member is familiar with that and what some 
people think of his travel plans. Does he not think that when he 
does those kinds of activities he just bragged about that the least he 
could do is have the courtesy of informing the local elected 
officials, and I am thinking here of the Grand Chief of Akwasasne?
<P>
	There is a perception of insulting the community by the failure 
of members to do so, and showing disrespect for the minority and 
also to stereotyping them as all being part of an illegal activity. If 
he does not want to give that perception, will he at least tell us now 
that the failure on his part and that of his colleagues to show that 
kind of respect was wrong and will he apologize to my constituents 
who live in Akwasasne?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, if this member 
were doing his job we would not have to travel to his riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15356"> 15356 </A></B>
<P>
	If that member realizes what is going on down there and the 
problems they are having and the people we talked about, he 
would not be in the House whining about it.
<P>
	He is trying to do exactly what is going on in the House. He is 
trying to turn a situation where we were looking at some real 
problems of crime in his riding into a racial issue. That is what is 
wrong.
<P>
	We have been talking to the solicitor general about the crime 
problem in this area and we have been getting very poor answers. 
There has been no recognition from the government, no real action 
to curb it. We have been down in the member's riding because we 
were asked to go. If he does not like the way we travel, that is really 
just too bad.
<P>
	I belong to a party that goes out and talks to the people rather 
than these pompous Liberals who complain that Reformers are in 
their ridings dealing with issues. They turn a crime issue into a 
racial issue. That is exactly what is wrong. He has a crime issue in 
his riding.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	They do not have the courage to deal with the crime because they 
are so sensitive about something they call a racial issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to discuss this bill, which seeks to make the 
workplace fairer for all Canadians, particularly those who have 
traditionally been disadvantaged.
<P>
	This is also an opportunity to reply to some very severe criticism 
made by Reform Party members in terms of this bill's probable 
impact on the Canadian business world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I wish they would stay with us long enough to hear some of these 
responses so they do not come back uneducated. They asked a lot 
of questions. They want responses. I am going to reply to some of 
their concerns and it would be great if they were here to hear them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This criticism has dire consequences, because it seeks to 
undermine the efforts made to ensure fair treatment of Canadian 
workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I note 
that it is customary and appropriate that we do not make reference 
to the absence or the attendance of other hon. members.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member for 
raising the point. His interpretation is  correct. If that assessment is 
correct I would ask the hon. member for St. Paul's to deal with it. 
We should all be mindful, as the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest has raised the issue, that we are not at any time to make 
reference to the absence of members from the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to speak 
to this bill and to have the attention of all members of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, I want to take a few minutes to discuss the provisions of this 
bill and explain how they will not only benefit disadvantaged 
people in the workplace, but also employers.
<P>
	This legislation reflects two basic values which Canadians really 
care about: fairness and equality. It also takes into account the need 
to promote business development, in order to create jobs and 
opportunities which will ensure a good future for all Canadians, 
whoever they are and whatever their situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill seeks to achieve a critical balance between 
competitiveness and compassion which is so vital for assuring 
opportunities for Canadians.
<P>
	While we in government are seeking to enhance fairness and 
opportunities for Canadians, some opposition members either do 
not see the need for such measures or feel that no improvements are 
required to existing legislation. In my opinion they simply do not 
get it.
<P>
	They have never had the experience. They do not understand 
what it is to apply for a job, to have all of the qualifications and to 
somehow suspect that their colour, their gender, their disability or 
their orientation precludes them from a fair chance at that job.
<P>
	I do not necessarily ascribe malevolence to interviewers or 
people who do the hiring. It is human nature. We have all felt it 
ourselves. When we face candidates before us we tend to like those 
who are just like us better than we like everybody else. We feel 
more comfortable. We feel more at home. We can see ourselves 
working with them.
<P>
	We have only to look at the membership of the third party to see 
that they have the same problem and perhaps need a plan to deal 
with it within their own ranks.
<P>
	An interesting study was done recently with respect to hiring. 
Employers were asked to consider applicants on the basis of their 
applications only. There were no personal interviews. It was 
interesting to see employers hire people without regard to colour, 
gender or disability and only find out later their colour, gender or 
disability and then say: ``I do not care. I will make whatever 
arrangements are necessary. Whether it is a ramp for a wheelchair, 
or whatever it is, I want that candidate''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15357"> 15357 </A></B>
<P>
	When faced with a person in front of them, by human nature 
or otherwise, the tendency is, after years and years of good 
intentions, for employers not to move fast enough. They need 
some assistance in seeing a way through to doing what they know 
is in the interests of their businesses which is to have a diversified 
workforce.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Much progress has been made under current employment 
legislation and the current act but much more remains to be done. 
Women are still concentrated in lower paid clerical, sales and 
service jobs. Maybe that is the place where some hon. members 
want to see them stay but that is not where this member or this 
party wishes to them stay.
<P>
	In the case of aboriginal people, the percentage in the workforce 
under the act currently is 1.4 per cent compared to 3 per cent in the 
Canadian population. It is roughly the case with respect to persons 
with disabilities. They are roughly 6.5 per cent of the overall 
population but a far lower percentage in the workforce. That is 
wrong. It denies Canadian businesses the work and dedication of 
devoted and capable people who can be accommodated and should 
be received and welcomed as should people who are otherwise 
among the designated groups.
<P>
	However, those people still find themselves on the bottom rung 
of the economic and social ladder. It is not just their problem, 
which is I what I suspect hon. members from the third party think. 
It is a problem for all of us since restricting the participation of 
such individuals in the economic life of our country damages the 
competitiveness of Canadian businesses. Businesses themselves 
understand that. They endorse many of these proposals. They have 
been doing a number of things on their own. They have been 
working with us to develop programs to give effect to the guiding 
principles encompassed in this legislation. It is good for business 
and it is good for Canada.
<P>
	Those businesses realize that recruiting, promoting and retaining 
people who are representative of the Canadian population helps 
them provide better and more responsive service since diverse 
experience and perspectives are a bonus not a burden.
<P>
	It is useful to note that many business representatives, not 
usually identified as left wing radicals, appeared before the 
standing committee in support of the bill. They told us the bill 
would help them develop a more diverse workforce and give them 
a competitive edge over less diversified competitors. 
Diversification in business just is not about one's product line. It is 
about one's employees as well.
<P>
	Contrary to the accusations of some members, this bill is not 
some piece of wild-eyed radicalism, totally divorced from the 
realities of economic life and experience. Rather, it is a moderate 
document which seeks to promote equal opportunity in the 
workplace without imposing an onerous regulatory environment on 
business which we recognize is already hard pressed in an 
increasingly global, competitive marketplace.
<P>
	For instance, while the act seeks to encourage employers to 
address under-representation by members of designated groups, it 
does not require them to hire unqualified people, to create new 
positions, to create undue hardship or to contradict the merit 
principle. What we are anxious to see is people hired on their 
merits regardless of their gender, their colour and other 
characteristics which have gotten in the way of people with equal 
merit getting an equal opportunity.
<P>
	The impact of the bill will be limited since it will only involve 
those public and private sector organizations and enterprises 
covered by the Canada Labour Code; about 10 per cent of the 
workforce. It does not impose quotas or some draconian regime 
directed from Ottawa as some have suggested. Rather it seeks to 
help organizations and enterprises develop their own targets for 
themselves which will allow them to develop a more representative 
workforce.
<P>
	To do this, the act will rely on self-identification by employees 
rather than forcing people to be singled out. There is every 
indication that such a system should be successful since employees 
have shown themselves increasingly willing to identify themselves 
for the purpose of this since the first act was passed in 1986.
<P>
	In addition, enforcement of the act will not be a reign of terror as 
conjured up by members of the third party. There is no intention of 
hounding companies which, not yet fully in compliance with the 
targets they set, are sincerely trying to reach their goals. Our 
approach in such situations will be of helping, not harassing. We 
hope to encourage co-management of this program within 
enterprises. This means getting workers and management to work 
together in partnership to ensure the success of the program. While 
management will bear responsibility since it has the ultimate say in 
how it manages its affairs, there will be considerable opportunity 
for both sides to work together on the setting of targets, timetables 
and implementation strategies.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Success in the area of labour-management co-operation could 
well prove so rewarding that both parties might then decide to 
extend this collaboration to other areas of common concern, which 
would in turn benefit the enterprise as a whole.
<P>
	Canadians are justly proud of the progress they have made in 
ensuring fairness and equal opportunity. While the Employment 
Equity Act of 1986 has led to a number of successes, much remains 
to be done. We in this party will not cease in our efforts to improve 
upon what we have done in the past. History does not stop. We gain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15358"> 15358 </A></B>
<P>
new experiences every day and we see ways in which we  can 
implement our policies more effectively as time goes on.
<P>
	We realize though that progress must not hinder the success of 
Canadian business, which is so vital for creating jobs and 
opportunities Canadians need. This act seeks to provide this vital 
balance and contains provisions that will benefit not only 
employees, particularly those traditionally disadvantaged, but 
employers as well. As such, it represents a win-win situation where 
everyone gains.
<P>
	For this reason I will be supporting this legislation before the 
House and would encourage all members to do so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before giving the floor to 
the hon. member for Lévis, I simply wish to remind the House that 
the period for questions and comments lasts five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want to say 
that the official opposition supports the legislation, even though we 
feel it does not go far enough-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> -in spite of the protests made by the third party. At 
the same time, a member of that party alluded earlier to the 
government's double standards. In a sense I agree with him, but 
obviously not for the same reasons.
<P>
	There are the following points. First, the government introduces 
legislation like this one, which is in general very praiseworthy and, 
at the same time, it passes other legislation, including one piece of 
legislation last year, suspending job security in the public service 
for three years. Administratively, they will cut 45,000 jobs over 
this period, and yet, when it comes to employment equity for 
women, for example, in the public service, it seems to me that a 
government should first set the example itself, before it asks 
business to do something.
<P>
	It should be beyond reproach in this regard. In fact, we can see, 
and all the statistics indicate, that no progress has been made in the 
federal public service; nothing has changed. Pay equity is in the 
order of 72 per cent. Even for jobs requiring the same 
qualifications, women were paid less than men. Women are in 
lower paying jobs, because these jobs are lower down the ladder.
<P>
	With the cuts and the legislation ending job security, there was 
the phenomenon of voluntary departures, buy-outs. In cutting other 
positions, a discretionary formula was used, by whom, by the 
managers of the various government services. The vast majority of 
the positions involved are held by men, very few by women.
<P>
	Can we call this a fair practice? This is what I mean when I talk 
about a double standard, it may be alright for the third party to 
support it. It is all very well to make speeches in the House, to pass 
fine laws, but I know,  coming from Quebec, that some people 
expected a lot from the official languages act, for example, in 
promoting employment equity for francophones, those from 
Quebec, and even those from outside Quebec, and still nothing has 
happened.
<P>
	Last year, a minister was obliged to issue directives to enforce a 
20-year old law, and nothing has improved.
<P>
	We will support this bill, but I have a question for the hon. 
member. In his opinion, since he is closer to the minister, are there 
any indications of a reversal of the double standard trend, that is, 
the trend of passing fine laws, but changing nothing? On the 
contrary, revisionist measures have been taken leading to 
regression and a return to the past by, for example, suspending job 
security in the public service.
<P>
	What is preventing the government from passing antiscab 
legislation?
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	So, this is my question to the hon. member, who seems to have 
progressive ideas. I want him to reassure me as to the value of what 
he is saying, in terms of its impact on the government and on 
cabinet.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the hon. member 
for St. Paul's that while he indicated to the Chair he would be 
splitting his time, if he wants to give his colleague the opportunity 
to conclude her intervention before the end of government orders 
his response should be brief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you. I do want to allow my 
colleague that opportunity.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his intervention and for reminding 
the House that the official opposition does support the bill. We 
appreciate that support. Obviously they recognize, as we do, that 
there are improvements that can be made in the way in which we do 
business in this country.
<P>
	He raises some good points to the effect that the public service 
should be mindful of the laudable merits of this statute as it begins 
to apply to them.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member for 
his co-operation and I regret the period of question or comment is 
terminated.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to join 
with my colleagues on this side of the House in support of this 
important piece of legislation, which many disadvantaged 
Canadians have long dreamed of.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15359"> 15359 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, I use the word ``dream''. I am proud to be a member of a 
team that dares to dream, one that has such faith in our capacity as 
individuals and our capacity as a nation.
<P>
	In the Liberal Party the vision was set out in what we called 
``Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada ''. In that 
document the government reinforced and spoke about the social 
fabric of the country. We promised to strengthen our employment 
equity legislation to ensure that we meet a very simple but 
profound commitment. That commitment springs from the belief 
that everyone in Canada is entitled to equality.
<P>
	I remind members that the red book speaks of a future where all 
Canadians, regardless of gender, race, or physical and intellectual 
attributes, enjoy a standard of living and quality of life equal to 
those of other Canadians. With this legislation we are moving 
forward and ensuring that that future will become a reality.
<P>
	I want to talk about Bill C-64 in terms of the strength we hope 
this will build in our society, in our communities, and among us. It 
is capitalizing on the diversity. It is about creating jobs and growth. 
It is about removing barriers to full employment. The 
modifications of the act are designed to streamline and strengthen 
its existing provisions to ensure that the philosophy behind 
employment equity becomes the everyday practice in the federally 
regulated workplace.
<P>
	This constructive piece of legislation builds on the significant 
progress we have achieved since the Employment Equity Act was 
introduced in 1986. I remind the House that Canadian banks, 
airlines, broadcasters, some of the largest and most visible 
companies in the country, have been implementing employment 
equity programs for a decade. They have recognized that without 
such plans their businesses would become less and less 
representative of the clients they serve, a point which must not be 
lost on us as government.
<P>
	As a result of the federal policy and the dedication of business to 
implement it, the numbers of designated groups have risen, without 
backlash but with plenty of benefits to our society. Bill C-64 is a 
continuation of our efforts to create real equality of opportunity in 
the federally regulated workplace. It goes further than our existing 
legislation by expanding the act's coverage and clarifying what 
employment equity will and will not do.
<P>
	This legislation will help explode the many myths we hear 
coming from across the way in this House. These folks have 
circulated many of those myths: employment equity challenges 
workplace norms that reinforce existing patterns of power. This can 
be threatening to people who are satisfied with the status quo. They 
do not understand the need to accommodate differences because 
they are satisfied with the way things are.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The so-called playing field is already tipped in favour of those 
for whom it was constructed, so it is not surprising that there are 
attempts to find reasons to justify resistance to more inclusive 
employment policies and practices.
<P>
	We have heard the myths coming from the other side of the 
House. We want to affirm that employment equity, with its 
emphasis on fairness toward all Canadians, shatters all those 
unfounded assumptions.
<P>
	The legislation requires only that employers consider all 
qualified candidates, I underline qualified, when seeking new 
employees or choosing among workers for promotions. The act 
does not allow quotas, and it certainly has no mandatory 
preferences when employers choose new workers or consider their 
existing employees for promotions. Somehow those two concepts, 
the qualified candidates and no mandatory preferences, seem to be 
lost on the opposition.
<P>
	This bill is not about preferential treatment; it is about equal 
treatment. If it is given a chance to work, everybody will benefit. 
The legislation is meant as an unobtrusive human resource 
management tool that would educate and assist employers as they 
create more equitable workforces. Would that we could do this in 
the House.
<P>
	The whole point of this bill is to enhance this country's 
economic performance through the removal of barriers that prevent 
members of the designated groups from contributing to the 
workplace. It is as much about economics as it is about justice. 
Clearly it is about both. We want to achieve a better balance, one 
that assures fairness and dignity for disadvantaged Canadians and 
works to our country's social and economic advantage.
<P>
	We are not interested in compiling statistics. The act is not about 
counting numbers or instituting reams of new regulations. We are 
talking about Canadian people, work ready individuals anxious to 
demonstrate their abilities in a fair and welcoming environment, 
who must be given that choice.
<P>
	We need to rethink how we relate to one another as groups of 
people. That is exactly what our improved employment equity 
legislation asks us to do.
<P>
	Bill C-64 asks Canadians to open their hearts and open their 
minds to the many advantages of workplace diversity. It asks that 
we put into practice the democratic principles we profess to believe 
in: fairness, access and equity for all, regardless of gender, race, 
disability, orientation. It insists that we live up to our moral and 
legal obligations by upholding the rights and freedoms enshrined in 
our Constitution.
<P>
	Clearly employment equity is not an impediment to business or 
an infringement on anyone's right. It is a catalyst for improvement 
to the workplace and progress in our country. It is the foundation of 
Canada's future. More than just the stuff dreams are made of, this 
legislation can dramatically impact the standard of living and 
quality of life of disadvantaged Canadians, the millions of women, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15360"> 15360 </A></B>
<P>
visible minorities, persons living with  disabilities, aboriginal 
people, et cetera, who are an important part of our great nation.
<P>
	I remind my hon. colleagues that these people are counting on us 
to do the right thing. They are counting on us to endorse this crucial 
legislation. There can be no debate. Bill C-64 is the right thing for 
Canada. It is the right thing for us to do. It is the right thing for us to 
do right now.
<P>
	Let us get on with the job. Maybe the myth carriers and those 
who would stand in this House and continue to have those myths 
circulate will begin to understand that Canadians are counting on 
us to ensure that fairness and equity exist in this country.
<P>
	Let us get on with the job. Let us support this legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see members seeking the 
floor on questions and comments. I remind colleagues it is 1.30 
p.m. I can only proceed by unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CORRECTIONSANDCONDITIONALRELEASEACT">CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-242, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, the Criminal Code and the Young Offenders Act 
(improvement to public safety), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have this private 
member's bill reach the floor of the House of Commons. As 
members know it is not an item of Private Members' Business 
which will be voted on. We all know and believe, because we have 
to, that our Private Members' Business arrangements sometimes 
shine a light, point the way and give direction in the field of 
statutory and policy reform. If it does not happen here it is not 
going to happen anywhere.
<P>
	My bill-perhaps I should not call it my bill because a lot of 
people, events and persons contributed to the bill-reflects six or 
seven years of experience in this House as a member of Parliament, 
regionally and nationally and more particularly the seven years I 
spent on the House of Commons justice committee. Some of the 
things in the bill actually evolve directly from that experience on 
the justice committee.
<P>
	To be sure there continues to be flaws in Canada's criminal 
justice system. We all recognize that. The challenge is to find 
solutions and make corrections.
<P>
	I am not one of those who would say that the whole system is in 
disrepute. I have a great deal of respect for the Canadian criminal 
justice system, notwithstanding some of the flaws that it has. Let us 
be honest, there is not a criminal justice system in the world which 
will not over time develop flaws and show need for change.
<P>
	In the past year and half the government that I sit with proudly 
has made a number of changes in the criminal justice area. I will 
mention the Young Offenders Act, the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, the new sentencing act, amendments to the Criminal 
Code to deal with DNA testing and other areas and last but not least 
the institution of a new national crime prevention council.
<P>
	The council recognizes that we have a long way to go, maybe 
forever. The business of reducing the potential for crime will go on 
forever. The business of addressing society's needs in a way that 
will reduce the propensity of our citizens to resort to crime will 
always be there and will go on.
<P>
	Last night, by coincidence I guess, I had the opportunity of 
watching on one of our Canadian networks an interview with the 
French and Mahaffy families following the conviction of the 
accused Paul Bernardo for the murder and other crimes in relation 
to their daughters. Thanks to television and to those families, we 
were able to enter into the homes of these two Canadian families. I 
could not help but sense that the families were hoping for a 
reconciliation with Canadians to meet the challenges in their 
personal lives. I cannot imagine that had anything to do with why 
they agreed to do the interview.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I want to thank them for doing the interview and I hope that 
Canadians have been made aware of several things. It shows how 
vulnerable we all are in terms of public safety. We share our 
vulnerability to a psychopath or any criminal intimately with every 
one of our fellow citizens.
<P>
	Last night's interview permitted Canadians to understand how 
important this area of law and policy is to all of us. I hope those 
families will forgive me for even attempting to suggest what they 
wanted to convey. I believe one area where we still have some 
reform ahead of us is the criminal justice area. I hope they would 
agree.
<P>
	There are still reforms that we must address. The bill before us 
today is a short list. It is not comprehensive. It contains six areas of 
reform. I am going to walk through it now. I believe it is fair to say 
that not every element of the six areas will have universal support. 
That is rarely the case when one tries to make a change in the 
criminal justice system. However, I would like to think that there  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15361"> 15361 </A></B>
<P>
is a sizeable consensus that this list is just part of the reforms still 
out there for us to accomplish.
<P>
	The first item is the denial of statutory release for serious, repeat 
offenders. A serious repeat offender in this case is a person who 
while on any form of early release, has been convicted of an 
offence for which that person has been sentenced to five years or 
more. The subsequent second offence which would result in the 
denial of early release is certainly a serious offence. It would have 
drawn a sentence of five years or more.
<P>
	I am not being particularly aggressive in this. In April 1993 the 
standing committee on justice reported through its 14th report and 
recommended that the sentence for the subsequent offence be set at 
two years. It is the same recommendation of denial of parole and 
early release but the threshold was two years. In my bill I have 
selected five years.
<P>
	I hope I will not be accused by anyone of wimping out. The 
Liberal Party of Canada in May and August of the same year 
adopted the report of the justice committee as part of its criminal 
justice policy package. The House of Commons justice committee 
unanimously endorsed the provision and referred it to the House. 
The Liberal Party of Canada adopted the entire justice committee 
report. At the moment that recommended reform has not yet been 
adopted.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	One of the most glaring examples of why reform is necessary is 
the case of the conviction of Albert Foulston in Edmonton for the 
murder of a police officer in 1990. This person has had 48 separate 
convictions so it is fair to call him a convict. This convict was in 
prison serving a sentence of approximately 10 years. I do not know 
whether anybody really knew exactly how the 10 years was 
composed because the sentencing mathematics contained in the 
Criminal Code and in the CCRA are very complex. In any event, he 
was released.
<P>
	On several occasions while he was on early release he committed 
other offences. I will not go through the list. It is part of the public 
record elsewhere. While on early release for the umpteenth time he 
participated in the killing of an Edmonton police officer for which 
he was fairly promptly sentenced to 20 years.
<P>
	The sentence calculation resulted in his total sentence looking 
like 30 years because it was consecutive. However, because of the 
way we calculate sentences, he was eligible for parole one year and 
five months after he was convicted of the murder. With his life 
sentence he was eligible for parole one year and five months after 
he was convicted of murder. That is absurd. The absurdity has been 
recorded in public journals.
<P>
	One is moved to say that the system is obviously in some 
disarray. I will leave that as an example of why the existing 
provision must be changed.
<P>
	My bill says that if a person is on early release and is convicted 
of a crime and sentenced to two years or more that person loses the 
right to early release.
<P>
	I accept that there must be at the end of the consecutive 
sentences a period when the offender will be integrated. That has to 
be in the statutory release portion because I do not want that guy 
being released at the end of 30 years and sitting on the Bay Street 
bus the next day beside my kids. I want a period of integration.
<P>
	The bill would close a loophole which allows offenders to avoid 
serving time for new offences if those new offences occur while 
they are on early release or even while they are in prison. If a 
person is sentenced to seven years for a particularly bad crime and 
during the fifth year that person gets out, beats somebody up and 
steals his money, that would normally draw a sentence of a couple 
of years. The way the law is currently written it requires that person 
to start the two years back at the beginning of the seven year 
sentence.
<P>
	I am not going to take time to read that section of the Criminal 
Code. It is a public statute and anybody can read it. They can read 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and the appropriate 
section of the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Basically the second offence is what I had call a freebie. There is 
no sanction. You can steal a car, steal a purse, commit an assault, 
and provided of course that the sentence for the second offence 
does not exceed the length of the sentence you were first on, you do 
not have to serve any additional time. This needs to be corrected.
<P>
	We tried in the House in the last Parliament, I know we tried in 
this one, and we are getting closer. We have made amendments, but 
officials seem to be reluctant to alter the system too much, because 
every time you change a sentence calculation it costs money, and 
they do not have the money in their budgets. They are very cautious 
about making changes to the way we sentence people and keep 
people in our correctional institutions. I accept that.
<P>
	In any event, I am still on the case and many of our colleagues in 
this House are still on the case and we are slowly getting to those 
reforms.
<P>
	The third area is the lowering of the age of criminal 
responsibility from age 12, where it is now, to age 10. That has 
been misinterpreted in a lot of quarters. People ask how you can 
throw the Criminal Code at a little 11-year-old. That is not the 
objective, any more than it is the objective to throw the book at the 
13-year-old or the 14-year old. What we have done in this country 
is arrange for intervention into the life of a young offender when 
they are under 18 years of age. What this does is allow the 
appropriate intervention for a 10-year-old or 11-year-old. At 
present there is no intervention.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15362"> 15362 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember in the last Parliament, the day before I introduced 
a similar provision in private members' business was the day of 
that unfortunate killing in Great Britain where the two 11-year-old 
boys were involved. If that had happened here in Canada there 
would have been no intervention. In some provinces there would 
have been a social worker, but no Young Offenders Act. The social 
worker procedures vary from province to province. This would 
allow intervention at an early age, the same way we intervene for 
all young offenders.
<P>
	The fourth area is a provision that deals with the community 
scourge of crack houses. Municipalities are crying out for some 
way to deal with this. I suggest the solution is to redefine what we 
call a disorderly house or a bawdy house in the Criminal Code and 
allow the same procedures that communities use to deal with 
bawdy houses and disorderly houses, where there are procedures to 
deal with what we call found-ins and procedures to deal with 
landlords. There is nothing else out there. It is a simple 
amendment, and many communities I know would want to take 
advantage of it to deal with crack houses.
<P>
	Fifth is stiffer bail provisions for two categories of cases, where 
you have people out on bail or on peace bonds committing other 
offences. This proposal deals with being on bail or on a peace bond 
and committing an offence on the peace bond or committing 
another driving offence while on bail for a driving offence. There 
are very serious implications for the public to have a drunk out 
driving again when he or she is on bail on a driving offence. To 
reverse the onus in the bail does not mean they do not get bail; it 
means that it is up to them to show the judge why they should be 
released. The onus or the burden of proof changes in terms of 
entitlement to bail.
<P>
	Last is a matter that has been discussed publicly. It would allow 
victims of sexual assault to have the blood of the accused tested 
only under a judge's order and in such a way that the evidence of 
the blood test would not be used against them in the trial. This 
provides something for the victim to make sure that he or she has 
not been infected with many of the sexually transmitted diseases 
that are out now. There are half a dozen of them. Some of them are 
lethal. We have to have some compassion for victims where you 
make a prima facie case in front of a judge and the judge says there 
will be a blood test. In this way the victim can be assured, as best 
we can using the medical testing we have, that he or she has not 
been infected with one of these STDs.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	Those are the six parts. I have had a lot of help preparing this, 
first from my constituents, who have given me a lot of latitude here 
in Parliament to deal with a lot of issues. I hope the bill reflects 
their concerns. I received a lot of help from Canadians. I will 
mention some of the people with whom I have had contact over  the 
last few years: Margot Blackburn, who has gone public, Priscilla de 
Villiers, who has gone public, Mrs. Mahaffy, the Rosenfeldts, and 
others. These people have all been direct or indirect victims who 
want to see change. I have also spoken to public interest groups, 
Victims of Violence, CAVEAT, the Canadian Centre for Victims of 
Crime, financed by the Canadian Police Association.
<P>
	I am grateful to my colleagues in this House for their continuing 
support. Sooner or later, I hope these initiatives will bear fruit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be 
able to speak on private member's Bill C-242 tabled by the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River. I shall be addressing in 
particular clauses 3 and 8 on lowering the minimum age of criminal 
responsibility.
<P>
	Before I begin, I would like to stress that I find it a bit strange 
that we are today debating a private member's bill from a member 
of the government party. He himself began his speech by stating 
that he was on the House of Commons justice committee for six 
years, nearly two of those while his own party formed the 
government. I find it somewhat strange that he is proposing this 
again today. I wonder, is it because he has not managed to influence 
his own minister of justice? Yet, as a member of the justice 
committee he has studied these specific aspects.
<P>
	I am a bit surprised therefore to see a former member of the 
justice committee proposing such a bill. Perhaps this means-and I 
think some of the hon. members opposite might have something to 
say on this-that the matter was looked at somewhere and the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River was no doubt told that his 
bill was not in line with the government's intentions.
<P>
	I am therefore prepared to debate it, but it is my impression-not 
that I want to say we are wasting our time-but that the energy 
expended by the hon. member, his good intentions 
notwithstanding, could have been better expended if he had worked 
on the office of the Minister of Justice, particularly the minister 
himself. But, there you are.
<P>
	The members of the opposition, who have no real power, can see 
that the backbenchers of the government party do not have much 
power or influence over their cabinet colleagues either.
<P>
	As I have stated, my speech will be on clauses 3 and 8, because 
they are aimed at dropping the minimum age of criminal 
responsibility from 12 to 10 years.
<P>
	I recall being present here in the House when the Young 
Offenders Act was being discussed. That debate succeeded in 
lowering the age by two years. At that rate, and considering the 
number of debates there have been over time-you may think I am 
laying it on a bit  thick-but if we keep dropping the age down 
every two years, in ten years they will be saying that the Criminal 
Code applies to babies. This is not logical, but there you have it. In 
Canada, government members, with the backing of the third party, 
are going along with a trend that is really reinforcing the ideas of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15363"> 15363 </A></B>
<P>
the right, ideas that our young people really need measures to 
control them better.
<P>
	I cannot get over this. Before coming out with such things, did 
anyone think about the message we are giving to our young people 
at the present time? Ten to twelve year olds are still just children, or 
adolescents at most.
<P>
	The hon. member is suggesting a change in the definition of a 
child and an adolescent by lowering the age. At 10 they would be 
recognized as adolescents.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	True, our children are bigger than they used to be because they 
are healthier and better fed. It was recently reported that their IQs 
might be 10 per cent higher as well, for a variety of reasons, than 
what they were 20 years ago. I am willing to agree that these 
conditions are improving, but I still feel ten years is too young.
<P>
	I am sure that this has not succeeded in influencing the Minister 
of Justice and therefore is not likely to be implemented. I trust that 
this debate will not influence others. One never knows if, after 
Quebec becomes sovereign, another party, the Reform Party for 
instance, were to come to power in Canada, well then it would be-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> It would be dreadful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Although I did not put words in the mouth of the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, for once I agree 
with him. It would be dreadful to see such measures made more 
stringent.
<P>
	We in Quebec have a tradition. Although we apply the Canadian 
Criminal Code to those under the age of 18 years. there is a 
provision for rehabilitation. When a crime has been committed by a 
young person, it must be interpreted as a sign to the parents and to 
society that something must be done for this young person.
<P>
	I recall the words of a member of this House, whom I shall not 
name as he is not present. You would have cautioned me,Mr. Speaker, that we must not speak of the absent, but once warned, 
twice shy.
<P>
	Who among us can boast that we did nothing bad as children. It 
is true that there are some extremely isolated cases, for instance the 
two young boys aged between 10 and 12 who committed a murder 
in England. This is unacceptable, but these are isolated cases. Let 
us have a look at the statistics.
<P>
	What is the real state of affairs? According to statistics issued by 
the Conseil permanent de la jeunesse du Québec, in 1992-1993, 35 
per cent of violent crimes in  Canada were committed by 
individuals aged 25 to 34. On the other hand, the 12 to 17 year old 
group was responsible for less than 15 per cent of these crimes. I 
repeat, less that 15 per cent.
<P>
	Excluding the elderly, the very old-I am sorry to say the very 
old, but I will soon be joining them, since in 12 years I will be 
60-statistics issued by Statistics Canada show that young people 
are less violent than any other age group in terms of serious violent 
crimes. Let us keep this in mind.
<P>
	I do not want to impute motives to the member, but he is jumping 
on the bandwagon in favour of harsher measures to better control 
our young people. Was increased funding for prevention and better 
education ever considered? Were increased resources in these areas 
ever considered?
<P>
	I did not see anything to that effect coming from this 
government. Unfortunately, some provincial governments want to 
cut this sort of services. A case in point is what is going on in 
Ontario. I have not closely checked it out but I understand that 
Alberta has made drastic cuts in these areas. This is a dangerous 
trend.
<P>
	We all have kids and we know how firm we have to be with 
them. We cannot be naive. We have to be firm with them, and, as 
adults, give them good advice. We must not always think in terms 
of punishment. We must give ourselves better means to help those 
who tell us that society leaves to be desired, that they have 
problems and need our help. I think we should debate those things.
<P>
	One last point. Time flies and I have only one minute left.
<P>
	I have kids living at home and friends who do also and I am 
always amazed to see how easy it is for them to view violent 
movies. Why can we not take adequate measures in that area?
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	I cannot give you specific statistics today, but I am sure that the 
many murders and attempts at violent acts that a young person can 
see depicted on film in one evening have a negative influence on 
our youth.
<P>
	Why are we not conducting serious studies to limit the influence 
of such programs on our youth? I would be an interesting approach. 
We could at least try.
<P>
	After all, we did bring these kids into the world. There is a song 
which says: ``We gave them birth, maybe we could listen to them''. 
So maybe we could listen to what they have to say and try to find 
out why these violent individuals acting the way they do, even 
though they are only a minority.
<P>
	We must, as a community, be it Quebec or Canada, take the 
necessary steps to help these young people. If I am still here later 
on- which is doubtful, although I may do so somewhere else--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15364"> 15364 </A></B>
<P>
someday I will suggest ways to help young people avoid the 
negative influence of such television programming.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House to speak 
on Bill C-242. It is a very rare occasion to see anything concrete 
coming from the government side of the House that makes any 
sense and actually deals with the real issues. I guess it is because it 
is coming from the back benches and not from the government that 
I can appreciate we are dealing with the real issues here.
<P>
	Having had the opportunity to sit on the Standing Committee of 
Justice and Legal Affairs with the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River, I can appreciate his approach to 
legislative changes. During his tenure on the committee the 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River has been able to identify 
problems with the current laws, propose legislative changes before 
the committee and try to promote them. Unfortunately he has had 
very little support from members of his own caucus.
<P>
	He is attempting with Bill C-242 to deal with the real issues, the 
real concerns, and to suggest legislative changes. There is nothing 
earth shattering about the changes he is recommending. Serious 
repeat offenders should be denied statutory release. Loopholes 
should be removed from the calculation of parole eligibility which 
allow repeat offenders not to serve their full new sentences. 
Victims of sexual assaults should be allowed to request that their 
assailants provide blood samples to check for infectious diseases. 
Bail procedures should be toughened up. Crack houses should be 
outlawed and the age of criminal responsibility for young offenders 
should be reduced from 12 to 10 years old.
<P>
	The member for Scarborough-Rouge River has identified a 
number of flaws in the justice system and has offered workable 
solutions to these flaws. Either that, or I would suggest he has been 
reading the Reform Party's policy book again. Bill C-242 reads like 
it came directly out of the criminal justice reform section of our 
policy book. In either event the Reform Party certainly supports 
each and every one of the amendments in Bill C-242.
<P>
	It is a shame that these issues will only receive one hour of 
debate this afternoon and then will die. All these amendments have 
the support of the Reform Party. I am certain they also have the 
support of an overwhelming majority of Canadians. Canadians are 
demanding justice reform. There are just too many cases where the 
law is not protecting the average citizen.
<P>
	Canada's justice system needs to adopt one underlying principle: 
when the rights of a convicted offender are in conflict with the 
rights of the victim or the rights of society as a whole, the rights of 
the victim or of society shall take precedence every time. A prime 
example of the  need for this principle is contained in clause 7 of 
Bill C-242.
<P>
	The need for legislation sprung out of a case in Quebec a few 
years ago when a mother was sexually assaulted by an inmate on 
parole. The inmate had previously been incarcerated in an 
institution with a very high number of AIDS cases. Since her 
assailant had been an intravenous drug user the victim was 
naturally concerned that her assailant may also have carried HIV. 
When her assailant refused to voluntarily give a blood sample the 
victim went to court to have one given. Her request was rejected 
because conducting a blood test against the offender's will was 
deemed to be a violation of his rights under the charter.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	This is a prime example of what is wrong with the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This offender who committed a 
serious crime of sexual assault should have lost some of his rights. 
One of the rights he should have lost was the right to refuse to take 
a blood test.
<P>
	On the day of the sexual assault the victim's life was irrevocably 
changed. Sexual assault leaves emotional scars that never leave the 
victim. One additional burden should not have been her daily 
concern about whether or not she had been infected by HIV or any 
other sexually transmitted disease.
<P>
	Clause 7 would have addressed that issue. Unfortunately Clause 
7 like the rest of Bill C-242 will never be enacted.
<P>
	In the last days of June we finally got the government to move on 
the question of taking DNA samples. Why could blood samples not 
be given the same consideration where there is justifiable cause?
<P>
	Another aspect of Bill C-242 I should like to address is the 
amendments the member for Scarborough-Rouge River wishes to 
make to the Young Offenders Act. He felt it was necessary to lower 
the minimum age from 12 years to 10 years. The member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River cites the example of the murder case in 
Great Britain where two 10-year old boys murdered a 3-year-old. 
The member correctly pointed out that had the offence occurred in 
Canada the police would have had little recourse but to simply 
accompany the boys back to their parents, and that would have 
been the end of it.
<P>
	It is interesting this example was used because I have used it 
myself on many occasions. I have been criticized because such a 
horrendous event has not occurred in Canada and therefore it is 
inappropriate to use it.
<P>
	Then I switched to my Mikey Smith story. Mikey Smith is an 
11-year old boy from Surrey who has for the past couple of years 
been one of the most active car thieves in the lower mainland area. 
While I am not sure what his current total is, it is probably well 
over 100 cars.  Mikey Smith publicly admitted that he would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15365"> 15365 </A></B>
<P>
continue to steal cars until he was 12 years old because there was 
nothing anybody could do about it.
<P>
	Mikey's mother asked that he be charged before he either killed 
himself or somebody else, before he reached a point where he 
could not turn his life around. The Surrey RCMP would have been 
more than happy to have accommodated the mother but the law did 
not allow it. The Surrey crown counsel would have loved to have 
been able to have accommodated Mikey's mother, but as the Young 
Offenders Act currently stands there was nothing they could do.
<P>
	I questioned the Minister of Justice about it in the House and in 
committee. He expressed concern about the issue. He basically said 
that while they can do something about it they are not prepared to 
do so.
<P>
	In the meantime one of my constituents was going home one 
afternoon, going through an intersection on a green light, and was 
sideswiped by a car stolen and driven by Mikey Smith. Fortunately 
no one was seriously injured, but it is incomprehensible that this 
kind of situation can continue to be allowed and that Mikey Smith 
should be allowed to continue the mayhem.
<P>
	One response I received from the federal government was that it 
was a case in which the provincial social services should have 
intervened. Just for the government's information, they did. They 
sent Mikey on a wilderness program so that he could develop a 
better attitude. The program helped so much that on the day Mikey 
returned to Surrey he stole a car to celebrate his return.
<P>
	Unfortunately Mikey is not the only youngster under 12 to be 
engaged in crime. Youth gangs are recruiting 10-year-olds and 
11-year-olds to carry out some of their crimes because they know 
that they cannot be charged. Still there is no hint from the 
government that it will support this kind of change. In fact when 
the Reform Party put forward a votable motion last year not one 
Liberal voted in favour of it.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-242 is a good example of how some Liberal 
backbenchers have proposed good legislation but how the 
government is not prepared to let the legislation be enacted. It is 
apparent to me that the only way these criminal justice reforms will 
ever be enacted is if there is a more Reform minded government in 
place. I assure the member for Scarborough-Rouge River that 
such a government would be much more sympathetic to supporting 
these initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has been interesting 
to listen to the debate.
<P>
	I have looked at some aspects of the bill and think it would make 
good law. However when I hear the position of the Reform Party 
then I think I must be wrong.
<P>
	I have studied the proposals that have been put forward. Some I 
agree with and some I do not. When trying to come up with 
criminal law we must always look for a balance. The protection of 
society is always a primary concern. That has to be balanced with 
the rights of the accused. In recent years the interests of the victim 
have also come to the fore.
<P>
	I believe that the bill put forward by the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River tries to strike that balance, particularly 
in the area of someone who continues with the commission of 
crimes while he or she is out on early release. The proposal for 
change so that the person will no longer be eligible for statutory 
release is a good one.
<P>
	The threshold for statutory release is also good because it is not 
at the two-year level but at the five-year level, which indicates that 
a rather severe crime has been committed. Therefore, more 
sanctions for the protection of society require that we have this type 
of an amendment. The example used by the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River of a person who commits a murder and 
would only have to serve roughly a year and half before being 
eligible for parole is something that needs to be amended. I support 
those two aspects of the proposed changes in Bill C-242.
<P>
	I share the concerns of members from the Bloc about changing 
the age for people who have committed a crime. It seems to me that 
lowering the age is really not the proper direction to proceed. 
Perhaps what we have to do is what has been done in some 
jurisdictions, which is introduce more flexibility. Rather than 
trying to come up with age limits, we should allow the court in 
specific circumstances to determine whether the child has the 
capability of understanding the crime he or she has committed and 
whether the process would be better served either inside or outside 
the criminal justice system, rather than come up with some magic 
line drawn in the sand.
<P>
	In that sense I cannot support the part of the bill calling for 
change to a 10-year age limit. Although it is very convenient when 
we hear the stories put forward by the Reform Party for Mikey 
Smith or the stories that come forward from the situation in Great 
Britain.
<P>
	Most often we hear of the extremes but we have to come up with 
laws that deal with the norms. Therefore, I see no real benefit in 
that aspect of the proposed bill. There is some benefit in looking at 
stiffer bail procedures, crack houses and those types of things to see 
whether we can grapple with those issues and come up with a 
system that works.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15366"> 15366 </A></B>
<P>
	On the face of it these seem to be good. It is too bad the bill will 
not get the opportunity for committee study and input. Maybe there 
are other approaches, other ways  to fine tune the bill. However, to 
me it looks very positive.
<P>
	I talked earlier about balancing one aspect against another. I 
cannot not think of anything worse than a person who has been the 
victim of a sexual assault being doubly victimized by not knowing 
what possible diseases may have been transmitted as a result of that 
sexual assault. When I try to balance the rights of the individual 
who committed the crime and the rights of the victim, from my 
own point of view I come down on the side of the person who has 
been victimized. If a blood test would give any comfort to that 
person after enduring that situation, then I think society would 
require that we do something.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	In that sense this bill proposes a methodology which would 
allow the court to review the circumstances to decide whether or 
not an order should be granted. Therefore the rights of the 
individuals in that balancing act we have to go through are 
protected to a degree, but the rights of the victim are also protected.
<P>
	In conclusion and as a general comment, the main thrust of the 
bill deals with the issues of the people who commit a crime once 
they are out on statutory release, the eligibility for bail and the 
calculation of sentences. Those issues are well aimed. We need 
some changes in the law in that area.
<P>
	I do not support the member in his position with respect to the 
change of age. The member for Scarborough-Rouge River and I 
have discussed this issue over some period of time.
<P>
	I do support the general direction. I would be interested in 
hearing from experts but I think the bill requires the right balance 
between the accused and the victim in dealing with blood tests. It is 
unfortunate this bill is not going before committee where we would 
have the input of others as to how we can make our criminal justice 
system better.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on 
Bill C-242, an Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, the Criminal Code, and the Young Offenders Act. I 
know that the hon. member from Scarborough-Rouge River has 
invested a great deal of time and energy in bringing this piece of 
legislation before the House.
<P>
	The thrust of the hon. member's proposals is to deal more 
stringently with repeat offenders, particularly those who commit 
crimes while on day parole, full parole or statutory release.
<P>
	In particular, these proposals address anomalies in the current 
legislation which have been of concern to various interest groups, 
particularly the police and justice system officials.
<P>
	Under that legislation, many offenders who commit multiple 
crimes or who re-offend during their sentence may remain eligible 
for release and may even avoid custody altogether.
<P>
	On June 21, 1994, the Solicitor General introduced Bill C-45, an 
Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and 
related statutes.
<P>
	The bill received third reading and is now before the Senate.
<P>
	The amendments contained in Bill C-45 will ensure that 
offenders who get new sentences will feel the effect of those 
sentences. This will help restore confidence in the sentence 
calculation process in the following way.
<P>
	Under the government's proposals, any offender who receives a 
new custodial sentence while on conditional release would be 
automatically returned to custody.
<P>
	In the case of a consecutive sentence, the offender would have to 
serve the parole ineligibility portion of the new sentence before 
becoming eligible again for parole.
<P>
	This means a third of the new sentence, or one-half of the 
sentence in cases where the court has made an order that this would 
have to be served. The net effect is proportionate to the new 
sentence and respects the decision of the court to serve an 
additional period of time in custody.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These proposals were developed on the basis of extensive 
consultations with a broad range of groups and individuals 
including judges, lawyers, police, provincial corrections and 
justice officials, as well as representatives of various voluntary 
service organizations.
<P>
	Last March the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
conducted a review of Bill C-45. During that process, the 
committee heard from over 60 witnesses who represented 32 
different organizations, including victims groups, police 
organizations, professional groups, women's groups, aboriginal 
organizations, as well as a range of organizations from the 
voluntary sector.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	During its clause by clause review, the committee debated a 
number of motions to amend the sentence calculation provisions of 
Bill C-45 and endorsed them in their entirety. These provisions 
were also recently passed by the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While I believe that the hon. member's bill is well-intentioned, I 
am also concerned that it falls short of the impact intended by Bill 
C-45 for the following  reasons. First, the changes proposed in Bill 
C-242 do not take into account the inter-relation of the various 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15367"> 15367 </A></B>
<P>
sentence calculation provisions in the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act.
<P>
	By changing two aspects of the law, we will create an imbalance 
with other aspects of the legislation. This would necessitate 
significant re-drafting of the law as it now stands. Bill C-242 also 
deals with the complex issue of sentence calculation in a limited 
manner. Implicit in these proposals is the assumption that an 
offender under sentence will receive only one new sentence.
<P>
	In such cases, sentence calculation is simple and 
straightforward. The offender would lose any eligibilities for 
conditional release on the original sentence, and would have to wait 
out the parole ineligibility period of the new sentence before 
becoming eligible again for conditional release.
<P>
	But how would a sentence be calculated if the offender receives 
four or five new sentences of varying durations, some consecutive 
and some concurrent, at different points in the original sentence? 
The bill fails to address this complex and very realistic matter.
<P>
	The law must be equipped to deal with multiple sentences and all 
possible combinations of sentences in an equitable manner 
consistent with the court's intent. And while this government 
supports the principle that repeat criminal behaviour should be 
dealt with more stringently, particularly when it occurs during 
conditional release, I also believe that the courts can take this into 
consideration when imposing a new sentence.
<P>
	Bill C-45 will address the shortcomings of the current sentence 
calculation provisions I mentioned earlier. In doing so, the bill does 
not lose sight of the purpose of statutory release which is to provide 
offenders released from prison with a gradual controlled transition 
period back to the community to assist them with their 
reintegration and minimize public safety risk.
<P>
	I would like to assure the members of this House that where any 
offender is at high risk of committing a violent or serious drug 
offence before sentence expiry, the National Parole Board has the 
authority to detain the offender until warrant expiry. All the 
measures I have mentioned aim to ensure that offenders are not 
arbitrarily held in prison longer than necessary, and that due 
consideration is given to their individual cases and level of risk to 
the community.
<P>
	We must take heed that discretion is fundamental for ensuring 
that all cases are dealt with fairly. I believe that an individualized 
approach based on risk assessment is preferable to blanket removal 
of statutory release for a category of offenders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During witness hearings on Bills C-45 and C-41 regarding 
sentencing reforms, it was frequently heard  that imprisonment 
should be used as a last resort for the most serious offences. Many 
witnesses who appeared before the justice and legal affairs 
committee also stressed the merit of providing offenders with 
gradual, structured release programs combined with ongoing 
treatment and support to ensure long term community protection. It 
is well known that simply locking them up for longer periods of 
time will not achieve the goal shared by all Canadians for improved 
public safety.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The proposals set out in Bill C-45 are a thoughtful reflection of 
the collaboration with many groups and individuals, including 
members of the opposition.
<P>
	I look forward to seeing effective and balanced reform-such as 
that presented by the government in Bill C-45-move forward, and 
anticipate that Parliament will deal fairly in addressing the 
anomalies which the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
has brought to our attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak in favour of Bill C-242, the public safety 
improvement act, introduced by my distinguished colleague from 
Scarborough-Rouge River. Before I address the specifics of the 
bill I believe it is important for members to understand the history 
of our colleague's complex initiative.
<P>
	As many members know, since his election to Parliament in 
1988, the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River has been a 
strong advocate for criminal justice reform. He first introduced this 
bill in the late stages of the last Parliament. At that time the bill 
received a great deal of attention for three main reasons.
<P>
	First it was and still is a thoughtful, well drafted and complex 
piece of legislation which attempts to fill numerous cracks in the 
criminal justice system. Second, national police and victims groups 
rallied around the bill because it addressed many of their concerns. 
Third and perhaps most significant of all, the bill was co-sponsored 
by the former member for Red Deer who at the time was a 
government member who shared his opposition colleague's 
concerns for the issues which the bill aimed to address. Today, 
more than two years later, we are still debating those same issues in 
the House.
<P>
	As previous speakers have noted, this is an omnibus bill which 
deals with six key areas of the criminal justice system. They 
include statutory release, sentencing, young offenders, crack and 
bawdy houses, bail provisions and the rights of victims. To a degree 
some of us are asking why the government has not already 
addressed these issues. To a degree it has.
<P>
	We have had the DNA legislation, amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act, a new child registry for sex  offenders, tougher 
immigration and deportation provisions, and the list goes on and 
on. The government has done a good job. We have done a lot more 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15368"> 15368 </A></B>
<P>
to improve public safety than any government before us and that is 
not just Liberal rhetoric.
<P>
	The deputy bureau chief for the <I>Sun</I> news recently reported: 
``This Liberal government has actually done more to toughen up 
the system in two years than the previous Tory government did in 
nine''. Although we have accomplished a great deal, there is still 
more to be done and this bill addresses some of those problems.
<P>
	The hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River has proposed 
that an offender who commits a crime while on early release and 
who is sentenced for five or more years for that crime would no 
longer be eligible for statutory release. That proposal makes a lot of 
sense. The purpose of statutory release and for that matter all forms 
of early release is to prepare the offender for his or her ultimate 
reintegration into society. If an offender commits a crime during 
the trial freedom period, they obviously do not appreciate their 
freedom and therefore should not be trusted again.
<P>
	In 1988 had Joseph Fredericks, a convicted pedophile with a 
long criminal record, not been entitled to statutory release, or 
mandatory supervision as it was known then, Christopher 
Stevenson, an innocent 11-year old Brampton boy, might not have 
been brutally murdered. It is for this reason that serious 
consideration should be given to this proposal by my colleague 
from Scarborough.
<P>
	The issue of an offender committing a crime while on early 
release for a previous crime brings us to another section of the bill 
which deals with an area referred to as corrections math. Currently, 
if an offender commits a new crime while still serving a sentence 
for a previous crime, the new sentence begins on the start date of 
the original sentence. I am certain that anyone listening to this is 
confused, as I was when I first learned about sentence calculation 
many years ago when I was in Millbrook on the other side of the 
table doing parole hearings.
<P>
	It still makes me angry. An offender serving a sentence of seven 
years for armed robbery commits another crime while on early 
release in year five of his or her sentence. Although the offender is 
sentenced to an additional three years in prison for the crime that 
was committed while on early release, they will not serve 
additional time in jail because the new sentence will be merged 
with the original one. Basically they are allowed to commit a free 
crime.
<P>
	It is Friday afternoon, 2.30, and everyone wants to leave. It is the 
end of the time. I am sorry I was not able to finish my speech, but I 
want to tell members that I support Bill C-242 and the amendments 
to it. I hope the justice minister is listening.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member for 
Victoria-Haliburton for his co-operation.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the order 
is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	Before adjourning, I wish all of you and yours a very happy 
Thanksgiving.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to wish you all a wonderful Thanksgiving Day.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday, 
October 16 at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28 and 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.31 p.m.)
