	The committee has examined the bill and agreed to report it with

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSPORT">TRANSPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the sixth report of the Standing Committee on Transport, tabled on 
Wednesday, February 12, 1997, be concurred in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to 
speak to this motion. The sixth report of the Standing Committee 
on Transport was about the need to reinvest as quickly as possible 
in our national highway network.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	As you know, back in 1993 a report that was endorsed almost 
unanimously by federal, provincial and territorial transport 
ministers recommended reinvesting in our national highway 
network. This is important because, with the free trade agreement, 
new communications networks and increase in trade with the 
Americans, one of the major tools we need is an adequate highway 
network.
<P>
	The work that went into this report included a strictly 
non-partisan search for new financing methods. That the federal 
government has failed to act since that time is mainly a matter of 
availability of funding. That being said, our committee tried to find 
new ways and received suggestions on the subject, including one 
under the heading ``Public/Private Partnerships''.
<P>
	This method of financing reverses the risk factor attached to 
highway construction, which is a rather interesting point. In the 
past, when the government decided to build or renovate a highway, 
it had to find the money, make it available and award the contract to 
a contractor so he could build the highway, which tied up 
government money for a long time. As you know, there are times, 
and that is the case now, when money is not available.
<P>
	The new financing approach based on private and public 
partnerships is a way to transfer the risk. It is up to the promoter, 
the highway construction company that decides to invest in a 
highway to find the appropriate financing, partners and other 
promoters, and they do this because the government says: ``If you 
build the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8562"> 8562 </A></B>
<P>
highway, we will guarantee financing for the next 30, 40 or 50 
years, as soon as the highway is built''.
<P>
	What is attractive about this kind of financing is that during 
construction, which could easily take two, three or four 
years-financing is provided by the construction company and not 
by the government. This can be an opportunity to get several major 
projects moving.
<P>
	The transport committee travelled across Canada to conduct 
consultations on the relationship between trade, tourism and 
transportation. We realized that a major overhaul was required, that 
Canada's network of highways needed considerable work, and this 
type of financing would make it possible.
<P>
	The other interesting point in public/private partnership funding 
is that, unlike in past years when the builder tended to work as 
quickly as possible, to save as much as possible and to build a road 
that would be adequate for the next few years, while the cost of 
road repairs in the future and the fact that there were faults in the 
construction were somewhat less of a concern, given that, once the 
work on the road was approved, he was relieved of his 
responsibilities.
<P>
	Under the new system, as the road builder is the road owner, like 
a good homeowner he will have to make sure that his property is in 
tip-top shape. Developers and builders will be obliged to build 
roads that are more solid and that will last longer, because they will 
not have to invest in repairs after 10, 15 or 20 years, as is the case at 
the moment.
<P>
	I find this approach very interesting, and I wanted to point it out 
to make it clear that solutions are possible and that the official 
opposition can act constructively when it is possible to do so.
<P>
	This type of funding was not invented by the transport 
committee nor, necessarily, by those who made the presentation. It 
has already been tried out in a number of countries, where a more 
satisfactory and permanent highway network has been built.
<P>
	What is interesting in the report as well is that provincial 
jurisdictions were taken into account throughout the report and in 
the recommendations. This has not always been the case in the 
past. The official opposition had to be very vigilant during the 
preparation of the report to make sure that the government did not 
maintain a paternalistic and centralizing attitude.
<P>
	We understand very well that several provinces feel they cannot 
afford to invest in such highways, because we must bear in mind 
that it is the federal government which has taxation powers. It is 
important that this be done according to jurisdiction, and this is 
why-in view of the criteria established by the committee and the 
suggestion regarding the new funding arrangements-we believe 
this step is so significant.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	We would have liked the Minister of Finance to be more explicit 
in the budget regarding his support of those projects. When he 
appeared before the committee, he encouraged us to explore the 
situation, to study it in more detail, but this is a sector where 
government decisions are urgently needed. As I said earlier, this is 
not a matter of committing funds for the short term. It is a matter of 
determining whether the selected projects are worthwhile.
<P>
	I made suggestions that were included in the committee's report 
recommending that a number of innovative pilot projects be 
undertaken across Canada in the next five or ten years.
<P>
	For instance, one pilot project could be undertaken in a very 
densely populated area, on a particularly busy stretch of the 
Canadian highway system. As well, pilot projects could be 
undertaken in regions where traffic is much lighter, but they would 
still have a major economic impact.
<P>
	For example, after road 185 between Rivière-du-Loup and 
Edmundston, New Brunswick, which is part of the Trans-Canada 
highway, was upgraded some 20 years ago, there was a substantial 
increase in truck traffic, and now this stretch of road is very busy. 
Security is even becoming a problem.
<P>
	I think it would be interesting to do an experimental project on 
this section of highway, in that part of Quebec, to see if a 
partnership with the private sector could work and how the 
government and the private sector could agree on a way to pay for 
the leasing of the upgraded highway.
<P>
	Economically, this is important since, in fact, all trade between 
New Brunswick and Ontario goes through highway 20, which only 
goes up to Rivière-du-Loup. It does continue up to New Brunswick, 
but not as a four lane highway. There would be some interesting 
work to do in this area. No matter what the status of Quebec is, 
whether it becomes a sovereign state or remains part of Canada, 
this type of project would benefit the Canadian economy as a 
whole. It would also benefit those who use the road on a regular 
basis.
<P>
	In a rural area like ours, in the Témiscouata region, this road has 
a significant economic impact. It allows all regular road users to 
get from one place to another. Today in various municipalities, 
people live in fear of the truck they see coming in their rear view 
mirror and of the dangerous situations they have to face. 
Unfortunately, the high number of accidents is proof that there is a 
need to act quickly in this area.
<P>
	This pilot project would be worthwhile as it would stimulate 
economic activity. This pilot project would also be worthwhile 
because it would take place in an area less densely populated than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8563"> 8563 </A></B>
<P>
major centres like Montreal,  Toronto, or Quebec City, but it would 
still be significant for the people living there.
<P>
	It is important for all small and medium size businesses to have 
access to the American market in a timely fashion. If you recall, 
not too long ago there was a railway running along the road. The 
tracks have been removed, putting additional pressure on the road 
system. Unfortunately it would not be possible today to build the 
railway tracks again, but it would be possible to ensure that the 
road network benefits from the new partnership program between 
the public and the private sectors, which would put us several years 
ahead compared to more traditional financing. If tomorrow we in 
Canada tried to meet all traditional road upgrading needs, we could 
not do it for lack of financial resources. Therefore, we must be 
creative and offer new suggestions like the one before us.
<P>
	The wood industry in particular would benefit from this project, 
since processing of raw materials is on the rise. There is room for 
manufactured products on the U.S. market, and transportation costs 
are becoming an important factor in North American competition.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	This is often the element that will make the difference between a 
profitable contract, an adequate bid in reply to a request for 
proposals, and withdrawing from the market. Therefore, when the 
federal government proposes a penalizing reform like the 
employment insurance reform in a region like ours, one way to 
compensate for its negative impact is to diversify the economy 
through the infrastructure.
<P>
	A few years ago, Quebec sovereignists were not so well 
informed on all aspects of rail, air and sea transport. But since the 
Bloc Quebecois has been in Ottawa, we have realized that it is 
imperative to link the different transportation modes. That is why 
an idea as original as the one proposed in the sixth report of the 
transport committee should be promoted, should get a chance to be 
tried out in pilot projects, as recommended in the committee's 
report.
<P>
	I hope that one of the first places where such a pilot project will 
be implemented will be on the stretch of road between 
Rivière-du-Loup and Edmundston, because that section really 
meets all the requirements to determine if joint funding by the 
private and the public sectors could be worthwhile.
<P>
	All this, in the end, to give to the economies of our regions the 
best possible tools of development. The federal government has 
often said that Quebec gets more in transfer payments than it 
contributes. Quebecers react to this by recalling the years when 
they depended on unemployment insurance. This is something 
often mentioned by the federal government, but something we do 
no longer want any part of. What we want is the money we pay in 
federal taxes to come back to us in constructive ways, as 
investments which would allow our regions to be competitive 
while co-operating with neighbouring regions.
<P>
	Northern New Brunswick would surely benefit from a project 
like this one which would facilitate the transfer of materials from 
one part of Canada to another. It is the same principle as the gas 
pipeline which comes from Quebec City and goes through 
Rivière-du-Loup on its way to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 
When such projects are realized, everyone comes out a winner.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to restate that the official opposition 
supported the testing of partnerships between the public and private 
sectors in the area of transportation. We believe that it is a solution 
for the future and we would like the federal government to state its 
final position as quickly as possible and to launch projects which 
would prove that it is not simply window dressing, but that it will 
implement the recommendations of the parliamentary committee 
so they can lead to concrete benefits. It would really benefit the 
whole of the Canadian economy, given that transportation 
infrastructures in this country have always been important means 
of development, and we have to reinvest in that area in innovative 
ways.
<P>
	I would like to ask that the report of the Standing Committee on 
Transport, tabled February 12, be concurred in. Once this is done, 
the federal government could propose projects which would 
stimulate regional economies and allow them to face the challenges 
of the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my learned colleague for his, I dare say, masterly speech. He never 
ceases to amaze me; he is an expert on everything, and we realize 
it.
<P>
	However, I would like him to give a few extra details concerning 
this partnership approach, because I did not fully understand how it 
will be funded. What kind of funding will be used? I would like our 
colleague to tell us a little more about the funding. I would also like 
to know whether the transport committee, which he was a member 
of, looked at marine transportation for heavy, surplus and off size 
goods.
<P>
	I would like to know if the committee talked about trying to 
bring back coastal shipping, formerly used in Quebec to carry 
goods from Montreal to Gaspé or from Montreal to the Lower 
North Shore, for example, because it would spare our roads.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, as for the first part of the question about 
funding, I belive it would go like this: a consortium of highway 
builders makes a proposal to the government regarding sites 
identified by the government as sites to be funded. Instead of 
asking the government to pay to have the highway built and, 
therefore, own it, the consortium takes it upon itself to raise the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8564"> 8564 </A></B>
<P>
necessary  funding. The consortium goes to the government and 
says: ``Tell us what terms we can expect to operate under in the 
future-basically, how much will the rent be for the next 20, 30 or 
40 years-and we will raise funds accordingly, to ensure 
completion of the highway''.
<P>
	From the government's point of view, this approach has the 
advantage of not costing a penny during the three to five years it 
takes to build it. The consortium will pay for that part of the 
project. It will certainly be paid back as part of long term financing, 
but this type of funding can help boost to some extent the economy 
or development in the industrial sector.
<P>
	It has never been tried in Canada. In the past, there have been 
experiments in the United Kingdom, for example, and a similar 
project was carried out in the maritimes. Canada should have seven 
or eight of these sites to assess the benefits over a five- or ten-year 
period.
<P>
	The second part of the question concerns shipping. The 
committee has undertaken a major review of the relationships 
between transport, trade and tourism. Because of the urgent need 
for action in that area, it has focused much more on highways than 
anything else.
<P>
	Just the same, we have heard people from various sectors who 
had all sorts of suggestions to make. People involved in tourism 
have told us that, at present, the highway system in Canada does 
not promote the development of tourism across Canada versus the 
U.S. competition.
<P>
	In Quebec for instance, we have been reminded of the fact that 
the federal government still has not done anything about casinos on 
cruise ships. The tourism industry and the shipping industry in 
Quebec have ben making representations for years to be able to 
operate casinos onboard cruise ships while on the St. Lawrence 
river. This would be a plus in terms of tourist attractions. The 
government has been dragging its feet on this issue for quite a 
while. Representations were made to that effect.
<P>
	Another aspect of the consultation process concerns Bill C-44 
regarding ports reform. Currently, communities along the river, and 
everywhere in Canada, are very concerned about what will happen 
to these ports. We were told that the ports would be turned over to 
the private sector and to local interests. What will be the conditions 
governing this transfer? Will the facilities be in such a condition 
that their service life will make them attractive when they are 
transferred? All this is not very clear.
<P>
	Bill C-44 has been shelved. We wonder why the government is 
now delaying this legislation, after putting pressure to have it 
reviewed at report stage, last fall. Maybe the government realized, 
after seeing our proposed amendments, including on the status of 
Canada port authorities and on other issues, that its bill was not up 
to date and that some additional work was required.
<P>
	The first thing that comes to mind about this tour is that, in the 
past, Quebec suffered a great prejudice because of the shared 
jurisdiction in the transport sector between the federal and 
provincial governments. Quebec has jurisdiction over highways 
and was able to take action in that area, but a large part of the 
province's budget was eaten away in the process.
<P>
	This was done at the expense of the development of an integrated 
transport strategy. In Canada, no one has put in place an integrated 
strategy that would enable us to know when to rely on marine 
transportation, for example, or when to use trains, road carriers or 
air carriers. The result is that we are now faced with totally absurd 
situations that could have been avoided, had there been only one 
level of government involved in these areas.
<P>
	This is the primary conclusion I come to after that tour. As the 
opposition's transport critic, I see a similarity between what is 
happening in this sector and in the manpower sector. Things will 
work only once the provinces have full jurisdiction over this sector. 
This is important because, as in other areas, we are stuck with 
duplication problems and with the fact that it is impossible, for a 
government that does not have full and sole responsibility, to 
develop strategies that would include all of these areas.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, the transport committee has more work to do. 
However, Quebecers will have to clearly express their will at the 
next election and say that, in this sector as in others, our province 
urgently needs to have full and sole jurisdiction, until sovereignty 
is achieved.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, spring will be here soon, because, as I noticed while 
driving in this morning, there sure are a lot of potholes out there. I 
think my colleague's comments on the transport committee's 
report are most timely.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup mentioned 
a pilot project, the first of its kind, that would go from 
Rivière-du-Loup up to Edmunston. He also talked about the 
jurisdictions that would be involved.
<P>
	I have not forgotten my geography. Since Edmunston is located 
in New Brunswick and Rivière-du-Loup in the province of Quebec, 
I would like my hon. colleague to describe for us what an ideal 
public/private partnership would be, if this pilot project is 
approved, of course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed, throughout the drafting of this 
report, the Bloc Quebecois was careful to ensure that the various 
jurisdictions were taken into consideration. We already have 
funding mechanisms and agreements can eventually be reached 
between the provincial government and the federal government.
<P>
	As was mentioned in a feature article published in <I>Le Journal de 
Montréal</I> last week, the Government of  Quebec is open to this kind 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8565"> 8565 </A></B>
<P>
of experiment and since governments all have money problems, 
they are ready to welcome some new action plans.
<P>
	As for the pilot project from Rivière-du-Loup to Edmunston, 
what is needed is an agreement between the provincial government 
and the Government of Canada to experiment with this kind of 
project. Since we are dealing with the Trans-Canada Highway, the 
federal government has some say in the matter. If such an 
agreement is reached, business people will set up a financing 
consortium for this kind of project.
<P>
	I intend to ask some of the stakeholders who took part in similar 
projects in other countries to come here and see how such a project 
could work, so that we can elaborate a concrete proposal in the 
months to come, before the next elections, in such a way that all the 
parties involved will have the opportunity to express theirs views 
on the relevance of these projects.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I declare the motion 
carried.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFREPORTSTAGE">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF REPORT STAGE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from February 21, consideration of Bill 
C-71, an act to regulate the manufacture, sale, labelling and 
promotion of tobacco products, to make consequential 
amendments to another Act and to repeal certain Acts, as reported 
(with amendments) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 1, 3, 
8, 26 and 29.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we resume consideration of report  stage of Bill C-71. 
With the guillotine the government just imposed on this bill, we 
unfortunately have only today's sitting to try to explain to 
Canadians what the situation really is right now.
<P>
	Thus, for the benefit of our viewers and in the hope that the 
government will finally understand, I remind the House that the 
Bloc Quebecois supports 80 per cent at least of this bill. We are not 
ashamed of saying it out loud and clear: we agree with 80 per cent 
of this bill.
<P>
	This having been said, I want to stress an extremely important 
matter. The government is missing the whole point with this bill, 
since it does not recognize in the first clause that tobacco is a 
hazardous, highly addictive and potentially lethal product. That is 
what should appear in clause 1 if the government were really being 
consistent.
<P>
	But no, the government refuses to do that because it would then 
have to crack down on tobacco and, eventually, to declare it an 
illegal substance, thus losing billions of dollars in taxes. That is 
where the problem lies. When the time comes to collect money, the 
government has no problem with tobacco, but when the time comes 
to let tobacco companies give money for cultural and sports events, 
especially in Montreal, which receives half of the sponsorship 
money, the government claims that its duty is to protect children's 
health.
<P>
	To protect children's health, the government would first have to 
control tobacco. The government should be able to force tobacco 
companies to reduce the nicotine content of their cigarettes.
<P>
	With its insidious measures and fallacious arguments, the 
government has brought us to a dead end because, in the past ten 
years, it has financed tobacco producers to help them make tobacco 
more addictive. Consequently, a young person who starts smoking 
today needs another cigarette after an hour and a half. That is what 
tobacco companies have decided. A smoker cannot go for more 
that an hour and a half without having a cigarette. That is how long 
he can go before having a nicotine fit. We even see people who, 
unfortunately, have to slip out; even though they work on the sixth 
floor, they rush downstairs to light up outside the building because 
they cannot wait more that an hour and a half. That is the problem.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The government should stop doing that, recognize that tobacco is 
a dangerous product and force tobacco companies, which are 
mostly located in Ontario, to reduce the nicotine content of their 
cigarettes.
<P>
	If it controlled tobacco products, the government could then 
regulate access to these products and control tobacco advertising, 
but it should not ban sponsorships because this is a dead end for the 
government. There is not one serious study that shows a direct 
cause-and-effect relationship between tobacco advertising and 
smoking.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8568"> 8568 </A></B>
<P>
	I would really like to know how a young person can see the 
Rothmans logo on Jacques Villeneuve's car zooming by at 240 
kilometres an hour. One must really have good eyesight to see the 
words Rothmans, Players or du Maurier at those speeds. One must 
have really sharp eyesight. The ban on sponsorship will really put 
us into trouble.
<P>
	I repeat that tobacco should be a controlled substance, it should 
be declared a dangerous product under the Food and Drugs Act. 
This should be the first step, but the government refuses to take it.
<P>
	The second step should be to regulate the inspection process. 
There should be standards setting the maximum nicotine and tar 
content. Instead of that, the government chose to spend millions of 
dollars to try to show us that unidentified packages or plain 
packages would prevent people from smoking. The clever ones lost 
no time in designing even more attractive packages.
<P>
	Complete and effective legislation would first control the 
product and its publicity; not ban it, but control it, control the sale 
of cigarettes. We have been saying for a long time that there should 
be effective coercive measures against people who sell cigarettes to 
children, one cigarette at a time.
<P>
	In her magnificent letter, Senator Hervieux-Payette said that 
when she was chairperson of a school board in a Montreal suburb, 
she fired some employees who sold cigarettes to kids. As some 
editorials pointed out this morning, we must first take certain 
measures before falling into the trap of exaggeration or, worse, 
extremism.
<P>
	Sales must, therefore, be controlled. We need some coercive 
measures. For example, the convenience store owner who sells 
cigarettes to children, one cigarette at a time, could be fined $5,000 
for the first offence, $10,000 for the second offence and, for a third 
offence, he would lose his permit to sell cigarettes. If it is a 
hazardous product, a permit should be required to sell it, and there 
should be someone monitoring permits.
<P>
	Access to tobacco should also be monitored. The government 
has gone overboard: it is forcing convenience stores to conceal 
their displays. We saw cases where a special gadget is required that 
only store employees can operate in order to release a pack of 
cigarettes. In bars, cigarettes are hidden from view so that no one 
can buy them. We have seen some completely ridiculous situations.
<P>
	In an effective bill, the government will first make sure it has 
good controls in place, and then proceed to take action. Controls 
must come before action. Behaviour can be dealt with later. The 
best way to influence the behaviour of young children is through 
proactive measures that build esteem and encourage.
<P>
	It is extremely important not to tell young children that they may 
not do something, because as soon as you do, what is the first thing 
a child or an adolescent wants  to do? The very thing he was told 
not to do beckons to him. Rather than set restrictions, it is better to 
tackle behaviour.
<P>
	Rather than spend $3 million to fund research centres, the 
government should take this money and put together kits 
promoting health, exercise, outdoor activities, anything to keep 
people from taking up smoking.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Then, the environment has to be tackled. Yesterday evening, we 
heard how Toronto had gone to some ridiculous lengths. Smoking 
has apparently been banned in washrooms because they are located 
in the wrong part of the restaurant.
<P>
	It must be possible to alter the product. The government must 
alter the product in order to make it less dangerous and less 
addictive. It is extremely important that people be aware of the 
difference between the cigarettes smoked in the past and those 
available today.
<P>
	The Liberal government is showing a great weakness in its 
inability to come up with a global perspective on the hazards of the 
product, smoking behaviour and the social and physical 
environment in which all those concerned are evolving: smokers, 
non-smokers, merchants, health stakeholders, tobacco companies 
and distribution networks. There must be recognition at the social, 
political and legislative level that the hazards and addictiveness of 
tobacco products take priority over banning sponsorships.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-71 today because this issue is very 
close to my heart.
<P>
	We all know about the harmful effects of smoking. The 
correlation between smoking and various forms of cancer affecting 
the lungs, the throat, the mouth, the larynx, the digestive tract, the 
stomach and the colon has been more than scientifically proven. 
The increased risk of heart disease among smokers is also a well 
known fact.
<P>
	Today, however, I would like to examine this issue from another 
point of view, namely the effect of second hand smoke on the 
health of non-smokers, particularly on the health of children. But 
first of all, I would like to talk briefly about the history of smoking.
<P>
	In his book entitled <I>Le tabagisme</I>, Professor Bertrand 
Dautzenberg tells us that in ancient times, the Greeks and the 
Romans smoked the pipe, or rolled leaves sometimes, but they did 
not smoke tobacco because it did not exist. They smoked pear tree 
leaves, eucalyptus leaves and other plants.
<P>
	In America, tobacco smoking goes back more than 3,000 years, 
both in South America and in the Mississippi Valley. Pipes dating 
back to 1,000 B.C. have been found in South America. The natives 
called that plant  ``petum''. The name tobacco comes either from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8569"> 8569 </A></B>
<P>
the island of Tobago in the Lesser Antilles where it was cultivated 
or from the name the natives gave their pipes.
<P>
	Tobacco, as used by the Incas and the Aztecs during important 
religious ceremonies, also had the virtue of appeasing hunger and 
overcoming fatigue. It was also used as a medicinal plant either by 
itself or in conjunction with coca leaves or other plants.
<P>
	At this stage, it is important to clarify the terminology because 
smoking produces three types of smoke. The best known is called 
mainstream smoke, and it is the smoke that is inhaled by the 
smoker when he or she draws on the cigarette. Then there is 
sidestream smoke, which is released into the environment when the 
smoker is not drawing on the cigarette. Finally, there is second 
hand smoke, which is exhaled by the smoker.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves the following question: which of these 
different types of smoke, mainstream, sidestream or second hand, 
is the most harmful? The answer is this: the most toxic type of 
smoke is the sidestream smoke that is released into the 
environment, because it undergoes an aging process before it is 
inhaled. What does the aging of smoke mean? It means that while 
the cigarette is burning in an ashtray, for example, certain 
substances such as carbon monoxide decompose and these altered 
substances are found in greater quantities in side stream smoke 
than in mainstream smoke.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	And what are the effects of these substances on our health and 
our children's health?
<P>
	Taking carbon monoxide as an example, everyone knows it 
decreases the amount of oxygen going to peripheral tissues, but 
how many people know that benzene is related to the development 
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia?
<P>
	Moreover, how many people know that the concentration of 
nicotine is two to three times greater in sidestream smoke than it is 
in mainstream smoke? One often wonders how much one can 
smoke daily without harming other family members, especially 
children. This is hard to say, because there are different definitions 
of harm, and many factors involved.
<P>
	It is easily understood that the smaller the room nonsmokers 
have to share with smokers, the greater the risk to them. The most 
dangerous places are on the job and in a car. Yes, a car. One of the 
first studies in this area, if not the absolute first, dates back to 1981 
in Japan, when Professor T. Hiramata proved unequivocally the 
harmful effects of cigarette smoke on nonsmokers.
<P>
	Why a study in Japan? First of all, because the Japanese live in 
very close quarters, more often than not a single room, and at the 
time of the study a poorly ventilated one. Second, because only 15 
per cent of Japanese women smoke, one-fifth of the figure for men:  
75 per cent. The study findings demonstrated that lung cancer 
among nonsmoking women was proportionate to the husband's 
smoking habit. Women whose husbands smoked were twice as 
likely to have cancer as women whose husbands did not.
<P>
	The focus of these studies was lung cancer, but it is most 
interesting to note that the same study also showed an increased 
incidence of breast cancer and leukemia in these same couples. All 
studies agree on this; 330 Canadians died in 1996 from lung cancer 
caused by someone else's smoking.
<P>
	I will close on my favourite topic: children. We all have young 
children or young grandchildren. Here are the facts: cigarette 
smoke is directly linked to all forms of respiratory disease, from 
pneumonia, to bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma and ear infections. 
How so? The child inhales nitrous oxides, which increases the 
sensitivity of its lungs. Children's contact with second hand smoke 
can have major and serious consequences for the quality of life of 
our young people in the short, medium and long term.
<P>
	In fact, children of pre-school age are the most at risk. They are 
often sick and are much sicker than children were 25 years ago. The 
phenomenal increase in asthma, for instance, is very disturbing. 
When children have ear infections, daycare is often blamed, but it 
has now been proved that the smoke from parents' cigarettes is as 
much to blame, if not more so, than daycare, with consequences 
such as future learning disabilities, operations, and so forth.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to say that the purpose of my speech 
today is not only to support this bill unreservedly but also to try and 
make the Canadian public aware, through my humble contribution, 
of the very real and harmful effects of second hand smoke and 
especially of the beneficial impact of a healthy environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would first like to point out some very sad facts about 
Parliament. I note that, in the case of such an important bill, it does 
not matter what our viewpoint is, we are in Parliament, and in a 
democracy the best way to oppose an idea is to propose a better 
one. Today, however, we can take no pride in the fact that the 
government and the members opposite chose an authoritarian and 
dictatorial measure that provides very little for freedom of ideas 
and discussion: the guillotine.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I would like to remind our viewers of what a guillotine means in 
parliamentary terms. Applying a guillotine limits the time for the 
proceedings. At the end of the time set aside for debate, whether all 
the members wishing to speak have spoken or not, the question is 
put.
<P>
	The issue of tobacco and its relationship to public health is a 
complex one. I think our colleague from  Rimouski-Témiscouata 
summed it up well when she said that we in the official opposition 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8570"> 8570 </A></B>
<P>
support the objectives sought in general terms, we support about 80 
per cent of them.
<P>
	Bills have objectives and this is why we asked those drafting 
them to follow policy and use legal terminology in wording the 
objectives. We agree that it is unacceptable, in 1997, for some 
40,000 people to take up smoking, which will ultimately kill them.
<P>
	We are also aware that smoking is more than just a personal 
responsibility. If smoking were merely a personal matter, the 
lawmaker would probably not be concerned and we would not be 
having today's debate. We also recognize that the community has a 
responsibility, because the health system pays out hundreds of 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	However, there is a discrepancy between the objectives and the 
means proposed to achieve them. Not only is there a discrepancy, 
but there is somewhat of a paradox in the fact that the government, 
while trying to solve a problem, or at least while trying to 
contribute to solving it, is going to jeopardize major sports and 
cultural events.
<P>
	I believe one cannot remain unaffected by what is going on in 
this industry. I will take Montreal as an example. As you know, 
Montreal is a favourite venue for cultural and sports events. It is a 
well known fact. Indeed I believe the member for Saint-Hyacinthe 
is an avid consumer. In the summer he can be seen wearing a 
T-shirt and bermuda shorts, casual and yet serious, attending the 
jazz festival, the Francopholies, and what not. I believe he does not 
miss any.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Oh no, I do not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I say it again, he is always welcome in Montreal.
<P>
	As you know the sponsoring industry is one that plans ahead. We 
are not talking about short term planning, a few weeks ahead of 
time. To give you an idea of the order of magnitude we are talking 
about, the tobacco industry sponsors a number of sports and 
cultural events to the tune of close to $60 million.
<P>
	If the government had been serious, if it had behaved 
professionally, if it had been consistent in its objectives-there 
might well exist a link between smoking and advertising on the site 
of sports events, but what we are saying is that, at the moment, it 
has not been rigorously proven. This link has not been 
scientifically established. Although we might suspect there is one.
<P>
	Just imagine if, as legislators, we were to pass legislation on the 
basis of approximations, speculations, without sufficient data to 
support the measures. We are now presented with a bill which, 
ultimately, could put several sports and cultural events at risk. Why 
are we concerned? I am concerned first of all as a Montrealer. I 
think it bears reminding that there are some institutional  partners 
who usually do not dabble in politics. As we speak, there is great 
effervescence in Montreal. People are in the streets. Not only are 
they marching, they have the support of several extremely 
important partners. I am thinking for example of the Convention 
and Tourism Bureau of Greater Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The convention and tourism bureau's mandate is to promote 
tourist activities, not public health. It is not an agency operating in 
Parliament. Why did it find it appropriate to break silence and join 
the people who, a few minutes ago, decided to close their 
businesses and take to the streets of Montreal? It decided to keep 
silent, but at the same time, to speak volumes down in the street, 
because this bill is unreasonable.
<P>
	It is not unreasonable from a public health perspective. Of 
course we are in favour of any measure aimed at reducing tobacco 
use. However, for a democrat, the end never justifies the means. It 
is not true that in order to fight against smoking we have to threaten 
whole areas of our cultural industry.
<P>
	Why did the government not provide for a transition period? 
Why did it not propose some financial compensation? It is too easy 
to ban, to prohibit without guaranteeing that it will not have a 
major financial impact.
<P>
	The jazz festival is an international event. People from all 
corners of the world come to Montreal to listen to jazz music 
because that festival's reputation is well established. Out of the 
festival's total budget of $9.5 million, approximately $2 million 
come from tobacco sponsorships.
<P>
	Parliament is not the only place there are fireworks you know; 
the Benson and Hedges international fireworks competition draws 
an international jury. I think the parliamentary secretary is well 
aware of that reality. There is a budget of $1.4 million for the 
fireworks, of which $1 million comes from sponsorship.
<P>
	Then there is the Just for Laughs festival, of which <I>Les 
parlementeries</I> are obviously the finest example; a number of hon. 
members in this House should stand for election to that bogus 
parliament: they would surely win.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé: </B>More so the people opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>As the hon. member for Lévis said, more so the 
people opposite. The Just for Laughs festival has a budget of $10 
million, of which $1 million is provided by sponsorship. The 
summer festival in Quebec City has a budget of $4.5 million, of 
which $500,000 comes from sponsorship. Is there a nicer area than 
the capital of Quebec to spend your summer? Every summer, I 
make a point of spending a few days there, meeting different 
people and enjoying varied activities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8571"> 8571 </A></B>
<P>
	We must set the record straight. Through you, Mr. Speaker, I 
want to tell the parliamentary secretary, who is here in the House, 
that we support any measure that will reduce smoking.
<P>
	I have never smoked and I have tried to convince my close 
relatives to stop smoking. Let me thank my mother and father who 
stopped smoking two years ago. It is not easy to stop smoking, 
because there is a dependency involved. The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot stopped smoking four years ago. In our 
environment, we know of individuals who have succeeded, and 
they are to be cited as examples.
<P>
	We know that nicotine creates a dependency. The hon. member 
for Rimouski-Témiscouata reminded us that manufacturers, 
producers have played on this dependency; this clearly shows that 
it is not easy to stop smoking. Smoking is a plague that causes 
intoxication.
<P>
	It is all fine and well to be concerned about it in terms of health, 
but for goodness sake we should not try to solve a problem by 
creating another one. The minister will find the official opposition 
supportive, in matters of public health needs, but we ask him to 
provide for transition mechanisms and to help the industry by 
making available to it some other mechanism whereby the 
activities can continue. I think this is reasonable.
<P>
	If this bill is passed, Montreal will go through another economic 
crisis, and we have a duty to deny our support to anything that 
could lead to that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on the bill. I would like to 
raise a few important notices.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Three years ago the government had an ideal opportunity to do 
something about the horrendous smoking situation. We were faced 
with the terrible situation of smuggling occurring primarily in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The government, however, chose to take a path that 
compromised the lives of Canadian children at the expense of 
political gain and of political courage. It chose to lower the taxation 
and cost of cigarettes in an effort to address the smuggling issue.
<P>
	In terms of decreasing the smuggling of tobacco, that issue was 
addressed because it decreased. However the cost was the increase 
in consumption and the increase in the number of young people 
smoking by the amount of a quarter of million every single year.
<P>
	Over the last three years the government by lowering the price of 
cigarettes introduced a quarter of a million new children to 
cigarette smoking every single year, or 750,000 children over the 
last three years, half of whom will die prematurely and virtually all 
of whom will suffer diseases, mortality and morbidity at a rate 
much higher than Canadians who do not smoke.
<P>
	The smuggling issue is an interesting one. Smuggling not only 
involves tobacco. It also involves guns, drugs, people, alcohol and 
cigarettes. The amount of cigarettes smuggled was all that was 
decreased. The conduits of smuggling existed as they do today. The 
solution we proposed three years ago would have effectively 
decreased the consumption of cigarettes and would have addressed 
the smuggling issue.
<P>
	Our proposal was to bring the export tax to where it was in 1992. 
The Conservative government of the day brought in an export tax 
of $8 per carton. In six weeks smuggling of cigarettes plummeted 
almost 70 per cent. The tobacco companies, fearful of a decrease in 
their profits, said if the government of the day did not remove that 
export tax they would leave the country.
<P>
	What happened? The Conservative government of the day 
buckled under pressure of the tobacco companies, removed the 
export tax, and consumption went right back up. The smuggling 
issue was not addressed. If we put on a tobacco export tax 
smuggling will go down.
<P>
	Also the law should be enforced. No one speaks about the people 
who live in these areas, many of whom are on aboriginal reserves 
on the Quebec-U.S. border. No one speaks about law-abiding 
innocent individuals living on these reserves who have to put up 
with thugs engaged in the movement and trafficking of illicit 
cigarettes as well as alcohol, weapons and drugs. Much of this is 
tied into criminal gangs in the United States. It is not run by 
law-abiding people. It is run by thugs and crooks.
<P>
	The single most important thing we could do is decrease 
consumption. I do not care about the issues of sponsorship or 
education. Education is important but unless people have been 
living in a cave for the last 30 years they know smoking is bad for 
their health. Smoking is addictive and smoking kills. It is not a 
problem of education. Cost is the single most important 
determining factor in consumption, particularly in children. There 
is ample scientific evidence showing that the supply and demand 
curve for consumption is very elastic in price.
<P>
	To decrease consumption tobacco taxes should be what they 
were before January 1994. In that way consumption will decrease. 
Revenues to the government will increase and health care costs will 
go down. It is unlike any other tax. We are a party firmly in favour 
of decreasing taxation.
<P>
	Tobacco presents a different situation. If tobacco taxes can be 
what they were as of January 1994, consumption will go down. 
Costs to the taxpayer will go down in terms of health care costs. By 
lowering the taxation rate government revenues have gone down 
and the costs to the taxpayer have escalated dramatically in terms 
of health care.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	With respect to the sponsorship issue the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois like to trumpet, let us call a spade a  spade. I do not think 
anyone in the House has been deluded into thinking for one 
moment that tobacco companies are sponsoring the Grand Prix and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8572"> 8572 </A></B>
<P>
the Players International Tennis Championship out of the goodness 
of their hearts.
<P>
	The tobacco companies sponsor events like the Montreal Jazz 
Festival, the Players International Tennis Championship and the 
Grand Prix so that children will take up cigarette smoking. The 
only reason any company invests in advertising is so that people 
will buy their product. The product in this case is a cancer causing, 
debilitating, addictive substance called tobacco.
<P>
	There is ample evidence to show in countries such as New 
Zealand, Great Britain and France tobacco sponsorship has been 
banned from sports and arts and cultural festivals. The festivals did 
not decline or go away. Rather they thrived because they found 
sponsors in other areas.
<P>
	There is no reason to believe that cultural and sporting events 
would leave Canada. Where would they go? Would they go to the 
United States? I think not. The United States is in the process of 
banning tobacco advertising in sponsorship and cultural events. 
Will they move to Europe? Of course not because it is banned in 
most countries there. Where will they go?
<P>
	It is a false promise trumpeted by the tobacco companies that 
cultural and sporting events will leave Canada because tobacco 
companies are not allowed to sponsor them. They will not leave 
Canada.
<P>
	The government can propose some alternative solutions to 
ensure cultural events survive quite nicely, perhaps by using some 
interim funding from tobacco taxes. By increasing the taxes we 
would decrease consumption, particularly among children.
<P>
	Education about tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana and other drugs 
including solvents is very important. Money from tobacco taxes 
could be applied to early childhood education to educate children 
in Kindergarten that smoking, drinking, solvents, cocaine, pot and 
heroin are all very bad and can ruin their lives.
<P>
	If the government proposed that along with its provincial 
counterparts a co-operative and productive situation would result. 
There would be a decrease in consumption of tobacco without 
compromising the lives of Canadians and without compromising 
our sports and cultural events. We are sensitive to that and believe 
the proposals put forward in the past will ensure cultural events 
continue and the consumption of tobacco decreases.
<P>
	In closing, three years ago the government had an opportunity to 
address the smoking epidemic in our midst. Instead of making the 
situation better it made it worse by making cigarettes more 
affordable for the children of our great nation. It is a terrible legacy 
to leave Canadians. It is the single worst piece of legislation  
affecting the health of Canadians I can remember in the last 35 to 
40 years. I cannot think of a piece of legislation that has been more 
damaging to the health and welfare of Canadians than what the 
government did back in February 1994.
<P>
	Amendments can be made today in the House. However the 
government needs to have the courage to stand up to the smoking 
lobbyists and tobacco companies and say ``We are not going to take 
it anymore. We are going to address this health epidemic. We are 
going to do it for the betterment of all Canadians''.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The proposals are out there. We and other Canadians have 
proposed them. Now take it and use it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I usually rise to say I am pleased to participate in the 
debate on whatever bill is before us at the time but, in this case, I 
must say I am not so pleased to speak on a bill that is a direct attack 
on and which threatens the very existence of cultural and sports 
events, particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	This is a bill befitting fundamentalists. All this time, we thought 
the rise of fundamentalism was centred in the Muslim world; we 
must recognize that we need not look any further than this place to 
find fundamental fundamentalism. The minister who introduced 
this bill that may well kill cultural events like the Montreal Jazz 
Festival and sports events like the Montreal Grand Prix car race is 
the same minister who, a little over one year ago, had the brilliant 
idea of legislating to prevent us from eating and producing raw 
milk cheese in Canada. There is a limit.
<P>
	One would think this minister turned into the ayatollah of the 
House of Commons: he wants to run our lives, preventing us from 
doing this, that and the other. What kind of society will this make? 
Where are the ministers and members from Quebec when they see 
a minister from Atlantic Canada jeopardizing an important part of 
Montreal's economy? Where are they? Where is the Minister of 
Finance and member for LaSalle-Émard? He has been absent 
since the start of our debate on this issue and, every time it is 
raised, he runs away and hides in the back.
<P>
	Where is the Minister of Labour and hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard, our great defender of parmesan cheese? When his 
parmesan cheese was attacked, he was outraged. Where is he today, 
while the Jazz Festival, the Just for Laughs Festival, the Montreal 
Grand Prix and the Trois-Rivières Grand Prix are being put on the 
line? Where is the great upholder of civil liberties? He is probably 
eating spaghetti sprinkled with parmesan cheese. He has traded 
away all the major cultural and sporting events held in 
Montreal-$30 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8573"> 8573 </A></B>
<P>
million out of the  $60 million spent by Canadian sponsors-, all 
that for a spoonful of parmesan cheese.
<P>
	Where is the hon. member for Outremont and Secretary of State 
in charge of the Federal Office of Regional Development for 
Quebec? We do not hear him anymore. Where is the great defender 
of Montreal's economy? He is also in hiding. He has been brought 
to heel.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. During the second mandate of the Trudeau 
government, there were 74 Liberal nitwits in the House and today 
we have a bunch of nitwits, Liberals again, who are afraid to get up 
and defend those who voted for them.
<P>
	This is no small affair. They are jeopardizing events such as the 
Just for Laughs Festival, the Montreal Grand Prix, the 
Trois-Rivières Grand Prix, of which my colleague, the hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières, is an ardent supporter, the Montreal 
and Toronto film festivals, the Montreal and Vancouver jazz 
festivals, the Benson &amp; Hedges International, the Players Tennis 
International, and many other cultural and sporting events which 
are held in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	In Montreal alone, cultural events represent 2,000 jobs. Given 
the unemployment rate in Montreal right now, this is disgraceful. 
Quebec's Liberal members across the way, the 1996-97 crop, 
should be ashamed of themselves for not speaking up against this 
bill, for not asking the Atlantic Ayatollah to withdraw such an 
fundamentalist bill. Soon, Quebecers and Canadians will have to 
ask permission just to walk.
<P>
	How could they introduce such a bill?
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	It reminds me of the measures taken during the prohibition. It is 
a return to a terrible ultra-conservatism that must be rejected. This 
government behaves like a dictatorship. It tells us what to eat, what 
to drink and what to listen to. Canadians have had enough of these 
absurd measures. This bill is totally and utterly ridiculous.
<P>
	For the public to mobilize so quickly, as we saw yesterday and as 
we will see today in Montreal and in Toronto, this legislation has to 
be utterly ridiculous.
<P>
	We are not talking about peanuts here. For the Montreal jazz 
festival, a $1.5 million sponsorship is at stake, at a time when the 
government is making deep cuts in the budgets for the poor and the 
unemployed. Now, it will put 2,000 people out of work in 
Montreal, just like that. This really takes the cake.
<P>
	The same goes for the fireworks festival, which stands to lose a 
$1 million sponsorship. Where will organizers find the money? It 
will be the end of this event in Montreal. The Just for Laughs 
festival will also lose $1 million in sponsorships. And we all know 
that money does not grow on trees.
<P>
	Through such a senseless bill, the government is cutting off 
funding for major events which generate up to $200 million in 
direct and indirect benefits. In the Montreal area alone, about $200 
million a year and 2,000 jobs are at stake.
<P>
	This is a second-rate fundamentalist government. Soon, because 
of the government's actions, Montreal's unemployment rate will 
continue to grow instead of decreasing. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	Where is the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel, who makes it a point of 
honour to rise and supposedly stand up for Quebec? Where is when 
we are discussing this bill?
<P>
	Our favourite constitutionalist minister-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> He is with Guy Bertrand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> -where is the hon. member for 
Saint-Laurent-Cartierville now? Where is this great champion of 
Quebec and of territorial integrity? Where is he? He is not 
speaking. And our Minister of Labour, where is he?
<P>
	The economy of Montreal and the economy of a large part of 
Quebec are being devastated by this government. This bill is totally 
unacceptable. My colleagues and I are ready to go all the way 
because we cannot understand how the government could introduce 
this bill, how it could deliberately jeopardize all cultural and sports 
events sponsored by tobacco companies.
<P>
	We will never accept this bill and we are ready to fight to the 
bitter end to defend the interests of Quebec and those of its 
workers. That is why it is so important for the population to 
continue to mobilize against it and to let this fundamentalist 
government know of their opposition. It takes a ridiculous 
government, with such ridiculous ministers as the health minister, 
to introduce such ridiculous bills as this one. How could the 
government agree to implement this bill?
<P>
	You can count on us. Quebecers, and especially the 2,000 
workers who depend on the many cultural and sports events held in 
the Montreal area, can count on the Bloc Quebecois. We will stand 
up for them with all our energy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
like my colleague for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has just said, this is 
one of the rare occasions when I am not pleased to take the floor to 
deal with a bill. This bill will be really detrimental to the economic 
health of Quebec, and to the well-being of an important part of the 
Canadian economy, the Montreal area, more particularly during the 
summer tourist season.
<P>
	Like my colleague for Rimouski-Témiscouata, I think it is very 
important to stress, as a first point in any speech, that the Bloc 
Quebecois supports part of Bill C-71, and indeed most of it.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8574"> 8574 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Like all Canadians, the Bloc Quebecois takes to heart the health 
of Canadians and Quebecers and would like to protect the young 
from smoking and being hooked on cigarettes.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has supported the principle of this bill 
because it thought wise amendments would be made and tangible 
improvements would make the bill more palatable for 
communities. But that was not to be. The intent of Bill C-71 should 
have been to prevent the promotion of smoking among our kids. 
What kind of prevention does this bill provide? The bill could have 
proposed a partial ban on cultural and sports sponsorships instead 
of a total ban.
<P>
	I would really like to see the government party tabling a study in 
this House showing how many young Canadians started to smoke 
after watching the fireworks from the Jacques-Cartier bridge. Or 
how many youngsters took up smoking after watching a tennis 
match at the new Du Maurier stadium or at the old Jarry park? 
Nobody was ever able to prove young people started smoking after 
attending such events and noboby ever will.
<P>
	I would also like to know what the Liberal Party's objectives are, 
with such a bill, in terms of a decrease in the number of young 
smokers 3, 4 or 5 years down the road. If, at this point in time, 
10,000 young people take up smoking every month, and this is a 
figure I just made up, what impact will the new bill have on the 
number of young people who will stop smoking in the years to 
come because of the ban? Will we have 2,000 or 3,000 fewer 
smokers than we have now? They will not tell us, because, first of 
all, they do not know, and second, there will not be any decrease.
<P>
	Instead of focusing on prevention, education and awareness, the 
bill neglects these issues in favour of a type of coercion that is 
totally off the mark. They are not targeting the people who take up 
smoking, but rather hitting on those who benefit from the 
sponsorship.
<P>
	The sponsors have a very important 1 per cent share of the 
market. The Bloc Quebecois and I believe that tobacco companies 
use their ads to target those who have a favourite brand. If you 
smoke a specific brand of cigarettes and you attend a sponsored 
event, you may be tempted to switch brands, and in my view that is 
why tobacco companies sponsor these events. But will people be 
tempted to take up smoking, that is another matter. Thus, those we 
want to target are the tobacco companies and sports and cultural 
events, not young people as originally intended.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois opposes Bill C-71 at third reading simply 
because the primary objective-to prevent smoking among young 
Quebecers and young Canadians-will not be achieved. But there 
is more. Our Liberal colleagues probably did not watch television 
this  afternoon and see the success of the protest in Montreal. All 
retailers and stakeholders in the Greater Montreal area were asked 
to let business come to a symbolic stop between twelve noon and 
12.15 p.m. to show what Montreal could look like after the act 
comes into force.
<P>
	The operation was a tremendous success. These people are not 
sovereignists or wicked separatists. They are restaurant owners, 
hotel operators, taxi drivers, people from all walks of life who 
benefit from these sponsorships, from the economic benefits 
generated by tourist attractions and events like the Grand Prix and 
the fireworks.
<P>
	The demonstration was a great success. People with very 
different interests got together to try and make the government 
understand that its bill does not make any sense, especially for the 
people in Montreal but also for those in Toronto and Vancouver.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, they are saying: ``It is nothing by a smoke screen. The 
Montreal Grand Prix will stay in Montreal and it will only change 
names. It will not be called the Players Grand Prix anymore''. 
Again this morning, we heard the Grand Prix promoter say on 
television that, contrary to what the Liberals are saying, it is not 
true that the Grand Prix will simply change names and major 
sponsors. Perhaps it will be called the Cottonelle Grand Prix. But it 
remains to be seen whether this company will agree to sponsor the 
Grand Prix.
<P>
	If, for example, milk producers-who now sponsor the Tour de 
l'île-decided to sponsor another event that lost the sponsorship of 
a tobacco company, the subsequent shift in sponsorships would 
indirectly affect the cultural and sporting events currently 
benefiting from the current arrangements. The affected events will 
either disappear or lose money to other events and activities. There 
will be an indirect impact on sporting and cultural events.
<P>
	Therefore, I believe that the Bloc Quebecois has clearly showed 
that Bill C-71 does not achieve its main purpose, which is to 
prevent young people from starting to smoke. The reason we will 
be voting against this bill is simply that, unlike the Liberals, we 
care about the health of Canadians and that the Liberals are missing 
the mark with this bill. It is not because we are not concerned about 
or interested in health. We were told that this bill was mainly about 
health. This is not the case, but it will have an impact on the 
economic health of sports and cultural events.
<P>
	I began by asking how many children started smoking after 
watching the Benson &amp; Hedges fireworks. I think that there are not 
many and the Liberal Party could not introduce them to us. Let us 
see who the other sponsors could be. The major banks were 
mentioned. They already sponsor some events. They do not 
sponsor the events we are talking about here because they do not 
have a direct interest in them. The pool of potential sponsors is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8575"> 8575 </A></B>
<P>
already  spread thin. The government wants us to believe that there 
will be other sponsors, but it could not prove it.
<P>
	Demonstrators gathered very quickly, and the Bloc Quebecois 
has noticed that, in spite of its agreement in principle to protect the 
health of Canadians, the government does not have the will to 
protect it at the present time. For all these reasons, the Bloc 
Quebecois and all the people of Montreal have until Thursday-we 
have been gagged because the government does not want to let us 
speak-to express their opposition and try to knock some sense 
into the government members across the way and the ministers 
from the Montreal area, who will have to justify their decision in 
the next election.
<P>
	When people see the unemployment rate go up and when 
students lose their summer jobs because the events no longer exist, 
we will go to the ridings of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Immigration, we will go to the 
riding of Outremont, which is represented by the hon. 
cigar-smoking minister who tried to express his opposition but was 
rebuffed by the majority of his colleagues, to explain to the people 
why Montreal went downhill after this bill was passed.
<P>
	It is still time because we have 48 hours left to make the Liberal 
members understand that their bill, in its present form, does 
nothing for the health of Canadians, but is detrimental to the 
economic health of Montreal. That is why we will vote against this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great interest and passion that I want to side with my friend 
and colleague, the member for Lévis, who has made a superhuman 
effort this week to bring the present government to change its mind 
in spite of the firm commitment made by the health minister, who 
invited Canadians to vote against his party if he did not succeed in 
having Bill C-71 adopted before the next elections.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I must pay tribute to the member for Lévis because, once again, 
this government is picking on Quebec when things are going well. 
Quebecers have adopted a philosophy that this government seems 
to be doing everything it can to destroy.
<P>
	The best example of that was ten month ago, when the same 
health minister wanted to ban the importation and production of 
raw milk cheese in Canada, knowing that Quebec accounted for 90 
per cent of raw milk cheese consumption and production.
<P>
	The labour minister, the member for Saint-Léonard who is of 
Italian origin, realized from his seat in the House that his friend, the 
health minister, wanted to deprive him of his parmesan cheese 
imported from Italy. The government changed its mind on that 
issue and it will do the same on Bill C-71 because at this very 
moment, in Montreal, all the people who count have  joined forces 
to save their cultural, sports and artistic events.
<P>
	I made a list of ten or so events that are threatened by this bill 
and I would like to read them to you: the Montreal Grand Prix, the 
Benson and Hedges fireworks, the jazz festival, the Trois-Rivières 
Grand Prix, the Festival Just for Laughs, the Valleyfield and 
Ville-Marie regatta, the Quebec summer festival and the 
international tennis championships in Montreal. Do you know that 
tobacco companies invest some $60 million a year to support these 
kinds of events which, without such sponsorship, could not exist? 
Of these $60 million, $30 million are spent in Quebec.
<P>
	Is it just a coincidence that this Liberal government is picking on 
Quebec once again? I doubt it. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said 
in the House that it was to save lives in Canada, because 40,000 
people die every year from smoking, and increasing numbers of 
young people are taking up smoking at a very early age.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, through you, I ask the Prime Minister, and I look 
him in the eye as I ask the question, if he really wants to help our 
young people, why does he not make sure that his own regulations 
are enforced in his country? Cigarettes must be sold to adults only, 
to people 18 years of age and older. Do you know how many 
inspectors there are to enforce this law in Canada? There are 40. 
Since Quebec represents one quarter of the population, it should 
have 10 of these inspectors, if it is not unfortunate. Ten inspectors 
to check whether cigarettes are being sold to those under 18 years 
of age.
<P>
	Yesterday, I asked how many establishments had been found 
breaking the law in the last five years. Government members were 
unable to tell me. They were probably ashamed to give me the 
figure. There are regulations that are not even being enforced, and 
they want to introduce other legislation, other regulations that will 
privatize, I was going to say deprive Quebec of major events and, 
to top it all, that will eliminate several thousand jobs, jobs that are 
often held by students.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	In 1993, along with the promise to scrap the GST, did the 
government not have as one of its slogans ``jobs, jobs, jobs''? The 
unemployment rate has been hovering around 10 per cent for over 
40 months now. Month after month, since this government took 
office, unemployment remained at the same level. It is really the 
first time since the economic depression of the 1930s that 
unemployment has reached 10 per cent, with 1.5 million 
unemployed. Bill C-71 will probably cause 2,000 more 
unemployed workers, although everybody agrees that the fact 
Jacques Villeneuve has a cigarette logo on his clothes will not 
induce youngsters to smoke.
<P>
	Indeed, our good old Prime Minister was proud to have his 
picture taken with Jacques Villeneuve under a Players sign. He was 
hoping this picture would go around  Canada. He was not reluctant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8576"> 8576 </A></B>
<P>
to be photographed just in front of an ad for Players. This shows his 
double standards.
<P>
	The member for Brome-Missisquoi, in the Eastern Townships, 
said he tried to convince the banks to take over from the tobacco 
companies. We checked, and he made only one call to one Ottawa 
office. This is really not serious. Today, the banks told us that this 
was definitely out of the question, because they are not active in 
this field.
<P>
	The member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot who spoke before me 
referred to the fact that there used to be 74 nitwits from the Liberal 
Party, and now there are 20 such nitwits from Quebec, not one of 
whom will rise in defence of Quebec's interests, but fortunately, 
since she does not have to answer to the Prime Minister, Senator 
Céline Hervieux-Payette is getting ready to oppose Bill C-71 in the 
Senate, and has asked her colleagues not to support this bill. We 
hope that the Prime Minister will backtrack or that this bill will die 
on the Order Paper, because of the coming general election.
<P>
	The Minister of Health made a commitment three months ago, 
saying that if he could not get that bill passed, he invited all 
Canadians to vote against the Liberal Party of Canada. I am going 
to top that. Through you, Mr. Speaker, I invite all Canadians, 
especially Quebecers, to teach a lesson to this political party, which 
almost reflects badly on Quebec. The little guy from Shawinigan is 
saying that he will go and take the pulse of his riding in the taverns 
and the shopping centers. I invite him to go to Shawinigan this 
weekend and, if he has the time, to stop off in Trois-Rivières on the 
way to find out what people think of him now, how people rate him. 
I think his popularity is at its lowest point.
<P>
	I therefore invite the Minister of Health and the Prime Minister 
to backtrack. Admitting they made a mistake, as they did in the 
case of the raw milk cheese, will improve their public image.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I just need another ten seconds to conclude. During a press 
conference in Montreal last Sunday, the Minister of Labour said 
they were going to solve the tobacco problem, then the liquor 
problem. His colleague, the hon. member from right across the 
river, the President of the Treasury Board, did not agree. He told his 
distinguished colleague not to overdo it on the liquor issue, that 
they were going to lose too many votes. They are going to deal first 
with the tobacco problem. This just goes to show how they are 
running the country now. They are just coasting along, which is 
nothing for Canadians to be proud of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker,I would like to point out that we are at the report stage of 
Bill C-71. Bills have a first reading and a second reading-and let 
us keep in mind that, with Bill  C-71, the government saw to it that 
there was no debate on second reading; it was referred directly to 
committee. Now they are trying the same thing on for size at report 
stage, putting a gag on us. We will have a time limit for discussing 
this vital matter.
<P>
	In the streets of Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec City, 
people are questioning the government's desire to put an end to 
virtually all of the major cultural and sporting events with tobacco 
company sponsorship. It is important not to use this issue as fodder 
for stirring people up. It must be kept in mind that the Bloc 
Quebecois voted in favour of the principle of this bill at second 
reading. The Prime Minister said yesterday that he no longer 
understood Bloc members, that we should be more openminded. 
When a bill is debated on second reading, it must be realized that it 
is the principle that is being addressed.
<P>
	True, we believe measures to protect the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians are important. Perhaps 80 per cent of the bill concerns 
things we consider important, particularly measures relating to the 
power to regulate tobacco products, measures relating to access to 
products, packaging and promotion. There are a number of 
measures the Bloc Quebecois supports, but there are some which 
need more work by members who should do some original thinking 
on the subject and perhaps go back to committee to look at some 
solutions to the sponsorship question. It is not true that there is a 
straightforward solution such as the one contained in the bill.
<P>
	For instance, the jazz festival, with a total budget of $9.5 
million, receives $1.5 million in sponsorship fees, which is 15 per 
cent of its budget. Today, 15 per cent often means the difference 
between cancelling an event or not, or guaranteeing that it offers 
quality programming and can attract a satisfactory audience. In the 
case of the fireworks, sponsorship fees represent $1 million out of a 
budget of $1.4 million. Clearly, without that sponsorship the event 
could be in serious trouble. The Festival Just for Laughs has $1 
million in sponsorship fees out of a budget of $10 million. The 
Festival d'été de Québec gets $500,000 out of a budget of $4.5 
million.
<P>
	In each case, banning sponsorship or imposing conditions that 
will scare away sponsors will have the same result. So we are 
certainly not saying that we are against the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians and that we do not care about our children's health. Of 
course we want everyone to be healthy, and we realize that it is 
important for our quality of life. It is also important in economic 
terms, because prevention saves a lot of money in the long run.
<P>
	Today, however, at the report stage we must consider 
amendments or proposals that would make this bill a piece of 
viable legislation, something sound that would pass the test of time 
but not at the expense of the people  who have the jobs that would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8577"> 8577 </A></B>
<P>
disappear as a result of this decision. There are other aspects in the 
bill that deserve far more attention than they are getting right now, 
and there certainly should be no time limitation in this respect, and 
I am referring, for instance, to the matter of regulatory powers.
<P>
	We should learn from the legislation passed during the past 15, 
20 or 30 years, where the government basically tried to make up 
our minds for us, to regulate everything so people would no longer 
have to make up their own minds. I think people have realized there 
is no future in this approach, that there are no answers. We need an 
approach that emphasizes educating the public so that people can 
consider the various options and are free to do what they think is 
best.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Sometimes, reversing the onus of proof is not necessarily a wise 
decision. Some more fine tuning is necessary in that respect.
<P>
	Why is the government putting a gag on this debate? It is now 
early March. There will be three weeks of debate between now and 
Easter, so we would have enough time to do a thorough job and end 
up with a bill everyone can be proud of. Let us not forget that, 
during debate at second reading, there was a fairly extensive 
agreement in principle, but there are problems that have yet to be 
resolved, that are still on the table. I would not like anyone to say 
that we are voting against the bill because we oppose the fact that 
the government wants to improve the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians. That is not the issue at all.
<P>
	The issue is how to go about creating a law that improves the 
health of Canadians or is likely to, without doing so to the 
detriment of events that create jobs and provide people with 
reasonable situations? We cannot take away with one hand what we 
are giving with the other. There has to be a balance, and the bill is 
not satisfactory in this regard.
<P>
	How can we go about finding other solutions in the area of 
sponsorship? Are there other forms of sponsorship we could 
consider, which would be attractive and sure of a market for the 
future? Could a support fund be set up and used? Could there be an 
extension so that businesses had the time to adapt and make 
adjustments? Could the $20 million used over the past year in the 
flag campaign not be set aside for this purpose? If this money were 
put in a fund to lessen the impact on sponsors so events could be 
held, would this not be a solution?
<P>
	We may not have all the solutions right now, but one of them is 
not rushing this bill through, without examining things carefully 
and seeing how to go about protecting sporting and cultural events, 
especially those in Quebec. You may know that out of the $60 
million  invested in sponsoring this kind of event in Canada $30 
million go to Quebec.
<P>
	Is it chance, is it an unfortunate result, or is it a lack of sensitivity 
to Quebec's concerns, a lack of caring on the part of the present 
government? In any case, the result is that these cultural and sports 
events with economic spinoffs mostly in Quebec will be affected 
by this bill, which in turn will have a very negative impact on jobs.
<P>
	Montreal is a city rich in cultural events and tourist attractions 
throughout the summer. They are held one after the other, creating 
non-stop economic spinoffs. The measures provided by this bill 
will result in adjustments of such magnitude that some events 
might have to be cancelled. We are not trying to stir up trouble 
when we say that we must give it more thought. We must review 
the situation and try to find solutions.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has asked the Minister of Health and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage to offer financial measures in 
compensation and to act as politicians responsible for their actions, 
but we have had no response from the health minister, who has 
been stonewalling all the demands from the Bloc and other 
witnesses with similar requests.
<P>
	What is the reason for such pigheadedness? Why is it so urgent 
to find a short term solution to this problem? This we cannot 
ascertain for the moment, but to conclude I will invite the 
government to think about the political impact of the steps it is 
taking now. Today it saw in the streets of Montreal and elsewhere 
the ire directed at its bill. I believe this is an argument it will listen 
to even if it does not want to listen to other more economic ones.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I urge the government to think twice about 
this, to change its position and offer solutions that will allow sports 
and cultural events to survive and have an adequate economic 
impact in the years to come.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House to speak to Bill C-71, the Tobacco Act. 
This gives me the opportunity to explain to constituents in the 
riding of Châteauguay where my party and I stand on this bill.
<P>
	Concerning the principle of this bill, as we have said many 
times, we voted for it at second reading. Indeed, I feel it is 
important to inform and educate people and eliminate the 
subliminal propaganda aimed at children. We know that tobacco 
use has an impact on the health of Quebecers and Canadians. That 
is why the Bloc Quebecois gave its approval in principle at second 
reading, as long as changes were made to the way the products 
could be displayed in the stores, that the regulations were tabled 
immediately and that more leeway was given for sponsorships, but 
this is not the case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8578"> 8578 </A></B>
<P>
	We intend to vote against this bill at third reading. While we 
support the principle of regulating the use of tobacco, we do not 
agree with the measures associated with signs, particularly with 
regard to sponsor identification. We also have a problem with the 
future regulations, because they give the minister too much leeway 
in the implementation of this bill and the way the products are 
to be displayed in the stores does not meet our demands.
<P>
	As I was saying, the negative impact of tobacco use on the health 
of Quebecers and Canadians has been proven and demonstrated. 
This Liberal government is mistaken if it thinks that banning 
sponsorships is the solution. Moreover, we know that many Liberal 
members, and also senators, have their doubts about the bill this 
government is getting ready to pass. However, they do not have 
enough backbone to defend Quebec.
<P>
	The government must be really out of touch to think that 
smokers will give up their habits if Benson &amp; Hedges stops funding 
the fireworks. How can it imagine that non-smokers will start 
smoking simply because events such as the Grand Prix in Montreal 
are sponsored by tobacco companies? We do not need advanced 
courses in marketing to understand that sponsorships are an extra 
advertising tool for the brand, and not for the decision to start 
smoking.
<P>
	Would it be dreaming in technicolour to think, as the labour 
minister told Liberals gathered in Quebec City last weekend, that 
other sponsors could take over from the tobacco companies? That 
will not happen and, contrary to what the minister said, it is not 
blackmail on the part of tobacco companies. We, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, believe that several international events are threatened.
<P>
	I would like to give us more food for thought in debating this 
bill. Little has been said about the therapeutic aspect of the various 
cultural and sports events sponsored by tobacco companies. Has 
consideration been given to how beneficial these events bringing 
the people of Quebec together can be? These are excellent 
opportunities for communities from various backgrounds to meet 
at one given place to share each in their own way experiences that 
are often quite meaningful.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Often, families and other groups that make up Quebec's society 
get together for such events. There is no doubt that all these events 
provide a break from routine, rest and entertainment. It would be 
most unfortunate that such festive reunions would be killed in the 
name of ensuring the well-being of Quebec's society. The Minister 
of Health should be sensitive to this reality, because it affects the 
mental health of an entire community.
<P>
	Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that we will be able to 
undo the harm done after losing the only Formula I Grand Prix race 
in North America. Bear in  mind that, in stubbornly rushing this bill 
through, the Liberals are forgetting their promise for jobs, jobs, 
jobs. I agree with my hon. colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, who suggested that the Minister of 
Health was out of touch with the reality and economy in Quebec 
and that the Prime Minister should get involved.
<P>
	Is there anyone in this government who takes Quebec's interests 
to heart? I hope to see Liberal members from Quebec rise for the 
first time to oppose this bill that will seriously affect Quebec's 
economy.
<P>
	Do not tell us that this bill has the support of the people of 
Quebec. It is not true. For example, a SOM-<I>Le Soleil</I> poll 
conducted last December showed that close to three quarters of the 
adult population in the Quebec City region were opposed to the 
provisions contained in this bill. Moreover, at noon today, 
merchants from downtown Montreal held a protest against this bill, 
which will adversely affect the restaurant, tourism and business 
industries. The Montreal Chamber of Commerce stated its 
opposition to the Liberal government's bill by calling it a 
fundamentalist measure.
<P>
	We must say it loud and clear to Quebecers: this bill goes beyond 
the laudable goal of fighting tobacco consumption. It will directly 
affect Montreal's sports and cultural events. It will make them 
disappear, thus eliminating a whole industry in the city's economy.
<P>
	This is a sad record for a government that is about to call a 
general election. Chances are the upcoming polls will be very 
revealing for the Bloc, which really looks after the interests of 
Quebecers. The bill also reflects a favourite tactic of this Liberal 
government. I am referring to the postponement, until after the 
general election, of certain irritants such as the implementation of 
clauses 24(2) and 24(3) on sponsorship. This is a tactic frequently 
used by the Minister of Finance, and it most certainly inspired his 
colleague, the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Even though some measures are being postponed, international 
events such as the Montreal Grand Prix will be in jeopardy as early 
as this year, because of certain clauses of the bill dealing with 
issues such as broadcasting and communication media.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I will oppose the bill at third reading, and I 
urge all members to do likewise. We will vote against this bill at 
third reading.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate that this bill is not perfect. 
Reformers strongly object to time allocation. There is no way that 
anti-democratic action should take place in this House.
<P>
	I have a couple of other objections for the record. The 
regulations that will follow this bill will not be subject to 
parliamentary scrutiny. I object to that. I also object to the fact that 
there was a way to make cigarettes a drug delivery system and to 
have nicotine restricted in that vein.
<P>
	My third objection is reflected by my amendments. The law 
states that it is illegal to sell tobacco to youths, and so it should be. 
The fines are substantial. However, the onus is all on the 
shopkeepers. They must check for identification. They take all the 
flack. They must police our kids for us. Who actually intends to 
break the law? The shopkeepers in this situation are innocent.
<P>
	The youth who comes into the store and who looks 17 does not 
get very much time from the shopkeeper, but the youth who comes 
in and who looks 22 but is actually 17 puts the shopkeeper in 
jeopardy. I believe, as do most shopkeepers, that there should be 
some onus placed on the youths who break the law. They are the 
individuals who come to the shops to break the law.
<P>
	It is done with alcohol. The underage youth comes in to buy a 
beer. Do we charge the vendor? Of course not. We charge the youth 
for doing something illegal. The youth gets charged with illegal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8580"> 8580 </A></B>
<P>
possession, and we  certainly do not go after the individual who 
sold the beer to the youth.
<P>
	This amendment recognizes that a youth under 18 purchasing 
tobacco is the culprit in the equation and suggests a small fine for 
the youth breaking the law. Obtaining and attempting to obtain 
should be discouraged by a penalty. Those are the amendments I 
put before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to 
address this motion. Maybe I can address a few issues that have 
been raised so far in the debate. I draw members' attention to the 
motions before the House which I will comment on briefly.
<P>
	Motion No. 2, moved by the member for Macleod, suggests that 
it become a criminal offence for young persons to possess or 
attempt to possess a tobacco product in a public place. Creating 
such an offence of possession would be contrary to the 
government's policy approach. As the member indicated, the onus 
is on the vendor.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	We are trying to focus control into the commercial activities of 
retailers so the onus would rest and vest with the retailer. I suggest 
that making it illegal for young people to possess tobacco products 
would subject hundreds of thousands of young people to potential 
criminal prosecution. That may be the intended objective of some 
members, but at this stage we want to focus on the commercial 
relationship that is initiated by the retailer offering this product for 
sale.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 has been proposed by the Minister of Health to 
clarify an amendment put forward in committee. Clause 12 was 
originally amended in committee to allow the use of vending 
machines with locking devices to be continued. The amendment 
now before us clarifies that vending machines with locking devices 
will be permitted only in a bar, tavern or a beverage room. 
Cigarette vending machines have been restricted to these locations 
since the coming into force of the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons 
Act in 1994 and we want to continue that practice.
<P>
	The reference to a prescribed security mechanism is preferred to 
the phrase that is currently proposed ``that is activated before each 
transaction'' as expressed in the amendment adopted by the 
Standing Committee on Health. In this way the government can 
determine through consultation the most appropriate types of 
security mechanisms with a view to advancing the objective of 
limiting youth access.
<P>
	Motion No. 5, moved by the member for Lévis, would also 
amend clause 12. The member suggests that vending machines be 
allowed to remain in places where youth do not have access, which 
is one of the venues where prescribed tobacco advertising and 
sponsorship  promotions will be permitted. This amendment should 
be rejected on the grounds that on occasion youth do gain access to 
places where they are not permitted to be by law. Obviously the 
availability of tobacco products through unsupervised transactions 
poses a more immediate peril than does the appearance of tobacco 
promotions.
<P>
	Finally, Motion No. 30 is proposed by the member for Macleod. 
It would set a maximum fine for young people who are acting as 
retailers and selling cigarettes illegally to other youth. The 
member's concern that young persons not be subjected to harsh 
penalties is addressed by Bill C-71. The bill sets maximums rather 
than minimum fines. Furthermore, a young offender between the 
ages of 12 and 18 years of age would be dealt with according to the 
Young Offenders Act, which provides for the use of alternative 
measures such as community service.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in my remaining time I would like to address some 
of the comments made by members opposite on Friday, February 
21, during the first part of report stage debate on the bill. On that 
date the member for Lévis stated that the Bloc shares the objectives 
of the Minister of Health on the issue. However, both he and his 
colleagues made statements which point to an opposite position. 
By the way, it is a position which was raised again earlier this 
morning in debate.
<P>
	I believe I am quoting the member for Lévis correctly when he 
said ``that the government shows no compassion, no willingness 
whatsoever to deal with the issue of sponsorships''. The 
government has proposed an implementation period, so clearly this 
is incorrect. He said that without the regulations nothing in Bill 
C-71 can be implemented. This too is clearly wrong and, in fact, 
false.
<P>
	The House will be surprised to learn that the member for 
Drummond is the health critic. She talked about the economic 
benefits of cultural and sports organizations. She is correct, there 
are benefits. She forgets that the government has not banned 
tobacco sponsorship. She overlooks that the government has 
proposed an implementation period. But more seriously, she and 
others on her side of the House have ignored the fact that there are 
12,000 tobacco related deaths in Quebec each year.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	They ignore that there are 38 per cent of Quebecers who are 
smokers. That average is higher than anywhere else in the country.
<P>
	Members on this side of the House would like to hear those 
members' justifications for ignoring that there are 76,000 Quebec 
youth who take up smoking each and every year. They urge us to do 
nothing about that statistic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8581"> 8581 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a cost. Members will appreciate this in its appropriate 
context. There is a cost of some $530 million to the Quebec health 
care system each year because of tobacco related illnesses. How 
do members opposite from the Bloc justify their opposition to Bill 
C-71 in the face of these facts?
<P>
	On Friday, February 21 the member for Trois-Rivières tried to 
convince himself that sponsorship promotion does not affect 
attitudes toward smoking. Obviously he did not consult with the 
minister for health in Quebec because he has an entirely different 
view.
<P>
	He and his colleagues ignore an extensive and growing body of 
international evidence confirming that young people are aware of 
and susceptible to promotional practices. It also confirms that it is 
not possible to promote the brand of cigarette without 
simultaneously promoting tobacco products and their use.
<P>
	Members will know that 85 per cent of smokers and 83 per cent 
of non-smokers in the 10 to 19-year old age group see sponsorship 
promotion as a way of advertising cigarettes. This is the age group 
in Quebec starting to smoke at a higher rate than in any other 
province in the country. Furthermore, sponsorship promotion has 
been the predominant form of tobacco products promotion in 
Canada since the advertising ban in 1988.
<P>
	On February 21 the member from Timiskaming criticized the 
provisions of Bill C-71 which limit the access of youth to 
cigarettes. The Bloc must now answer regarding whether or not it is 
advocating the sale of tobacco products to youth. Let us address 
that issue.
<P>
	The member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies stood in this 
House on February 21 and said that everybody recognizes that 
smoking is not healthy. Great. He said that we must do all that we 
can to prevent our young people from starting to smoke, but not 
this.
<P>
	The member for Berthier-Montcalm said that Quebecers will 
suffer most from this bill. Quebecers are already suffering the 
most. If they accept the figures that I have given, in terms of the 
health component, they should answer their own rhetorical 
question.
<P>
	Quebecers smoke more and are dying faster than people in any 
other region of the country as a result of tobacco induced illnesses. 
Right now in Quebec there are up to a million citizens who will 
eventually die of tobacco related causes. The members opposite 
want to defend a continuation of the status quo. That same member 
said that cigarettes are good because they put $3.5 billion into the 
government's treasury but he did not appreciate that they take out 
some $15 billion in direct and indirect costs.
<P>
	The member for Argenteuil-Papineau said that the government 
did not take into account the testimony heard before the health 
committee. How false a misrepresentation that would be.
<P>
	The committee recommended that the Minister of Health 
consider an implementation period for the sponsorship promotion 
restriction. That is before this House today.
<P>
	The same member reminded the House on February 21 that the 
Bloc voted for the bill on second reading because it recognized the 
validity of the government's objectives.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	If it did, are the principles of Bill C-71 today less valid than they 
were in December of last year? Are there fewer Canadians being 
affected by tobacco than there were last-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret the hon. member's time has 
expired. The hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have to 
acknowledge that the parliamentary secretary is quite brave. He at 
least has the decency to show up in this House. On the Liberal side, 
he is among the very few who stand up for this bill, or at least try to 
do so. He is having quite a hard time, because even though we 
support the objectives aimed at in the 80 per cent of the bill that is 
justifiable, including the fight against smoking among young 
people, there are some provisions that are unacceptable and not 
applicable.
<P>
	I realize that it is still useful to speak up in this House. The 
parliamentary secretary did not like certain things the official 
opposition, Bloc members, said and he is giving us a piece of his 
mind, and I appreciate this debate we are having. However, I would 
like for more of his colleagues to show the same courage.
<P>
	We are dealing with Group No. 2. What is the purpose of these 
motions? Let me focus more specifically on the amendment we put 
forward. It is Motion No. 5 concerning clause 12. What does clause 
12 say? It deals with vending machines that have a security 
mechanism.
<P>
	In the clause by clause consideration of this bill, we managed to 
convince the parliamentary secretary to approve an amendment and 
to recognize the fact that, in some public places, a security 
mechanism with a remote control could be used. It was accepted by 
the Department of Health, but everything has changed all of a 
sudden. A wind of change has been blowing on the Department of 
Health since the arrival of the new minister. They want to regulate 
everything and they no longer accept what used to be accepted.
<P>
	In this case as in many others, Quebecers showed some 
ingenuity, as they often do. They thought of using the same kind of 
remote control mechanism that is used for a television set. Those 
who use these remote control mechanisms are called zappers. The 
same principle was applied to vending machines. An employee 
could block access to a vending machine and, using this remote  
control, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8582"> 8582 </A></B>
<P>
could allow the client to buy cigarettes himself by inserting the 
right amount of money in the machine.
<P>
	What was the purpose of the bill initially? It was designed to 
have these vending machines kept in a place to which the public 
does not have access. Maybe this would not have been a problem in 
a large restaurant or in a large bar, but imagine what the situation 
would be in a small country bar with only one employee. 
According to this bill, if a client asked for cigarettes, the waiter 
would have had to leave the restaurant or the bar unattended to get 
cigarettes from a place to which the public does not have access. 
That is what the bill was designed to do initially.
<P>
	By putting forward arguments and explaining our point of view, 
we finally succeeded in making the parliamentary secretary 
understand that an amendment was necessary. Of course, it seems 
very difficult for the Liberal Party to accept an amendment 
proposed by the opposition. They do not think the opposition can 
be right sometimes. And on the rare occasions where they have to 
agree with us, they cannot admit that we are completely right. That 
is why we are raising this issue again in the House at report stage, 
in front of the television cameras, to say that we may have won on 
the principle of security by remote control, but let us look, for 
example, at the situation in a bar where liquor is sold, but it cannot 
be sold to people under 18 years of age.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to make access to tobacco products 
more difficult for young people under 18 years of age. Since only 
people 18 years of age and older are allowed into establishments 
restricted to adults, why would there be any need to activate the 
safety mechanism on a vending machine?
<P>
	In a restaurant, this would be understandable, because young 
people may go there, accompanied by their parents. But if they 
have some money tucked away and their parents momentarily lose 
sight of them, they could buy cigarettes. So, it is understandable in 
a restaurant, but in a bar where it is prohibited anyway by law, by 
regulations, by fines or whatever, for a young person under the age 
of 18 to enter and consume alcoholic drinks, there is therefore less 
of a need, in our view, for this provision to be included because, 
ultimately, it departs from the purpose.
<P>
	We have tried to make the government, the parliamentary 
secretary, understand this, without success.
<P>
	When the parliamentary secretary broadened the discussion to 
include other provisions, reacting to comments from Bloc 
Quebecois members in particular, it is annoying, because we 
realize we were right. Members will recall that the government 
wanted to rush this bill through before the holidays. It put off 
consideration of the bill for months and then, just before 
Christmas, a  couple of weeks before Christmas, it wanted to ram 
the bill through.
<P>
	The Reform members went along with it. They even gave the bill 
their approval before it was printed, before they had read it.
<P>
Imagine. After a member from each party had spoken, the member 
who had introduced the amendment rose to speak for 30 seconds, 
after asking that the House pass the bill quickly, before the 
holidays, with no study or debate.
<P>
	We in the official opposition suggested that some witnesses be 
heard by the committee, with the result that the bill was not passed 
before the holidays. What happened? There was a debate and 
public pressure made itself felt, with the result that the minister felt 
obliged to table certain amendments that are an improvement, that 
spread out the effect, but that shifted the problem. We are used to 
seeing this government dump things onto the provinces, but now it 
is dumping-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, you are entitled to two more 
minutes for your speech, if you wish to use them after oral question 
period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., we will proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
small and medium size businesses are creating the majority of new 
full time jobs in Canada. The Liberal government acknowledges 
that this is true.
<P>
	Small and medium sized businesses in a recent survey say the 
conditions necessary for them to hire more people are increased 
consumer demand and lower taxes.  Lower payroll taxes were cited 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8583"> 8583 </A></B>
<P>
by over 40 per cent as a necessary condition for them to hire more 
workers.
<P>
	Why then did the finance minister not listen to these views with 
respect to payroll taxes? He not only failed to reduce payroll taxes. 
He increased them. A whopping 73 per cent increase in CPP 
premiums will overwhelm the minuscule reduction in EI 
premiums. In 1998, for example, CPP premium increases will take 
three times as much out of the pockets of small business and 
workers as EI cuts will leave there.
<P>
	This was a bad budget decision by the Liberals, bad news for job 
creators and bad news for the unemployed.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the more one looks at the Liberal government's tobacco 
bill, the more one realizes the perverse effects of a piece of 
legislation which will obviously not attain the intended objective, 
unless that objective is to damage the Quebec economy.
<P>
	On top of the millions of dollars Montreal will lose as a result of 
this hypocritical legislation, there is the domino effect of the 
Canadian health ayatollah's policy, which will impact upon all 
regions of Quebec, including Berthier-Montcalm, unfortunately.
<P>
	During the Montreal Grand Prix weekend, tourists from Japan, 
Europe and the southern United States come to visit the Gilles 
Villeneuve museum in Berthierville. The museum, and the local 
economy, will lose those thousands of tourists from other 
countries, for if there is no Grand Prix sponsorship, there will be no 
Grand Prix, no high-profile drivers, no foreign visitors.
<P>
	Who could possibly believe that there could be any beneficial 
effects for Montreal and other areas of Quebec when they lose 
thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in economic 
benefits?

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the United 
States has served notice that it will invoke section 20, the national 
security clause of the World Trade Organization, to keep the 
regulatory body from adjudicating a European Union challenge to 
the controversial Helms-Burton law.
<P>
	The Americans argue they fear a Cuban invasion and that their 
national security is threatened. Therefore they will boycott a World 
Trade Organization dispute  settlement panel struck to examine the 
trade legitimacy of the Helms-Burton legislation.
<P>
	If the Americans can use section 20, why does Canada not 
invoke section 20 to maintain a secure supply of food as a national 
security issue? Why not invoke section 20 to keep an American 
attack on our cultural industries at bay, or to ward off an attack on 
our generic pharmaceuticals, or perhaps most important to protect 
the eventual invasion by the United States to direct our water from 
our rivers and lakes into the United States mid and southwest?

	If Americans can use section 20 of the World Trade Organization 
to protect the most powerful military nation on earth from a Cuban 
invasion, surely we can use the same argument to protect our 
cultural industries, our food supply, our Canadian-

<P>
	This event has a major economic impact on our region, not to 
mention the redistribution of profit among local organizations in 
order to improve the quality of life there.
<P>
	Alas, the Liberal government is going at it hammer and tongs, 
threatening the survival of events of this type with its Bill C-71. 
This bill, in doing away with tobacco company sponsorships, will 
deprive the international regatta circuit of a major financial partner. 
And what lies behind such a decision? A desire to encourage young  
people to smoke less, or a desire to get at Quebec's sporting and 
cultural events, the focus of 50 per cent of the tobacco companies' 
sponsorships?
<P>
	This is, in fact, just window-dressing, a measure by a 
government which wants to give the impression that it is concerned 
about the health of Canadians, and to make people forget the 
billions of dollars in cuts to health care funding.

Bloc Quebecois will continue its battle against this bill and will 
keep on demanding that the Liberals explain themselves to all parts

of particular interest for women.
<P>
	In our red book, we made a commitment to women's health, and 
I quote: ``A Liberal government will add a Centre of Excellence for 
Women's Health, aimed at effective and equal treatment of 
women's health issues in the Canadian health care system''.
<P>
	On June 25, our government announced the establishment of five 
centres of excellence for women's health. These centres are being 
set up to remedy the grave failures of our research efforts with 
regard to women's health and of a health care system which does 
not pay enough attention to the particular needs of women across 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
hundreds of citizens in Trois-Rivières have shown their opposition 
to the bill aimed at regulating tobacco sponsorship, and attempted 
once again to bring  to its senses this Liberal government which is 
jeopardizing the very existence of the Trois-Rivières Grand Prix.
<P>
	SIDAC members, stores and businesses, suspended their 
activities for 15 minutes in a show of solidarity because the 
Saint-Maurice area cannot allow this government to cause the loss 
of $10 million in economic spinoffs, of hundreds of jobs, and the 
loss of international exposure due to the broadcasting of the 
Trois-Rivières Grand Prix in 141 countries.
<P>
	Under the guise of public health, a concept it abuses, this 
government is making a mockery of the freedom of expression and 
showing its intolerance and shortsightedness by leading people to 
believe that the disappearance of tobacco sponsorship will be 
synonymous with an improvement in public health.
<P>
	This is the reason why people in greater Trois-Rivières are once 
again condemning the stubbornness of the Prime Minister, 
although he is from our area, and the fundamentalism of the Liberal 
government.

sodomizing a single mother. None of these criminals are serving 
time in jail, courtesy of the Liberal government's Bill C-41 which 
has resulted in case after case of criminals walking free.

	Now the Liberal's sentencing law is on trial in three provinces. 
In Alberta nine cases involving conditional sentences have been

General of Ontario has asked for leave to appeal to the Supreme 
Court of Canada, all on matters dealing with conditional sentences.

tobacco industry would have everyone believe that the entire 
artistic community opposes the bill, they are there to prove it 
wrong. Second, they want to draw attention to the utilitarian side 
of tobacco sponsorships. Their records show they have much more 
far-reaching implications. Sponsorships actually sell cigarettes.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today in Montreal thousands of people are demonstrating 
their disagreement with the federal government, which is getting 
ready to wipe out major sports and cultural events with the 
anti-advertising provisions contained in the bill.
<P>
	Although everyone shares the same anti-smoking objectives, it 
must realize that many people, restaurant owners, hotel operators, 
taxi drivers, are convinced they  will lose a large part of their 
earnings if Quebec's cultural and sports events are attacked.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that in Montreal alone, I hope the 
ministers from Quebec across the way are listening closely, $240 
million in spinoffs will disappear because the government is 
refusing to listen to reason concerning tobacco company 
sponsorships?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member opposite for his question. The fact of the 
matter remains that over the last number of months we have been 
very reasonable and very comprehensive in the legislation we are 
putting forward.
<P>
	As I am sure the hon. member knows and knows only too well, 
there is no banning of sponsorships. There is no banning of 
sponsorship promotion. In point of fact it was his party and this 
leader who stood in their places and supported the principles on 
second reading which included the restrictions on sponsorships.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to remind the minister, as I did yesterday, 
that our political party shares the objective of reducing smoking. 
What we do not agree with is their desire to kill events in Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> I would like to tell the health minister, through 
you, Mr. Speaker, that Quebecers will never accept a decision that 
interferes with the entire range of sports and cultural development, 
particularly that of Montreal and of Quebec. We will not accept it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Did the health minister not hold discussions with 
his colleagues from Quebec? Did nobody in this government point 
out to him that, if over 50 per cent of sponsorships go to Quebec, 
the repercussions of his plan on Quebec will be extremely negative 
in the short term?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members of all political parties in the House have to listen quite 
carefully to what the Leader of the Official Opposition says on the 
subject matter.
<P>
	So that we have all the facts I will share with my hon. colleague 
opposite that 36 of the medical associations in la belle province de 
Québec are in support of the legislation; 24 public health networks 
in the province of Quebec support the legislation; 140 hospitals in 
the province of Quebec support the legislation; and 27 anti-tobacco 
groups in the province of Quebec support the legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8587"> 8587 </A></B>
<P>
	When the hon. member stands in his place let him remember 
that in the province of Quebec in excess of 200 municipal units 
support the provisions of Bill C-71.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> At this point I judge the questions to be in order 
today because they never made mention of the bill which we are 
debating in the House. I would ask also that in the responses from 
the government no mention of the bill be brought up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister can talk all he wants about support but the 
fact remains that, if he were more aware of what was going in 
Quebec, he would know that on all the radio stations today, 
everywhere, Quebecers are protesting against certain provisions of 
his bill. They would like to get him to listen to reason.
<P>
	I heard the Minister of Labour say on television: ``We will see. 
Perhaps it will be the end of the world; we will wait and see''. Is the 
government going to run the risk of waiting and seeing Quebec's 
sports and cultural events destroyed before reacting? Are we once 
again going to be the victim of a bad decision made by Ottawa 
much too far away from where we live?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank my colleagues opposite for that round of applause. I 
think the tone has been hit by the Leader of the Opposition when he 
talks about reasonableness.
<P>
	The fact is the chairman of the Standing Committee on Health 
heard all the various groups make representation. It was a result of 
their recommendation, which his party was a part of, that this 
government had heeded the suggestion of the hon. member, giving 
him an implementation period.
<P>
	I want the hon. opposite to reflect on this: ``My name is Eric 
Carsley. My wife, my companion, my best friend for 23 years, died 
two years ago at the age of 45 from lung cancer that was caused by 
her smoking''. That man is from the province of Quebec. This 
government stands solidly behind children and people across the 
country to fight tobacco consumption in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a letter addressed to Hon. Senator Colin Kenny, Senator 
Céline Hervieux-Payette, who is not a Bloc Quebecois member-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, she is Liberal.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>Not yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> -who is Liberal, writes the following: ``If 
Quebec's sports and cultural activities are to be the guinea pigs of a 
policy that will not produce its intended effects, I want no part of 
it''. This comment is from Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette, the 
vice-president of the Liberal election campaign. She definitely did 
not make it for political expediency.
<P>
	If the minister will not listen to the official opposition, will he at 
least listen to a Liberal senator, to the vice-president of the election 
campaign of a party seeking to win seats outside Quebec, but which 
seems to have let Quebec and its members down, since 68 per cent 
of Quebecers are against the Liberals?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it was precisely for the reasons which were given at the Standing 
Committee on Health, where all members of different political 
parties were represented and recommendations came forward in 
order to provide some reasonableness for an implementation period 
for arts and cultural groups, that we have followed up on that 
suggestion.
<P>
	Furthermore, I think it has to be understood that notwithstanding 
the date, October 1998, thereafter there is no banning of 
sponsorships. There is no banning of sponsorship promotion. In 
point of fact, our bill, as the leader of the opposition has indicated, 
is indeed very reasonable.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the party in office rejected all the amendments we 
proposed. It did not want to hear promoters of cultural and sports 
events-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> None.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> -and had it not been for the Bloc Quebecois, 
these people would not have been heard. Ask them-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I am listening very carefully to 
the questions as they are posed. It is true that today we are debating 
a certain bill. It is also true that before the question is posed, and I 
do not know what the question is, if members take me too far down 
the road in the preamble it would be my intention to intervene.
<P>
	However, with respect to all members who are raising their 
voices in question period, I have judged to this point for these 
questions which are posed to be of a general enough nature that 
they are acceptable. I am going to permit these questions, 
providing they do not refer specifically to the bill under discussion 
today.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>Absolutely, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Again, I am quoting the Hon. Senator, who said: ``Give me your 
support to keep Montreal, which is already plagued by 
unemployment, from being the big loser regarding this policy''.
<P>
	Did the minister hear the people from Trois-Rivières today, 
those from Montreal, the cab drivers, the restaurant and hotel 
owners, the promoters of major cultural and sports events, who said 
it does not make sense to destroy Montreal's cultural and sports 
life, to eliminate its cultural and sports events, adding that the 
government should educate young people about the dangers of 
tobacco use, instead of going after Montreal's economy and the 
city's cultural and sports events? Will the minister listen to these 
people once and for all?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it was precisely for those reasons that many individuals came 
before the standing committee. That was the rationale we had for 
the purposes of the implementation period, so that people have the 
opportunity to adjust to the new regime.
<P>
	It is quite false for individuals to suggest or to imply that this 
legislation in any way bans sponsorship or sponsorship 
promotions. What is being done is that restrictions are being placed 
on four essential items: the price, the place, the product and the 
promotion.
<P>
	I am appalled that a candidate for the leadership of a party would 
stand in his place and dismiss $3.5 billion in costs to our health 
care system and 40,000 lives each and every year. Shame on the 
Bloc Quebecois.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 32 
years ago today John Kroeker was fired from the federal civil 
service for daring to criticize the Pearson government's newly 
created Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Mr. Kroeker rightly predicted that the CPP was unsustainable 
and for that he lost his job. For that he was blackballed by the 
federal government and labelled a kook. Mr. Kroeker said that the 
CPP would be broke by the year 2000 without constant and large 
infusions of cash from Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister, who was part of that Pearson 
government decades ago, admit that Mr. Kroeker was right in 1965 
and that his own Liberal government was wrong?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is wrong is that 
the Reform Party is wrong about the CPP. We have changed the 
rules of the CPP.
<P>
	I have to remind the Reform Party that the CPP is a 
federal-provincial policy.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	It is not just a federal program. To change the CPP requires 
two-thirds majority of the provinces with two-thirds of the 
population. We have gone out as a government and got that 
two-thirds majority. We have the support of the majority of the 
provinces.
<P>
	In the Reform Party's proposal for reform, does it have the 
support of any of the provinces? It has the support of none of the 
provinces, let alone a two-thirds majority. It does not have the 
support of any.
<P>
	We have, also, the support of the Canadian people. The Canadian 
people want a secure, publicly funded pension program and we 
have the support of the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that this junior minister talks about having the support 
of all the provinces on it.
<P>
	In 1965 Mr. Kroeker stated that the Pearson government simply 
lured the provinces into the CPP by offering them loans from the 
fund at amazingly low bargain basement interest rates. No wonder 
they are keen on the project.
<P>
	Thirty years later in the 1990s this government is doing exactly 
the same thing with the provincial governments. Using the CPP as 
a cash cow for governments was a lousy idea in 1965 and it is a 
lousy idea now, 30 years later.
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister and those in charge of dealing with 
the provinces right now on this deal lure the provinces into a 
sweetheart deal at the expense of the Canadian taxpayers who will 
have to belly up and pay that cash?
<P>
	The Liberals learned nothing since 1965. Which way will it be, 
sweetheart deals for the provinces or the best deal for Canadian 
taxpayers in their retirement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have in the 
CPP now is the best deal for the Canadian people.
<P>
	Compared with the Reform Party's absolutely ridiculous 
proposal with rates of return that are absolutely beyond belief, our 
proposal is a reasonable proposal. It is a proposal backed by the 
Canadian people and it is backed by the provinces. It is not a 
proposal that any of the provinces do not want. It is a proposal that 
the Canadian people want.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadian young people want to know that there will be a  
sustainable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8589"> 8589 </A></B>
<P>
plan for them. They would like to earn three times as much through 
privately funding their own RRSP rather than any CPP plan.
<P>
	Thirty-two years ago these Liberal politicians called John 
Kroeker crazy for predicting that CPP was unsustainable without 
constant payroll tax increases.
<P>
	In the next 6 years from now alone, premiums will have gone up 
over 70 per cent and Canadians will be paying a full 10 per cent of 
their paycheques toward a pension plan that still is not sustainable.
<P>
	The minister thinks people in the galleries here and across the 
country are really pleased about this plan of mismanagement of 
their own money.
<P>
	Is it not true that the government is hiding the fact that premiums 
will have to go up again before the Canadian public gets any 
benefit which these people have promised?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member said 
that younger Canadians want to know there is a secure pension 
plan. This Canada pension plan is that secure pension plan.
<P>
	What would the Reform Party offer instead? The Reform Party's 
finance critic said about their own proposals on pension: ``I'm kind 
of reluctant to get into the numbers''. Why would he be reluctant to 
get into the numbers? It is because their numbers do not add up.
<P>
	Why do they not add up? What would their contribution rate be? 
Would it be 10 per cent? Would it be 15 per cent? They do not say. 
How would they honour the commitment to today's seniors, $18 
billion a year and growing? Would they honour those 
commitments?
<P>
	If they are going to honour those commitments, where would 
they find the money? Would they simply renege on those 
commitments? What do they plan for Canadians who have 
contributed?

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	To explain why his government is going to such lengths to 
unreasonably restrict the sponsorship activities of the tobacco 
industry, the Prime Minister keeps referring to the health issue. 
There are other more efficient ways to protect the health of the 
public. What the Bloc Quebecois is against is a ban on 
sponsorships, because it will be irretrievably detrimental to various 
sports and cultural events.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that the official opposition has 
supported 80 per cent of the bill, that the Bloc has  even moved 
more proactive measures to fight smoking among young people 
and that if the Prime Minister were to agree to sit down with the 
opposition and event organizers, a solution could be found? Is he 
aware of that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is precisely for the reasons that the hon. member has referred to 
that we on this side of the House have accepted the very reasoned 
amendment which has been put forward by the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Health, that we have a period of time for 
the purposes of implementation keeping in mind, as I said 
previously, that in no way are we at the present time banning 
sponsorship or banning sponsorship promotion. After the 
implementation period is over there will still be the opportunity to 
promote one's product. So we are just restricting the promotion as 
well as the sponsorship.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister acknowledge that by trying so hard to save his head before 
the next election, he is not helping to improve the health of our 
fellow citizens, but is contributing to the demise of the tourist 
industry in Montreal, which will only make the people in Montreal 
and throughout the province of Quebec even poorer?

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> I have great 
respect for the honourable member opposite and I want to share 
with you, Mr. Speaker, and the hon. member the words of a 
prominent Quebecer: ``Sponsorship is subliminal publicity. People 
associate cultural products to tobacco brands. It is a very powerful 
way to push consumption of the product, in particular among 
youth''.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians of all age groups want and need to know that 
they can count on a decent standard of living upon retirement. 
There is no question of that. However, Canadians have been 
deceived in the past by successive Liberal-Tory governments about 
the sustainability of the CPP.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	First the rate was 3.6 per cent. Now it is 5.6 per cent. Soon it will 
be 9.9 per cent. The minister talks about rates. Where is it going to 
stop? No one seems to know.
<P>
	The government has proven that it cannot be trusted on the GST 
promise. What would lead Canadians to believe that it can keep a 
promise on the CPP?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, was there a question?
<P>
	The Reform Party misses the point. This reform of the CPP is 
supported by a majority of the provinces. This is a 
federal-provincial initiative. The Reform Party has no province 
supporting its suggestions whatsoever. We are going to secure a 
firm public pension plan for lower and middle income Canadians, 
for all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	When the official opposition comes to the defence of 
sponsorship of sports and cultural events, when it defends the 
importance of keeping the thousands of jobs that depend on it, the 
only remark the Prime Minister can muster is that the official 
opposition is being politically opportunistic.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister defines opportunism as an attempt to save 
sporting and cultural events, how does he describe the behaviour of 
his own government, which  continues to pocket billions of dollars 
in taxes on tobacco? Is that is not what one would call 
opportunism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that the 
member did not reveal how much smoking costs the Quebec 
economy. In 1991, taxpayers paid $4 billion because of smoking. 
This is in addition to the costs involved for all those who die of 
smoking related cancer or heart conditions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would it not be 
opportunism to talk about improving health on the one hand and to 
protect the revenues Canada Post makes from continuing to allow 
the tobacco companies to advertise by mail on the other?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are talking about 
productivity. We are talking about jobs. Every year, 12,000 people 
die in Quebec, unfortunately, from smoking. We are taking action 
because we agree with Louise Beaudouin, the Quebec minister of 
culture, who said, and I quote: ``I agree that Quebecers' health 
comes first and foremost'' in <I>Le Soleil</I> last year.

After slashing health care funding to the provinces by 40 per cent, 
the Prime Minister is meddling in Ontario's affairs when that 
province is closing a hospital. It is like a business partner that pulls 
out of the business and still wants to run the thing.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister stop interfering in the personal affairs of 
Ontario when he is directly responsible for the crisis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is rather obvious that the Reform Party does not wish to stand in 
its place and support francophones outside the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I want to tell the House and the hon. member that the Prime 
Minister of Canada has every right as a Canadian citizen to voice 
his opinion, whether in this House or outside. When it comes to 
defending francophones there is none better than the right hon. 
Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is interesting 
because I went to the hospital this morning and asked the chief 
executive officer what he thought of the Liberal government's cuts. 
His comment to me: ``If there weren't Liberal government cuts we 
wouldn't be in the position we are in today''.

<B><A NAME="8591"> 8591 </A></B>
<P>
gives $734,766 to the Majestic Fur Association. Reform would 
give that money to health care.
<P>
	Why does the government look after its buddies rather than 
looking after health care and the hospitals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a great day. We have a representative of the Reform Party 
standing in the House in an unholy alliance with Michael Harris, 
the premier of the province of Ontario.
<P>
	Canadians will not swallow this unholy alliance with the 
Conservatives in the province of Ontario. The Mike Harris tax 
break is going to cost in excess of $5 billion on an annual basis. 
That is what the province of Ontario is doing with the money.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	Last weekend, his own supporters drew the labour minister's 
attention to the catastrophic effects this quasi-ban on tobacco 
sponsorships will have on Montreal's economy. Content with 
blindly defending his government's position on the matter, he 
added insult to injury by stating that, once they were through with 
tobacco, the Minister of Health would probably address alcohol.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the irresponsible remarks made by 
the minister that his government is set to take the absurdity of its 
policies one step further by threatening to ban beer sponsorship of 
sports events? Does the minister mean to say that someone, 
somewhere in the federal government is preparing to shut down the 
Molson Centre or to prevent Labatts from sponsoring the Expos?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the opposition would have us believe the apocalypse is 
upon us.
<P>
	More seriously, I would like to quote someone who, we must 
agree, is an authority on the organization of the Montreal Grand

he states clearly the following: ``Contrary to what you may think of 
someone who has been involved with auto racing for many years, I 
fully support the government policy on the tobacco control 
legislation.

	He concludes by saying: ``Media attitude in this issue is 
deplorable, and the remarks of some journalists are far from

Dodging questions is an art, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	We will recall that, when the Minister of Health was considering 
banning raw milk cheese a few months ago, the Minister of Labour 
rose in the name of common sense. In the name of Montreal's 
economic health, will a Liberal from Quebec rise in this House 
today and speak up in its defence?

this breach of common sense that will cost Montreal millions of

that we have been able to provide an implementation period which 
will allow a variety of different groups to become accustomed to 
the new regime.

heart attack. He had to be transferred to St. Paul's Hospital. He 
waited three days because there was not enough money to open the 
intensive care unit beds in that hospital. This man died.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Health. Is that his version of 
the government allowing the provinces to absorb $7 billion in

absorb that with their lives?

suggest that there is any form of negligence being exercised here

for a five-year period with an escalation clause.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr.

want to put $4 billion into the health care of Canadians.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Health tell the provinces what stable 
funding is? Is stable funding the removal of $7 billion in transfer 
payments to health and education? That is slash and burn health 
care in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is not often that I get the opportunity to stand on the floor in the

<P>
	The hon. member opposite should discover all of the facts and 
not some of the selected facts that he and the leader of his party are 
trying to portray to the Canadian people. The reality, as exhibited

the efforts Canada has made in deficit reduction.
<P>
	Canadian federal borrowing requirements, which are the way 
most countries measure their deficits, have fallen sharply and will 
be eliminated in 1998-99. This will be well below any other G-7

The fact is that, while the government did its utmost to gag the

to table a copy of that advertisement.
<P>
	I am prepared to hand it over to him right now, and I suppose the 
House leader will understand it as soon as he reads it, since he was 
in this House in 1989. At the time, he advocated a reprimand, to 
ensure that taxpayers' money cannot be used deceitfully in advance 
under a false pretenses.

know the House rules are set by precedent. Earlier today during 
question period you referred to some questions that would appear 
to come close to encroaching on the orders of the day. I think you 
also indicated that you would intervene if you believed that the 
questions encroached on the orders of the day.
<P>
	Beauchesne's citation 428 (v) says a question must not 
``anticipate an order of the day or other matters'' and (r) says a 
question shall not ``refer to debate or answers to questions of the 
current session''.
<P>
	Citation 428 of Beauchesne's refers to written questions. I am 
asking you to advise the House on any guidelines you feel are 
appropriate that would give direction to the opposition parties that 
formulate questions, so that we can abide by the rules and know 
exactly what the rules are when we formulate questions in so far as 
they may or may not encroach upon the orders of the day.
<P>
	There does appear to be a different interpretation by the Reform 
Party compared to the Bloc Quebecois on what is and is not 
allowable and our assumption of what you would or would not 
allow as far as questions are concerned.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, since there is nothing specific in Beauchesne's or in 
the standing orders that would give us specific direction regarding 
oral questions, I ask that you come back to the House to give us 
guidance.

one in the sense that although the Chair can surely give an opinion 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8595"> 8595 </A></B>
<P>
on the general direction of questions, I want to give colleagues 
every latitude in answering questions. When the questions were 
posed  today I listened very attentively that they did not encroach 
on or refer to the specific bill.
<P>
	The preambles give me a great deal of difficulty. I have appealed 
to the House before that if your preambles could be quite concise 
and then you get into the questions, I am better able to respond. I 
try as much as possible to listen as you get down to the question or 
at least to know the direction in which a member is leading. If I feel 
that a preamble is taking us irrevocably toward a specific section of 
a specific bill I will intervene.
<P>
	I would hope on days such as today where Bill C-71 is being 
debated all day that hon. members would consider perhaps a 
different line of questioning. I always leave that to members. In my 
view if a question is of a general nature and not hitting on the bill 
directly I would tend to allow the question as I have today.
<P>
	However the point is well taken. I commit myself to reviewing 
all the questions asked today in question period to satisfy myself 
and perhaps satisfy the House that the questions were indeed in 
order. If I find upon reflection that I perhaps was a bit too lenient I 
will come back to the House and give that direction.

	I prefer to give a general direction to members because you 
know what want to ask and I try to give you as much room as I can. 
I commit to coming back to the House if it is necessary.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-71, an act to regulate 
the manufacture, sale, labelling and promotion of tobacco 
products, to make consequential amendments to another act and to 
repeal certain acts, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and Motions Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 30.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
second group of motions, Group No. 2, the Bloc Quebecois had 
Motion No. 5. This part concerns access to tobacco products. This 
part maintains the ban on selling tobacco products to persons under 
18 years of age. What is new in this second part of the bill is that 
retailers will now have to ask for an identity card with a 
photograph.
<P>
	On many occasions, the Bloc Quebecois has criticized the fact 
that the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act was not enforced. 
According to certain investigations carried out in the year just 
ended, 50 per cent of convenience stores did not enforce the 
legislation and cigarettes were still being sold to young persons 
under 18 years of age. Worse yet, cigarettes were still being sold 
individually. This new provision requiring an identity card with a 
photograph is very laudable.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	It is a measure welcomed by the Bloc Quebecois, because it can 
truly be effective. We have some questions, however, about how 
this measure will be enforced. Right now, there are only about 40 
public servants throughout the country inspecting convenience 
store owners, merchants and retailers selling tobacco products. So 
how can we enforce this measure, although, I repeat, the Bloc 
Quebecois is in agreement with it? Who is going to report those 
who have no social conscience and who, for financial gain, will 
continue to sell cigarettes to those under 18 years of age?
<P>
	This clause mentions regulations that will follow. It is like 
signing a blank cheque. We do not know how they will proceed. 
They are still working out the regulations not mentioned in this bill 
that, following the master plan tabled by the former health 
minister, took one year to reach first reading in the House. We have 
not yet seen the regulations to follow. This is all very laudable and 
we applaud this measure. We hope that it will be introduced, but we 
also want this legislation to be enforced.
<P>
	This part also contains a ban on selling a tobacco product by 
means of a display that permits a person to handle the tobacco 
product before paying for it. Goodbye to self-service displays. We 
also applaud this measure.
<P>
	The ban on furnishing a tobacco product by means of a 
dispensing device. It must be understood here that the prohibition 
concerns access to the products sold by vending machine, not the 
vending machine itself. This means, more or less, that the 
machines will have to be kept behind the counter in a restaurant, for 
example, and the staff will have to go and get the products.
<P>
	It will also be prohibited to cause a tobacco product to be 
delivered from one province to another, or to be sent by mail, for a 
consideration. The obligation for retailers to post signs prohibiting 
sales to persons under the age of 18 years will be retained, as will 
the prohibition of sales of packages containing fewer than 20 
cigarettes. But that was already in place.
<P>
	How can it be that there are still corner stores and other 
businesses where unscrupulous merchants will sell tobacco to 
young people? According to the statistics and surveys, moreover, 
these children are often between the ages of 8 and 11. This is how 
our young people get hooked on nicotine and the taste of cigarettes, 
and are unable to quit afterward, and the reason why we are so 
concerned.
<P>
	The applications or measures they want to put in place are 
actually quite laudable, as I have said, but there are already 
measures in place which are not being enforced. There are no 
inspections, no one making sure the laws are being adhered to. 
How can we then believe there will be a decrease in smoking by 
young people? How can we believe that the government has the 
will to do it? It has the will to put effective measures down on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8596"> 8596 </A></B>
<P>
paper, but  when the time comes to enforce them, there is nobody 
around to do it. That is what we are finding fault with.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The bill contains other measures regulating labelling. 
Essentially, manufacturers are forbidden to sell a tobacco product 
if it does not bear a message on emissions and on health risks. 
Since the recent Supreme Court judgment, however, the message 
may be attributed to a body or individual determined by regulation. 
Thus, manufacturers will be able to attribute health-related 
messages to Health Canada, which they could not under the old 
legislation.
<P>
	In short, Bill C-71 contains measures which could have a 
positive impact on tobacco use in Quebec and in Canada. This is 
worthy of applause, but as I was saying, only if these measures, this 
legislation, are enforced and not left up in the air, or set out in a bill 
which does not have the manpower to back it up, the inspectors to 
enforce it. One wonders how some forty inspectors are going to be 
able to look after all of Canada and all of the convenience stores 
across Canada. That is where the ridiculous part of the whole thing 
lies.
<P>
	What is of interest to us in Group No. 2 is the Bloc Quebecois 
Motion No. 5, which refers to amending clause 12, so that vending 
devices, even without security mechanisms, are allowed in places 
to which young persons are denied access. The clause as amended 
would read as follows: ``No person shall furnish or permit the 
furnishing of a tobacco product by means of a device that dispenses 
tobacco products except where the device is in a place to which the 
public does not reasonably have access or where that device has a 
security mechanism that is activated before each transaction or that 
is in a place to which young persons are not permitted by law to 
have access''.
<P>
	This is just a matter of common sense. The purpose of this clause 
is to prevent young people from buying their own cigarettes. We 
quite agree with this measure and with all other measures aimed at 
restricting access by minors to tobacco products.
<P>
	If the vending machine is in a place to which young people do 
not have access, a bar, for instance, obviously they would not be 
able to use it. You cannot get anything at all from a vending 
machine unless you are in front of it, whether it is chocolate, gum 
or cigarettes.
<P>
	If our laws are enforced, young people under the age of 18 
should not be in bars and certainly not have access to cigarette 
vending machines.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois received a memo from an association of 
operators of automatic cigarette vending machines. Its members 
are all small businesses that create jobs, and they informed us that 
in its present form, clause 12 in Bill C-71 would cause them to 
close, because these businesses would no longer be profitable. 
They said that the bill was unfair to operators of cigarette vending  
machines and, as such, discriminatory. ``Our members are retailers 
as defined in clause 2 of the bill, and as such we ask, no more and 
no less, to be treated like other tobacco retailers, in other words, on 
the same level as corner stores, drug stores, grocery stores, and so 
forth''.
<P>
	I would draw your attention to what this group finds so illogical. 
Time already!
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, time flies. Only ten minutes this time.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think we are debating a societal value here. We are 
talking about the difference between short and long term.
<P>
	What should we do in our society about smoking? What action 
should we take? Whenever a law involves tobacco, be it in the 
House of Commons or in the provincial legislatures, there is 
always a huge outcry and a great discussion. I know, because in 
1986, when I was the Quebec minister of the environment, we 
introduced the first legislation to protect non smokers, Bill 84.
<P>
	At that point in Quebec, people smoked in hospitals, in clinics, 
in restaurants and in classrooms. Today, things have improved 
considerably, I must say, but a lot remains to be done. That was the 
first step. However, when we introduced Bill 84, there was a whole 
discussion. The entire tobacco industry opposed the very 
introduction of the bill.
<P>
	A debate was held in parliamentary committee. The subject was 
then discussed in the newspapers. It will go on so long as an 
attempt is made to reduce the effect of smoking, because the 
tobacco companies know very well that every country that signs on 
to fight smoking further restricts the market.
<P>
	The statistics are alarming: 256,000 new smokers in Canada, 
with 30 per cent of them in Quebec; 14 is the average age of new 
smokers; 40,000 deaths in Canada, with the highest 
proportion-11,841-in Quebec; and $536 million in health care 
costs in Quebec. If we add on all the economic costs such as 
absenteeism from work, all the economic costs of smoking, we 
reach a figure of $4 billion in negative costs.
<P>
	I heard our colleagues in opposition say: ``Young people do not 
smoke. If they do, it is not because of a poster or advertising on a 
car or the like''. And if it were? Why then put so much importance 
on this advertising? Why do the tobacco companies put so much 
importance on having their brand name appear on a car, a tennis 
court or at a festival, like the Montreal fireworks festival?
<P>
	If there is no element of cause and effect, if it is not true that 
young people are attracted by this subliminal advertising, why then 
are the tobacco companies so opposed to this bill? Do we believe 
for one single minute that the tobacco companies would invest if 
they were not  expecting profits at the end of the line? Do the 
tobacco companies not invest precisely because they know full 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8597"> 8597 </A></B>
<P>
well that young people are influenced by subliminal advertising? 
Otherwise, why would they do it?
<P>
	If there is not an element of cause and effect in sponsorship, why 
are the tobacco companies fighting so hard against legislation like 
Bill C-71? If there is no link whatsoever, how do we explain that 
France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Australia, 
Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, and in 1998 the United States 
all passed legislation to either ban or restrict sponsorship?
<P>
	To those who say that the Montreal Grand Prix is going to 
disappear I would read an article published in December 1992 in 
the daily <I>Le Monde.</I> It says that the IAF, International Automobile 
Association, is announcing the withdrawal of the French Grand 
Prix because of the restrictions imposed on sponsorship. And yet 
today, four years later, the French Grand Prix is alive and well.
<P>
	I remember when Air Canada started its smoke free flights. It 
created an uproar: ``Air Canada is going to lose a lot of 
passengers''. Not only did the number of passengers on Air Canada 
not decrease, it actually increased.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I remember the uproar when Bill 84 was introduced in Quebec, 
when representatives of the bus company Voyageur came before a 
parliamentary committee to tell us that they would lose all their 
clientele if we banned smoking on buses. We gave them a few 
years' extension to gradually introduce the change.
<P>
	In the end, the management of Voyageur told me that it was the 
best decision that could have been taken, that it was a lot cheaper 
nowadays to maintain buses, that passengers were now used to a 
non-smoking environment. There is no longer any argument, any 
discussion on the issue.
<P>
	The tobacco companies and their allies are engaging in this 
heated debate because so much at stake, for them. Of course there 
is something at stake. Profits, clients, younger clients who get 
addicted to tobacco.
<P>
	They say it has nothing to do with health. If it is not a question of 
health, then what is it? If advertising does not promote smoking, 
why do tobacco companies insist on using it?
<P>
	There are so many examples where tobacco companies were 
replaced by others as main sponsors of international events. There 
was the Virginia Slims women's tennis tournament. Virginia Slims 
was replaced by Corel. There was an outcry in the United States, 
people were asking how a tennis tournament could be sponsored by 
a tobacco company. The Australian tennis  tournament formerly 
sponsored by Marlborough cigarettes is now sponsored by Ford.
<P>
	In 1988, when we tried to convince the managers of the 
Canadian Open Golf Championship not to accept du Maurier as 
their sponsor anymore, they told us that without du Maurier the 
Canadian Open could no longer exist. It is doing fine thank you. 
This year it will be held in Montreal and will be sponsored by Bell 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> And by du Maurier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln: </B>It is sponsored by Bell Canada; you will have the 
opportunity to speak later on. What is happening today is that 
people want to use petty politics to make political hay before the 
election, they want to make a big issue of this, they say it is not a 
question of health, that advertisements have no impact on people, 
that they do not encourage young people to smoke.
<P>
	However, Minister Rochon himself said there is a direct link and 
he should know because he is a medical doctor and Quebec's health 
minister. In November 1996, he proposed even tougher legislation 
than Bill C-71 which is now before us. In November 1996, he said 
to the media in Quebec that he wanted that legislation passed. And 
now we are being told that it is the federal Liberals who are trying 
to push this.
<P>
	All these festivals and events that have benefited from these 
sponsors must be given some room to manoeuvre. That is why the 
minister has agreed today to extend the period until October 1st, 
1998. This will give event organizers two full years to find new 
sponsors.
<P>
	My colleague, the president of the Liberal caucus in Quebec, has 
appealed to the Canadian bankers association. It says that it does 
not have enough money, that it already gives a lot to charities. The 
chartered banks have made $6 billion in profits on the backs of 
Canadians. It would be nothing for them to give some to the Jazz 
festival in Montreal, the Montreal Grand Prix or the tennis open. It 
would be nothing for them. They have made $6 billion in profits on 
the backs of all Canadians. I appeal to their corporate spirit, to their 
corporate conscience, so they will replace these millions that may 
be lost from tobacco sponsorships.
<P>
	As the minister has pointed out, nothing prevents a tobacco 
company from sponsoring an event in the future, but there certainly 
will be restrictions on advertising. I support the minister's bill 
entirely. If choices have to be made, human lives are a lot more 
important than advertising by the tobacco companies.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I support the minister entirely, because I think we do everything 
we can to reduce the use of tobacco in our society, whether it is in 
Quebec or elsewhere.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on the motions in GroupNo. 2 that were put forward by my colleague from Macleod. We are 
faced with a difficult dilemma.
<P>
	The dilemma in this bill is how we address decreasing 
consumption, particularly among youth and dealing with the 
purchase of cigarettes in shops. Is it fair to criminalize those 
individuals who unknowingly sell cigarettes to minors or is it fairer 
to put the responsibility on the individual who goes into the store 
with the knowledge they are committing an illegal act? My 
colleague from Macleod and I feel it is more important to put the 
responsibility and the onus on the child who buys cigarettes and 
who knows full well he is committing an illegal act.
<P>
	That is why the motions in Group No. 2 were put forward by my 
colleague, putting a $75 dollar summary conviction fine on 
underage children who buy cigarettes.
<P>
	We have heard a lot today on the issue of sponsorship. The 
ultimate goal of this bill should be to decrease tobacco 
consumption with all Canadians, particularly youth. We know we 
can have the greatest effect in decreasing consumption in youth. 
Tobacco consumption and the addiction to tobacco products occurs 
when somebody is a child, particularly around the ages of 11 to 14. 
The consumption of as little as one pack of cigarettes or sometimes 
even less can ensure that a child is addicted for life.
<P>
	Over the term of this government, the statistics have been very 
interesting in a number of areas. One area is the decrease in cost 
this government effected when it decreased tobacco taxes in 
February 1994, a move we vehemently opposed. We opposed this 
because decreasing the tobacco tax was the single most important 
negative health move that any government in the past 50 years has 
made.
<P>
	The negative effect of this move cannot be underestimated. 
Lowering the cost of cigarettes has introduced 250,000 children to 
cigarettes each year. They will be addicted for life. Half of them 
will ultimately die an early death. A great percentage will suffer 
morbidity from a wide variety of diseases, from chronic 
obstructive lung disease to angina to a number of other 
malignancies, which there is not enough time to speak of today.
<P>
	This is the fate that awaits those children in the future and that is 
the legacy this government has given to the Canadian people. This 
is what it has done for their health.
<P>
	This government was warned by Health Canada. A Health 
Canada study was conducted by Drs. Morrison, Mao, Wigle and 
Villeneuve entitled ``The Impact of Cigarette Price Rollback on the 
Future Health of Canadian Adolescents''. I will quote from the 
summary:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Government tobacco control in Canada has had three main components: health 
promotion campaigns, high tobacco taxes and restrictive policies on public smoking. 
Even the temporary abandonment of high cigarette taxes will likely lead to a large 
number of teenagers becoming and/or remaining smokers. The health consequences 
of the recent tax decrease will continue for decades.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That study, which was given to the minister in 1995, illustrated 
very clearly, succinctly and scientifically that the impact of a 
tobacco tax rollback would be utterly devastating to the health and 
welfare of Canadians, but in particular to the health and welfare of 
Canadian children. The government has also been inactive in the 
area of advertising.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	The Supreme Court in its wisdom, and I use that very 
sarcastically because I cannot think of a greater affront to 
Canadians and a greater lack of responsibility than the Supreme 
Court has demonstrated through twisting the charter of rights and 
freedoms, turned down the advertising ban on smoking advertising. 
What has been the effect of that? Let us take a look.
<P>
	The data of the last year show in 1996 alone that the lack of a ban 
on tobacco advertising has been enough to support 250,000 new 
smokers in this country. The per capita increase has been anywhere 
from 3 to 4 per cent in this country as a result of not allowing the 
ban on tobacco advertising itself.
<P>
	To colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois, I ask them to take a look 
at this very clearly and it will demonstrate without a shadow of a 
doubt that the ban on advertising that has been removed has caused 
an increase in consumption. They should be more concerned than 
anybody else because the children in Quebec take up smoking 
earlier and smoke more than children in any other province in this 
country. Those are the facts.
<P>
	We have to do something in this House. We have to deal with the 
epidemic of smoking. The tobacco sponsorship provisions in the 
bill are okay. We are holding our noses and supporting the bill only 
because nothing has been done on the tobacco issue in this country 
for three years. For three years while a quarter of a million kids 
pick up the habit the government has been diddling around doing 
nothing.
<P>
	The health minister would rather deal with banning certain types 
of soft cheeses than with a health epidemic that claims 40,000 lives 
every year. What does that say about the commitment of this 
government to the health of Canadians? If I were them I would be 
truly embarrassed.
<P>
	Certainly back in 1994 we had a smuggling epidemic but here is 
another problem that the government failed to deal with properly. 
Instead of dealing with the smuggling issue which actually occurs 
unfortunately on many aboriginal reserves in Quebec, instead of 
dealing with the smuggling conduits which deal not only with  
tobacco but also deal with guns, with alcohol, with drugs and with 
tobacco and people, the government has chosen to put its head in 
the sand and not address the criminals and the thugs who are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8599"> 8599 </A></B>
<P>
engaging in this and who are associated closely with the gangs in 
the United States.
<P>
	Instead of dealing with the thugs, the government has chosen to 
compromise the health and welfare of all Canadians and in 
particular the children of this country by rolling back the tobacco 
taxes. The government has put its tail between its legs and said ``we 
are not going to enforce the law, we are going to compromise the 
health of Canadians and make it look like we are doing 
something''.
<P>
	A plan for the health of Canadians and a plan to decrease 
consumption and a plan to address the smuggling was there and it is 
as follows. One, bring the tobacco taxes back where they were in 
January 1994. Two, put forth an export tax which would decrease 
the smuggling of tobacco. Three, enforce the law to address and 
arrest those individuals who are committing crimes and who are 
smuggling all across this country.
<P>
	The government fails to recognize the law-abiding aboriginal 
people who live on these reserves who have to put up with thugs in 
their midst who are engaging in these illicit, illegal practices. No 
one talks about the culture of fear that many of those people live in. 
It is an abrogation of the responsibility of this government to not 
address that problem. It is an abrogation of the responsibility of 
this government to put its own political fortunes ahead of the health 
of Canadians.
<P>
	The government should be ashamed of itself and the Canadian 
people should understand what is going on here. The plan was there 
but the government chose to ignore it.
<P>
	I hope that our colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois will unite 
with our colleagues in the Reform Party and I hope some members 
of the Liberal Party to put forth a better solution to address the 
smuggling issue, decrease consumption of cigarette smoking in 
this country and enable us to all live in a healthier and happier 
environment, if not for ourselves then in particular for the health 
and welfare of our children.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the report stage motions in Group No. 2 of Bill 
C-71.
<P>
	I was a member of the standing committee on health of the 
House of Commons in 1994 and this was an issue that was before 
the committee on a number of occasions for a number of reasons. I 
recall when the committee held public hearings with regard to the 
issue of plain packaging for tobacco products. We also, as members 
know, had hearings with regard to the proposed legislation, Bill 
C-71.
<P>
	There was a common element in both about which I want to 
advise the House. I do not think many people realize what 
happened. The tobacco companies did not, and I stress that, appear 
before the standing committee on health on either occasion. They 
demonstrated what we must all accept as one of the most brilliant 
strategies in terms of an economic strategy for a failing business.
<P>
	Tobacco companies had to do something to deal with the fact 
that the health care industry: doctors and nurses, medical officers 
of health, the communities in which we live, the social agencies 
that have to deal with the aftermath of problems associated with 
tobacco consumption and addiction, the Addiction Research 
Foundation, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, were saying 
very clearly: ``Tobacco hurts Canadians and we have to do 
something about it''.
<P>
	The tobacco companies had virtually everybody against them. 
There was absolutely no future for the tobacco industry in Canada. 
There was no place for them to go. They had to find some way to 
continue to be in business but they had to insulate themselves from 
the real people of Canada.
<P>
	They used their influence to manipulate people. That was their 
brilliant strategy. They took a position with their resources, with 
their money. They bought people. Everybody has a price, so they 
say.
<P>
	Who appeared before the committee? Cultural groups, recreation 
groups, sports groups, all came to say: ``This is terrible. If you do 
this, we are going to lose our tobacco sponsorship and we are going 
to lose these events''. That is the brilliance of the strategy. The 
tobacco companies said to the groups that they were sponsoring: 
``Let's go-''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	I can understand the hon. member's flash of anger, but I think 
stating in this House that witnesses were bought by tobacco 
companies is a bit excessive. I sat on the committee, I saw 
individuals earnestly make their point, and it seems to me that to 
say they let themselves be bought is excessive.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, it is very likely that these words 
are excessive, and I would ask our hon. colleague not to use such 
words in this debate. The hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the groups that came before the health 
committee were a number of cultural groups, recreational groups, 
sporting associations, and they said: ``This is what the impact will 
be on our organizations and on our events if tobacco advertising is 
banned''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8600"> 8600 </A></B>
<P>
	We knew exactly what was happening. These organizations were 
approached. Their sponsors, the tobacco companies said: ``Let's go 
and fight the tobacco  bill in front of the health committee. By the 
way, if I do not show up, you start without me''. That is exactly 
what happened.
<P>
	The tobacco companies did not appear during the hearings on the 
plain packaging issue, even though we found out subsequently the 
CEO of RJR-MacDonald was actually sitting there. He refused to 
come and sit at the table to answer questions or to address the 
issues before the committee. They did buy the consulting services 
of certain people to speak on their behalf. They came before the 
committee. One witness was a gentleman from the U.S. with a 
Ph.D. He came before the committee to talk about the impact of 
advertising on children. He basically concluded on behalf of the 
tobacco companies that advertising has no impact on children.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I asked him quite explicitly if he thought that the figure of Joe 
Camel on Camel cigarettes, because of its cartoon character nature, 
had any influence on children. He said: ``Who is Joe Camel?'' This 
is a consultant, an expert witness, speaking on behalf of the tobacco 
companies and he admitted before the committee he did not know 
who Joe Camel was. Then he was asked a rhetorical question: Did 
he know who Mickey Mouse was? He said: ``No, who is Mickey 
Mouse?'' It is clear you can get anybody to say anything if he is 
working on your behalf.
<P>
	We saw the same thing before the committee with Bill C-71 and 
the sponsorship issue. All the groups that we know have a vested 
interested in seeing events continue appeared. They all found 
themselves in bed with the tobacco companies, totally addicted to 
tobacco money. They were relying on blood money and it really 
was a problem because we had no way of knowing what the real 
issues were for these people. We asked them if the government 
made up the additional funding they needed for sponsorship would 
they support the bill? They said: ``No question, it is a good bill''.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the kinds of things that 
tobacco companies have done in the past to support their events. 
They have advertised in comic books for children. They have held 
rock concerts where the admission fee was two empty packages of 
cigarettes. They have had scantily clad women go to high schools 
to hand out individual cigarettes. These are the kinds of tactics they 
use. It is all about attracting young people to their products, the 
250,000 young people a year who are becoming addicted.
<P>
	The facts are clear. If you do not start smoking by age 19 it is 
very unlikely that you will be a smoker in your lifetime. The 
tobacco companies know it, the health industry knows it. The 
targets of the tobacco companies are the young people of Canada 
and of the world.
<P>
	Other members and the Bloc would say this is awful. We are 
going to lose all these sponsorships. We are going  to lose the races. 
<P>
We are going to lose Just for Laughs. Where are they going? There 
is no ban. They can still advertise, they can still promote, they will 
still have exclusivity. What are the options?
<P>
	They cannot move the automobile race to the United States. The 
Americans are going much further than Canada. They are going for 
a full ban.
<P>
	It is absolute hypocrisy to argue the benefits of commercialism 
over the health benefits to Canadians. The consequences of tobacco 
products cost Canadians $15 billion a year. I remind members of 
the Bloc that the right thing to do-and that is why we are here-is 
to care for the health of Canadians, not for the health of the 
commercial sector.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that many groups unwittingly have come 
to members of Parliament: constituents, retailers and all of those 
who benefit in some small way from the tobacco money, and have 
unwittingly been put between the health of Canadians and the 
needs or the demands of the tobacco companies.
<P>
	The history is clear. The tobacco companies are not prepared to 
come face to face with the House of Commons. Therefore, we have 
to do the right thing and protect the health of Canadians because 
that is why we are here.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to remind the hon. members that we are now 
at report stage. Yet, the speeches I heard before I rose myself 
sounded identical to those I had heard one, two or three years ago, 
in the debate on the principle of the bill. This issue of the principle 
of the bill has been resolved, and the principle agreed upon, at 
second reading.
<P>
	At this stage, we must ensure the bill is viable and contains 
realistic and adequate provisions. The Bloc voted for this bill.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	And having come this far, they would have us throw out the baby 
with the bath water, in the sense that we are being gagged for 
making constructive remarks to improve on the bill. We are being 
told that we will not be allowed to debate the bill later than5:15 p.m. and third reading will be on Thursday; we are prevented 
from debating the bill fully the same way we were at second 
reading.
<P>
	There is an amendment put forward by Bloc Quebecois in the 
group under consideration. Let me explain briefly, to show you it is 
a matter of plain common sense.
<P>
	The bill provides for a security mechanism to ensure those under 
age cannot use cigarette vending machines in restaurants or other 
public places. The bill provides that  the same type of security 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8601"> 8601 </A></B>
<P>
mechanism will have to be used in bars, where minors are not 
allowed in any case.
<P>
	This is like wearing both a belt and suspenders. In any case, it 
lacks logic. It looks like overkill. In small communities where one 
person mans the bar, this will be an additional obstacle that will 
adversely affect business. It is not true that a 10, 12, 14 or 15-year 
old can go into a bar to buy cigarettes. In any case that person does 
not have the right to go into a bar.
<P>
	This is the type of amendment we feel is important at this stage, 
to avoid impossible situations. You will see the kind of details the 
government should be concerned with, and the type of amendments 
that should be made, so as to not unduly bother people in their 
everyday activities.
<P>
	This is important, because we are trying to see why the 
government is so intent on ramming this legislation through. It is 
true that this bill is based on the four pillars of marketing: the 
ability to influence the price, the product, the promotion and the 
advertising. This is an approach that can make sense. However, one 
must see if each of the measures based on these four elements is 
appropriate. Above all, we must avoid giving way to demagoguery.
<P>
	The government tells us that sponsors will have until 1998 to 
adjust, but it does not tell us that they will have no leeway as 
regards the broadcasting of events outside the country. On the one 
hand, something is given, but on the other hand, we prevent the 
sponsorship from having its expected impact. This amounts to 
prohibiting the event, as the members opposite are well aware.
<P>
	Then, we are told that the tobacco companies did not appear 
before the committee. It is not up to me to defend the tobacco 
companies, but the House should not be misled in this way. 
Representations were made by the Canadian Tobacco 
Manufacturers' Council to the committee. So, representations were 
made.
<P>
	Finally, some more or less realistic comments are made, which 
have nothing to do with the stage we are at now. We are trying to 
improve this bill as much as possible. For instance, the Bloc 
Quebecois is not against the amendments providing for a photo ID 
card, but we would like to know how this will be implemented in 
real life.
<P>
	This bill gives a lot of regulatory authority to the minister. With 
this kind of legislation, it would have been very useful to find out 
what the regulations will be and how they will work. But there is no 
mention of that in the bill.
<P>
	We also agree with the principle that consumers should not have 
direct access before paying, as long as it is workable. 
Representations were made by a coalition of cigarette vending 
machine owners. These people agree with the measures to further 
restrict access to tobacco products for young people, but they fear 
the government might go too far and bring about the demise of 
their  businesses, and I referred earlier to the concerns of bar 
owners.
<P>
	I would ask the government to take into consideration the 
amendments put forward, especially those of the Bloc Quebecois
<P>
which appear in this group, and to also take whatever time is 
needed to discuss the issue so that we can end up with an 
interesting bill and not have to completely overhaul the regulations 
and the bill just a few years down the road.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, thus this is 
Group No. 3, that is, mainly the whole chapter on sponsorship, or 
clause 24. I remind you that, at second reading, the official 
opposition voted for the principle of the bill because we agree with 
80 per cent of the bill and with all clauses aimed at reducing 
smoking, especially among young people, but also among all 
Canadians, although this is obviously more of a voluntary decision 
for adults.
<P>
	Concerning sponsorship, though, there are important economic 
issues at stake for Quebec and for Canada also, since sponsorship 
accounts for some $60 million that are distributed by the tobacco 
companies for sporting and cultural events. Of those $60 million, 
some $30 million go to sporting and cultural events in Quebec. You 
will understand, therefore, that the Bloc Quebecois, which forms 
the official opposition and has Quebec's interests at heart, wants to 
preserve these funds that ensure the survival and even the 
development of cultural activities, and thus are good for the 
economy, especially in the tourism industry.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	In terms of added value, events such as the Montreal Jazz 
festival, the Montreal Grand Prix and other international events are 
important because they attract many visitors to the Montreal area, 
as do events such as the summer festival in Quebec City, which 
also attracts many visitors. In fact, all events of this calibre attract a 
lot of visitors and that is why their economic impact is so great.
<P>
	But there is also the issue of visibility. Events such as the 
Montreal Grand Prix, the Du Maurier tennis tournament or the golf 
open give sports fans an  opportunity to see, on television, what 
goes on all over the world. It is a window on the world, an 
opportunity to promote extraordinary sporting and cultural events 
that give each region and each country the visibility they need.
<P>
	Let us talk about the Montreal Grand Prix. The Grand Prix in 
Formula 1 racing comes in third place among sporting events, after 
the Olympic Games and the World Cup in soccer, in terms of 
coverage and in terms of viewership. It is the third most important 
event. There are no such races in the United States or anywhere else 
in North America. But there is one in Montreal.
<P>
	We could lose all that because, even if the minister has accepted, 
through an amendment, to stagger the application of section 24 
concerning certain restrictions on the sponsorship of sporting and 
cultural events, there is still section 31-and I see that the 
chairman of the health committee, who, like me, has studied this 
bill clause by clause, knows full well what I am talking 
about-which will prohibit retransmission as soon as this bill 
becomes law. So it will be this year, if the bill is adopted in the next 
few weeks as planned by the government and if the other House 
gives its consent. This means that the Montreal Grand Prix is 
threatened, and we see in the newspapers that China, which is badly 
in need of visibility, is very interested in taking over the Montreal 
Grand Prix and would be most happy to do so. You can certainly 
understand why we want to defend ourselves in these 
circumstances.
<P>
	There is always the same argument that something similar 
happened with the French Grand Prix. But in France it is not the 
same situation because, in the context of the automotive industry, 
in connection with Formula 1 cars, several companies are 
represented. The same is true for England, Italy and Germany. 
There are enough sponsorships from racing car manufacturers that 
they can do without tobacco sponsorships.
<P>
	But this is not the case in other countries. It is not the case in 
Australia. They wanted to ban it, but they were forced to adopt a 
legislative measure allowing an exception. So, there are a number 
of countries with the same situation, notably Japan, because it was 
not possible to attract automobile manufacturers, Formula 1 teams 
sponsored by tobacco companies, not just by companies we are 
familiar with but by foreign companies.
<P>
	Imagine this strange situation: in order for a car sponsored by a 
tobacco company to be allowed on television, if clause 31 were 
allowed to stand, the brand on the car would have to be purposely 
blurred, somewhat like the procedure used when interviewing a 
criminal or an informer who wishes to remain anonymous. This is 
commonly seen on television, but in this case, the car is travelling 
over 200 kilometres an hour. You can imagine the skill required if 
ever the leading car were sponsored by a tobacco company. There 
are a number of things like that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8604"> 8604 </A></B>
<P>
	The official opposition presented many amendments to clause 
24 so as to reduce the impact, so that the situation could continue. 
Most of the amendments consist of compromises. Most of the 
amendments we have presented here at report stage were 
suggested by people who benefit from these sponsorships, not by 
tobacco products, and not by companies.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I do not wish to come to the defence of tobacco companies. I do 
not smoke, but sports and cultural events are very important to the 
cultural and economic life of Quebec. That is what we are fighting 
for.
<P>
	The main issue is this: Is there a connection between displaying 
a tobacco company brand in a place of entertainment or somewhere 
else and the increase in smoking among young people? I 
systematically asked this question, as the chairman of the health 
committee knows. I asked each witness whether he had a scientific 
study demonstrating a link. Each time, people replied that they did 
not, that they had a number of studies, but none on that specifically.
<P>
	A very articulate representative of the Canadian Cancer Society, 
to whom I had directed the question, even answered me: ``No, there 
is no study''.
<P>
	Finally, these people have the impression that sponsorship is a 
way of improving the image of tobacco companies, but nobody 
could show in a scientific way that it helps increase tobacco use. As 
an advocate of non-smoking, I am pursuing the goal of improving 
health. I will recall very briefly that I was a recreation professional 
when I was younger, before I became a member of Parliament. I 
might not look like it, but I used to take part in 10 kilometre runs. I 
realized soon enough that it did not agree with smoking. In another 
speech, I pointed out that Céline Dion surely does not smoke in 
order to protect her voice.
<P>
	So, we should do promotion in a positive fashion. We should 
spend more money on programs to prevent smoking. The 
government is collecting $4.5 billion in taxes on the sale of tobacco 
products. It should take some of that money to try to reach its goals. 
Instead of announcing a piece of legislation that has yet to be 
adopted, it should have launched a program to encourage people to 
stop smoking by showing them the benefits of quitting, how 
pleasant it is to be in shape, to take deep breaths, to go play outside, 
as Kino-Québec used to say, to play sports, and by demonstrating, 
if necessary with the help of athletes or famous singers, how great 
it is to be in good health and a non-smoker. This would have a very 
positive impact on our young people.
<P>
	I know that some other colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois will 
speak later on. My hon. colleague for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead will probably rise and speak with 
enthusiasm as he puts forward other arguments that will convince 
you, Madam Speaker, or the  chairman of the health committee, to 
postpone the implementation of this provision of Bill C-71.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in the debate. As the chair of 
the health committee that dealt with Bill C-71 I and my colleagues 
from Lévis, Drummond and others have had a fair amount of 
exposure to the bill. We have had a good opportuntiy to say what 
we want about it. My words today will be few and quite pointed. 
They will be largely related to the amendment which stands in my 
name in the group before us.
<P>
	In general terms I believe very strongly in the provisions of Bill 
C-71. I believe very strongly in its objectives. The bill goes a long 
way to seeing that its objectives are met, namely the objective to 
reduce tobacco consumption particularly by young people.
<P>
	Our hearings were extensive. I am proud to say on behalf of the 
committee that we were able to hear all who wanted to be heard 
over three or four days. The hearings last fall were televised which 
gave a large body of people, apart from those in the hearing room, 
an opportunity to participate, to see how the matter was dealt with 
and to hear the arguments on both sides of the issue. The overall 
process was served very well. We were able to hear in committee 
the real concerns that people had with the bill.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	At the end of the three or four days of hearings I was rather 
impressed by the case that had been made by the representatives of 
sponsored events, those events which have heretofore been 
sponsored by the tobacco companies. I thought their argument 
made a fair amount of sense and ought to be examined.
<P>
	As a result, once the bill had passed clause by clause in 
committee I as a member of the committee said to my colleagues 
that we ought to look at some transition period. Instead of bringing 
in the provision which would limit sponsorship when the bill came 
into effect, I felt we could allow some lead time for a couple of 
reasons.
<P>
	It would give those people involved in sponsored events time to 
adjust to the new reality. I was cognizant that many events had been 
planned for this summer and even for next summer. We needed to 
give those people some lead time to adjust to the new reality.
<P>
	Equally important was to remove from the tobacco companies a 
potential weapon, namely the possibility that the tobacco 
companies would rush out on the excuse of this legislation and 
cancel forthwith sponsorship funds they had already subscribed to 
events. I wanted to remove from the tobacco companies that 
particular excuse. I wanted to take that weapon away from them. 
The lead time proposed in my amendment has the effect of doing 
that. If the tobacco companies want in the next  year or so to 
continue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8605"> 8605 </A></B>
<P>
sponsorship, nothing legislatively prevents those companies from 
doing so.
<P>
	It would give the organizations running the events time to look 
around for alternate funding without the threat of having their 
events collapse because of the immediate loss of the funding upon 
which they have come to depend over the years.
<P>
	With these thoughts in mind I made a suggestion to the 
committee. The committee put forth a resolution to the House a day 
or so after the bill was reported. It is in that spirit my amendment 
before the House has been made.
<P>
	It is not intended to water down or detract from the measures in 
the bill. My own view on sponsorship was different from what is in 
the bill. I felt we should have wiped out sponsorship altogether 
from day one. That was my view. I felt that we ought to have 
provided alternate funding for a period of three, four or five years. 
That was my position on that issue.
<P>
	That view did not prevail. What we have in the bill, I understand 
for constitutional and other reasons, is a limited sponsorship. That 
is my second position. I would have preferred to have no 
sponsorship by the tobacco companies at all. A good argument can 
be made for that, but that is yesterday's battle so I will not get into 
it.
<P>
	The amendment I have proposed will give some assistance to the 
groups whose concerns we heard in committee. The transition 
period will give them the extra time they need to find other 
sponsors. However they also need the certainty of knowing the 
precise date when the restrictions on sponsorship promotion will 
come into effect. We do not know exactly when the bill will receive 
royal assent. It is fair to assume it may well be some time this 
spring. Events are already en train for this summer. I thought we 
ought to give them this summer and next to make the adjustments.
<P>
	With that in mind, and the importance of having a definite date, 
my motion indicates that we would have the sponsorship 
provisions in the bill take effect as of October of the following year. 
This would be a welcome measure for those who are looking for as 
much time as possible to make the adjustments.
<P>
	As I have said before, I do not think it in any way detracts from 
the health principles of the bill. It does not in any way dilute the 
principles of the measures in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	In closing, let us remind ourselves that this is first and foremost 
a health bill. Anything it does ought to have as its mandate the 
improvement of the health of Canadians. The bill goes a long way 
in that direction.
<P>
	I hope my amendment is not seen as a diversion but rather as a 
practical way of accommodating what is a problem created by the 
bill but not intended. The people  who sponsor these events are not 
the culprits. If we as legislators can avoid making them victims, we 
ought to do so. The spirit behind the amendment is to give them 
that little extra time.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to take 
part for the second time in the debate and more specifically to 
speak about sponsorship.
<P>
	About ten days ago, during my last speech on Bill C-71, I 
concluded by saying that we were having a false debate. The 
arguments put forth by the Liberal members, particularly the 
Minister of Health, prove more clearly every day that we are 
having a false debate.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to the hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's, who is the chairman of the committee on health, and his 
statements prove once again that I am right. He told the House that 
he himself moved an amendment allowing the Minister of Health 
and the Liberal members to rise in this House and declare one after 
the other that they had not abolished sponsorship of sports and 
cultural events by tobacco companies.
<P>
	How can they say that? By deferring the decision by one year. In 
the original bill, sponsorship of major sports and cultural events by 
tobacco companies would have been prohibited as of December 
1997. The very generous-I would even say 
munificent-amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Burin-St. George's defers the decision by one year.
<P>
	The Liberals are so keen on stifling the economy of Quebec, 
particularly that of Montreal and of other cities such as 
Trois-Rivières and Quebec City that have great sporting and 
cultural events, they so like to hamper what is working well, to 
stifle the promotion of important events, that they decided to have 
more fun.
<P>
	Six months was not enough. They would have had six months to 
enjoy watching important events simply disappear because of a 
lack of funds, but six months was not enough for them. Therefore, 
they decided to have one more year of fun. They gave themselves 
until December 1998 to have their fun so they could say to the 
people of Quebec: ``You see what a good government we are. We 
want to stifle your economy, and we will take all the time needed to 
do so''. That is the result of the process, and that is why I am saying 
that this is a false debate.
<P>
	Moreover, the health minister, in response to questions in and 
outside the House yesterday, repeated that his bill had only one 
objective: to improve the health of Canadians and Quebecers alike, 
particularly that of young people. It was its sole objective. He said 
that his bill had nothing to do with sport or culture, and that is why 
he could afford to ban tobacco advertising at these events.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8606"> 8606 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Along the same lines, the Minister of Health says that he 
understands that there may be problems for the organizers of 
cultural or sports events, but all they will need to do is to approach 
the banks instead. Sure, all the organizers of cultural or sports 
events will need to do is to approach the banks, but they will not be 
the only ones; dozens of restaurant and hotel owners will also have 
to approach the banks, but to file bankruptcy. They will be out of 
business, just as in the example given by my colleague from 
Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	I am sure he will quote this example again this afternoon. In the 
Trois-Rivières area, during the Grand Prix, all motels and hotels 
display no-vacancy signs as all available rooms within about 50 
kilometres are booked. As a result of the decision being made by 
the Liberal government concerning sponsorships, this will no 
longer be the case.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will object within the limits allowed by 
parliamentary procedure to prevent this bill from coming into 
effect. And if, unfortunately, it did come into effect, we will see to 
it that people, especially in Quebec-since we will be the hardest 
hit by this decision-know what is going on, who is responsible for 
this disastrous Bill C-71. We are going to blow the whistle and we 
will keep on blowing it.
<P>
	I am convinced that, when an election is called in a few weeks, 
or a few months, at most, Quebecers who, in 1993, gave their 
support to the Bloc Quebecois in an overwhelming majority will 
think of its general record when they are faced with the decision. 
They will wonder if it has been worth it to have voted for the Bloc 
in 1993.
<P>
	When they realize the role the Bloc Quebecois assumed in this 
House, and now with Bill C-71, Quebecers will think: ``Thanks to 
the Bloc, some men and women stood up for the interests of 
Quebec''. In fact, not one member opposite, among the Liberals, 
discussed that matter, on the contrary. The Secretary of State for 
the Federal Office of Regional Development referred to it a few 
times, but he was told very quickly that if he wanted to keep his 
job, he had better to keep his mouth shut.
<P>
	Fortunately, the Bloc Quebecois was there to fight for Quebec's 
interests. Otherwise, we would never have known this bill's 
disastrous consequences for the economy of Montreal, 
Trois-Rivières, Quebec City and other towns in Quebec.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that we are indeed in a false debate. If 
the Minister of Health cares so much about the health of 
Quebecers, about the health of Canadians, he should speak up in 
Cabinet, plead with the Minister of Finance who has repeatedly cut 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I contend that poverty does a lot more damage than tobacco, not 
only among children, but also among the  general population. 
Everybody agrees that smoking is bad for your health, but this 
debate should be at the provincial level, especially in Quebec. We 
will have this debate. We will decide on the scope of the legislation 
we pass to protect our children, our women and our men. We do not 
need the federal government to tell us what to do in this regard.
<P>
	What we want to avoid most of all is a decision which threatens 
thousands of jobs in Quebec, and that is something that Quebec 
men and women will remember during the next election.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the motions in Group No. 3.
<P>
	The previous speaker just spent some time talking about the 
impact of tobacco advertising on Quebec and that it is a good thing 
that the Bloc is here. Canadians know it is not a good thing that the 
Bloc is here and I think Quebecers know it as well.
<P>
	In the last reported period the cost of smoking in Quebec totalled 
$4.1 billion. That puts in context what the alternative is. Members 
of the Bloc are now saying that this is going to cost jobs at events 
such as car races, and cultural events are going to disappear and all 
the economic benefit will be lost.
<P>
	What does that say about the value of the lives of Canadians to 
members of the Bloc Quebecois? I am not going to dwell on that. I 
think members of the Bloc have made their position clear. They 
hold the value of commerce much higher than the value of the 
citizens of our country.
<P>
	I want to speak very briefly about the issue of sponsorship. 
Earlier in the debate I raised the fact that the representatives of 
tobacco companies did not choose to appear before the Standing 
Committee on Health to represent their interests. In fact, they sent 
cultural and sporting groups and organizations whose events they 
sponsor.
<P>
	Although the representatives of tobacco companies did not 
appear before the committee, they were quite active before the 
hearings of the Standing Committee on Health took place. They 
made representations by sending letters to citizens, members of 
Parliament. They had advertisements in newspapers and made 
television appearances. They did not come before the House of 
Commons committee, face to face, to be questioned and to provide 
facts. They were telling it their way, on their terms, and in a way 
which did not provide all the facts.
<P>
	I want to refer to one of the ads from a newspaper. They claim 
that the restrictions under Bill C-71 make the sponsorship of any 
event commercially untenable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8607"> 8607 </A></B>
<P>
	The tobacco companies continue to use the words ``ban 
advertising and promotion''. The fact is that tobacco companies 
will not be banned from advertising and promoting events. Some 
would argue that advertising should be banned, as I am told it will 
be in the United States, a total ban. In Canada there will be 
restrictions, not a ban. It means that the tobacco companies will 
still be able to advertise fully in magazines, direct mail solicitation 
for support and sponsorship of their events. They will still be able 
to occupy 10 per cent of a poster size even where they can be seen 
by children.
<P>
	However, there will be some restrictions. No longer will an 
entire venue be totally coloured and plastered with the name of a 
cigarette brand. The exclusive sponsor of an event will still be able 
to be identified. They will continue to have that right.
<P>
	I makes me wonder exactly where these events are going to go. 
The tobacco companies want to advertise. Obviously they are 
advertising because they feel there is some benefit to it. In letters 
we have received, some have said they do not know anyone who 
has gone to a tennis match, came out and said: ``I want to start 
smoking because I was at that tennis match''.
<P>
	It is not that easy. The promotion of any product involves a 
multiplicity of approaches. It involves colours, sounds and 
different venues, different medias.
<P>
	We have some examples. In 1992 the French government banned 
tobacco sponsorship and promotion. Throughout the debate, just as 
we are having here, the opposition to the government said that 
events, such as the Grand Prix, would be gone as a result of the ban. 
The Grand Prix circuit would withdraw. In fact, the organizers went 
so far as to announce that the French Grand Prix would be pulled 
from the 1993 circuit if the legislation went through.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	What are the facts? The legislation did go through, the 1993 
French Grand Prix did go ahead as scheduled as did the 1994, 1995 
and 1996 Grand Prix. That is just one example. There are many 
other examples of where threats, directly or indirectly, by the 
tobacco companies are simply a bunch of smoke. They have 
absolutely no relevance to what really will happen. In fact, some 
have characterized it as a cliché of Chicken Little, ``the sky is 
falling''. Everything is going to fall apart.
<P>
	Most members of Parliament have received letters from the 
Alliance for Sponsorship Freedom. It represents itself as an 
alliance of concerned organizations and sponsors of arts, sports, 
fashion and entertainment events in Canada. Let us look at these 
poor organizations who, on behalf of the tobacco companies, are 
saying: ``The sky is falling and our events are going to be cancelled 
if you do this''.
<P>
	Here is just an indication of what are the real facts with respect 
to how much somebody gets through  tobacco sponsorship. People 
are talking about Just for Laughs, which is a Quebec based cultural 
event, and about how terrible it is going to be for Canadians 
because Just for Laughs will be gone. The fact is that Just for 
Laughs only receives 10 per cent of its budget from tobacco money. 
Are the Bloc Quebecois going to convince Canadians that Just for 
Laughs is going to disappear because it loses 10 per cent of its 
sponsorship funding? Nonsense.
<P>
	Members of the Neptune Theatre in Halifax also speak on behalf 
of this alliance. How much does the Neptune Theatre receive? This 
is for the people who said it was awful about tobacco sponsorship 
being restricted. The Neptune Theatre only receives one-half of 1 
per cent of its revenue from tobacco money. Is the Neptune Theatre 
going to go out of business because it loses one-half of 1 per cent of 
its revenue? Nonsense.
<P>
	Representations of Players Grand Prix de Canada also speak on 
behalf of the the Alliance for Sponsorship Freedom. The Grand 
Prix de Canada receives only one-fifth of its revenues from tobacco 
money. Again I must ask the question: Is the Grand Prix de Canada 
going to disappear simply because of the loss of one-fifth of its 
revenues from tobacco money?
<P>
	Finally, a 1995 Canadian Conference of the Arts study of 78 arts 
groups across Canada found that 60 per cent of the surveyed groups 
received less than 1 per cent of their revenues from tobacco money. 
In fact, 86 per cent received less than 5 per cent of the revenues 
from tobacco.
<P>
	It is very clear from the examples I have given that the tobacco 
companies have come across a brilliant, superior strategy to deal 
with a fatal situation in their business. They are going out of 
business and we know that. We cannot find a place to smoke legally 
any more in municipal and public buildings in Canada. The 
Canadian people are making it very clear that the importance is not 
the commercial benefit of businesses like the tobacco companies. It 
is the health and welfare of Canadians. It is what the government 
has brought forward in Bill C-71. It is what the Minister of Health, 
day after day, has been fighting for in this place. Notwithstanding 
the Bloc Quebecois and others saying how terrible it is, it is the 
right thing to do.
<P>
	As legislators, we are elected to do the right thing and the health 
of Canadians must come before the profits of the tobacco 
companies.
<P>
	I just want to repeat the impact of tobacco on Canada: some $3.5 
billion in direct health care costs and about $15 billion in 
comprehensive costs, whether it be social program costs, 
productivity costs, et cetera, and 40,000 lives lost every year.
<P>
	We know from research statistics that if a person does not start 
smoking by the age of 19, it is very likely that person will not 
become a smoker. It is also clear to the  tobacco companies that that 
is the case. It is clear from their strategies that their target audience 
is young people. This Minister of Health has been defending Bill 
C-71 on behalf of the youth of Canada. I am proud to support it and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8608"> 8608 </A></B>
<P>
I know this House will support the excellent legislation and the 
health of Canadians as represented in Bill C-71.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to speak in this 
debate, and I will be making use of several documents which I feel 
to be of great importance.
<P>
	I have here a letter signed by the Prime Minister himself, Jean 
Chrétien, dating from 1995, which says the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to extend a welcome to all of you 
attending this concert presented by Du Maurier Arts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This event, part of a prestigious six-concert series in six Canadian cities, is 
evidence of a long and faithful tradition of promoting and encouraging our Canadian 
artists. Since its inception, Du Maurier Arts Ltd. has been a major supporter of the 
arts, and has provided many outstanding talents with the opportunity to develop their 
careers and to bring honour to our country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I congratulate this organization for its outstanding contribution to the expansion 
of the arts, and I hope that each and every one of you will have a most entertaining 
evening.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So there you have six cultural events in six major cities that will 
no longer be able to take place, thanks to Bill C-71.
<P>
	This morning we also received a letter from the Montreal 
Symphony Orchestra, telling us that they had been involved in the 
Du Maurier matinees for 25 years, and now these matinee 
performances are in danger of going up in smoke-no pun 
intended-because the government has decided to pass a bill, some 
of the clauses of which are anything but sensible.
<P>
	For the benefit of those of our hon. colleagues who are with us 
today, I would repeat that the Bloc Quebecois supports at least 85 
or 90 per cent of this bill, but that we have been given responses 
this afternoon which have come very close to verging on the 
opposite of truthfulness.
<P>
	Clause 31 states, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>31.(1) No person shall, on behalf of another person, with or without 
consideration, publish, broadcast or otherwise disseminate any promotion that is 
prohibited by this Part.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[-]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) No person in Canada shall, by means of a publication that is published outside 
Canada or a broadcast that originates outside Canada or any communication other 
than a publication or broadcast that originates outside Canada,-</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is clear as mud, and the Supreme Court is going to have fun 
trying to interpret all this.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-promote any product the promotion of which is regulated under this Part, or 
disseminate promotional material that contains a tobacco product-related brand 
element in a way that is contrary to this Part.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	At noon, they explained to us on television what all this meant. It 
means that the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday might not be 
televised, although the hon. member opposite insisted that anything 
goes and that nothing is prohibited in this bill; although the 
minister said during question period this afternoon that he had 
nothing against promotions and sponsorship and that it was still 
allowed; and although they told us the present situation might 
continue until October 1998.
<P>
	They would have us believe that it will go on until 1998, just 
enough time to have an election in between. People are not easily 
fooled. They realize that the Bloc Quebecois, while it disagrees 
with this bill, supports a healthy life style. No one would be against 
that. We are all for health, but we do not think this is the way to 
keep people healthy.
<P>
	When you do not give people the jobs they need, when you cut 
their unemployment insurance and when all they have left is 
welfare, you should at least have the decency to let them have a 
smoke with their feet up on the wood stove. Taking away their right 
to smoke would be the last straw.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The government is about to regulate people's private lives, 
telling them what they can do, who they can talk to and what they 
can watch. This is absurd.
<P>
	There is also the Coalition québécoise pour le contrôle du tabac 
which issues press releases that are entirely misleading and refers 
to us as a party that caves in to pressure groups. As if they were not 
a pressure group! What is this coalition? A pressure group, pure 
and simple. It is just applying pressure in the opposite direction. 
That is the only difference.
<P>
	We represent the interests of Quebec. We promised Quebecers 
that we would go the limit to defend the interests of Quebec and 
that is what we are doing now. We want to tell this government, 
which is insensitive and is even deaf to the demands of its own 
supporters, we say to this government that it makes no sense at all 
to paint yourself into a corner the way it has done. How they can 
back out? By saying that they will add an extra year or a fourth or a 
fifth? That does not change anything. It just postpones dealing with 
the problem.
<P>
	We want this government to deal with the problem right away 
and to make the right decisions. I spent 35 years of my life teaching 
young children, and I can tell you that preventing young people 
from watching the Grand Prix and their idol Jacques Villeneuve is 
not going to deal with the problem of smoking in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8609"> 8609 </A></B>
<P>
	Just let them try to make us believe that one. Earlier, I was 
listening to a young driver, who was totally shattered this 
afternoon to hear the minister lay the guilt on him for the death 
of 40,000 people, because he races cars, and tobacco companies 
sponsor car races.
<P>
	He was totally shattered at the attempt to link these two things. 
Are we now going to be prevented from smoking in our own cars, 
because it could be dangerous and could cause accidents? Smoking 
has already been prohibited in aircraft, because the people in front 
were sending their smoke to the back or the other way around, 
according to how the air circulated.
<P>
	We are on the point of being regulated everywhere, and that does 
not make a lot of sense. What does the coalition have to say?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Bloc is acting as if the question of tobacco sponsorship concerned only 
economic interests and had nothing to do with tobacco and its effects on health, that 
is, the 12,000 deaths annually in Quebec. Do we have to again repeat what we have 
said so many times? This bill is first and foremost a matter of public health.</BLOCKQUOTE>
In 80 per cent of the cases, we agree that it pertains to public 
health.
<P>
	I met Dr. Vanasse in my riding, who is in charge of public health 
in the region. Even though he came to my riding office to lobby for 
my support of the bill, he said that it avoided the heart of the issue 
by not controlling the product. So, the government is not dealing 
with the essential, but with the secondary and is preventing people 
from having access to cultural and sporting events.
<P>
	Do you know what is important for a people? It is to develop 
culturally, and sports are an integral part of the cultural life of a 
people. I would like to thank the Liberal Party officially. I would 
like it to be noted in <I>Hansard</I> that I am thanking the Liberal Party, 
because what happened in Montreal at noon is totally amazing.
<P>
	The city shut down between 11.30 a.m. and 11.45 a.m., taxi 
drivers and everything. Because of a bill that has a number of 
stupid clauses, you enabled us to make a few political points. The 
next time we will win even more ridings in Quebec, and it will be 
one more reason to leave this country, which wants to prevent us 
from fulfilling ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> It is with great 
pleasure that I rise again to speak to Bill C-71, which deals with 
tobacco in general, as well as its consumption, promotion, 
labelling, sale, and manufacture.
<P>
	To start with, I would like to salute two of my colleagues who 
have done a tremendous amount of work on this issue, namely my 
colleague from Drummond and my colleague from Lévis, who 
often had to face difficult circumstances due to the underhanded 
way the government has dealt with this issue of utmost  importance 
for thousands and thousands of Quebecers and Canadians. It tried 
to work behind closed doors, at the end of a session and at night, 
issuing position papers and press releases. It made sure the official 
opposition had to work under the most difficult conditions. It 
refused to work in committee, only to yield to pressure from the 
opposition. Therefore, I want to pay tribute to both my colleagues 
because without them, this debate would probably not have taken 
place.
<P>
	I would also like to pay tribute to people who today rose to the 
occasion in Montreal of course, but also in Trois-Rivières, in my 
riding, in my home town. Restaurant owners, shopkeepers, taxi 
drivers, hotel managers and employees marched in the streets to 
show their unmitigated displeasure and disagreement with this 
particular provision of the bill and not with the spirit of the bill 
itself. These are significant nuances that the government in its 
carelessness seems unable to grasp.
<P>
	As the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and leader of the opposition 
said during question period, we agree with 80 per cent of this bill. 
We, however, totally disagree with one of its major aspects, which 
is the focus of the present debate, and that is the advertising, the 
sponsorships. That is why I rose today. We can see how the 
government is acting in bad faith. The more the government speaks 
on this issue, the more we can see its bad faith; it wants to convince 
the public and this House that eliminating sponsorships, billboards 
and tobacco company logos will have a positive impact on people's 
health. This would require a great leap of logic that is outrageous.
<P>
	The government is refusing to budge, even though it is a matter 
of economic development as thousands of jobs, including some 100 
in Trois-Rivières, 3,000 in Montreal and 5,000 in Canada, are at 
stake. There are also some international repercussions. People in 
141 countries can watch the Trois-Rivières Grand Prix on 
television. I discovered that this morning. This is no small feat! 
The Grand Prix is not a spontaneous event. If it can be held at all 
this year, it will be for the 28th year, thanks to the work and energy 
of the many volunteers involved.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Lévis, mentioned earlier that the 
Montreal Grand Prix was the third sporting event in importance 
after the Olympics and the World Cup in soccer. We are talking 
about huge events here. These are significant events which create 
an interest, they put Montreal on the map, they attract tourists and 
they make them want to come back.
<P>
	The government is not being transparent, it is acting with 
shortsightedness and incompetence and in bad faith; it is trying to 
ram this bill through the House by muzzling the opposition as 
much as possible. We know that, at first reading, only one 
representative of the Bloc Quebecois, my colleague from Lévis, 
was able to speak. At second reading, the government also acted 
very quickly. It announced that closure would be imposed  today 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8610"> 8610 </A></B>
<P>
and that third reading would take place Thursday, so as to restrict 
debate as much as possible.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to this government's attitude, 
which may be interpreted in various ways. Earlier the chairman of 
the health committee moved Motion No. 34 with great pride, 
saying-as the Prime Minister repeated later-that the bill would 
not come into effect until October 1, 1998. They were very proud of 
that announcement.
<P>
	But, if this product is lethal, as I heard on the radio at home this 
morning, how can they brag about delaying the implementation of 
this bill as much as possible? Either this is an extremely harmful 
product or we are able to deal with it. However, if it is extremely 
harmful, as the bill is suggesting, let us try to act as soon as 
possible, and certainly not brag about it. Let us not amend this bill 
only to implement it on October 1.
<P>
	Therefore, we see that the government is inconsistent and does 
not care about the public interest, about the best interests of the 
people. Either it is urgent or it is not. If it is urgent, let us act. If the 
bill is not so urgent, if it is not so serious, it should never be 
enforced. The government's current position is remarkably 
inconsistent, and this is something I wanted to underline.
<P>
	In this respect, we must also point to the very deplorable 
behaviour of someone from La Mauricie who, given his influence, 
his power, his origins, is quite aware of what is going on and of the 
terrible, catastrophic impact this bill will have on the Quebec 
economy. You will have recognized the Prime Minister and 
member for Saint-Maurice, whose behaviour and carelessness I 
condemn. He does not listen and springs to the defence of this bill.
<P>
	Reference was made earlier to the great public rallies in 
Montreal and Trois-Rivières, where people have taken to the streets 
today. Opposition to the bill is mounting. I would be very pleased 
to read a release I just received at 3.23 p.m., stating the position of 
the Montreal Exchange on this issue, not that of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	Very briefly, it reads: ``The Montreal Exchange supports the 
various Montreal communities that are protesting the adoption of 
Bill C-71. According to its President and Chief Executive Officer, 
Gérald A. Lacoste, the loss of international events, due to the 
passing of the law as presented, would be disastrous for Montreal. 
The Montreal Exchange has frequently used these large-scale 
events, such as the Canadian Grand Prix and the Du Maurier Open, 
to promote the dynamism of Montreal and its marketplace among 
the international financial community''.
<P>
	This is a fine illustration of the consensus developing in a wide 
segment of the population, which is a stakeholder for one part and 
an observer for the other, and which realizes that this government 
simply lost its  bearings and, in this case, can appropriately and 
colloquially be said to have lost it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill C-71 
respecting the tobacco act.
<P>
	If enacted one of the amendments would oblige the Minister of 
Health to lay before the House of Commons any proposed 
regulations under sections 7, 14, 17, 33 or 42 of the act. At that 
time an appropriate committee would be struck to conduct 
inquiries or public hearings with respect to the proposed regulation 
and report its findings to the House.
<P>
	At the end of the 30 sitting days following the day on which the 
proposed regulation was laid before the House, the governor in 
council could make a regulation under any of the aforementioned 
sections only if the House of Commons has not concurred in any 
report from a committee respecting the proposed regulation, in 
which case the regulation may be made in the form laid, or the 
House of Commons has concurred in a report from a committee 
approving the proposed regulation or an amended version of it, in 
which case the governor in council may only make the regulation in 
the form concurred in.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	As members will know, regulations are subordinate laws made 
pursuant to the authority of statutory provisions called enabling 
powers. The authority to make regulations is usually delegated to 
the governor in council, cabinet, but it may also be delegated to one 
or more individuals or to an independent agency. Ideally these 
powers are used to make the detailed rules that support the 
statutory provisions.
<P>
	While there are a few particular cases in which parliamentary 
review of regulations before they are made is provided for, this 
process is a relatively rare exception to the general rule. In general 
the normal legislative process gives Parliament the role of setting 
out the principles of law in detailed provisions appropriate for 
inclusion in the statute and determining the scope and nature of the 
enabling power which authorizes an elaboration of these provisions 
by even more detailed supporting rules.
<P>
	The making of this subordinate law is then left to government 
ideally in consultation with the primary stakeholders and with 
some input from the general public. What then are the exceptions 
to the general regulation making process?
<P>
	The best example is section 116(2) of the Criminal Code which 
has required since 1992 that all regulations made pursuant to 
enabling power under part III of the code, the gun control laws, be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8611"> 8611 </A></B>
<P>
laid before Parliament for a review by committee prior to their 
enactment. A  requirement that all regulations made pursuant to 
this enabling power undergo such a review is a precondition to 
exercise of the power to make the subordinate laws. Thus we see in 
section 118 of the Firearms Act a procedure for parliamentary 
review of proposed regulations before they are made.
<P>
	Opportunity should be given to the House of Commons to 
scrutinize and amend, if deemed necessary, any regulations 
proposed by the minister under the said section.
<P>
	While I acknowledge the general necessity and appropriateness 
of executive regulation making in the great majority of cases, I 
would argue that there are very good reasons regulation making 
powers in Bill C-71 must be subject to full democratic 
accountability which is only possible through Parliament.
<P>
	We must first examine the context in which Bill C-71 was 
drafted. Essentially the bill represents a response by the Minister of 
Health to the last year's decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
in RJR-MacDonald versus the Attorney General of Canada.
<P>
	Members will recall that in the September 21, 1995 decision a 
majority of the court ruled the government had failed to 
demonstrate that the restraints in the Tobacco Products Control Act 
regarding advertising, promotion and labelling were reasonable, 
justified restrictions on the freedom of expression and 
consequently struck down most of the provisions of the act.
<P>
	In its ruling the Supreme Court has also been helpful through its 
suggestions of a number of options which the federal government 
might use in future legislation. In particular, the court mentioned 
such options as a partial ban on advertising which would allow 
information and brand preference advertising, a ban on lifestyle 
advertising, measures to prohibit advertising aimed at children and 
adolescence, and health labelling requirements with the source of 
the labelling.
<P>
	All these options have been incorporated in Bill C-71. Bill C-71 
represents a conscientious attempt to respond to the guidance 
offered by the Supreme Court of Canada. At the same time we must 
remember that tobacco continues to be a legal product. The 
producers and retailers of this legal product continue to enjoy the 
rights and freedoms afforded to them by the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Should we not then take advantage of every opportunity 
available to us as parliamentarians to ensure that any regulations 
proposed under the bill are scrutinized in detail and in public by a 
committee which  would presumably invite all stakeholders to state 
their case pro or con on any proposed regulations? I certainly think 
so.
<P>
	A public process would go a long way toward legitimizing any 
proposed regulations precisely because it would allow stakeholders 
the opportunity to propose in public improvements to the 
regulations. This public scrutiny of proposed regulations could 
very well lessen the possibility of court challenges against 
legislation.
<P>
	Let us not forget the Tobacco Products Control Act was 
challenged in court almost as soon as it was proclaimed into law in 
1988, taking another seven years before the case finally ended up in 
the Supreme Court of Canada. Do we really want a repeat of this 
process, especially when we consider that a number of tobacco 
companies have already been making threatening noises about 
further court action against the proposed legislation?
<P>
	It seems to me we have a golden opportunity to correct flaws 
which existed not only in the substance of the previous 
legislation-and here I am referring to both the Tobacco Products 
Control Act and the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act-but in 
the process as well.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	No member of the House would welcome more court challenges 
to Canada's tobacco legislation. We want it to work. By inviting all 
stakeholders to participate in the regulation making process, I am 
convinced we will have created a forum whereby regulations will 
be made through negotiation rather than intimidation.
<P>
	I will now say a few words about the actual scope of the enabling 
power of Bill C-71. In so doing I will argue that taken together they 
expand regulation making powers far beyond what may be believed 
as their legitimate scope and must therefore be subject to full 
democratic accountability, which is possible in Parliament.
<P>
	The five sections I have mentioned provide for the enabling 
power to make regulations in the first five parts of the bill which 
deal with tobacco product standards: access to tobacco products, 
labelling, promotion and enforcement. Each section begins with 
the phrase ``the governor in council may make regulations'', 
followed by a number of relatively detailed subsections that 
enumerate the specific areas in which regulations can be made. So 
far so good.
<P>
	Each of these subsections is detailed enough to satisfy the 
principle that regulations should only be made in areas that have 
been sufficiently defined. However-and here is where alarm bells 
go off in the minds of all members of the House-each of these 
sections concludes with the subsection ``the governor in council 
may make regulations generally for carrying out the purposes of 
this part''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8612"> 8612 </A></B>
<P>
	In and of itself this catch-all phrase represents sufficient reason 
to demand that all regulations proposed under the bill be brought 
under the scrutiny of the parliamentary committee. When we 
consider that the purpose of the first five parts of Bill C-71 is to 
introduce a number of restrictions in areas of product content, 
access, labelling, promotion and enforcement, surely all types of 
regulations to be made in these invasive periods should be spelled 
out clearly in enabling power. Unfortunately they are not and the 
reason is simply that each of these sections contains a subsection 
which gives the governor in council a virtual carte blanche to 
propose any regulation at all.
<P>
	How does one define the phrase ``generally for carrying out the 
purpose of this part''? No one can because the options are 
practically endless. If few people today seriously dispute the 
legitimacy of executive law making, concerns linger over the 
extent of these law making powers in the manner of their exercise. 
The perception is that the regulation making process is not fully 
compatible with the values of democratic and open government. 
Whereas statutes are enacted by elected representatives in a public 
forum, regulations will be characterized as the handiwork of 
appointed officials who remain unaccountable to Parliament or to 
the public.
<P>
	I point out this final observation to my colleagues. Since 
regulations have the force of law, the process by which they are 
made must be one that maximizes opportunities for the citizens to 
participate in their making. Since the legislation which preceded 
Bill C-71 has been struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada as 
a transgression against the freedom of expression, the least we can 
do as legislators is to ensure that reasonable constraints be put in 
place to check any potential abuse within the regulation making 
process of the bill.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank you 
for giving me the floor, even though I will not have enough time to 
finish my 10-minute speech. Still, I want to mention certain 
principles and parameters on which I will elaborate on Thursday, 
when we resume this debate.
<P>
	I remind this House and all our viewers that the Bloc Quebecois 
is not opposed to health and is not trying to fight a bill which, on 
the surface, seeks to protect people's health. As we said, we all 
want to do the right thing. We voted in favour of this bill at first and 
second reading, but we can no longer support it at report stage, 
because the government is trying to force solutions on us that do 
not address the real problems.
<P>
	What is the problem? The problem is that some people smoke 
too much and become susceptible to problems such as heart 
attacks, lung cancer, asthma, etc. This is the problem. The 
government wants to reduce tobacco use and, to that end, it has 
decided to eliminate sponsorships.  This is like telling someone 
who eats too much that we will cut his fingers off. Instead of 
teaching the person not to consume the product that is harmful to 
his health, we cut that person's fingers off. We are opposed to the 
solution that the government wants to apply. We have to look at the 
link between the remedy being proposed and the objective pursued.
<P>
	I feel the government is trying to administer medication whose 
side effects have once again not been properly evaluated. It is a 
good thing to look for measures to restrict and reduce tobacco use, 
but there are various ways of achieving this. The best one is 
education.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I must stop now. I will have good examples to 
provide on Thursday. I believe I will have at least nine minutes left. 
Thank you for allowing me to begin my speech.

taken into consideration.

	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 234.</I>]
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I declare the

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, just to reassure the House, the vote 
was on Motions Nos. 8, 23 and 24 at report stage.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> To clarify the 
situation, Motions Nos. 26 and 29 are consequential to MotionNo. 8.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> May I ask the Chair for clarification? Were the 
motions you mentioned moved by the New Democratic Party or 
not?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> MotionsNos. 26 and 29 are in the name of the hon. Minister of Health and, 
in accordance with the Speaker's ruling, the result of the vote on 
Motion No. 8 applies to them. Consequently, when Motion No. 8 
was agreed to, we agreed to Motions Nos. 26 and 29. Those are the 
three motions moved by the Minister of Health.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We now move to Motion No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, if the House agrees, I propose that 
you seek unanimous consent that members who voted on the 
previous motion be recorded as having voted on the motion now 
before the House with Liberal members voting yea.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> The members of the official opposition 
will vote nay, Madam Speaker.
<P>

will vote yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Madam Speaker, the New Democratic Party 
caucus members present this evening will vote yes on this motion.
<P>

vote yea.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I declare 
Motion No. 6 lost.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe you will find consent to 
apply the results of the vote just taken to Motions Nos. 45, 49, 11, 
24, 28, 29, 26, 31, 42, 47 and 37.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> We agree.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Madam Speaker, did the government whip say 
Motion No. 47 or 37?
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Both motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think it is the fault of the 
government whip but a mistake was made. The application of the 
vote to Motion No. 37 is correct. The application to Motion No. 47 
is not correct for the Reform Party. All the others are right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> I agree, Madam Speaker. The vote applies to 
Motion No. 37 but not to Motion No. 47.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 245.</I>]
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> MotionsNos. 45, 49, 11, 24, 28, 29, 26, 31, 42 and 37 are lost. Consequently 
Motions Nos. 41, 51, 25 and 43 are also lost.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should renew its commitment 
to British pensioners living in Canada and vigorously pursue an agreement with the 
government of the United Kingdom to provide them with pensions fully indexed to 
the cost of living.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the hon. member's 
motion concerning the government's commitment to British 
pensioners living in Canada.
<P>
	I agree there is something entirely unacceptable in the present 
situation. As a result, pensioners are receiving and will receive in 
the future, if the situation does not change, the same amount they 
have received since the very beginning. Of course there was no 
indexation at the time, and now we have a situation that has 
become absurd, where pensioners who earned the right to a pension 
are in fact deprived of that right since the amount is not really 
significant. It is too bad the motion is not votable, but perhaps it 
could be examined in committee and we will see what can be 
achieved by going this route.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to a similar 
situation that existed with respect to American pensions. Last year, 
a very unfortunate decision was made by the Government of 
Canada and the Government of the United States when the tax 
treaty between these two countries was renewed. Formerly, people 
receiving American pensions received the full amount and declared 
half of the amount on their income tax return. In other words, 
someone who received $10,000 in pension payments in one year 
would declare $5,000, and as result of various tax deductions, low 
income people were not too severely penalized.
<P>
	However, under the new tax treaty signed by the Government of 
Canada, and the Minister of Finance himself admitted it was unfair, 
pensioners are now taxed at source by the American government 
and have no way of recovering the amounts they are due. This is 
totally unacceptable. It leads to situations that make no sense at all.
<P>
	For instance, someone in my riding is now faced with the 
following problem: formerly she received $400 per month, which 
by the end of the year added up to only $4,800. This person is 62 
and it is the only income that person has. As result of the deduction 
at source, this  person gets $290 per month instead of $400. It 
means $110 deducted per month. When your income only amounts 
to a few thousand dollars, this $110 per month is often needed to 
pay for rent and food. This is totally unacceptable. The minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8639"> 8639 </A></B>
<P>
admitted it was unfair, but unfortunately, there has been no 
concrete action by the government in recent months to deal with 
the situation.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	As you know, negotiations are under way with the U.S. 
government aimed at modifying the tax agreement. I have made 
representations to the minister and the senior officials responsible 
for trying to move this matter along, and according to their best 
case scenario, the tax agreement will perhaps be changed in 1998, 
if everything goes well, and if there is rapid progress.
<P>
	During that time, those who are being penalized will continue to 
be penalized, and the government has proposed no stop-gap 
measures whatsoever to remedy the situation, none whatsoever. 
The latest budget contained not a single one. Yet the Minister of 
Finance's budget would have offered a fine opportunity to make 
some corrections, to improve these pensioners' situation. But 
nothing doing.
<P>
	I find this absolutely deplorable, since there are 70,000 people 
across Canada who are affected by this situation. Of these, 10,000 
are in Quebec, 1,643 in the lower St. Lawrence region alone. These 
are all people who went to the U.S. to earn their living, often in 
New England just across the border in Maine, but also all along the 
border. Now they are coming back to Canada and finding 
themselves in an absolutely horrible situation.
<P>
	To repeat the example I gave just a while ago: when a person is 
entitled to about $10,000 from that pension, the Americans hold 
back $2,500, which means he or she is left with $7,500. Then when 
the person files income tax, he has to declare the whole $10,000 as 
income, even though the $2,500 has been lost sight of forever, with 
no way of ever getting it back.
<P>
	Here is what is being suggested as an interim measure: in 
calculations for the guaranteed income supplement, for example, 
the actual amount received by the person could be used, and this 
would give him a better chance of being eligible for a sizeable 
portion of the income supplement.
<P>
	It is hard to understand why the minister has not heeded these 
requests and why there have been no proposals made. It is not 
because no one has spoken of them to him, for there have already 
been important meetings in various parts of Canada, and it is 
known that 70,000 people are affected by this.
<P>
	In my riding alone, at least 200 people have written to the 
minister in recent months. Hundreds of people have signed 
petitions to get this matter corrected, and we are still unable to 
rouse the sympathies of the minister to get him to correct the 
situation for low income earners.
<P>
	There are some strange situations. For example, in the case of 
someone with a substantial pension of say $40,000 a year, $10,000 
would go to the American government. In the past, this person was 
taxed on 50 per cent of the amount he or she received, that is 
$20,000.
<P>
	Under the new convention, people earning a lot pay less income 
tax, and people earning little now receive less. This situation must 
be corrected. It is not a partisan situation, it is a situation that calls 
for concrete action by the government. In the same way as the 
member called for fair treatment of British retirees in Canada, I 
think our own people, Canadian citizens, who worked hard in the 
United States for a period of time, must enjoy the same treatment.
<P>
	A number of people in my riding have often worked for logging 
companies as lumberjacks, cooks and in other capacities, where 
they have worked very hard. Today they choose to retire in their 
corner of the land of their birth, and the current situation is 
untenable.
<P>
	I think we have reached the stage where more vigorous public 
action has to be taken to get the government to decide on this 
matter. At the end of March, I intend to hold a meeting of 
pensioners from Témiscouata and the whole Lower St. Lawrence 
region. I also invite all those who could be affected by this situation 
so that it is made clear that what they are going through is 
unacceptable for people whose income is only a few thousand 
dollars annually.
<P>
	For example, there are women between the ages of 55 and 65 
who are still not entitled to a pension and who wait a few years 
until their income is a little bit more respectable. Their American 
pension is all they get. They were used to receiving a cheque and 
making it last, but since January 1996 it has been a nightmare. 
They are forced to borrow money, to turn to their families, to find 
other ways of making ends meet. We are not talking about high 
income earners. These are people for whom this is truly the 
minimum amount they can manage on.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	These are amounts that they have earned and that they have no 
possibility of recovering from the American government. It is 
completely impossible right now for a Canadian citizen to apply to 
the American government for this $2,000 or $3,000 to which he 
was entitled in the past.
<P>
	Because the tax rules are different in the two countries, when a 
person declared his income in Canada, because of the salary 
protection measures we introduced that are not available in the 
American system, he was not as heavily penalized. He could cash 
the cheque. While he was receiving it, he could spend it as required 
and only paid taxes the following year. This is very different from 
the present situation where the amount is deducted at source and 
can never be recovered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8640"> 8640 </A></B>
<P>
	So if we have compassion for British pensioners living in 
Canada, I think we should show the same compassion for 
Canadian citizens living in Canada who earned a pension in the 
United States. I hope the government will take action in the short 
term because, if not, there will definitely be a lot of questions 
asked during the next election campaign, because people who are 
being deprived of the income necessary to their survival will 
certainly not be content with promises of future action.
<P>
	A public servant told me they were doing everything possible to 
negotiate a change to the tax convention and that it will take place 
in 1998. He can say that to me, but for the person living with this 
every day, it is unacceptable, and it is vital that a temporary 
measure be worked out as soon as possible. I hope that the 
government will work something out in the coming months, so that 
equity for citizens of Quebec and of Canada in receipt of American 
pensions can be restored.
<P>
	For these reasons, I am well aware of the importance of the 
member's motion concerning British pensioners and I hope that we 
can study it, that the member can take it to committee so that a 
concrete solution can be found, and that similarly, with respect to 
American pensions, a temporary, concrete solution can be found in 
the short term to correct the inequity that has been acknowledged 
by the minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, today I am very proud to sponsor and debate 
private members' motion M-53 which supports the cause of British 
pensioners living in Canada. As I will outline in my remarks today, 
these people have been unfairly treated and deserve our support in 
every way we can provide it.
<P>
	This is certainly not a new issue. It has been around for a long 
time and I am pleased to say that, informally, the Government of 
Canada has been supportive of British pensioners living in Canada. 
It is time that the government became a little more formal in its 
requests of the British government and that is the reason for my 
motion today.
<P>
	When I say that we have been supportive informally, let me 
quote from a recent letter that I received signed by Canada's former 
Minister of Human Resources Development, the present Minister 
of National Defence.
<P>
	The minister said: ``The Government of Canada has been very 
active for many years in trying to persuade the United Kingdom to 
conclude a social security agreement that would provide for the 
indexing of British pensions.
<P>
	``Prime Minister Chrétien has raised the issue of frozen British 
pensions on several occasions with Prime Minister John Major.
<P>
	``These included his visits to London in June, 1994, for the 
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day and his visit 
marking the 50th anniversary of V-E Day.
<P>
	``These occasions were especially appropriate, given that so 
many of the British pensioners in Canada are either themselves 
veterans of the second world war, or the widows of veterans.
<P>
	``Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom has also 
been very active on the issue of frozen British pensions.
<P>
	``The high commissioner and his staff have had numerous 
meetings with United Kingdom cabinet ministers and with both 
government and opposition members of Parliament.
<P>
	``It is clear from these meetings that the U.K. is not about to 
consider unfreezing its pensions in Canada. However, I can assure 
you that the Government of Canada will continue to do everything 
we can to try to persuade the British government to change its 
position''.
<P>
	That was a letter that I recently received from the former 
Minister of Human Resources Development. Obviously, the 
government is committed to the substance contained in the motion 
in front of us today.
<P>
<B>(1940 )</B>
<P>
	I have also been told that the current minister, the hon. member 
for Papineau-Saint-Michel, was in London in mid-January, just a 
short five weeks ago. At that time he raised the frozen pension 
issue again with his counterpart.
<P>
	The government is on side with this motion. I hope it will say so 
again today in this debate. Support in the House of Commons, in 
public debate, is worth so much more than comments made in 
private meetings. The word of the minister is one thing, but the 
voice of Parliament is another. By supporting the motion today, 
members of the House can help to add the voice of Parliament to 
the voice of the minister in support of these very deserving people.
<P>
	For the members of the House who do not yet know why this is 
important, let me take a minute to outline the issue.
<P>
	Pensions for elderly British expatriates resident in Canada are 
frozen at the level paid on the first date of payment or at the date 
when the individual took up residence in Canada. The same 
situation exists for almost 425,000 elderly expatriate residents in 
137 other countries throughout the world. Yet, at the same time, 
some 325,000 British expatriate pensioners residing in some 37 
other countries enjoy the same annual upgrading enjoyed by the 
equivalent pensioner beneficiaries living in the United Kingdom.
<P>
	All of these pensioners, regardless of where they live, accrued 
their credits toward a state pension on the same basis. During their 
working life in the United Kingdom,  they all paid into the fund in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8641"> 8641 </A></B>
<P>
the same way and reasonably assumed that they would all benefit 
on an equal basis when it came time to draw their pensions.
<P>
	Successive British governments have failed to correct this 
completely unfair and discriminatory situation. The British old age 
security pension is indexed, in part, to the British retail price index 
and is subject to being upgraded in April of each year. Since 1965 
the value of the pension for pensioners residing in Britain and the 
37 other non-frozen countries has increased over 15 times its 1965 
value.
<P>
	The Canadian Alliance of British Pensioners gives this example 
of how unfair the pension plan is. A 65-year-old man living in 
Britain who became eligible for a full British pension in 1974 is 
now receiving a pension of £61.15 per week. If that same 
individual, on retirement, had elected to move to Canada to be 
close to his children or other members of his family or for any other 
reason, he would still be eligible for a pension, but only for the 
same level of pension paid to him when he left the country, 
possibly around £10 per week. The amount of the pension would 
never have changed over the period from 1974 to today. That is 
clearly discriminatory.
<P>
	The matter has hit the floor of the House of Commons in Britain 
and numerous MPs there want to see changes brought about. In 
July 1994, for example, Winston S. Churchill, MP, said with regard 
to a particular case being debated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That lady and others like her are being cheated-there is no other word for it-by 
the government of £53.60 per week of the pension to which she contributed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we were talking about a private personal pension or a life insurance policy, and 
the directors of the company tried to restrict the territorial area of payment, I am sure 
that my hon. friend, the minister, would have a shrewd idea of where those directors 
would be languishing now.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They would be in jail, and rightly so.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In my constituency there is a Dr. Derek and his wife Kathy 
Brown who now live near Big River, Saskatchewan. On their 
retirement they came to Canada to get away from the crowds of 
Britain and were told when they left that their pension would be 
payable worldwide. Derek Brown was a doctor in Britain for most 
of his working life and his pension was a full one when he claimed 
it 10 years ago. Now, because he lives in Canada and because his 
pension is not indexed, his £42.50 per week is nearly £20 a week 
less than he would get if he were to move back to Britain.
<P>
<B>(1945 )</B>
<P>
	Dr. Brown says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The thing that annoys us is that they say they cannot afford to do it for us.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But they index the pensions paid in the United States, but not for us in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is this discrimination that we are so fed up with.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Dr. Brown has also written to me to say that he thinks the motion 
before us today should be somewhat amended to replaced the word 
indexed with the word prorated since the pensions in Britain are not 
exactly indexed to the cost of living. This would be quite 
acceptable and I would propose this change be made should the 
motion be sent to committee.
<P>
	During the past few weeks since the motion was drawn for 
debate I have received many letters from British pensioners in 
support of the motion. I will quote one letter in particular written 
by Miss Elaine Dawn of Vancouver, British Columbia. She writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing to request that you please support the current plight of British 
pensioners who live in Canada who, due to no fault of their own have, had their 
pensions frozen at the rate at which they first entered this country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am sure you will agree that this is very unfair considering just south of the 
border in the United States, British pensioners can enjoy the same indexing of 
pensions as if they had continued to live in England.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It certainly seems very unfair to me that certain countries support British 
pensioners while others, like Australia and Canada, have frozen the pensions of 
British subjects at the same level at which they entered their country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am sure you will agree that this has meant a great deal of hardship to many 
people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Miss Dawn's letter says what many others said to me in similar 
letters received during the past four or five weeks.
<P>
	While I was preparing for this debate today, Mr. Doug Ross, 
president of the Canadian Alliance of British Pensioners, wrote to 
me to let me know that in Britain the House of Commons select 
committee for social security had tabled its report on pension 
benefits for expatriates living in countries like Canada.
<P>
	He told me that hearings had been held in London during 
December 1996, following which the committee issued a report 
that admitted the design of the current policies of pensions to 
expatriates was a mess. It also acknowledged that Britain was alone 
among OECD countries in failing to pay up ratings, as they call 
them, equally to all the beneficiaries of state contributory pension 
plans regardless of where they live.
<P>
	However the committee disappointed many. It fell short of 
accepting the requests of the pensioner groups which asked them to 
recommend to the government that it should end the discriminatory 
practice of using country of residence as a factor in the 
determination of pension benefits. Instead the committee simply 
turned the problem over to the government by taking the unusual 
stand for a committee in Britain of recommending a free vote in the 
British Parliament to allow members of the British House to 
express their opinions.
<P>
	Britain is about due for an election. There is no opportunity or 
time for this vote to be called. If an  election is held and a new 
house is created with new members of Parliament, the report of the 
committee will no longer be valid. The next government will not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8642"> 8642 </A></B>
<P>
required, as the motion puts it, to present any motion to the house 
for members to vote on. Therefore this pass on of responsibility is a 
great disappointment to those who appeared before the committee.
<P>
	Mr. Ross and the Canadian Alliance of British Pensioners in 
particular have informed me of how disappointed they are the issue 
is not yet resolved. They have told me they appreciate the efforts of 
the Canadian government in support of their campaign to end 
pension discrimination, but at the same time they feel strongly 
Canada and other Commonwealth countries must take a much more 
aggressive stance in their bilateral dealings to step up the pressure 
on Westminster to end the disgraceful practice of freezing the 
pensions of some expatriates.
<P>
	Mr. Ross writes that there are 718,000 British expatriates 
resident in Canada. Some 137,000 of them have some level of 
current frozen U.K. state pensions earned during the period they 
lived, worked and served in the United Kingdom. An end to 
pension freezing by Britain would ease the plight of thousands of 
cash strapped pensioners living in Canada and would directly inject 
$150 million in the first year into the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	It is time our Parliament supported the cause of the British 
expatriate pensioners. This motion which costs the government 
nothing serves to enhance the position already taken by the 
government in bilateral international discussions. It adds the voice 
of Parliament to the voice of the government to the voice of the 
minister speaking in Britain.
<P>
	I expect to receive unanimous support of the members speaking 
in this debate. Therefore I serve notice that it is my intention to rise 
at the end of the debate to request unanimous consent to move the 
appropriate motion which would allow us to send the matter to 
committee for further action. I look forward to the support and 
comments of other members of the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake for his 
motion.
<P>
	The British pensions paid to some 130,000 persons in Canada are 
frozen. In other words, they are not increased from year to year to 
compensate for rises in the cost of living. The same situation exists 
in many other countries around the world including Australia, New 
Zealand and South Africa.
<P>
	This is not the case everywhere in the world. Under the European 
Union's regulations on social security, for example, the United 
Kingdom indexes annually the pensions it pays to persons who 
have retired in the Costa del Sol, the French Riviera or elsewhere in 
the EU.
<P>
	Under social security agreements the United Kingdom has 
concluded with many other countries around the world British 
pensions are also indexed in these countries. They include, to name 
a few, Bosnia, Croatia, Cyprus, Israel, Turkey and the United 
States.
<P>
	For 20 years the Government of Canada has been trying to 
persuade the United Kingdom to conclude a social security 
agreement that would lead to the annual indexing of the British 
pensions paid in Canada. The United Kingdom has repeatedly 
refused because of the costs it would incur.
<P>
	The issue of frozen British pensions has been raised at every 
level. The Prime Minister has personally discussed it twice with 
Prime Minister John Major. The Minister of Foreign Affairs 
discussed the unfreezing issue at his first bilateral meeting with the 
British Foreign Secretary.
<P>
	Most recently, in January of this year, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development went to London and personally discussed 
the issue with his British counterpart, the Secretary of State for 
Social Security. I regret to say the British reply is always the same: 
the United Kingdom cannot afford to index its pensions in Canada.
<P>
	The Government of Canada believes the fundamental issue at the 
heart of the unfreezing issue is fairness. The persons who are 
receiving frozen pensions contributed to the British national 
insurance scheme during their working years in the United 
Kingdom. They made these contributions in the expectation they 
would eventually receive a pension in retirement irrespective of 
where they might choose to live.
<P>
	Now, however, depending on which country they decide to spend 
their retirement years in their British pension may or may not be 
frozen. The unfairness is compounded by the fact that most of 
today's British pensioners in Canada served the United Kingdom 
during World War II or are the widows of British veterans. This 
point was emphatically made by the Prime Minister when he met 
with Prime Minister Major on the occasion of the commemoration 
of the 50th anniversaries of D-Day and V-E Day.
<P>
	There is also a humanitarian consideration. Many of the British 
pensioners in Canada came to our country so that they could spend 
their retirement years with their children and grandchildren who 
immigrated here. Their frozen British pensions make them more 
financially dependent on their families. For many this can mean a 
loss of dignity.
<P>
	There are undoubtedly also some pensioners in Britain who 
would like to join their families in Canada but have not done so 
because their British pensions will be frozen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8643"> 8643 </A></B>
<P>
	On February 5 the social security committee of the British 
House of Commons released a report on the issue of frozen British 
pensions. The report unfortunately did not call directly on the U.K. 
government to change its position on unfreezing. However it 
pointed out the illogic of the current British policy of indexing 
its pensions in some countries and not in others. In the words of 
the report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surely no one would have deliberately designed a policy of paying pensions to 
people living abroad intending to end up in the position we are in today-It is 
impossible to discern any pattern behind the selection of countries with whom 
bilateral agreements have been made providing for unfreezing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	The committee's report goes on to recommend a free vote in the 
British House of Commons:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to allow members to express their opinion on the principle of whether the 
government should pay upgradings to some or all of those pensioners living in 
countries where upgradings are not paid at present.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Government of Canada views this as a positive suggestion. 
We hope it will be adopted by the United Kingdom.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to support the motion put 
forward by the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake. 
The government is already strongly committed to vigorously 
pursuing an agreement with the United Kingdom that provides for 
the indexing of British pensions.
<P>
	Unanimous adoption of the motion will clearly demonstrate the 
commitment of all parties in the House and of all Canadians to the 
resolution of this long outstanding problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. I wonder if you seek unanimous consent of the 
House to delete Motion No. 259 in the name of the member for 
Calgary Southwest from the Order Paper and replace the name of 
the hon. member for Calgary West with the name of the member 
for Calgary Southwest as the sponsor of Private Members' Bill 
C-341 on the Order Paper.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since other members are interested in speaking to the 
motion I will keep my comments brief.
<P>
	When I was asked to speak to the motion my first reaction was 
what business was it of ours. This is a pension problem for some 
Canadian citizens but it is the responsibility of the British 
government to be make these payments. If the shoe were on the 
other foot, how would I feel if the government in Westminster were 
making decisions or passing resolutions that had to do with how  
Canada treated its expatriate citizens as far as pensions were 
concerned?
<P>
	When I looked into it I wondered why on earth a pensioner who 
lives in Canada would be treated any different from the way the 
same person living in the United States would be treated. It just did 
not make any sense to me.
<P>
	I quite cheerfully take up the cudgel on behalf expatriated 
Britons living in Canada who are scattered fairly evenly across the 
country. There are perhaps proportionately a few more living in the 
maritimes than in the rest of the country.
<P>
	For the interest of members of Parliament present and those at 
home fixed to the television watching this debate, it is of particular 
interest that Britain does not index the pensions paid to expatriated 
Britons living in Commonwealth or former Commonwealth 
countries. Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and 
Zimbabwe are the countries where Britain does not index pensions. 
Yet it does in Germany, France and other countries in the Economic 
Union.
<P>
	In 1996 the stated British government reason for the 
discrimination was that the other countries had entered into 
agreements with the British government. Alternatively indexation 
is a requirement of the European Economic Community. Britain 
has entered into an agreement to index the pensions in the 
European Economic Community but not with Canadians.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that if a pensioner lived in, as one 
example, Bosnia, they would be collecting a fully indexed pension. 
However, because they live in a former Commonwealth country or 
Canada they do not.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party and on behalf of those British 
ex-patriot citizens resident in Canada and who have come to us and 
other members of Parliament to ask that we take up their case, I am 
happy to do so.
<P>
	I know the member opposite, who will soon be on her feet, will 
be taking up the cudgel on behalf of the British ex-patriots living in 
Canada as well.
<P>
	There are 208,000 British pensioners living in Canada right now. 
Fifty-two thousand live in British Columbia. If the pensions to 
ex-patriot British pensioners living in Canada were fully indexed 
and were paid it would mean an additional $200 million annually to 
the budget at Westminster. There are many ex-patriot Canadians 
resident in Britain. Those ex-patriot Canadians resident in Britain 
benefit from the fact that we pay their indexed pensions. Does it not 
seem reasonable that Britain should also index the pensions to 
ex-patriots from Britain living in Canada? It seems to me that it 
would make good sense to do that.
<P>
	I will terminate my comments on this subject by once again 
reiterating the fact that on behalf of the Reform  Party we support 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8644"> 8644 </A></B>
<P>
this motion. I understand that the member for 
Battlefords-Meadowlake has served notice that he will be asking 
for this motion to be made votable. We would certainly support 
that.
<P>
	Seeing the member opposite ready to rise to her feet, I will 
terminate my comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague who is a 
gentleman always.
<P>
	It is with pleasure that I rise to speak in support of this motion 
which calls upon the Government of Canada to seek an agreement 
with the British government that would require the British 
government to begin paying costs of living increases to British 
pensioners living in Canada.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for the Battlefords-Meadowlake for 
raising this issue. I am also grateful to my constituents who have 
written to me to raise my awareness to their concerns.
<P>
	The United Kingdom is the country of origin of the largest 
number of immigrants to Canada since the second world war. Many 
have made significant contributions to the prosperity of Canada. As 
members know, Guelph is called the royal city. We are proud of our 
heritage which is tied to Great Britain.
<P>
	It is therefore troubling that in spite of the efforts of the 
Government of Canada over the last 20 years there is still no social 
security agreement in place between our two countries to protect 
the pension rights of British pensioners in Canada. We are 
discussing pension rights of a significant number of people, 
estimated at around 130,000. These people are being hurt because 
the British government refuses to provide them with the same 
protection against inflation that is enjoyed by British pensioners 
living in the United Kingdom, the European Union and a number of 
other countries with which the United Kingdom has social security 
agreements.
<P>
	I believe that the policy of the current British government is 
illogical. All the people we are talking about have contributed to 
the British pension plan and believed when they did that they 
would be paid a pension to which they were entitled and that 
everyone would be treated fairly and in the same way. This is not 
the case.
<P>
<B>(2005)</B>
<P>
	The current policy of the British government therefore treats 
some of its citizens more equally than others. The situation exists 
where many British pensioners living in Canada, including those 
living in Guelph-Wellington, who wrote to me only recently 
received considerably less than those in Great Britain who made 
exactly the same contributions but who reside in the United 
Kingdom or in countries with which the United Kingdom has social 
security agreements.
<P>
	Is this unfair? Of course it is. This has resulted in a significant 
loss of income for some pensioners living in Canada. Many of 
these people moved to this country to be closer to their children and 
their grandchildren and the reduction in their pension income has 
been very difficult.
<P>
	I am told that in some cases these pensioners who worked all of 
their lives and contributed to the British pension plan are now 
dependent on their families. This has resulted in a loss of dignity.
<P>
	For people who spent their lives hoping and contributing for a 
decent pension plan, this must be quite a blow. Interestingly, the 
inconsistency of this policy has been recognized by members of 
Parliament in Britain.
<P>
	A recent British parliamentary committee studying this issue 
noted that there seems to be no pattern to this system, which 
provides indexing for some but not for others.
<P>
	In addition, the report went on to observe that no one would have 
deliberately set out to design such a system. However, this is the 
situation faced by thousands of people living in Canada. Something 
obviously has to be done if this double standard is to be eliminated. 
It is time for the British government to act.
<P>
	I was saddened to learn that the current British government 
seemed no more willing to correct this situation now than it has 
been for the past 20 years. The reason appears to be that the cost of 
fixing this injustice is estimated to be about $16.8 million in the 
first year and this figure is growing over time to about $150 million 
per year.
<P>
	As a supporter of fiscal restraint and deficit reduction, I 
appreciate the difficulties that this means for the British 
government. However, we must insist that the British treat its 
pensioners living in Canada in exactly the same way as those living 
in the United Kingdom and other country by providing them with 
the same indexation of benefits enjoyed by pensioners living 
elsewhere.
<P>
	The Canadian government has tried to make its position clear. 
For instance, the Prime Minister spoke to British Prime Minister 
Major about this when they met during the 50th anniversary of 
D-Day and the 50th anniversary of V-E Day.
<P>
	As well, the Minister of Foreign Affairs raised this issue with his 
British counterpart at their first bilateral meeting. More recently, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development discussed this with 
the British secretary of state and with various spokespersons of the 
opposition during his visit to London in January.
<P>
	He emphasized then how strongly the Government of Canada 
feels about this issue. These are concrete examples that show the 
determination of this government to see this matter through to a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8645"> 8645 </A></B>
<P>
successful conclusion. I  remain hopeful that the British 
government will change its attitude on this issue.
<P>
	Last October, I shared with this House my motion calling for a 
seniors bill of rights. At that time I spoke about the people in my 
community who deserve our respect and support. They are, of 
course, seniors who gave so much and ask for so little.
<P>
	I spoke then, as I do now, about their one main request, to be 
treated with the dignity they deserve. I spoke about the many 
organizations, associations and senior complexes, like the Elliott 
under the leadership of David Hicks, who support our seniors.
<P>
	The injustice that is experienced by the thousands of British 
pensioners living in Canada is another example that we must 
always be vigilant and watchful to protect those most vulnerable 
and to help those who help them.
<P>
	This motion has my support and I urge all members to support it 
as well. By supporting this motion, members of Parliament will 
demonstrate the resolve of all Canadians to see this matter to a 
successful conclusion, thus ensuring that justice is done for these 
130,000 people living in Canada.
<P>
	The royal city says yes to this motion and so do I.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, it does appear 
that all members wishing to speak on this motion tonight have risen 
and spoken. As the mover of the motion, I want to thank them very 
much for the dedication and concern they showed for British 
pensioners during their remarks tonight. I thank them very much 
for that.
<P>
	I noticed that all members who spoke today from all the parties 
represented in the House were supportive of the motion, including 
the two government members.
<P>
	Therefore I think it would be appropriate to ask if there was 
unanimous consent of the House to make this a votable motion and 
send it to committee so that there could be full House support for 
the government's position.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the hon. 
member have the unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There is not 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	There being no further members rising for debate and the motion 
not being designated a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 8.11 p.m, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 8.11 p.m.)
<P>
