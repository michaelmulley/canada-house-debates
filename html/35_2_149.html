	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege with regard to 
actions taken by officials of the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration who, in my opinion, have acted in contempt of 
Parliament.
<P>
	This morning I was told that I would not be allowed into a 
preview of a press conference with department officials giving 
details of proposed changes to legislation or regulations given by 
the minister. Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer you to Joseph 
Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, page 14 where it 
states that the Senate and the House of Commons have the power or 
right to punish actions, which, while not appearing to be breaches 
of any specific privilege, are offences against their authority or 
dignity. Such actions, though often called breaches of privilege 
should more properly be considered contempts.
<P>
	I rise because I feel that the actions of the department of 
immigration have been in contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, it is the practice of this place to 
include opposition members when detailed briefings are given on 
changes to regulations. I feel that the attempt by the department to 
deny me access until after the media had received the information 
is to deny me my privilege to information.
<P>
	It is time that we as members of Parliament object to 
departmental officials placing the needs and desires of the media 
ahead of members of Parliament and the House.
<P>
	I would like you to consider seriously that this is a contempt of 
Parliament and of my privileges as a member of Parliament. The 
media was given information that was going to be denied to me 
until two hours after the fact.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I understand the hon. member's feelings and I sympathize with 
them.
<P>
	From the point of view of parliamentary privilege I would ask 
you to consider whether what she is saying applies to matters that 
are extra-parliamentary or non-parliamentary. We are not talking 
about a sitting of the House of Commons. We are not talking about 
a sitting of one of its committees. We are talking about a meeting 
that officials decided to have with members of the press.
<P>
	If the hon. member is right, does this mean that any MP has a 
right to go to any meeting officials have with the press or with 
interest groups, et cetera? Is there no right on the part of the 
officials, or the minister for that matter, to say that they are entitled 
to have under some circumstances what amount to private 
meetings?
<P>
	While I understand the member's desire to be informed and it is 
commendable in terms of what she wants to do as critic for her 
party, I respectfully ask the Chair to consider whether what she is 
complaining about is, in fact, something parliamentary, raising all 
the rules and considerations of parliamentary privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. member who raised 
the point of privilege would be kind enough to indicate where the 
meeting was held and who ultimately was present, who arranged 
the meeting and that kind of detail.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will. The meeting was called by 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration in the press 
building across the street on Wellington. It was a briefing of the 
details of the changes to the immigrant investors program. When 
we asked if we could attend, the department told us that we would 
not be allowed to attend and that I would be given the same briefing 
by the same departmental officials after question period, which 
would be more than two hours after the detailed briefing had been 
given to the media. The time of the briefing was nine o'clock this 
morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to respond to the words of the government House leader 
who talked about private meetings and how they relate to this 
matter. I cannot imagine how the government House leader would 
think that a briefing of the media could in any way be interpreted as 
a private meeting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9312"> 9312 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to Erskine May's 
21st edition, page 115. It states that an offence for contempt may 
be treated as contempt even though there is no precedent for the 
offence. It is, therefore, impossible to list every act which might 
be considered to amount to contempt, the part punished for such 
an offence being of its nature discretionary.
<P>
	These situations happen far too often. I refer to Commons 
<I>Debates</I> of November 20, 1996, at page 6505, when I stated in the 
House: ``That I had been advised that tomorrow''-being 
November 21-``members of Parliament will not be given a copy 
of the report by the royal commission on aboriginal affairs. It will 
be given to the press, to the media, but not to members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	You, Mr. Speaker, in the Chair replied that I would appreciate the 
word ``inchoate'' because it would not happen until the following 
day. Because I raised it as a matter of privilege, the government 
went out of its way to ensure that a few copies of the report of the 
royal commission were delivered in order that my question of 
privilege would be negated before the offence took place.
<P>
	The meeting was at 9 a.m. it is now 10.10 a.m. Therefore I would 
state that the contempt has taken place and must be ruled on 
accordingly.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would also like to draw your attention to a 
situation of some time ago where I raised a question of privilege 
regarding questions I have had on the Order Paper for almost two 
years. There have been some quotes in the newspapers-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not think that is the matter we are 
dealing with at the moment. If the hon. member has anything 
further to say on the precise question that has been raised by his 
colleague, please deal with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was pointing out that the issue of 
contempt has arisen in this area on numerous occasions. 
Government staff have been quoted in the media as saying that they 
have no intention of responding to my question on the Order Paper. 
These types of offences are happening far too often. Now we have 
another one this morning from the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley.
<P>
	I hope you take the matter seriously and report back to the House 
that there has been contempt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, in a constructive way I would like to 
advance a point that had not occurred to me when I spoke. The 
premises in question are not parliamentary buildings. They are 
occupied by the press gallery which I think as part of the traditional 
autonomy of the gallery runs the press conferences in the press 
theatre.
<P>
	It may be that the hon. member has a complaint to the executive 
of the press gallery which manages the press conferences or 
briefings. In recent years it has become  more strict about how 
many MPs and their staff it will allow even into the press gallery 
theatre to listen to open press conferences.
<P>
	I am just in a constructive way adding a fact that I would have 
put on the table if I had thought of it when I spoke earlier. Also, do 
the hon. member and her colleagues intend to say that I will have a 
question of privilege if I am not allowed into their confidential 
briefings when they prepare for question period? Mr. Speaker, if 
that is the case I would be happy to ask you to take that into account 
as well.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am going to reserve on this matter but I 
will allow the hon. member to speak for a third time on the matter 
that has just been raised by our colleague across the floor.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be very tempting to do 
what the House leader of the government suggested.
<P>
	To clarify the matter, because we felt the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration did not have the right to deny us 
access, we did follow up by phoning the press gallery. We were told 
that the department did not have the right to deny me access to that 
building.
<P>
	The point of my concern is that we had departmental officials 
trying to prevent members of Parliament from getting information 
at the same time as the media was getting information on the 
details of government regulations. My objection is to the treatment 
I was given as a member of Parliament by the staff in the office of 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley, the hon. government House leader and the 
member for St. Albert. The Chair will reserve on this and will get 
back as quickly as it can with a ruling on the matter.

	The House resumed from March 19 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for the opportunity to participate in the debate on the 1997 budget. I 
will be splitting my time with one of my colleagues, so in my 10 
minutes I will talk about an issue that has aggravated western 
Canadians for years: the endless attempt by successive 
governments, Tory and Liberal, to buy Quebec's love with large 
amounts of federal largesse.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9313"> 9313 </A></B>
<P>
	To understand the source of this irritation I will point out a few 
blatant examples from this and recent Parliaments. Second, I will 
talk about why successive Liberal and Tory governments have felt 
compelled to perpetuate this habit of favouring Quebec to the 
detriment of other provinces and other territories. I would like to 
spend my last few minutes outlining why my Reform colleagues 
and I feel there is a better way to address the Quebec question.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	On the first point, I have watched this dance play itself out 
between Ottawa and Quebec for the last 30 years. Quebecers say 
they are unhappy with the federal system and if something is not 
done they will leave.
<P>
	Instead of sitting down and addressing Quebec's concerns, the 
federal politicians in Ottawa are consistent in trying to buy its love 
instead of dealing with the matter. Here are a few examples.
<P>
	To put it bluntly, in dollar terms Quebecers benefit 
disproportionately from the federation itself. For example, Quebec 
accounts for only 25 per cent of the Canadian population yet it 
receives30 per cent of all federal transfers to provinces.
<P>
	The equalization program is supposed to assist the poorest 
provinces to provide services to their people. Quebec, the fourth 
richest province in Canada, receives more equalization dollars than 
any other provinces. It receives more than the four Atlantic 
provinces combined.
<P>
	The separatists will dispute these facts and claim that Quebec 
pays more to Ottawa in taxes than it receives in transfers and 
program spending. This is not true. The fact is that Quebec paid22 per cent of total federal income tax, which is less than its 25 per 
cent share of the population and considerably less than its 30 per 
cent share of federal transfer dollars.
<P>
	This systemic bias in favour of Quebec is not what really irritates 
western Canadians. Rather, what galls my constituents in 
Lethbridge, in southern Alberta and in other places in western 
Canada is the blatant political pork which successive federal 
administrations, Liberals and Tories, have shovelled into Quebec.
<P>
	Let us take some examples. The infrastructure program was 
supposed to be for roads and sewers, basic infrastructure. The very 
first infrastructure project announced by the government was a 
convention centre for Quebec City. Do we need another example? 
How about the canoe museum in the Prime Minister's home town 
of Shawinigan? Then there were business subsidies. Last weekend 
it was $600,000 for a hotel in Shawinigan in the Prime Minister's 
riding. The next day it was an $8.1 million sock factory for 
Montreal, with the taxpayers of Canada footing the bill.
<P>
	How about Bombardier? Over the past 15 years total federal 
subsidies to this giant corporation totalled $1.2  billion: 1.2 billion 
of taxpayers' dollars to a company that earned $400 million in 
profit last year. It had a profit. It could have gone to the market and 
got the money on its own without the intervention and the handout 
of the Liberal government in Ottawa.
<P>
	The final example I would like to use is the allocation of federal 
funds to assist provinces with the settlement of immigrants and 
refugees. Under the terms of a deal signed during the Mulroney 
administration Quebec was guaranteed $90 million per year for that 
program. In turn Quebec agreed to accept 25 per cent of Canadian 
immigrants. Quebec has not honoured that agreement. Today 
Quebec only accepts 12 per cent of Canada's immigrants but 
continues to receive the $90 million. That is wrong. That represents 
roughly 30 per cent of the total funds allocated to that program.
<P>
	To illustrate this geographically, British Columbia receives 
about $1,000 in federal funds for each immigrant. For the same 
immigrant in the province of Quebec the allocation is $3,327.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	My constituents want to know why there is a double standard. 
The reason is that successive Liberal and Tory governments-and 
this one is as bad as the rest-have refused to address the legitimate 
concerns of Quebecers about the federal system. Their selfish 
refusal to abandon the status quo and make real change means the 
federal government has nothing to offer Quebecers except federal 
largesse. Instead of renewing the federal union to keep them in 
Canada the government tries to buy their loyalty instead.
<P>
	It is a losing proposition. After three decades of overspending 
the federal government simply does not have enough money left. 
More important, people's loyalty or love for the nation cannot be 
bought with government money.
<P>
	The bottom line is that Quebecers are unhappy with the way the 
nation works and have been for some time. Quebecers object to a 
domineering federal government that intrudes into provincial 
jurisdiction. They object to an elitist status quo that vests powers to 
the Prime Minister and his respective cabinet which not allow them 
to elect their own senators or appoint their own lieutenant 
governors.
<P>
	It is ironic that many other Canadians object to exactly the same 
things, especially western Canadians. As my leader said last week 
in Oshawa, Quebec sent 50 BQ members to Parliament and western 
Canada sent 50 Reform members to Parliament because both 
parties articulated the contempt felt by Canadians toward the 
political status quo. The big difference is that Reformers offered a 
plan to rebuild the federation while the separatists in the House are 
merely offering to tear it down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9314"> 9314 </A></B>
<P>
	What is the new path Reformers would like to offer Canadians? 
It should reach the ears of some Liberals who sit rather deaf in 
the House. What would we like to do?
<P>
	We would rebalance the federation by transferring control of 
jurisdictions such as resources, training, culture, housing and 
tourism back to the provinces where they belong. We would forbid 
any new encroachments on provincial jurisdiction through use of 
federal spending power. We would replace federal cash transfers 
with a tax point system of transfers to prevent future governments 
from slashing such transfers the way the present government has 
done. We would reform our democratic institutions to allow for 
election of senators, freer votes in the House of Commons, 
provincial input into judicial appointments and much more. We 
would give the final word on any constitutional amendment to the 
people of Canada in the form of a national referendum.
<P>
	The bottom line is that if the next federal government continues 
to resist fundamental systemic changes to our federation Quebecers 
will more than likely choose to leave. The concern in western 
Canada will continue.
<P>
	If, however, the next government commits itself to real change 
and offers all Canadians including Quebecers a new deal then the 
Canadian federation would finally be placed on the foundation it 
needs to lead us in a confident and united way into the 21st century.
<P>
	As we move into the possibility of a spring election it is 
incumbent upon the current members of Parliament to consider that 
it is easy to play political games and to seek re-election for the sake 
of having power in the country. However, if parliamentarians and 
those going into the next election look at their responsibilities and 
their goals and are unable to say they have a new plan to build a 
Canada for all Canadians rather than just for a political party, we 
are doing a major disservice to our history. That will be the 
challenge of the 1997 election.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	Can the Liberal Party and the Tory Party step over the bridge and 
away from their continuous goal for years of seeking power and of 
handing out federal government largesse to Quebec and maybe to 
other provinces just to get votes which allow them to stay in 
power? Can they cross over that bridge and change their ways and 
take responsibility for building a better nation? It is time they tried.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleague suggested, Ottawa seems consumed with appeasing 
Quebec. Federal funds flow into that province without reason. At 
the same time provincial policies drive money out of that province.
<P>
	This enrages many people in the province of British Columbia 
and weakens the attachment of many of them to Canada. Does the 
favouritism shown to Quebec strengthen the national fabric of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, favouritism has been 
going on for years. Federal largesse has been handed out in an 
unplanned way to Quebec, the maritimes, Ontario and even to the 
west in an attempt to buy votes. That is one of the observations I 
made with respect to the current Liberal government.
<P>
	When the Liberals were elected in 1993 it was over a year before 
we saw a budget plan. We heard about studies. We were told they 
were thinking about things. They were delaying. They were going 
to hear witnesses. They were going to do all kinds of things but 
they were not going to implement a plan.
<P>
	What happened in the 1994-95 budget? The Minister of Finance 
was not ready with a plan. We lost a year in which we could have 
reduced the deficit significantly. We could have dealt with it when 
Canadians were in favour of that type of action. We had to wait 
until the budget of 1995-96 for the Liberals to do something.
<P>
	As long as the government has as its priority handing out money 
to Quebec to get political support and to maintain political power, 
Canadians will be discontent whether they live in B.C., Alberta or 
the maritimes. Somewhere along the line that approach to 
government must stop.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Lethbridge mentioned a lot of things about 
Quebec, the Constitution, the security of Canada and unity. Those 
are very significant issues. However another area that has been of 
concern to me has to do with the promise to create jobs.
<P>
	Could the member give us some examples of measures in the last 
two budgets which gave encouragement to young people in the area 
of job creation?
<P>
	The Reform Party, with its fresh start program, is telling young 
people that there is hope. There is a vision for Canada which will 
give them job security, stability and hope. It will give them the 
things they want for their families and their future.
<P>
	Could he say a few words about that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I reiterate a point I 
made earlier. If the Liberal government had been elected with a 
plan to reduce the deficit and bring forward a balanced budget 
during the 35th Parliament, there would have been a greater 
amount of stability in the Canadian economy and a greater amount 
of confidence in the nation.
<P>
	The 1997-98 budget could have been a balanced budget.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	If that happened, the confidence of the investors in Canada 
would have been greater. We would have had investment in all 
kinds of small and medium size business across this nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9315"> 9315 </A></B>
<P>
	The consumers of Canada who would have been more secure 
in their jobs would have been ready to spend money and buy. 
However, the problem is confidence is not there. The Minister of 
Finance stands in the House and says interest rates are low.
<P>
	We remember what happened in the 1970s when interest rates 
ballooned into the 18 to 23 per cent range and there was a floating 
interest rate that a small company or as a small businessman or a 
farmer took out. It devastated their business. It took all the cash 
flow and we are scared that that could happen again. This 
government has not come to grips with its finances. The confidence 
level in this country is horrible even though it has been glazed over 
by a good media communications plan by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	That is not going to hold water very long. If the interest rates in 
United States start to increase, we know the Canadian interest rates 
are going to follow. That, in turn, is only going to reduce the 
confidence of the investor and the consumer.
<P>
	That leaves our young people, 25 per cent between the ages of 18 
and 25, who are now currently unemployed in a very unstable 
condition. We must deal with our budget in a more responsible 
way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, four years ago I 
came to this place excited at the prospect of trying to affect some 
change here. At that time, I shared the enthusiasm of my fellow 
Reformers for fiscal prudence and for promoting the notion of 
fiscal prudence and some sort of social responsibility. As well, I 
came with an interest in the fishery, especially the fishery on the 
west coast.
<P>
	Canada's fisheries represent a valuable national resource. The 
responsibility for that resource is vested in the federal government. 
It is a constitutional responsibility, one that the federal government 
cannot ignore. Yet this government has failed miserably in that 
regard.
<P>
	It has ignored the best advice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It 
has ignored countless participants and shareholders in the fisheries 
who have attempted to offer good and solid advice to the 
government. Most curiously, it was ignored by a former Speaker of 
the House whom this government appointed to conduct a review of 
the Fraser River fishery in 1994.
<P>
	Why I bring this up in the context of the budget is that the federal 
department of fisheries has a budget this year approaching $1.2 
billion. We are not talking peanuts here. We are talking about a 
huge budget, one which is not spent wisely and one which puts this 
valuable natural resource at risk.
<P>
	Mr. Fraser in his comments suggested the same: ``DFO must 
formulate a strategy and a plan that will marshal the personnel, 
facilities, equipment and communications systems needed to 
re-establish a credible  enforcement deterrent. The first step in the 
process must be a proper assessment of what is required at 
minimum to ensure adequate enforcement. This cannot be achieved 
in the context of a budget exercise''.
<P>
	What the former Speaker was saying was that when there is a 
department like fisheries and oceans with a constitutional 
responsibility to protect a national resource, we cannot simply take 
the accountant's view and start slashing at the budget. We first have 
to determine what is needed to protect that resource and go from 
there. In managing the budget this government has not done that.
<P>
	That is not to say, necessarily, that we are standing here saying 
that more money must be spent. What we are saying is that a proper 
assessment must be taken of what is needed. We must ensure that 
the moneys spent are spent wisely.
<P>
	In 1994 the government reaffirmed its support for something 
known as the aboriginal fishing strategy. This was a strategy that 
established a racially segregated fishery on the west coast which 
the previous government said was an obligation as a result of a 
Supreme Court decision and Sparrow. This of course was false.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, a mid-term review was conducted of this program 
in 1996. In that mid-term review it was noted that reallocation of 
money from within DFO to the aboriginal fishing strategy starved 
the real needs of the department such as enforcement.
<P>
	What we have here is an abuse of priorities. Where the key 
priority must be enforcing regulations and laws and protecting the 
resource, the government in its wisdom took money from that 
critical area and put it into an area which came about as a result of a 
political need rather than a constitutional need.
<P>
	Within a year of coming to power, the government reaffirmed its 
support for this aboriginal fishing strategy and approved the 
continuation of AFS commercial sales projects and allocated 
money away from key enforcement areas. This is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	DFO auditors went over the results of the mid-term review and 
they noted two things. The first thing they said is that it was 
difficult to get an overall sense of what had been accomplished 
through the expenditure of almost $100 million over four years. 
That $100 million was spent on this aboriginal fishing strategy.
<P>
	The auditors went on to say that most of the examples used in the 
document contained no hard data, thus they had no way of knowing 
the magnitude of the project, whether it was cost effective or how 
the results were determined.
<P>
	The government asked Mr. Matkin, former head of the B.C. 
business council, to conduct a review of this aboriginal fishing 
strategy. The review was completed  toward the end of January and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9316"> 9316 </A></B>
<P>
the government promised that this review would be made public. 
We are still waiting for the publication of that review.
<P>
	At the same time as we are waiting, it is preventing the 
government from doing its job and that is preparing for the 
upcoming fishing season. In a draft of the Matkin report, Mr. 
Matkin noted that these pilot sales programs were in a rut and that 
something must be done. Yet again we are waiting and waiting for 
something to come about here.
<P>
	The government further spent money on another study, a study 
which would deal with the coast wide implications of using the 
Nisga'a treaty as a model for treaties which would be established 
coast wide and the impact of using that treaty as a model, 
especially with this fisheries component. In other words, what is 
the cost of replicating the Nisga'a treaty coast wide to the 
commercial fishing industry?
<P>
	Over a year ago we applied under access to information to get a 
copy of that study. It took 12 months. The Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans, in its wisdom, refused to release anything to us, not 
even the cover page of that 98 page document. We are still working 
through access to information to get it. What does the department 
have to fear from the public understanding of what it is doing and 
what the cost is going to be in settling these treaties?
<P>
	My colleague from Fraser Valley East has also asked the 
department for a study it did on the Sto:lo and their budget. He still 
has not been able to get that. There was a May report, again 
commissioned by the department. We are waiting for action on 
that. It is yet to happen. This report was delivered last December 
and we are still waiting.
<P>
	As I said, the department spends about $1.2 billion a year. There 
is no denying that the problems it faces are complex. Unfortunately 
the department has not measured up to the job. Time is running out 
for Parliament to examine the workings of this department and yet 
examine it must.
<P>
	Last fall a federal court judge accused the department of a litany 
of corrupt behaviour which included vote rigging and sham 
consultative process. This had reference to dealing with the 
establishment of a halibut quota system on the west coast.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	The federal court judge noted: ``A DFO official's unwillingness 
to face the obvious meaning of his own words caused the court to 
doubt the reliability of the evidence offered in defence of the 
minister's, DFO's, and his own position''. This is a tremendous 
indictment of the department. The judge went on to say: ``Rules 
were simply broken because it was necessary to do so to reach the 
planned objective''.
<P>
	The minister has refused to this point to dissociate himself from 
the action of the official named by the court.
<P>
	If the federal court of Canada can come down with an indictment 
of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans with the intensity it did 
last fall, why should I or why should the Canadian public have any 
confidence in the ability of this department to manage this huge 
budget? It is an issue that needs to be addressed and addressed 
quickly by this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found 
the member's speech very interesting because it dealt with an area 
of waste in the budget where there seems to be no control and no 
accountability, and the auditor general is very concerned about 
spending in the whole range of activities of the Indian affairs 
department.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member about fishing rights and the cost 
of those exercises, those legal situations that are occurring on the 
Fraser River now. I realize he may not be able to speak in much 
detail about cases. Has he any idea of the cost to Canadian 
taxpayers for the constant intervention of officials of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans in enforcing what are probably 
illegal regulations that give fishing rights to a specific group over 
another group? Yet these officials will keep spending taxpayers' 
money and forcing regulations that could be illegal and then not 
carrying them through to get a court ruling to actually prove 
whether they are legal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for the question. 
The cost to the Canadian taxpayer for these court cases has been 
absolutely remarkable. We know that just the operation of this 
fishery which is operating beyond the law with the consent of the 
minister has cost Canadian taxpayers well over $100 million in the 
last few years.
<P>
	The actual legal costs to the government I cannot recall at the 
moment. I do know that industry has spent over $1 million of its 
own money representing itself in an intervener status in pursuing 
these cases through to the Supreme Court of Canada. That is a huge 
amount of money.
<P>
	What is most serious about it is in focusing its energies on this 
issue, the department is not able to manage the resource for other 
fisheries. I have an example at hand here right now which we are 
currently petitioning the minister about. That has to do with the 
eulachon fishery in the Fraser River. It is a small fishery. There are 
probably only 25 to 35 participants in it in any one year. This year 
there were 20 tonnes allocated to that eulachon fishery on the 
Fraser River.
<P>
	Because the department could not get a management plan in 
place to operate this fishery it shut it down this year. It shut it down 
in spite of the fact that the participants committed that they would 
pay for an  observer to monitor the fishery so that it would not go 
over the total allowable catch and so that it would not cost the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9317"> 9317 </A></B>
<P>
department any money. Yet the department has refused. It has shut 
down that small fishery this year and said it cannot fish because the 
government cannot get a management plan in place.
<P>
	How outrageous is that? It is like saying to a farmer ``you cannot 
plant your crops because there may be a snowstorm in the Fraser 
Canyon that is going to prevent the trains from getting to the 
coast''. It is absolutely outrageous. Yet this is the kind of thing that 
goes on in this department time after time. Time permitting, I could 
give the House example after example just as outrageous as this 
one.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask my hon. colleague to explain an area that he probably 
has not touched on directly, but I think ties into the categories of 
fisheries which have apparently been created.
<P>
	I wonder whether within this mismanagement, this lack of 
planning, there is some sort of perpetuation of inequality among 
Canadians, of one group of Canadians getting one kind of 
advantage at the expense of others.
<P>
	In the time that is left, I wonder if the member could talk about 
that a little bit because I think equality before the law is a very 
significant issue. It attacks the very unity of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, no doubt the inequality promoted 
by the aboriginal fishing strategy has driven wedges between 
communities which have been able to get along for the last 100 
years. There was harmony, people worked and played together and 
now wedges have been driven between these communities.
<P>
	The industry has no faith in the department. In fact, it has been 
treated better by the courts than by DFO in the past. Many in the 
industry say it is preferable to litigate because the courts hear and 
take into account the arguments of non-aboriginals when dealing 
with the issue, something the department has refused to do.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 
18, my hon. colleague, the Minister of Finance, presented the 
government's 1997 budget, its fourth budget. I am pleased to speak 
on this budget. I will be sharing my time with the member of 
Parliament from Erie, Ontario.
<P>
	It is a budget for all Canadians. It is a budget that works. It is a 
budget that stays the course. It stays the course in a manner that is 
seeing the deficit fall, but remains true to the ideals that Canadians 
hold dear. Through this budget the government has not only 
ensured but strengthened the social safety net for this generation of 
Canadians and for generations of Canadians to come.
<P>
	The 1997 budget proposes selective tax cuts for low income 
families, charities, the disabled, students and workers pursuing 
higher education, and for parents saving for their children's future 
educations. But it is not yet feasible to consider a broad based tax 
cut. When the government does so, it will ensure that a tax cut is 
affordable and sustainable. Broad based tax cuts would be too 
costly at this time. They would require additional spending cuts or 
an increase in the deficit. Neither of these options are acceptable to 
the government.
<P>
	The budget continues on the course of putting Canada's finances 
in order in a manner that is measured, deliberate and responsible. 
This is an approach that is giving Canadians control of their own 
finances.
<P>
	Financial requirements will be eliminated by 1998-99. This 
means that the government will not have to borrow any new money 
from financial markets that year for the first time in 19 years. We 
are restoring self-sufficiency.
<P>
	Keeping inflation low and progress in deficit reduction have 
paved the way for dramatic declines in Canada's interest rates. In 
the past three years Canadian short term rates have fallen close to 
5.5 percentage points, the lowest levels in close to 35 years.
<P>
	By creating a favourable economic environment, the 
government has enabled Canadians to save thousands of dollars a 
year on their mortgage payments and the benefits to small business 
have been even more dramatic. Let me give an example. On a $1 
million loan with a 10-year amortization and monthly payments, a 
small business would save approximately $33,395 over 
comparable payments in 1995.
<P>
	It is true that lower interest rates take time to stimulate the 
economy. However, developments in late 1996 show that the lower 
interest rates are beginning to stimulate growth. Let me give two 
examples. Housing sales soared in late 1996, stimulating strong 
gains in new home construction. This is very evident in the riding 
of Nepean. Sales of consumer goods have risen strongly, led by 
motor vehicle sales.
<P>
	As demand has grown, so too has job creation. In the last five 
months 61,000 jobs have been created by the private sector, the 
majority of which are full time jobs.
<P>
	The government is not alone in its optimism. It is shared by 
consumer, by businesses and by private forecasters alike. 
Consumer confidence has risen for four quarters in succession. 
Business confidence is at a record level with more businesses than 
ever believing that, now is a good time to invest.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	Canadian forecasters expect the economy to grow by 3.3 per cent 
in 1997 and by nearly 3 per cent in 1998. They expect the economy 
to create between 300,000 and 350,000 jobs during 1997 with 
similar results in 1998. That is good news. Even international 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9318"> 9318 </A></B>
<P>
forecasters are  impressed with Canada's achievements. The OECD 
expects Canada and the U.K. to lead the G7 nations in growth for 
1997 and it expects Canada alone to lead the G7 in job creation this 
year. The IMF also paints a rosy picture of Canada's economic 
outlook.
<P>
	While the budget is helping to create a climate for long term jobs 
and growth, the government is also investing in immediate job 
creation, bridging the gap to the stronger growth that will result 
from lower interest rates. Through the Canadian infrastructure 
works program, the government has provided $2 billion in 
partnership with municipalities and provinces for $6 billion worth 
of investment in 12,000 different projects right across the country.
<P>
	In the 1997 budget the government proposes to increase this 
commitment by an additional $425 million. When leveraged with 
municipal and provincial contributions, this could translate into 
approximately $1.8 billion worth of new investment and hence new 
jobs.
<P>
	To further stimulate job growth, EI premium rates will be 
reduced by another 10 cents on January 1, 1998 and the new hires 
program will completely eliminate EI premiums this year for 
additional employees hired by almost 900,000 eligible small 
businesses. This reduction of payroll taxes will save both 
employers and employees, including those in Nepean, $1.7 billion 
in 1997. That is a very significant amount.
<P>
	The budget invests in both the construction sector and needy 
households through a $50 million extension of the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program.
<P>
	Tourism will get a further economic shot in the arm with a $15 
million injection to the Canadian Tourism Commission. And $50 
million to the Business Development Bank will help finance the 
private sector tourism infrastructure.
<P>
	Neither is rural business forgotten. The 1997 budget provides 
$50 million to the Farm Credit Corporation to expand its capacity 
to support rural economic growth and diversification. Through the 
community access program, rural small businesses are being 
helped to plug into the Internet to the tune of $30 million over three 
years.
<P>
	Another important initiative in the budget is the reduction of the 
paper burden for small business. Eligible businesses will be able to 
file quarterly rather than monthly. Then there are the budget 
measures that invest in long term job creation and growth. An 
important component of this long term strategy is the government's 
support for Canadian youth and for education and skills training.
<P>
	In addition to the youth employment strategy, the funds for 
which were provided in the 1996 budget, federal assistance for 
higher education and skills enhancement will be enriched by $137 
million in 1998-99. This allotment will grow to $275 million  
annually when the full impact of these measures come into effect.
<P>
	Through the proposed education credit, the tuition credit and the 
carry forward of the unused portion of credits, the government has 
demonstrated its commitment to education. Students who need 
help repaying their loans will have their deferral period extended 
from 18 to 30 months. The loan repayment schedule will be tied 
directly to income in co-operation with interested provinces, 
lenders and other groups. The registered education savings plan 
contribution limit will double, and parents will be able to transfer 
unused RESP income into their RRSPs if their children do not 
pursue higher education.
<P>
	No long term growth strategy would be complete without 
investment in innovation. Again, the 1997 budget proposes the 
creation of the Canada Foundation for Innovation. One of the main 
budget initiatives, the foundation will help to modernize research 
infrastructure at Canadian post-secondary institutions and research 
hospitals in health, environment, science and engineering.
<P>
	The foundation will help Canadians be at the leading edge of 
research and technology developments which keep our industries 
competitive and create the jobs of tomorrow. It will encourage the 
best and brightest Canadian researchers to stay in Canada. It will 
assist in generating the kind of technology oriented graduates the 
future workforce will require. With its vibrant high tech sector, 
benefits such as these will be invaluable to the Nepean high tech 
community. The foundation will develop partnerships among 
educational institutions, research hospitals, business and non-profit 
sectors, individual Canadians and the provinces which could 
trigger approximately $2 billion worth of spending in research 
infrastructure.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	These initiatives are all important for the creation of jobs and 
growth. However, if we lost our compassion in the process it would 
not be worth the price. I want to stress that the government has not 
lost its compassion in its fight to bring down the deficit. That is 
evident in the budget proposals that sustain and strengthen the 
social safety net. Included among these measures is $300 million 
which will be spent over three years to improve the delivery of 
health services to Canadians.
<P>
	These announcements address a number of recommendations 
made in the report by the National Forum on Health. That includes 
$150 million for a health transition fund to investigate new and 
better approaches to providing health care, $50 million allotted 
over three years for the Canada health information system and 
$100 million over three years in additional funding to the 
community action program for children and the Canada prenatal 
nutritional program.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9319"> 9319 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government is also providing support for medicare 
and other social programs through the Canada health and social 
transfer.
<P>
	While health is of prime importance, so too is the need to ensure 
our children's successful passage into adulthood. That is why the 
budget proposal for a national child benefit system is a major step 
forward.
<P>
	Under the national child benefit system, the federal government 
will introduce an enriched Canada child tax benefit, while the 
provinces and territories will redirect some of their spending into 
improved services and benefits for low income working families. 
The proposal includes a two-step enrichment of the current child 
tax benefit to create a new $6 billion Canada child tax benefit by 
July 1998.
<P>
	Canadians with disabilities have also been addressed by the 
budget. As well, charities have not been ignored.
<P>
	In conclusion, we are staying the course on deficit reduction. We 
are investing in short term and long term strategies to stimulate job 
creation and growth.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am terribly sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member, but her time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member talked about compassion and how wonderful the budget 
was because it had gone slow. I wonder if the member recognizes 
that presently the debt is $600 billion and the interest payment on 
that debt is about $50 billion, give or take, per year at present 
interest rates. If the interest rates go up by 1 per cent it will add $6 
billion a year, 2 per cent will add $12 billion and 3 per cent will add 
$18 billion.
<P>
	How compassionate will her go slow budget look when interest 
rates rise 3 per cent and we have to slash $18 billion more from 
social programs because her government went too slow?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously the Reform member was 
not listening to my speech. We are a very compassionate 
government. We have dealt with all of these programs in a most 
compassionate way.
<P>
	The deficit has to be reduced first. Once it is reduced then we can 
start on the debt. Until we get the annual operating budget in order, 
there is no way we can start on the annual debt.
<P>
	He is quite correct in stating that if interest rates rise and if 
inflation rises, it would certainly hurt our ability to reduce our 
indebtedness, both through the annual operating deficit and the 
debt.
<P>
	We are quite confident that we have our house in order. Interest 
rates are down and inflation is under control. Obviously, we are at 
the mercy of international markets. We hope that what he says will 
not happen. I really see it as being hypothetical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to congratulate the hon. member for her fine approach to the 
budget and the informative speech which she gave.
<P>
	I wonder if she could elaborate a little on measures for the 
disabled which are in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for giving 
me the opportunity to speak on persons with disabilities as I did not 
have time to do it in my speech. The proposed measures in the 
budget will allocate $230 million over three years to assist the 
disabled.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The list of expenses eligible for the medical expense credit will 
be broadened. We will eliminate the $5,000 limit on the deduction 
for attendant care expenses for disabled earners. Audiologists will 
be allowed to certify eligibility for the disability tax credit.
<P>
	The definition of a preferred beneficiary of a trust will be 
broadened to include adults who are dependent on others because 
of mental or physical infirmity. The customs tariff will be changed 
to provide duty free entry for goods designed for use in this area. I 
could go on and on.

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
where are the priorities of the federal government? Since 1994 the 
Liberals chose to hack, gut and gouge health care to the tune of 
$3.6 billion. The effects of this slash and burn policy have been 
devastating.
<P>
	In Quesnel and district there are only 44 hospital beds for a 
population of 25,000 and the sick and suffering are being cared for 
in the hallways. Unfortunately the  Liberals do not seem to care.

While people were hurting they chose to give $221,500 to the

people were hurting they chose to give thousands of dollars to build 
golf courses, ski hills and club houses.
<P>
	Canadians believe health care and human life are more important 
than new golf courses and canoe championships. That is why 
Reform will reinvest $4 billion into health care and education. We 
will show compassion to the suffering and we will make the needs

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is 
the international day for the elimination of racial discrimination. 
The offhand comments about gender equality in the House of 
Commons made last night at a Reform fund raiser is an example of 
the type of misinformation and lack of sensitivity that can lead to 
discrimination, racial or otherwise.
<P>
	As a legislator and as a woman I take offence at the Reform 
member for Beaver River joking about gender equality in the 
House of Commons, that it would spell trouble at certain times of 
the month. She said: ``What would happen if we were all PMSed 
the same week''? I personally had a hot flash when I read this 
report and it was not hormonally induced.
<P>
	Women definitely have a place in the House. We work hard and 
effectively every day of the month for the betterment of our 
legislature, our constituencies and society.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
United States would adapt with little disruption to having a 
sovereign Quebec as a neighbour. This is one of the findings of a 
study carried out by David Jones, who was until just recently a 
senior policy adviser at the U.S. embassy in Ottawa.
<P>
	In his analysis, Mr. Jones also claims that the U.S. anxiety about 
Quebec's sovereignty is an exaggeration and a thing of the past. For 
example, a sovereign Quebec would pose no threat to American 
security, since it would be a democratic state with a sound 
economy. Moreover, a sovereign Quebec would become the fifth or 
sixth trade partner of the U.S.; politically, socially and 
economically, it would look like Austria, Belgium or the Czech 
Republic.
<P>
	According to this expert on Canadian affairs, it is time the U.S. 
got used to the idea of Quebec becoming sovereign. Should it 
happen, the U.S. government should make its own assessment of 
the will expressed by Quebecers instead of relying on advice from 
Ottawa. This certainly bodes well for the future.

	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Thursday 
evening the member for Beaver River attacked the Prime 
Minister's efforts to promote gender equality in the House. 
Women, she declared, are biologically disqualified from achieving 
political equality in the country. She cheapened the role of our 
Liberal female candidates by calling them ``poor girls at a grade 
eight sock hop waiting to be asked to dance''.
<P>
	Liberal candidate, Elinor Kaplan, is no poor grade eight girl at a 
sock hop. She was dancing in public life  long before the member 
for Beaver River learned to creep. In the 1970s Elinor Kaplan 
founded the North York Business Association. In the 1980s she 
chaired the Management Board of Cabinet in Ontario. In the 1990s 
she was deputy house leader and chief opposition whip in the 
Ontario legislature.
<P>
	In 1997 she will become a member of the House of Commons, 
one of dozens of new female members of Parliament who benefit 
from our Prime Minister's efforts to achieve a full role for women 
in Canadian public life.

	This Reform Party member referred to women candidates 
appointed by the Prime Minister as ``poor girls''. This member also 
likened these candidates to ``girls at a grade eight sock hop'' 
hoping ``if I just stand here he will come and ask me to dance''. 
This is insulting and offensive not only to women candidates but to 
every woman in Canada.
<P>
	My colleague from Saskatoon-Humboldt has distinguished 
herself as an MP. Before her appointment as a candidate in 1993 
she served her community as a lawyer, a business woman and

How will we get to the truth when Liberal and Tory politicians will

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the Liberal member for 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle shamelessly accused, in this House, 
the Quebec government of blocking the development of Mirabel 
airport.
<P>
	The fact is that the two airports serving Montreal are federal 
facilities, that ADM was created by the federal government, and 
that all the bad decisions which have undermined Montreal's 
potential in the air transportation sector were taken by the federal 
government itself. The Viau ruling made on February 12 confirms 
that the federal government is ultimately responsible for the 
decision regarding the future of Dorval and Mirabel airports.
<P>
	If, like me, the hon. member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle 
does believe in developing Mirabel airport, he should join with 
Bloc Quebecois members in asking that public hearings be held 
soon, in order to find the best possible solution to this issue, after

government, particularly under the Liberals.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, by refusing to reply to the Bloc Quebecois' 
questions, the Minister of Canadian Heritage confirmed that the 
government, through Option Canada, paid out money that was 
spent during the referendum campaign without ever being 
included, however, in the referendum expenses of the no 
committee.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. The mandate of 
Option Canada, this phantom organization to promote Canadian 
unity, is the promotion of national unity by all means, legal, 
political and other.
<P>
	I have no trouble understanding what the words ``political'' and 
``legal'' mean, but I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to 
explain to me what means other than legal and political ones are at 
our disposal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are speaking today 
about the means available to people. We know that on September 
12 Quebec Treasury Board President, Pauline Maurois, announced 
that Quebec's unionized workers were going to be receiving an 
additional $1 million from the government by 1998.
<P>
	Going into the referendum campaign, the chief negotiator for the 
yes side promised unions a $1 million increase, but today he hits 
them with special legislation forcing them to accept a 6 per cent 
cut.
<P>
	So, if the topic is morality and legality, we have to ask ourselves: 
Who is telling the truth about the unionized workers in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B>Mr. Speaker, it is quite discouraging to see how the Deputy Prime 
Minister performs in the House.
<P>
	What goes on within the Government of Quebec is the 
Government of Quebec's business. If, today, the Government of 
Quebec is unable to respect its agreement to increase salaries by 1 
per cent, it is because of her government, which slashed provincial 
transfer payments. Let us not confuse matters.
<P>
	I return to my topic, which she finds very upsetting. Peter White, 
the president of the Council for Canadian Unity, told <I>The Gazette</I> 
that Option Canada had been set up specifically to collect funds for 
provincial and federal Liberals for the referendum campaign.
<P>
	In response to this statement, the Labour Minister could think of 
nothing better to say than that Peter White had already said so 
many idiotic things in his life that one more would not make any 
difference.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	So who can we believe, the chief organizer of the Liberal Party 
of Canada, who should know what the money paid to Option 
Canada was used for, or the president of the Council for Canadian 
Unity, to whom Option Canada reported?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are talking about 
expenditures. I have with me the Government of Quebec's order in 
council.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> That is not the question.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> We have read in <I>Le Soleil</I> that the Government of 
Quebec, not the Liberal Party, spent $83 million on referendum 
activities. With $83 million, the government could have hired 
1,769 more police officers. It could have hired 2,098 additional 
nurses or another 2,621 teachers.
<P>
	The PQ government made its choice. It wanted to spend money 
on the referendum rather than on keeping its promises to Quebec's 
unionized workers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B>Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I would like to make a 
suggestion to the Deputy Prime Minister: that she quit running in 
Hamilton East, resign one more time, run for the Liberal Party in 
Quebec and tackle Mr. Bouchard in the National Assembly. We 
have heard enough from her about Quebec. This is Canada here.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9324"> 9324 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata): </B>I will ask her a 
third question regarding the topic that concerns us and which is 
seriously worrying Canadians. I ask her to listen attentively. This 
time, I am giving her a chance to reply on topic. I would like her 
to consult the right pages among those prepared for her by her 
assistants.
<P>
	We learned this morning that Quebec's chief electoral officer 
wanted to hold an inquiry into this matter, which is of great concern 
to him. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, who boasts that her 
government is completely honest and transparent, whether she is 
prepared to tell us in the House this morning that she will 
co-operate with Quebec's chief electoral officer to get to the 
bottom of this diversion of close to $5 million of taxpayers' 
money?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course I will 
co-operate with the elections commission in any kind of 
investigation. But I would also have to underline that if Mr. Coté is 
really interested in getting to the facts surrounding the referendum, 
when he begins his investigation I would also ask him to 
investigate the secret plan of Jacques Parizeau which was revealed 
in <I>Le Soleil</I> of November 4, 1995: ``Parizeau admitted that he had a 
special slush fund of billions of dollars that he was going to use to 
defend the Canadian dollar against a plunge''.
<P>
	I would also ask Mr. Coté to investigate the fake promise given 
by the the chief negotiator of the yes side to the unions. On the eve 
of the referendum he promised them a million dollars and today we 
saw what the promise meant. It meant zero.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the president of the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadienne du Canada challenged the statement by 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage that the objective of the 
assistance program for minority language groups was to promote 
Canada. The government's documentation on the various programs 
available to official language minority groups does not, in fact, 
ever mention this objective.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage realize that, by 
declaring that the objective of the official languages program is to 
promote Canada, she is attacking the political independence of all 
official language minority groups in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, those of us on this side do 
not need any lectures from someone born in Ontario, who learned 
his French in Penetanguishene, and who now claims that 
francophones  outside Quebec are nothing more than paraplegics in 
wheelchairs.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	His policy is to separate Quebec from the rest of Canada, and to 
dump the million francophones in the rest of the country. We are 
never going to just dump one million francophones, who are 
counting on us and who can count on a Canadian government that 
believes in two peoples and two official languages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when Heritage Canada chopped subsidies to official language 
minority groups, the government claimed it had no choice but to do 
so. Today, we learn that the government has used that money for 
propaganda purposes.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Canadian Heritage make a commitment to 
reimburse the official language minority groups for the losses they 
have incurred?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat this in 
English so the member for Quebec East, who learned to speak 
French in Penetanguishene-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-who was so fond of the city of his birth that he even ran for 
mayor of Penetanguishene.
<P>
	Having been born in Penetanguishene, having learned his 
english in Ontario, he now is calling the Franco-Ontarians 
paraplegics in wheelchairs, which we are not. If we are to have two 
official languages, if we believe in two official languages, we need 
to have a country that does not believe in separatism.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way is not interested in official 
languages, is not interested in minorities. He wants to create a 
country in which there is but one official language. He wants to 
dump all of the minorities throughout Canada.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after months of trying to 
defend the shutting down of the Somalia inquiry and letting a 
political cover-up go unpunished, the Liberal government has 
finally admitted it was wrong. Unfortunately, instead of letting the 
inquiry commissioners get at the truth, the Liberals are trying to 
orchestrate a whitewash in the Senate.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of National Defence. Since the 
government now believes that the minister was wrong, why will it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9325"> 9325 </A></B>
<P>
not simply let the inquiry fulfil its  mandate instead of trying to 
cover up the cover-up in the Senate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the 
Canadian forces look forward to an unequivocal statement from the 
Reform Party that Reformers believe the Somalia commission of 
inquiry should continue indefinitely. I hope at some point 
Reformers will come clean with the Canadian people and say 
without equivocation that they want the ticker to keep running.
<P>
	Over $3 million has now been spent on lawyer fees and $15 
million to $25 million, depending on how we calculate it, has been 
spent on the commission of inquiry.
<P>
	With all due respect to the hon. member, the government has 
decided that after three extensions the Somalia commission of 
inquiry should report by the end of June.
<P>
	The hon. member should respect the fact that this is a 
parliamentary system and the Senate is allowed to conduct its 
business as it thinks appropriate, as is the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps it would be better 
if the minister would come clean.
<P>
	When it comes to covering up its nasty messes this government 
is as hapless as a cat on a concrete driveway.
<P>
	One member of the cabinet, the defence minister, thinks that 
there was no political cover-up. Another member of cabinet, 
Senator Fairbairn, thinks there was a political cover-up and wants it 
investigated.
<P>
	Who is speaking for the government? Do the Liberals think there 
was a political cover-up or do they think there was not a political 
cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
obvious differences, and the member has recognized it, is that 
Liberals are able to think, unlike the hon. member and members of 
his party.
<P>
	The fact remains that if Reformers believe the Somalia 
commission of inquiry should continue indefinitely, in other words, 
never mind the cover-up or the whitewash, but a carte blanche, then 
that is what they should say.
<P>
	With respect to the inquiry being terminated at the end of June, 
everyone knows it has gone on now for over two years. It has heard 
hundreds of witnesses. It has reviewed hundreds of thousands of 
pages of documents. I think Canadians look forward to the report, 
the conclusions and the recommendations of the Somalia 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	With respect to what happens in the Senate, the hon. member 
should respect that the question of looking into  incidents 
surrounding the affair in Somalia was raised by a Conservative 
member of the Senate several weeks ago. Subsequent to a number 
of discussions it was determined unanimously in the Senate, as I 
understand it, that it should look into the Somalia situation. It has a 
right to do that. Constitutionally we are operating as two separate 
House, the Senate and the House of Commons. It has every right to 
look into whatever it wishes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the hon. minister 
has just implied that he has such a magnificent intellect I want to 
draw him a little picture.
<P>
	The government shut down an independent inquiry that was to 
investigate its political friends and buddies. Then it replaced it with 
partisan Liberal and Tory senators who will try to whitewash a 
political cover-up that occurred under Liberal and Tory 
governments. I hope the hon. minister got that.
<P>
	Instead of trying to throw up a political smoke screen, why does 
the government not simply let the independent inquiry get to the 
bottom of a murder and a cover-up and stop these political 
shenanigans?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member and his party over the last few months have demonstrated 
exactly what they think of the Canadian forces. They have not told 
us what they believe should be done for the Canadian forces. They 
have made absolutely no attempt to provide any input into the very 
thorough review we have made of the Canadian forces, the military 
justice system, the military police, all the questions dealing with 
the selection and promotion of people in the Canadian military 
organization.
<P>
	All Reformers have been able to do so far to help the Canadian 
forces is insist that the Somalia commission of inquiry continue for 
as long as they feel is appropriate; it could be a year, two years or 
three years. Reformers might be interested in history but we are 
interested in getting things done. If they have the interest of the 
Canadian forces at heart, they should be here next Tuesday when I 
will report to the Canadian people and to the Prime Minister on 
what the Liberal government believes should be done for the 
Canadian forces.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a press release dated February 21, 1997, the Quebec 
minister of finance made the following comments, and I quote: ``If 
the same 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9326"> 9326 </A></B>
<P>
criterion is applied to Quebec's tax structure before harmonization 
and after total harmonization, Quebec's loss of revenue amounts in 
fact to nearly 20 per cent''. If there is one person in a position to 
know the cost of harmonizing the  GST and the QST in Quebec it is 
the Quebec minister of finance.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How can the Minister 
of Finance claim that Quebec officials are unable to establish the 
true cost of harmonizing and why does he continue to insinuate that 
minister Landry is lying to the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if 
I may cite the figures for Quebec sales tax revenues, which in fact 
come from the Government of Quebec, they reveal that, compared 
to the year preceding harmonization, Quebec's revenues in 1990-91 
increased by $240 million. The next year, they increased by $1 
billion; the year after that, by $888 million; the next year, by $465 
million; the following year, $319 million and, finally by $504 
million.
<P>
	Since Quebec's decision to harmonize, its revenues have 
increased by $3.4 billion, that is, Quebec has not lost money, it has 
made money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the minister is not saying is that, in the calculations 
to establish Quebec's entitlement to compensation, the Minister of 
Finance overestimates Quebec's revenues from the harmonized 
GST and QST by $575 million a year.
<P>
	Second, he is not saying that to harmonize the QST with the GST 
Quebec had to cut revenues from other taxes-on tobacco and 
gasoline, for example-by $355 million. Finally, he is not saying 
that, to harmonize the GST and the QST, the Government of 
Quebec had to increase the rate of taxation on corporate profits by 
67 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	In other words, if Quebec had been offered the same conditions 
as the maritimes, Mr. McKenna would not be on the roam so 
detestably giving Quebec businesses unfair competition.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance finally recognize that Quebec's 
assessment are the right ones and that he must pay the Government 
of Quebec compensation of $2 billion, under the same 
harmonization and compensation criteria used for the maritimes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member is an economist, an economist of the right in his 
field, he should know that the figures I have just given are those of 
the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member is quoting ministers of finance, so perhaps I 
could quote the former minister of finance, André Bourbeau-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> An incompetent. He put Quebec in the hole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> -and I quote: ``Nevertheless, 
on the very face of them, the figures published by the Government 
of Quebec totally contradict what the current minister of finance in 
Quebec is saying. He cannot prove that the Government of Quebec 
lost revenues with this tax. He cannot claim reimbursement from 
the federal government of money he claims to have lost, since the 
Government of Quebec's own figures prove that it has not lost 
anything''.

we appreciate that the finance minister pointed out the gaping holes 
in the Tory platform yesterday and that their numbers do not add 
up, out of fairness I think he should point out that his own numbers 
do not add up.
<P>
	Somehow he missed the fact that in 1995 he said in his budget 
speech that he was going to cut departmental spending by 19 per 
cent. He said these are not going to be phoney cuts, they are going 
to be real cuts. That is in the budget speech. Today departmental 
spending has fallen only 8.3 per cent. That is a $5 billion

<P>
	Why is the minister failing to meet his spending reduction 
targets in departmental spending just like Michael Wilson?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President

and every year we have met our targets. As a matter of fact, the 
opposition keeps complaining because the minister has bettered his 
targets.
<P>
	We have not reached the end of the fiscal year and this 
government has met its targets each year. The Reform Party is 
comparing apples and oranges. Our statistics show 18 per cent with 
program review saving targets that were identified in the 1995-96 
budgets. Each one met its target. The required reductions were 
made in departments and the agency budgets in the time that they 
were announced. Planned program spending is on track in all years.

down to $105.8 billion.

surprised that we do not have the finance minister on his feet. This 
is an issue that goes right to the credibility of the government's 
numbers.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget speech the Liberals said departmental 
spending will fall 19 per cent. They did not say anything about

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is time to leave demagoguery aside and to set the record 
straight once and for all.
<P>
	The hon. member for Québec-Est made an analogy and said that 
comparing the situation of anglophones in Quebec to that of 
francophone minorities in Canada was like comparing a Cadillac to 
a wheelchair. This analogy is not meant to be derogatory to 
paraplegics. There comes a point where we must leave 
grandstanding aside and deal with the real issues.
<P>
	The President of the Fédération des communautés francophones 
et acadienne, Jacques Michaud, said he did not want their 
organizations to be used to promote Canadian unity. On the other 
hand, the federation is quite prepared to protect francophone and 
Acadian community groups.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	In light of this, could the minister tell us whether her statement 
means that, in the future, these groups will have to pursue the 
government's political objectives on national unity, instead of 
promoting the rights of official language minorities in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to know 
what the member from Témiscouata thinks of the comments made 
by the member for Québec-Est. How would you like to be called a 
paraplegic in a wheelchair?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is an insult to all Franco-Ontarians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> These are the words of the member for Québec-Est, 
who himself learned to speak French fairly well in 
Penetanguishene, Ontario.
<P>
	That being said, it is obvious that if Canada did not exist, there 
would be no official languages policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope the minister can understand the analogy made by 
the hon. member for Québec-Est, because I am sure Canadians and 
Quebecers can.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that the $4.5 million given to the 
Council for Canadian Unity and the $4.8 million  given to Option 
Canada, which were diverted from the budget earmarked for 
official language minority communities in Canada, will be returned 
to these minorities? This amounts to 22 per cent of the money set 
aside for minorities. Will the minister give back to official 
language minorities what she fraudulently took from them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to point out the 
lack of logic in the member's question. He claims the Government 
of Canada has no interest in having a country. How can he claim 
there will be two official languages if this country ceases to exist? 
The Government of Canada obviously cares about this issue, 
considering that, yesterday, it gave an $8 million subsidy to 
Collège Boréal, in Sudbury.
<P>
	Similarly, if we support the efforts of those who are fighting to 
save the Montfort hospital, it is because we believe in the million 
francophones living outside Quebec, right across Canada.
<P>
	What is so pitiful is that the same member of Parliament who 
compared francophones to paraplegics in wheelchairs now claims 
to be defending their rights, which is absolutely untrue. The only 
thing he is defending is the separatist cause, which would deprive 
francophones outside Quebec of their right to live in a truly 
bilingual country.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first

up a surplus of $6.1 billion. That could actually hit a surplus of $7.5 
billion by the end of the fiscal year.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Is there no limit to 
the tax he will place on Canadian jobs in order for him to make his 
deficit numbers look good?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we took office unemployment insurance premiums were 
scheduled to rise to $3.30. We stopped that.
<P>
	Every year since then we have reduced the unemployment 
insurance rate. In the last budget we announced that at the end of 
this year it would be at $2.80. In the last three years of the Tory 
regime they raised the unemployment insurance premiums every 
year. In the first three years we have been in office, we have 
dropped the premiums every year.
<P>
	This year there is going to be a saving to Canadian workers and 
companies of $1.7 billion as a result of the actions taken by the 
government. That demonstrates tax reductions.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
minister has built up a surplus in the EI fund like we have never 
seen before. The surplus this year amounts to a $500 tax on every 
job in the country. The minister has the gall to stand up in the 
House and say that he has not raised taxes. That is a disgrace.
<P>
	The minister said that payroll taxes are a cancer on jobs. Will he 
announce a cut in employment insurance premiums to give the 
unemployed some hope that there will be a job created for them?
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member certainly has a strange way of looking at what is a 
premium increase or a premium decrease.
<P>
	When we took office premiums were roughly $3.07 going to 
$3.30. We stopped that. The next year we brought premiums down 
to $3.00, then down to $2.90 and then down to $2.80. Those are not 
increases, those are decreases.
<P>
	We have stated as a government that it is our intention to 
continue to bring those premiums down. We will do this 
responsibly, not in the way the leader of the Reform Party stated the 
other day, that there would be a massive cut.
<P>
	Virtually every commentator has said that if there was a 
recession, the first thing a Tory government would have to do 
would be to hike those premiums, which was exactly what it did in 
1989 and 1990. This is how the Tories put us into a terrible 
recession.
<P>

are the kissing cousins of Reformers, on the extreme right.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The federal government's financial participation in the 
agricultural day haul transportation assistance program officially 
ends on March 31 in Quebec. This program gives labourers living 
in the city access to farm jobs they could not get if it were not for 
organised transit between urban areas and rural areas.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that, by refusing to provide the $350,000 
required to maintain this program, he is directly responsible for the 
loss of thousands of jobs for seasonal agricultural workers and that 
the resulting social costs will be much higher than the savings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate  the hon. member's 
concern for this program, which was indeed very useful to many 
seasonal workers. As you know, in any program review, hard 
choices have to be made sometimes. Some of the decisions we have 
made are not the ones we wish we could have made.
<P>
	Now, of course, we must look at what other programs and active 
employment measures are available to the workers to make their 
access to the labour market easier. I think that, on the whole, 
government policy and programs are quite satisfactory.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> That is right, Mr. Speaker. The 
minister is replacing measures that worked well by ones he is 
unsure of.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that, by refusing to continue funding 
this program in the future, he will promote the hiring of foreign 
labour at the expense of thousands of workers in Quebec and 
Canada who will be denied the seasonal jobs available?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

confirms what the Government of Canada has been saying all

	We presented a comprehensive strategy on combating tobacco 
use and its very serious and negative health impacts. It is a bad 
admission to make, but we are relieved that there is an indication,

	Recently, a laundry in my riding bid for a contract to service 
hospitals in Granby and Brome-Missisquoi. They lost to 
CORCAN, which is connected to the Laval correctional centre and 
employs people being reintegrated into the work force. The private 
company, Buanderie Shefford, therefore lost a contract because it 
was competing with a company funded in large part by the 
taxpayers, and therefore able to offer a better price.
<P>

unfair competition on the part of the federal administration, taking 
major contracts away from companies which are at least as 
competitive as Corrections Canada?

led to the creation of these licences?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture

the Supreme Court clearly established that the nation in question 
had the right to commercial fishing and it was based on historical 
facts.
<P>

understanding, to an agreement with the nation in question 
whereby DFO and the Heiltsuk tribal council have agreed to 
harvest 100 tonnes of unallocated herring available in area eight for 
1997, in three open pond licences. The 100 tonnes of unallocated 
herring now being allocated have a roe content of lesser quality 
which means, therefore, it is of lesser interest to the commercial 
fishermen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no 
unallocated herring in B.C.
<P>
	After hearing petitions from all parties, the Supreme Court 
recommended a judicial process to establish the limits of the 
Heiltsuk right. Why has the minister sought to subvert the 
judicially established process to develop constitutional law on the 
issue of native fishing rights, given that the fishing industry has 
spent millions of dollars on litigation to defend their rights and to 
establish sound, legal principles on which to allocate the fisheries 
resource.
<P>
	Why has the minister replaced the law book with the red book?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture

the privilege to present petitions containing hundreds of signatures 
from residents of Saskatchewan and Alberta who wish to draw to 
the attention of the House that as deeply concerned citizens, they 
believe the provocation defence as it is currently used in wife

the criminal trial from the behaviour of the accused and his 
intention to murder to the behaviour of the victim.

the petitioners request that Parliament enact legislation to amend 
the Criminal Code to allow for the post-sentence supervision 
and/or detention of those who have been convicted of sex offences 
involving children or of serious personal offences.
<P>
	They ask that we establish a procedure of public notification of 
such offenders being released, that we establish a central registry

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour 
and pleasure to address the House this afternoon on the fourth 
budget of our mandate.
<P>
	As with the case of our first three budgets, the good news 
continues. The fourth Liberal budget continues the plan of 
competent fiscal and economic management that is reducing the 
deficit. It creates a climate for jobs and economic growth in both 
the short and long term and ensures the long term future for 
effective sustainable social programs and investing in a stronger 
society through education, health and our children.
<P>
	Our fourth budget announces that this year's deficit is the lowest 
in 15 years. It represents the largest ever year over year decline in 
the federal deficit. By 1998-99 we will no longer need to borrow 
new money from the financial markets and we will have the lowest 
deficit in the G7, a truly amazing economic turn around in four 
short years.
<P>
	When we took office Canadians knew that tough decisions on 
fundamental reforms were required. They did not want tinkering. 
They wanted lasting solutions. They want us to develop a plan. 
They want us to stick to it. We have done just that. We are 
continuing the job with our fourth budget.
<P>
	This budget is a plan for wise and thoughtful investment in 
Canada and Canadians. It is an investment in post-secondary 
education. It is an investment in a stronger society. It is an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9334"> 9334 </A></B>
<P>
investment in immediate jobs and growth. Allow me to address 
some of these points.
<P>
	The annual costs of post-secondary education are truly 
astronomical; $10,000 to $12,000 a year for under graduate studies 
when all expenses are included. Canadians want and deserve the 
opportunity to equip themselves and their children with the 
knowledge, skills and education necessary to succeed an prosper in 
the global world; necessary for Canada to succeed and prosper in 
the global world.
<P>
	The measures in the budget designed to ease the financial burden 
of post-secondary education are commendable. Let me deal with a 
few.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	The budget provides assistance for parents saving for their 
children's education by amending registered education savings 
plans, or RESPs as they are commonly called. The full benefits of 
these tax sheltered plans are reaped by parents who start saving 
when their children are very young.
<P>
	The budget proposes that annual contribution limits to RESPs be 
doubled to $4,000. This will assist parents who are not able to start 
saving for their children's education when they were young and 
therefore have fewer years to make contributions. It will also 
provide major incentives for increased savings for education.
<P>
	Under current RESP provisions, all RESP income must go for 
education purposes. The family loses the investment income in its 
plan if their child does not pursue higher education. Since this can 
discourage parents from starting an RESP, two measures are 
proposed to address this problem.
<P>
	First, individuals winding up an RESP will now be allowed to 
transfer all or part of their RESP income into their registered 
retirement savings plans, provided they have unused RRSP room. 
Alternatively, individuals without RRSP room or who do not wish 
to make RRSP contributions, will be allowed to change the 
investment directly, subject to an appropriate charge. This charge 
will ensure that assistance is not provided to those who might use 
RESPs for tax deferral purposes unrelated to either education or 
retirement savings.
<P>
	This is a tremendous incentive for parents to save for their 
children's education. This is a tremendous relief for parents who 
are worried that they will not be able to afford the costs of their 
children's education.
<P>
	To assist students currently enrolled in post-secondary 
education, the budget has further welcome news. The amount used 
to establish the education credit will increase immediately to $150 
per month from $100 and to $200 for 1998 and subsequent years. 
The budget proposes to extend the tuition tax credit to mandatory 
fees set by post-secondary institutions to cover the costs of 
education although this will not include fees levied by student 
bodies.
<P>
	To ensure that all students can use these credits fully they will 
now be allowed to carry forward all unused portions of these 
credits to be applied against any future income. This measure will 
also benefit workers who are returning to school.
<P>
	Through the Canada student loans program the federal 
government provides financial assistance to students who need 
help to pursue post-secondary education. Often this is the only 
avenue that many students have to finance  their higher education. 
The problem arises when our best and our brightest graduate with a 
heavy debt load but have difficulty obtaining immediate 
employment or are underemployed. Admittedly students facing 
hardship are allowed to defer making payments on their loans for 
up to 18 months. Notwithstanding, some students are still unable to 
meet their obligations.
<P>
	To better recognize that some students still may not have the 
capacity to repay their loans, the budget will extend from 18 
months to 30 months the period of time during which students are 
allowed to defer making payments. The government will pay the 
interest that the student would have paid over this extended period.
<P>
	Combined with the initial six months after graduation when no 
payments are required, students will have up to three years of help 
in dealing with their loans. This measure will be effective August 
1, 1997 and will provide an additional $20 million a year in 
assistance to students. These measures are investments in our 
greatest asset, our children.
<P>
	The budget also reflects a strong investment in the health care of 
Canadians. Our publicly funded health care is studied and emulated 
by countries throughout the world. It is one of our finest 
achievements. We must be ever vigilant against those who would 
seek to destroy it.
<P>
	The government is committed to the principles of the Canada 
Health Act. We must not only protect medicare but work with the 
provinces to improve it, to strengthen it, to respond to changing 
health needs and advances in medicine. We must ensure that our 
health care dollars are spent effectively and efficiently, but we must 
also ensure that our health care facilities, our hospitals, be kept 
open to serve our citizens. Canadians deserve not good health care, 
but excellent health care, the best health care the world has to offer.
<P>
	In October 1994 the Prime Minister established the National 
Forum on Health to develop a vision of the health system that will 
meet the health needs of Canadians into the 21st century. In 
February 1997 the forum issued its report.
<P>
	In response to the forum's report the government has acted and 
acted quickly. The 1997 budget provides $300 million over the next 
three years for additional health care initiatives. Each dollar of this 
new money will be devoted to improving the delivery of health 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9335"> 9335 </A></B>
<P>
services to Canadians. We will provide $150 million for a health 
transition fund to help provinces launch pilot projects to investigate 
new and better approaches to health care. Projects could include, 
for example, better ways to provide medically necessary drugs and 
home care services. The assistance regarding expenditures will be 
made jointly by Canada's health ministers.
<P>
	The national forum emphasized that health care providers need 
timely access to quality health information in order to provide the 
best possible care.  We have allocated $50 million over three years 
to put in place a new Canada health information service. The 
national forum also spoke in favour of stronger community based 
programs and the need to invest in a healthy future for our children 
today. We agree.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	We currently fund two community based programs directed at 
improving the health of children. The community action program 
for children supports hundreds of groups, for example, in providing 
parenting education, child development centres and family 
resource programs, all directed to addressing the needs of children 
at risk up to the age of six years. As a member of the justice 
committee, which has just completed a study of the Young 
Offenders Act, I can confirm that this is a very wise initiative.
<P>
	The Canada prenatal nutrition program promotes the birth of 
healthy babies among high risk pregnant women. The 1997 budget 
increases funding for these two programs by $100 million over the 
next three years, money very well spent.
<P>
	Time and time again we are told that our children are our most 
precious resource and I agree. Yet the country has too many 
children and their families living below the poverty line. This is not 
right and this is not acceptable. This must be changed and we must 
not stop until there is not one single child living in poverty.
<P>
	The budget is one further step to this end as we propose to 
allocate $850 million to increase existing spending under the child 
tax benefit. This includes $600 million of new funds as of July 
1998, in addition to the $250 million increase in child benefits 
announced in the 1996 budget. This initiative will require 
partnership with the provinces, a partnership on behalf of our 
nation's children. We will provide additional resources when we 
can afford it.
<P>
	Why are we doing this? The reason is clear. I quote the Minister 
of Finance: ``Opportunity denied in childhood too often means 
chances lost as an adult. The future of Canada's children is a future 
of this country itself''. Nothing more needs to be said.
<P>
	With the new Canada child tax benefit, provinces will have room 
to provide more services and benefits to children and low income 
working families. For example, in kind benefits such as medical or 
dental care that are now available only to welfare recipients could 
be extended to low income working families. Positive steps, 
positive developments and a positive budget.
<P>
	As I conclude, I wish to point out that the government has set its 
priorities over the last four years and has stuck to them. It is 
continuing to bring down the deficit, to restore economic stability 
and vitality to the country by providing substantial new resources 
to invest in jobs, in health care, in education and in children. The 
journey is  not over. We have come far and our vision will carry this 
country forward into the next millennium.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member began by talking about the lowest budget in three 
years. In fact, the deficit is perhaps about half. The Liberals began 
their regime with a deficit of about $38 billion which they inflated 
to about $42 billion for their own political purposes, but the deficit 
is still at this time only about half of that at $19 billion.
<P>
	The Liberals also claim that they have brought down interest 
rates. In fact, the interest rates have come down as a result of 
market forces. I cannot see how the Liberals can take any credit for 
this.
<P>
	However, my concern is if interest rates begin to rise again. The 
Liberal government has no control over them. What contingency 
plan does the Liberal government have, if interest rates begin to 
rise, aside from creating a contingency fund raised by increasing 
taxes even more and expecting taxpayers to pay for the contingency 
fund as well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question. I appreciate the statistics that he has 
shown us this morning. Indeed, the deficit was $42 billion when we 
assumed office and it is now down to approximately $19 billion, 
truly a phenomenal reduction.
<P>
	Interest rates have come down. Yes, it is from market forces but 
market forces are the result of stability in the economy and a 
feeling of confidence once again. All of this contributes to a vibrant 
and wonderful economic future.
<P>
	Contingency plans? I think we hypothesize. We do not have a 
slush fund that we can worry about. We do not have to worry about 
it. This country is moving forward and moving forward fast. Of the 
G7, we have the best economy going and it is going to keep on 
going because of all the initiatives we have taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
appears that the spin doctors upstairs who are writing the speeches 
for the government side still have not got the message about the 
child poverty stuff they are throwing around.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for his definition of child 
poverty. He kept using that term in his speech. I would like him to 
explain to me what it actually means to him and his constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney: </B>Mr. Speaker, child poverty is a family who does 
not have the necessities of life. Each week that family lives from 
pay cheque to pay cheque which is very little. They wonder where 
the milk money will come from or extra money, perhaps, for a 
school lunch. This is child poverty.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Speaker, if I may, I will share my 20 minutes with my 
colleague, the hon. member for Shefford.
<P>
	I am pleased to take part in the debate on the budget tabled 
February 18 by the Minister of Finance. This budget definitely does 
not help the unemployed or poor children. I agree with my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues who have spoken recently on this budget, 
describing it as a lazy budget, an expression coined by our party's 
finance critic, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	Where is the minister's compassion for these unemployed 
people, these poor children? The $600 million announced for 
1998-99 for the 1.5 million poor children makes a very poor 
showing next to the billions of dollars slashed from social transfers 
and pilfered from the employment insurance fund.
<P>
	Where are the business and individual tax reforms the Bloc 
Quebecois has been demanding for so long? The Bloc Quebecois 
has pointed out, in fact, that the government could have freed up $3 
billion yearly from corporate taxes to help companies create jobs. 
What this involved was a reworking of the corporate tax system to 
eliminate inefficiencies.
<P>
	The government is trying to reduce its deficit at the expense of 
the provinces, mainly via a tax burden which has increased by $22 
billion in four years.
<P>
	What has the government done to stimulate employment? 
Bankruptcies have risen by 22 per cent in Canada, 20 per cent in 
Quebec, and 22 per cent in Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What is more, the number of bankruptcies in the National 
Capital Region has increased even more than in the other regions. 
The government has at least created one category of jobs, the 
pawnbrokers, whose business is booming. The Minister of Finance 
continues to promote family trusts and to promise job creation.
<P>
	In September 1996, the federal government launched an 
unprecedented attack on the auditor general in order to try to stifle 
the scandal on the tax-free transfer of family trusts to the U.S. The 
government was, and is still, using all the means at its disposal to 
protect the coffers of the Liberal Party. Canada's rich families 
continue to enjoy these tax havens, and this budget continues to 
protect them.
<P>
	It is not a budget that creates jobs, but purely an election budget. 
All the government's new initiatives are in the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the provinces, and taxpayers are the victims of the 
overlap and duplication.
<P>
	The federal government did however find the funds necessary 
for the minister of propaganda's flag campaign on the eve of the 
election.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9337"> 9337 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is also helping artists, by subsidizing those who 
advocate federalism. We must not forget that over 49 per cent of 
the cuts to the $16.5 billion in program expenditures between 1994 
and 1999 come from cuts to transfers to other levels of 
government, primarily the provinces.
<P>
	What has the government done for the rural regions? Nothing 
new yet. In my riding of Argenteuil-Papineau, we have a number 
of farmers facing major problems. The government is spending 
only $25 million this year on job search. This means less than $1 
per Canadian and less than $20 per unemployed individual.
<P>
	Since we are talking about overlap and duplication, I would like 
to point out that the federal government announced in its budget the 
establishment of an opportunities fund of $30 million a year over 
three years to give persons with disabilities greater financial 
independence.
<P>
	The fund will contribute to supporting innovative projects 
developed in partnership with groups of individuals with 
disabilities, the private sector and provincial governments. 
However, the provinces have always been involved in this area, and 
here comes the federal government once again to appropriate their 
clientele.
<P>
	I have spoken on a number of occasions before this House to 
underscore my interest in persons with disabilities. In December, I 
expressed my interest and that of the Government of Quebec in 
marking the Quebec week of disabled persons, by saying, and I 
quote: ``The Quebec week of disabled persons focuses on 
integrating these people into the work place. Presided over jointly 
by Clément Godbout, president of the FTQ, and Ghislain Dufour, 
of the Conseil du Patronat, this week is a first of its sort in Quebec 
and takes place in a spirit of fairness and solidarity''.
<P>
	I told of the work done by Cécile-Hélène Wojas, a paraplegic 
teacher in Lachute whose dynamism and courage have advanced 
the cause of the disabled, not just in her workplace, but also in the 
Lachute area, which is part of my riding.
<P>
	I also paid tribute last February to parents of sick children, and 
particularly to the courage of one family in my riding of 
Argenteuil-Papineau. The Séguin family of Saint-André 
d'Argenteuil, two of whose children, Sylvie and Patrick have 
muscular dystrophy, is a model of love, courage and devotion.
<P>
	In addition, what has the federal government done to help 
students? Their debt load has increased in recent years.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	In 1994-95, the total amount owed by students under the Canada 
Student Loans Program and Quebec's loans and bursaries program 
was over $7 million.
<P>
	In 1994-95, over 625,000 Quebecers and Canadians paid interest 
on loans taken out to pursue their education. In my riding of 
Argenteuil-Papineau, students must often leave home and move 
to larger urban centres, thus adding to what it costs them to get an 
education.
<P>
	Tax assistance for students certainly helps with their tax burden, 
but these measures were put in place when the economic situation 
of students was different.
<P>
	This budget certainly does not create jobs for taxpayers. And 
what can we say about the mistakes made by the federal 
government with respect to the Montreal airports, which will mean 
the loss of thousands of jobs for many, including people in the 
Lower Laurentians.
<P>
	I spoke about this scandal this week. I mentioned that the Bloc 
Quebecois was severely critical of the federal government for its 
inconsistent decisions and its mistakes, as former minister André 
Ouellet called them, in the matter of the Montreal airports.
<P>
	I also referred to the comments made by Senator Pietro Rizzuto, 
who confirmed that, for two years now, the federal government has 
failed to assume its responsibilities in looking for a viable solution 
to ensure the future of air transport in Quebec, hence the current 
confusion and the mess we are in.
<P>
	I also said that the Bloc Quebecois condemned the Liberals for 
trying, once again, to take the people of the Lower Laurentians 
hostage on this issue by making all sorts of promises on the eve of 
an election for purely partisan purposes.
<P>
	In conclusion, with an election in the offing, I urge the federal 
government to do a better job and to be more honest, because the 
public will not be fooled. It can read between the lines and sees this 
lazy budget for what it really is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to participate in the debate on the Minister of 
Finance's budget. A great many things could be said, but I shall 
restrict myself to analyzing certain parts of the budget which I feel 
are unacceptable to the population.
<P>
	First of all: employment insurance and the future consequences 
of this budget. An announcement has been made of a 10 cent cut in 
contributions, 10 cents less per $100. This proposed measure will 
not have much of an effect, since the reduction could have been50 cents per $100, which might have led to job creation.
<P>
	At the moment, the jobs that are being created are precarious, 
poorly paid and short-lived. According to the experts, in the past 
six years there have been so many cuts in unemployment 
insurance-renamed employment insurance, which is a hoax, since 
insurance must insure us when we lose work and are 
unemployed-that there is a $2 billion annual shortfall in the fund.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9338"> 9338 </A></B>
<P>
	This means that, had we maintained the 1989 criteria, we would 
have had a $3 billion surplus in the fund. What did the Liberal 
government do? Cut benefits to the least well-off. You will agree 
with me that people who are unemployed are not considered to 
be our society's most well-off.
<P>
	What is sad today in Canada is that there are people who worry 
about what colour their next Mercedes will be, while others worry 
about whether there will be anything to put on the table tomorrow. 
There are fathers and mothers who are constantly worrying whether 
they will have anything to feed their families with, whether there 
will be anything to put in their children's lunch boxes. That 
measure is unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to talk about child poverty. When the Liberal 
Party was in opposition and debating poverty, there were one 
million children living in poverty in Canada. The Liberals rose in 
this House to criticize the fact. Four years later, there are 1.5 
million young people and children who lack what is needed to grow 
up in Canada.
<P>
	And what did the Minister of Finance do? What provision is 
there in the budget? An increase of some $30 per child to fix the 
situation. That is shameful. It is shameful to spend an additional 
$70 million to help poor children.
<P>
	We will recall that unemployment insurance was cut by some $2 
billion a year. The poor lose $2 billion, and the $5 billion surplus 
goes to deficit reduction-those worst off pay for this too-and 
$30 a year more goes to filling lunch boxes. It is a scandal.
<P>
	I would like to talk as well about the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation. This foundation will receive $800 million. By chance, 
transfers to the provinces were cut by $800 million, and here they 
are going to create a fund.
<P>
	But, careful, a fund is not spent. The money in a fund is invested, 
and the interest is spent. So the government will be spending 
another $180 million a year-on what? It will spend it on 
education, research and hospitals, all of which come under 
provincial jurisdiction. Once again, federal Liberals, who 
specialize in invading areas of provincial jurisdiction, are going to 
butt in as they always do. This is unacceptable, it must be said.
<P>
	Members will recall that the red book contained a proposal to 
create new day care spaces in Canada. The government promised to 
invest $720 million in day care. They broke their promise. Now 
there is a plan to invest $600 million of new money in children. As 
I said earlier, the budget provides for expenditres of only $70 
million. Knowing the way Liberals are, we have be wary of what 
they promise as well as of the promises they keep.
<P>
	Another point in this budget I did not like at all is the fact the 
minister refused to compensate us for harmonizing the GST. 
Members will recall that Quebec was the first province in Canada 
to harmonize its sales tax. When it did, it received no 
compensation. And what is the finance minister telling us now? He 
is saying that, thanks to harmonization, Quebec is making a profit.
<P>
	Simply by looking at the tax in one province, and in other 
provinces, how can you say whether or not that province is making 
a profit? The minister forgot to say that the tax system in Quebec is 
different from Ontario's and the maritimes'. If the maritime 
provinces opted for a 10 or 11 per cent tax, it is their choice, but 
taxpayers there pay lower income taxes, higher sales taxes, but 
lower income taxes. In Quebec, we pay lower sales taxes, but a 
higher income tax than anywhere else in the country.
<P>
	Therefore I think that when the finance minister is telling us in 
this House that with his new tax, Quebec is making a profit, he is 
not being honest. He ought to look at the tax system overall, and 
see how much Quebec has lost. The Quebec Minister of Finance is 
demanding $1.9 billion in compensation to be on an equal footing 
with the maritimes, who will be receiving close to $1 billion. I 
believe that this is important. It is a question of equity with 
Quebec, and the minister is continually brushing it off as trivial.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Once again, the Liberals are demonstrating that they are 
sympathetic, that they are willing, but when the time comes to act, 
they do not. The means were there this year, however, because the 
annual debt will be lower this year as a result of the lower interest 
rates, so the minister had the means of doing it, yet he has decided 
not to. What he is doing is sprinkling a little largesse here and 
there, a few goodies, just peanuts. What people would like to see, 
as the official opposition has proposed, is a complete 
reorganization of the personal and corporate income tax systems. 
This government has been asleep at the switch for four years, and 
has done absolutely nothing to improve the situation.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to state that this is terrible, because there is talk 
everywhere of sharing, of equity. In Canada at the present time, it is 
the poor who are getting it in the neck, the poor who are being cut 
off, in this peculiar view of what equity toward them should be. 
The poor are bearing the brunt more and more, and receiving less 
and less. This is totally unacceptable, and I trust that this minister 
will think things over again, and return with a far more meaningful 
budget, for this one is a do-nothing budget, with nothing innovative 
about it. There is nothing innovative in this budget, and the entire 
population of Canada and of Quebec are bearing the brunt of this.
<P>
	When the bishops of Quebec speak of poverty, of the role of a 
member of Parliament, the role of representing  the least 
advantaged members of society, I think that everyone here in this 
House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9339"> 9339 </A></B>
<P>
has missed the boat here. We are not doing what we were elected to 
do, and the main responsibility lies with the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see that no 
Liberal member, on the other side, dares respond to the eloquent 
arguments made by the hon. member for Shefford. I want to 
commend him, not only for his speech, but also for the concerns 
that he is always showing in the House and during the discussions 
we have about the victims of the federal budget, that is, the poor 
and, particularly, the unemployment.
<P>
	I know that he did not have time to say everything. I would like 
him to remind us of what he thinks when he hears the finance 
minister bragging about reaching, and even exceeding, his budget 
objectives, when we know that the main reason why he exceeded 
his objectives is that he cut assistance to the unemployed.
<P>
	We remember the famous bill on employment insurance, which 
is essentially similar to unemployment insurance. This legislation 
reduced the eligibility period and the benefits. It is now more 
difficult for young people and for women to get back into the work 
force. A person will now have to work 910 hours to be eligible for 
employment insurance. Yet, people pay premiums from the first 
hour and not the 15th hour, as was the case before.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I would like the member for Shefford to tell me what he thinks 
about these employment insurance cuts. Does he think, as I do, that 
it is shameful to see the finance minister boasting about his 
success, when he is achieving it mainly on the backs of the 
unemployed and with cuts in transfers to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
hon. colleague from Lévis. He also works very hard on these 
issues. We have only 10 minutes to talk about the budget, and of 
course, we cannot say much in 10 minutes. But the Liberals will get 
their comeuppance. There will be an election soon and then we will 
have our say. We will talk about their achievements, about what 
they have done, but mostly about what they have not done and how 
they went about it. They picked on the poor, the disadvantaged in 
our society, those who need to feel that we are here to help them. 
But not the Liberals, they are hiding from these people.
<P>
	I remember listening to the Minister of Finance talk about poor 
children. What has he done for poor children? He merely injected 
$70 million. Now, $70 million may look like a lot of money. Mr. 
Speaker, you and I would feel like rich men if we were to win such 
a huge amount. It may look like a lot money, but it is peanuts in a 
country like ours, it only amounts to $30 per child every year. It is a 
shame. When the Liberals took office, there were 1 million kids 
living in poverty,  now that figure is up to 1.5 million, that is 
500,000 more poor children since the Liberals took office.
<P>
	To resolve this issue, we need to get rid of the Liberals and to 
replace them by something else. By what exactly, I do not know. 
But one thing is sure. Historically, the Liberal Party has cared about 
the disadvantaged, but now they are worse than the Conservatives. 
The decisions they make are worse. The friends of these two parties 
are often rich people, contributors, people with money to support 
them. The poor do not have any money. However, they want to 
improve their lot. Their children are in an even worse situation. 
They have rights too.
<P>
	In our society, we have parents who do not know if they will 
have a slice of bread the next morning to put into their kids' 
lunchbox, and that is unacceptable. It is unacceptable and 
shameful. There is no word strong enough to describe that whole 
situation.
<P>
	As official opposition, we will continue to work hard. We will 
continue to criticize the people opposite. They are not all the same, 
but they are very much alike. We have to make the decision makers 
and the ministers aware of the measures that need to be taken in our 
society and that cannot wait any longer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, back in my 
university days I had some experience with Maoist economics. I 
just heard some of that come at me from the previous speaker. I 
understand that is where their leader is coming from in terms of 
protocol ideology.
<P>
	Nevertheless I am pleased and privileged to have the opportunity 
to speak on the fourth budget of the government. My maiden 
speech to the House was on the occasion of the government's first 
budget. I vividly recall the challenges we were facing as a new 
government and as a people.
<P>
	The previous Conservative government during its nine years in 
office mismanaged the Canadian economy, gave Canadians record 
deficits and the debt grew from $208 billion to $508 billion. We 
were facing a fiscal crisis whereby over one-third of our revenues 
went to finance the debt.
<P>
	The challenge for us as a government and the challenge for us as 
Canadians was to bring the country back to fiscal health and to 
regain our fiscal sovereignty. As a government we knew that if we 
failed at this task we would fail at everything else we tried to do.
<P>
	We have met our deficit targets. We have restored Canada's 
fiscal integrity. We have united the country in the determination to 
guard the new fiscal sovereignty we have won.
<P>
	The proof of our fiscal success is the reality of having the lowest 
interest rates in 40 years. The Canadian prime rate is at 4.75 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9340"> 9340 </A></B>
<P>
cent and the U.S. prime rate is at 8.25 per cent. Our prime rate is 
3.5 per cent lower than the  U.S. prime rate. The U.S. prime rate is 
74 per cent higher than the Canadian prime rate. On a loan of 
$100,000 this represents a saving of $3,500 in annual interest 
charges.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	Because we have our fiscal house in order Canada is viewed 
abroad as a good place to invest, a good partner to trade with and a 
great place to live. Everyone is optimistic about Canada's future 
both in the short term and in the long term. The rest of the 
community is forecasting improvements and rightly so.
<P>
	The budget has its priorities in balance. This is truly a Liberal 
budget for it makes provision for those who need the assistance of 
their fellow Canadians within the framework of the economic 
realities. Because of the government's policies which have been 
reiterated in the budget we the people of Canada are once again 
maîtres chez nous.
<P>
	We are investing in ourselves by facilitating the full participation 
in society of those with disabilities. We are investing in ourselves 
by taking steps to maintain and strengthen our health care system. 
We are investing in ourselves by not yielding to the temptation to 
buy votes with our tax cut. That would be a fool's bargain. That 
would be throwing away our future, our children's future and 
Canada's future.
<P>
	Therefore we have chosen to invest in our future. We are 
proposing the new national child benefit system to give the 
children of low income families a better start in life and to fight 
poverty.
<P>
	Without a job the ordinary Canadian has no future whether we 
are speaking of today's adults or today's children when they grow 
up. Creating a favourable climate for a growing economy has been 
and continues to be a goal of the government.
<P>
	The government has taken positive actions to create more jobs 
for Canadians now and in the future. That is how we will maintain 
and improve our standard of living and increase government 
revenues, not by borrowing more money to cut taxes.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister are to be 
applauded for their leadership in involving the Liberal caucus in 
drafting the budget. They involved members of the Liberal caucus 
through caucus committees. The budget is a result of our collective 
efforts. Along with my colleague from Kitchener I helped establish 
the eight-member post-secondary caucus, of which we are both 
members. We see the fruits of our three years of work in the budget.
<P>
	Canada's bright future depends on our continuing ability to 
produce the goods and services the world needs. To produce those 
goods and services we need to invest in ourselves.
<P>
	My constituency is blessed with two universities and a 
community college campus with a combined student enrolment of 
over 40,000. Wilfrid Laurier University, the University of Waterloo 
and Conestoga College are integral parts of the identity of my 
riding. I applaud the wisdom of the finance minister in arranging to 
help students pay for their education. There are three ways in which 
the budget will benefit those paying tuition for higher education.
<P>
	The increased tax assistance makes it possible to dedicate more 
of a person's income to education costs, thus holding down the 
debts incurred in meeting those costs.
<P>
	In the past it has been common for students to graduate and find 
themselves faced with having to pay off their student loans before 
they could get established in a job. The maximum deferral period 
will be increased to three years to help them get on their feet.
<P>
	James Downey, president of the University of Waterloo, and 
Lorna Marsden, president of Wilfrid Laurier University, have 
expressed to me their enthusiastic approval and support of the 
higher education provisions of the budget.
<P>
	Canadian universities and their presidents have all reacted 
positively to the budget which identifies investment in university 
research, university infrastructure and students as key priorities.
<P>
	The idea for improved student financing was started at the 
University of Waterloo last spring by two economic students, Chris 
Lowe and Paul Skipper. Through Kelly Foley, vice-president of 
education of the Federation of Students, they worked with the 
Canadian Alliance of Student Associations to lobby the 
government through the post-secondary education caucus.
<P>
	As a former president of the Federation of Students, a member of 
the senate at the University of Waterloo and a former board of 
governors member of Wilfrid Laurier University, I thank Kelly 
Foley and all members of the post-secondary education community 
for their help. We did this together. You made a difference. Your 
lobby worked and I and my colleague from Kitchener look forward 
to working together with you to ensure the excellence of our 
post-secondary educational institutions in Canada. This budget is a 
big step in that process.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	It is because of my deep belief in post-secondary education that I 
support financially all the post-secondary educational institutions 
in my community and I urge all post-secondary graduates to do the 
same. The education community supports us in this because it 
knows the value of education. Like the students and their parents, it 
does not want to see our young people robbed of their opportunities 
for higher education because of fiscal barriers. All the people of 
Canada do not want to see the nation deprived of the talents of the 
next generation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9341"> 9341 </A></B>
<P>
	I am very happy that the budget is investing in future jobs in 
Canada for Canadians by setting up the foundation for innovation. 
This is a very important strategic move to keep Canada in the 
technological forefront in several keys areas, science, engineering, 
health and the environment. The dividends of this investment will 
be huge. By putting funding into education and research and 
development we are building the bridge to the next millennium. 
We need jobs and this is where the jobs of the future are.
<P>
	The key to a person's success in the world is education. Statistics 
show that the more education you have, the less likely you are to be 
unemployed. So there is no question that the more of us who obtain 
a higher education, the better off we will be as individuals and as 
Canadians.
<P>
	Where will these graduates work? As I said, here in Canada. I 
can give a good example on how it works for my riding. There are 
probably similar situations right across Canada. The University of 
Waterloo, Wilfred Laurier University and Conestoga College have 
spun off more than 200 companies because of their programs in 
engineering and computers, environmental technology and 
business. These companies are located in Canada's technology 
triangle and in other Canadian centres. They are doing well because 
they are dealing in the goods and services that are needed.
<P>
	Because of the constant output of new graduates from 
universities and because of university research our local high tech 
sector is going to boom in the immediate future especially in the 
area of information technology.
<P>
	Right now Canada has a shortage of 20,000 positions in the 
software sector that are not being filled. This is clearly hurting our 
economy. It is hurting us economically as a nation. Clearly there 
are many places these young people can be trained. Resources 
spent in our post-secondary institutions will ensure those jobs are 
filled.
<P>
	With the notable exception I just stated, we have through our 
education system a critical mass of skilled labour together with the 
capability of ongoing research in partnership with the educational 
sector. Thanks to the new budget the federal government is 
fostering the growth of both industry and education to the benefit 
of all Canada. With a new high tech industrial park in place, it is 
now in the initial stages. There will be less of a tendency for 
graduates and companies to move south. The facilities for 
development will be here in the Waterloo region, in Canada's 
technology triangle.
<P>
	In the new economy it is an imperative that industry, educational 
institutions and governments at all levels work together in the 
fashion of Team Canada. We are doing that in my riding.
<P>
	I mentioned that we have a high tech sector in the Waterloo area. 
Students are graduating from the  computer engineering program at 
the University of Waterloo. The biggest recruiter of our students is 
Microsoft in the United States. Clearly that does not make any 
sense.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	We are spending tax dollars to educate our young people. We get 
them to the point where they can compete in the world. In too many 
cases the brain drain goes to the United States.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Why is that happening?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> My Reform colleague opposite asked why this is 
happening.
<P>
	In this new economy we need a Team Canada approach. When I 
say a Team Canada approach, we need educational institutions, 
industry and governments at all levels to work together to solve 
these problems. Not one sector alone has the solutions for these 
problems. In my riding too many graduates are going south of the 
border.
<P>
	We are defining the problems, but opportunities are lacking for 
software industries to expand in our country.
<P>
	Let me tell the House about a problem. This has to do with 
government policy overall and how governments involve 
themselves in the Team Canada approach.
<P>
	A number of years ago one of the companies in my riding was 
going public. The technology it produces is Internet 
communications technology. Its initial development was funded by 
government research dollars. Its technical expertise was found at 
the University of Waterloo.
<P>
	About a year ago, when that company went public, it found it 
easier to list on the NASDAQ exchange in the United States than to 
list in Canada. In the United States companies can get listed with a 
big exchange and cover all their fiscal needs.
<P>
	Furthermore, not only do we have securities commissions in 
each province, we have the ridiculous situation that companies 
have to file with all of them if they want to trade across Canada.
<P>
	When this company went public and issued warrants, it found it 
much more difficult to sell in Canada than to sell its warrants in the 
United States.
<P>
	Once this company went public it needed to expand very quickly. 
The American market provided the financing. Two hundred and 
fifteen of the new employees hired are now in the United States. It 
still has 100 employees in Waterloo.
<P>
	Infrastructure funding is of critical importance. We do not have 
in the Waterloo area is a high tech park which would allow these 
companies to develop so we can be one of the best software centres 
in Canada. Not only would we produce graduates from the 
University of Waterloo, we would keep them in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9342"> 9342 </A></B>
<P>
	This is an exploding sector in terms of opportunity. The 
projections are that over the next couple of decades, in the 
Waterloo region, we could add 25,000 new jobs to this sector. That 
is an enormous payoff for the dollars we have spent on our 
educational system.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	In the new economy it is imperative that industry, educational 
institutions and governments at all levels work together in the 
fashion of Team Canada. We are doing that in my riding.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated in February 1997: ``I know for 
someone without a job statistics may not be much comfort. 
However, I want all Canadians to understand what we are doing to 
combat unemployment and how I believe our actions will create a 
stronger economy and more jobs for all Canadians''.
<P>
	It is important to bear in mind that restoring Canada's fiscal 
sovereignty is not an end in itself but a means to an end, a job for 
every Canadian who wants one. Our economy is poised for 
expansion because interest rates are low, our operating deficit is 
under control and we are in a position to cope with the national 
debt.
<P>
	It is all due to sound management on the part of this government 
and the support of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is customary in 
this House to point out that a member expresses the concerns and 
interests of his constituents.
<P>
	In this regard, I think the hon. member for Waterloo deserves 
praise for expressing the concerns of his region. There is certainly 
nothing wrong with this. The member also talked about financial 
sovereignty. Again, we are rarely opposed to anyone seeking 
greater autonomy.
<P>
	The member talked about the financial sovereignty of the people 
in his region, compared to the United States. In stating his 
concerns, he mentioned that a number of people trained and 
educated in his province are moving to the United States. This is 
certainly a serious concern for him and others, since he would like 
these people to stay. Indeed, when the government puts money into 
education, it wants to see the benefits of that investment remain in 
this country. Therefore, the hon. member must be congratulated for 
his concern.
<P>
	This is the positive note, the flower-who knows, it might bring 
spring along. However, when the member mentioned that the 
government was about to invest $800 million in the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation, he should have pointed out that this 
amount will not all be invested this year. In fact, it is believed that 
only $150 million will be invested in the near future.
<P>
	The member then said that the Minister of Finance promised to 
invest in higher or post-secondary education. It is true that $137 
million has been set aside for  education and $7 million for literacy. 
While this may seems interesting at first because it looks like more 
money, we must remember that this same government and its 
Minister of Finance have cut $800 million more in transfer 
payments to the provinces for health and education. The hon. 
member says it is great that a foundation will be created with a 
$800 million budget. It looks like it adds up, but in fact only $150 
million will be invested in the foundation.
<P>
	In itself, saying $800 million will be invested while the actual 
amount is $150 million, does not matter that much. What does 
matter, however, is the fact that this is basically a provincial 
jurisdiction. The member comes from Ontario, so he must surely 
be aware of what is going on in Ontario-reaction to the cuts made 
by the Harris government, a Conservative government-and must 
know why these cuts are being made. They are the result of the 
federal government's cuts across the board. Since its election, this 
government has cut no less than $4.5 billion in those transfer 
payments referred to by the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	On the eve of an election, having made all these cuts, the federal 
government wants to be seen as generous and be able to say it has 
done something for post-secondary education. It would have been 
much better for the government not to make such drastic cuts in 
transfer payments for education and health in the first place, but 
rather to have let the provinces look after it; then, the provinces 
would not have been left holding the bag and been forced, as they 
are now, to make their own cuts. The same thing is happening in 
Quebec.
<P>
	A matter of current interest in Quebec concerns the renegotiation 
of collectives agreements by the government and the major union 
federations representing health and education workers. It is tough, 
even fierce. Why? Because the federal government has cut transfer 
payments back and Quebec has been hit especially hard by the cuts.
<P>
	I find it incredible that, after having cut transfer payments, the 
government now forces the provinces to clean up its mess, while it 
hands out crumbs to hide all the cuts and cover everything up. That 
is unacceptable. I would like to hear his comments on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member posed a lot of questions 
that I will try to answer.
<P>
	When I talk about my region vis-à-vis the United States I am 
talking about my country. The Waterloo region is a part of Canada 
and part of the province of Ontario. Let me also say that Quebec is 
a part of Canada. It is a part of my country.
<P>
	When we get to be 50 years of age we begin to reflect on the past. 
It was 40 years ago that my family crossed  the Austrian frontier. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9343"> 9343 </A></B>
<P>
To get there we had to go through minefields. We were fleeing the 
repression of the Hungarian revolution. I was 10 years old at the 
time. I remember my parents, my older brother and my sister 
having to leave. We had all sorts of fears and concerns about what 
the future would hold but we believed the future would be better.
<P>
	Canada is the best country in the world. I can say that from all 
my years of experience. I will do everything in my power to make 
sure it stays together. Part of the way that can be done is by 
establishing the financial sovereignty of the country.
<P>
	When the government took office it was on the verge of hitting 
the debt wall. It was on the verge of economic doom. We have to 
recall those times and the 1993 election. We have to recall how 
some folk thought we should follow the experience of New 
Zealand. The government chose not to do that.
<P>
	I reiterate that we as a government knew the finances of the 
country had to be stabilized. We cut transfer payments. Let me 
speak to that for a minute because transfer payment cuts have had 
personal impacts on my life and on people around me.
<P>
	My wife used to work in the health care sector. A number of 
years ago because of cuts to the hospital where she was working 
she had to go back to university and get some additional training. 
The fact she was a nurse helps her in her new jobs but essentially 
she is in a new field.
<P>
	We cut transfer payments. In the case of the province of Ontario 
we cut to the tune of $1.2 billion. We in Ontario know that a 30 per 
cent tax cut at the provincial level to give a tax break to the people 
of Ontario devastated the health care sector and many community 
organizations that have worked with victims.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	I used to be employed by an organization called Youth in 
Conflict with the Law involved in community corrections. It is 
slated to end at the end of the month. Twelve programs across the 
province of Ontario which were a cost effective and humane way to 
provide protection to communities will be lost. Community 
resource centres were closed down by the Harris government 
because they were driven by a right wing ideology that tax cuts are 
the way to restore the economy.
<P>
	That was tried by Ronald Reagan. He took the United States of 
America from being the biggest lending nation in the world to the 
biggest indebted nation in eight years. He lost more sovereignty for 
the United States of America than any other previous president.
<P>
	That is exactly what the previous Conservative government 
wanted to do. That is exactly what the leader of the Ontario 
Conservative government wants to do. That is exactly what the 
leader of the Reform Party and  the Reform Party want to do. They 
want to slash and burn and follow the American model.
<P>
	The people of Ontario have had the experience of the Harris 
government. They have seen that right wing approach and they 
have seen this government's balanced approach. They will respond 
positively in the next election by supporting our government, not 
because we are perfect, not because we have a God given right to be 
here, but because the choices we have made are in the best interest 
of the country and of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member who spoke just before me on the Liberal side of the House 
mentioned in his speech on the budget that graduates from his area 
were going south and jobs were going south. That disturbed him 
quite a lot. He speculated on the reasons that is happening. It is 
very obvious why it is happening. There are more jobs in the 
United States and the taxes are lower. Those things are linked 
together. Where the taxes are lower, the jobs appear.
<P>
	In my riding of North Vancouver, which is close to the border 
with the United States, a whole slew of businesses, thousands of 
small businesses, have moved across the border into the 
Bellingham area to operate in the United States where there is a 
lower tax regime.
<P>
	Canadian businesses have produced jobs in the United States for 
U.S. citizens. It happens because of lower taxes. Even when we 
take into account paying for medical care it is still cheaper to work 
in Washington State than it is in the province of B.C. It is very clear 
that is the main reason graduates are going south.
<P>
	The member also mentioned interest rates, which is something a 
lot of other Liberals mentioned today. He claimed credit for low 
interest rates. They must think that the people of Canada have no 
long term memory at all. Prior to the last election the Liberal Party 
opposed the policies of the Bank of Canada and the federal reserve 
in the United States which have led to the low interest rate 
situation.
<P>
	Because of the need to beat inflation, which was destroying our 
economy, the federal reserve and the Bank of Canada took the 
position they did. The Liberals spoke out strongly against the Bank 
of Canada. They did not approve the policy at all.
<P>
	It is just amazing. They did not want NAFTA, which has now 
produced tremendous export markets for Canada. They did not 
want the interest rates scenario of the Bank of Canada. Suddenly 
the Liberals want to take credit for all the things that have been 
beneficial. It is absolutely amazing.
<P>
	It is Liberal, Tory, same old story. They really have always been 
in bed together. They still are. Nothing would suit them better than 
to have the Tories back in the House because everything would tick 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9344"> 9344 </A></B>
<P>
along quite  nicely. They would pass the same legislation together. 
They would have a great time.
<P>
	During question period today one of our members rose to 
question the finance minister. He could not even rise to answer 
questions. We must be getting to them if the finance minister is 
perhaps incapable of rising and answering questions about the 
figures and about why government departments have not met the 
targets set in the budget. Departmental spending has been exceeded 
by the various departments.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I realize I cannot use props but I will describe an example I have 
with me today. It is quite a large package of papers about 1.5 times 
the size of a package of copy paper used for copying machines. 
About 650 pages of material arrived on my desk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> I thought that was your speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Luckily it is not. On the 
top there is a computer disk which contains the material in 
electronic form.
<P>
	What are these 650 pages of material about? They are about the 
western economic diversification fund. It is a big propaganda 
package that is supposed to convince me that the Liberal 
propaganda machine is something worthwhile having.
<P>
	There are summaries of press releases from Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Half of it is being sent to western 
MPs in French as well. About the only piece of frugal work in the 
whole package is the letter from the deputy minister which is 
actually double sided instead of using two sheets. Everything else 
is a complete and utter waste of taxpayers' money. There are 
brochures in French going to MPs in the western ridings.
<P>
	As soon as I am done my speech today this package is going 
straight back to the minister. What a waste of money. It is a good 
example of why the government is over budget on departmental 
spending.
<P>
	I can give another example. Yesterday there was a meeting of the 
heritage committee. One of the matters to be discussed in camera 
was a new trip around the country, a junket for the people on the 
heritage committee. What were they to do on this junket? They 
were to study Canadian culture and try to define it. They were to go 
to Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal. They were to define Canadian 
culture. That is like trying to define love or why a cat is a cat. What 
a ridiculous, stupid exercise.
<P>
	How much was it to cost? If that had been discussed and passed 
yesterday, $214,000 of taxpayers' money would have gone down 
the tubes. If we really need to define Canadian culture, ask people 
to write us some letters and tell us. We do not need to spend 
$214,000. No wonder the budget estimates are over budget.
<P>
	Another example is a letter I received from a constituent. He 
mentions that according to the attached news report last year 
Bombardier made a profit of $313 million. In its current fiscal year 
the Liberal government has made Bombardier a grant of $97 
million. That figure is from page 878 of <I>Hansard</I>. This constituent 
reads <I>Hansard</I> religiously so he has all his ducks in a row.
<P>
	Adding the $313 million profit and the $97 million grant gives 
us a $410 million figure. This year ending January 31 Bombardier 
reported a profit of $406.2 million. Is that not a coincidence? Most 
of the additional profit came in the form of a grant. Should it be 
taxable or non-taxable? It is another propaganda give away from 
the Minister of Industry and a good example of why departmental 
spending is over budget.
<P>
	I have another example. The Liberals have been saying how 
wonderful their budget is and that everybody is falling over 
themselves with praise for what they have done, conveniently 
forgetting as I mentioned earlier in the day the $600 billion debt 
which at the moment costs us about $50 billion a year in interest. If 
the interest rate went up 1 per cent it would add $6 billion more to 
that figure; 2 per cent would add $12 billion; and 3 per cent would 
$18 billion. If we had a 5 per cent jump the whole thing would be 
totally out of control. We would have the crisis the member before 
me mentioned we were close to in 1993.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	We are not out of the woods yet. If this government had adopted 
the zero in three plan which Reform promoted in the last election 
we would be running surpluses today. We would be arguing in this 
House what to do with the surplus money, like Alberta is doing 
today, instead of discussing a $19 billion deficit.
<P>
	Only Liberals would think that a $19 billion deficit is something 
to be celebrated. When we have a $19 billion surplus we can have a 
party. However, a $19 billion deficit, give me a break.
<P>
	Another of my constituents wrote me a letter: ``Last October, I 
was lucky enough to receive a $300 per month raise in pay. My 
wife and I considered ourselves fortunate and looked forward to 
being able to remodel the kitchen. When my end of January pay 
arrived, there did not seem to be any extra money in there''.
<P>
	We are not surprised at that because, when my constituent 
analyzed his paycheque, he found that from the original $300 raise, 
$162.60 went to income tax and $129.96 went to increased CPP 
and UI deductions. He ended up with $7.44.
<P>
	A Liberal answer to that would be borrow the money because 
interest rates are low. We have these wonderful interest rates. That 
is typical Liberal speak, Liberal think. There is a benefit in 
borrowing money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9345"> 9345 </A></B>
<P>
	Does that sound familiar? They started it in the 1970s. Look 
at the hole they dug for us, the debt hole they dug for us by taking 
the attitude that borrowing money was good, that there would be 
a benefit by borrowing money. Absolute rubbish.
<P>
	If the people of Canada had a surplus running today through their 
government we could be giving them tax breaks so that they did not 
have to borrow money to get a break. It would be in their pay 
packet every week, a meaningful tax reduction.
<P>
	In July 1996 the New Zealand government gave every average 
worker $200 a week more in their pockets. It was a tax break for 
everyone. They do not have to borrow money to get the benefit.
<P>
	On March 19, one of the talk show hosts in Vancouver, Mr. Bill 
Good on CKNW, did a poll about the reduction of taxes. He asked 
people whether they thought reducing taxes would be a good idea. 
It coincided with the release of the Tory election platform. He took 
calls for an hour. There was unanimous support. Every single call 
to that program was in support of Reform's tax cut proposals and 
the comments that were made, to summarize generally, were do not 
trust the PCs because it is just more of the same Liberal-Tory, same 
old story.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Reform member referred to some of my comments, I should 
respond.
<P>
	One of the reasons we have for students going south is that the 
opportunity for expansion was not there to the extent that it should 
have been in the Waterloo region. That is what you get when you 
invest in infrastructure and that is exactly what we are doing now.
<P>
	In the past in my community there were so many good things 
happening that Canadians did not need the co-ordination between 
government, industry and the educational sector to the extent that it 
is needed now. That is important to understand.
<P>
	I am a little distressed when the member keeps referring to 
Bombardier because all sorts of money went out under the Canada 
technology partnership fund. That is a perfect example of a critical 
investment in research and development in this country which in 
terms of our new policies is not a giveaway. It is money that we 
will get back with interest.
<P>
	The member from the Reform Party talks about having gone to 
zero deficit in three years. If that plan ever had a chance of 
happening, it would be worse than what Mike Harris is doing. It 
would devastate this country. Since Mike Harris began his plan of 
tax cuts there has been a net loss in jobs in the province of Ontario. 
It has actually been a drag on overall Canadian job creation.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	It is necessary for Reform to understand that by destroying an 
economy you do not get more tax revenues. You get less. When you 
destroy an economy you have less tax revenue. I know Reform 
Party members do not like good news but I recommend that they 
read the report in the business section of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
because there is good news there every day. The Canadian prime 
rate, 4.75 per cent; U.S. prime rate, 8.25 per cent; on $100,000 
borrowed in Canada, the consumers, the small businesses, save 
$3,500.
<P>
	I can also refer them to another happy story. The headline is 
``Economy on a Tear. Consumer spending, exports, business 
investments produce outstandingly strong numbers. Canada's 
private sector appears to be firing in all cylinders''.
<P>
	The government's policy was set up to create the climate for the 
private sector to start creating jobs, and it is happening. In spite of 
all the cuts governments have made across the country, which have 
cost overall about 100,000 jobs, because they have had the right 
climate, private businesses have created 800,000 jobs. So over 
700,000 jobs have been created since this government came to 
office. It all rested on the integrity of our fiscal policies, on the 
integrity of the finance minister whereby we met our financial 
targets time after time. It is unparalleled in budget forecasting. 
That is why the economy is doing that well.
<P>
	So I suggest to Reform members-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for North Vancouver 
has a minute to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, he asked so many 
questions. It is ridiculous for the member to say that a company 
like Bombardier which makes $406 million profit needs any 
money. It does not need a single cent and it is an outrage that this 
member has been brainwashed, I would have to say, by the spin 
doctors upstairs who have convinced him that company that makes 
$406 million should be given $97 million of taxpayer money.
<P>
	He also made the comment that if we give tax cuts there will be 
less taxes coming in. Of course there will. The member does not 
get it yet. Canadians are asking for smaller government. Smaller 
government does not need as much tax. That is the whole idea and 
that is why people are so supportive of the Harris government, of 
the Klein government. They are doing what people want. They are 
making government smaller and any opportunities that are coming 
in Ontario are a direct result of the Harris government actions. 
They are not a result of this government's actions.
<P>
	When he talks about students going south because there are no 
expansion opportunities in Waterloo, that again is related to taxes. 
Companies are moving out of his area. They are taking jobs away 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9346"> 9346 </A></B>
<P>
from that area because  the taxes are too high. The member should 
go back to his riding, listen to his constituents and look at the facts. 
Taxes in Canada are too high. It is a job killer.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak 
in the budget debate today. I am delighted to have the opportunity 
to shed some light on one of the most deceptive documents I have 
ever seen. Watching the Minister of Finance perform in this house 
is like watching one of the greatest illusionists since Merlin the 
magician.
<P>
	There are claims of no tax increases when the finance minister 
has introduced 35 tax increases, taking an additional $25 billion out 
of the hands of Canadians. Imagine what would have happened if 
that $25 billion had been left in the hands of consumers. Imagine 
all the spending Canadians would have done with that $25 billion. 
Imagine all the jobs that would have been created with that $25 
billion. For some reason this Liberal government does not want 
Canadians to spend their own money. Instead the Liberals want to 
spend Canadians' money.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	A movie about a sports agent, ``Jerry Maguire'', contains the 
line: ``Show me the money. Show me the money''. The finance 
minister and the Liberal government have adopted a slightly 
different version of the line. The government's version is ``Give me 
your money. Give me your money''.
<P>
	Another example of the minister's smoke and mirrors is how he 
arrived at the $19 billion deficit.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration. In the main estimates which were tabled after the 
budget the department's spending decreased by $40 million. 
However, less than two weeks later, the department tabled its 
supplementary estimates. Instead of a $40 million decrease there 
was an $88 million increase. It is no wonder the finance minister 
can claim fiscal responsibility when government departments show 
their spending has been cut by 7 per cent the week of the budget 
and then increased by 15 per cent two weeks later.
<P>
	The finance minister's greatest sleight of hand involves the 
Canada pension plan. I will go through this really slowly so 
government members, if they are around to listen, will be able to 
follow.
<P>
	With the recently announced increase in CPP premiums, in six 
years Canadians will see 9.9 per cent of their salary going into the 
plan. For someone paying the maximum amount, that will mean the 
individual will pay $1,635, with the employer paying a matching 
amount.
<P>
	Let us imagine that we have someone under the age of 30 paying 
the maximum amount for the next 35 years. That person and their 
employer will pay about $110,000  in premiums. I have heard that 
the average length of collecting CPP is 19 years. That means, in 
today's dollars, that individual would collect $165,000.
<P>
	Is $165,000 a good return on an investment of $110,000 over 35 
years? I would suggest that 99 per cent of Canadians would laugh at 
the idea that it is a good investment.
<P>
	It gets worse. Under the provisions of the seniors' benefit which 
the Liberal government introduced last year, the first $12,500 of 
income over and above the seniors' benefit will be taxed at the rate 
of 50 per cent. That is right, 50 per cent. This poor soul who paid 
$110,000 into the Canada pension plan will not get that cheque for 
$724 a month; rather they will only receive $362 a month.
<P>
	If this poor soul lives to collect his pension of $362 a month for 
19 years, he will collect a grand total of $82,500. That is an 
$82,500 return on an investment of $110,000. I do not know what 
kind of mathematics it takes to show that is not a good investment. 
Only a member of the Liberal government would think it is a good 
deal.
<P>
	Actually under this government's pension policies, it is a good 
plan for Liberal and Tory MPs. The Liberals have ensured that they 
will not have to worry about little things like the CPP. No, they do 
not have to worry about the Canada pension plan when they have 
their own gold plated pension.
<P>
	While the average Canadian in the future will be struggling on 
their skimpy seniors' benefit and half of their CPP, these Liberal 
MPs will be basking in the glory of the richest pension plan in the 
country, so rich that it is illegal for any other Canadian to have a 
similar plan.
<P>
	The finance minister has made sure that he and his fellow 
Liberals will enjoy most of their obscene pension.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	One may ask, why is that? Under the provisions of the seniors 
benefit, that 50 per cent tax on pension income only covers the first 
$12,500. The next $12,500 is taxed at the rate of zero. That is right, 
there is no income tax on the next $12,500. That means it will 
completely cover the benefit that someone will receive from the 
Canada pension plan, but it will only touch a small portion of 
additional pension income, like the members of Parliament pension 
plan.
<P>
	This means that the Deputy Prime Minister will be able to collect 
her full pension of over $50,000 a year when she reaches the age of 
55, a full 10 years earlier than the average Canadian. When she 
turns 65 her CPP payments will be taxed at 50 per cent. However, 
that will be just a pittance to her because $12,500 of her gold plated 
pension plan will be tax free and the rest is only going to be taxed at 
a rate of about 20 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9347"> 9347 </A></B>
<P>
	So while the average Canadian will have his or her CPP taxed 
at 50 per cent, these Liberal MPs will be laughing while paying 
less than 20 per cent tax on that outrageous pension. No wonder 
the Liberals think that this is a really great budget. For them it 
is.
<P>
	No wonder the finance minister has refused to answer the 
Reform Party's tough questions about the budget. Instead, he uses a 
typical Liberal tactic of attacking Reform, of diverting people's 
attention from the real issue, his sham of a budget. Instead of 
paying his people to come up with a decent budget, he has them all 
working scouring everything the Reform Party has ever said about 
finances and then figuring a way to distort them.
<P>
	Here is something that is not in Reform Party policy that I think I 
could get my colleagues to approve. While we normally are not in 
favour of tax increases, we would be prepared to support a very 
heavy tax increase on Canadian shipping magnates who register 
their ships in Panama so they can avoid paying Canadian taxes. We 
would be more than happy to tax these Canadians who export jobs 
out of Canada and would rather pay taxes in Panama than in 
Canada.
<P>
	Perhaps it is time for the finance minister to lead by example. 
Perhaps it is time for the finance minister and his fellow Liberals to 
put their hands in their own pockets instead of the pockets of 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thought it was worth mentioning again a part of the speech that the 
hon. member brought to our attention. It is something that is so 
easy to forget: that members of the Reform Party made a 
commitment that they would not take the gold plated pension plan 
that members of the government side took for themselves.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if she could cover a little bit of 
that ground once again to remind the Canadian public of that 
commitment, we are not in this place for our long term pensions. 
We are here because we truly believe that what Reform stands for 
can make this a better country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
opportunity to share with Canadians that he is right, 51 out of 52 
Reformers did opt out of the pension plan for members of 
Parliament. It was not easy as a single parent without any pension 
to walk away from it. However, I felt was not right and because it 
was not in the same vein as pension plans for the average Canadian 
in the private sector, I could not in good conscience remain in that 
plan. Yes, at great sacrifice to myself and my colleagues, we opted 
out when the opportunity was there. We will not be ripping off 
Canadians down the road as far as the pension is concerned.
<P>
	It shows the leadership and the vision we have for the country. I 
hope that when the voters go to the poll in the very near future they 
will consider that as an indication  of what kind of government we 
will provide after the next election.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the budget debate that is 
drawing to a close. We have to wonder about what we should have 
found in this budget and what was not there.
<P>
	We have learned to expect some quite original, but not always 
positive, moves by the Minister of Finance to cut expenditures, 
reduce transfer payments to the provinces, use the UI fund surplus 
as public revenues to hide the deficit. This year, however, he could 
have come up with more original initiatives to deal with our 
number one problem, the employment situation.
<P>
	The budget contains no original employment measure on jobs. In 
my speech, I will point out some initiatives that should have been 
brought forward, but that were not, which goes to show that the 
government does not really want to deal with the unemployment 
problem we are facing in Quebec and throughout Canada.
<P>
	First, I would like to give you an example of how public 
expenditures could have been better controlled. It would have been 
interesting to cut the Senate's budget. All the Senate has done this 
last year is to reject the Pearson Airport bill.
<P>
	Because this measure was rejected, the federal government had 
to go to court and will probably have to pay up to $600 million of 
taxpayers' money in compensation because of the Pearson airport 
mess. Perhaps the Senate deserves that we cut its expenses and that 
we look more closely at what it is doing with our money.
<P>
	The main issue is that the government has not set an employment 
target. It has not established specific objectives, as it did for deficit 
reduction. It has not made a commitment to reduce unemployment 
by a certain percentage over the next year or over the next two 
years.
<P>
	That is what the Quebec government has done. It said that it 
would meet its job creation target as soon as possible and eliminate 
the gap between Quebec and the average for Canada. The federal 
government has not made such a commitment. The Prime Minister 
is constantly telling us that we must create the proper conditions 
for job creation, which means keeping an eye on interest rates and 
other such things. That is good for a certain number of jobs. 
However, in today's society, I think there are two realities with 
regard to employment.
<P>
	There are those people concerned with the new economy, those 
who just got out of university or college and for whom we must 
implement new technologies, open markets, increase exports, etc. 
It is true that we must act on that front, but there is also a segment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9348"> 9348 </A></B>
<P>
of the  population that has been abandoned, that is not being taken 
care of in the present budget as I think it should have been.
<P>
	There are the solutions I heard about in a workshop held during 
the Bloc Quebecois convention on the issue of employment. A 
number of solutions were suggested. One is to turn over 
management of the UI fund, now known as the EI fund, to those 
paying into it, that is employers, employees and the unemployed. 
Chambers of Commerce, the Bloc Quebecois and even the 
Conservative Party of Canada called very clearly for a significant 
reduction in UI premiums. This would free up money that could be 
put back into the economy, thus helping to create jobs.
<P>
	The federal government made a very timid move in this 
direction, but without any real results. The 5 cent reduction decided 
on by the federal government will not have a real effect on 
employment. It could have been a much larger reduction, 
something like 40 cents for every $100 in earnings, so as to put a 
significant amount back into the economy and actually produce 
jobs.
<P>
	The most productive money is not the money we invest in the 
system of government, in the bureaucracies. It would perhaps be 
more helpful in terms of job creation to invest money directly in 
the private sector, in the economy.
<P>
	Another point is that this UI fund should be turned over to those 
who ultimately fund it. Until then, the emphasis could be on 
short-term projects. I know there is one in the Lower St. Lawrence 
to enable forestry workers to have more weeks of work from year 
to year and less need of employment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	This project was put to the minister long ago. We are waiting to 
hear from him. Perhaps we will have good news soon. This claim 
has been pending a long time. It was supported by the Bloc 
Quebecois. It was regularly part of our arguments against 
employment insurance. The surplus must serve the community 
more. It must target a specific clientele, like seasonal workers, 
people who do not necessarily have specialized training, so as to 
ensure that they are properly trained to respond to market 
conditions.
<P>
	This is another possible use that must be advocated, developed in 
a proactive approach. The surplus money must be used to provide 
in-house training and thus prevent people who lost their job from 
ending up on EI, and provide them instead with the opportunity to 
upgrade their skills while they are still employed, in order to fill the 
new positions created by the new economy.
<P>
	There is a third solution I would have liked to see in the budget, 
namely stopping the cuts to transfer payments and, if possible, 
increasing them. The finance minister's documents brush a very 
revealing employment picture. They show that since 1976 
employment has  increased in the private sector, but decreased in 
the public sector. At the end of the day, people who lost their job in 
the public sector may not have found another job in the private 
sector, and they may not have found a job with the same conditions. 
This situation has created insecurity.
<P>
	This year, if, instead of hiding the lower deficit from us, in order 
to be able to throw out some election goodies, the federal 
government had instead decided to inject the money back into 
transfer payments, the provinces would not be experiencing the 
difficulties they are at present with their health and education 
budgets, and would have been able to maintain employment on a 
more meaningful and more significant basis, while maintaining 
services at a still more worth while level.
<P>
	These are, therefore, three approaches to the employment 
question that are not included in the budget. The reason they are not 
there is that the government has made no commitment to really 
tackle this problem of unemployment. This is rather strange since 
the government was elected on a platform promising ``jobs, jobs, 
jobs''. Yet, after three years, when the Liberal candidates face their 
constituents, they will be asked: ``Yes, it is true, you fought the 
deficit, there were cuts in transfer payments, there were 
tremendous pressures on the unemployment insurance fund, but 
what did you do to provide us with jobs? Did you provide a climate 
favourable to job creation? Yes, interest rates are low, but that did 
not give me a job''.
<P>
	The lowering of interest rates is very often good for the 
introduction of new technologies, but if we do not want that the 
victim be the person who loses his or her job, we have to find ways 
to give that person another job, we have to be proactive. This is an 
element you will not find in the budget.
<P>
	The workshop participants, Bloc members, people who take this 
issue at heart, who are aware of the what is really going on around 
them, also suggested to me other solutions that they thought should 
be in the budget to help the employment issue.
<P>
	First, the dramatic reduction of paperwork required from small 
and medium size businesses. Today, a small business owner who is 
just starting or is already an owner must go through endless red 
tape when he wants to create an extra job. He must get employer's 
numbers, approach health and safety organizations, the human 
resources development department, as well as many other 
organizations. This has a demoralizing effect on the business 
owner, who will tend to ask his employees to work extra hours or 
try to find other similar solutions, but all this does not allow for a 
better sharing of jobs.
<P>
	Therefore, paperwork reduction is a specific point that could 
have been put forward, but this budget does not consider this as 
crucial.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9349"> 9349 </A></B>
<P>
	The establishment of a progressive retirement plan could have 
been another interesting point.
<P>
	It is crucial to follow up on small and medium size businesses 
during the first three years, the critical years for them. They are 
now offered interesting start-up programs, but they often have a 
high rate of failure because there is no adequate follow-up. Is there 
anything specific to help these businesses? I have not seen anything 
about that in the budget and I find this deplorable. This would be 
important, because it is small and medium size businesses that 
create more than 80 per cent of new jobs in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	Another thing would be to see how we could make retirement 
plans and mutual funds beneficial to those who invest in Quebec or 
Canadian businesses. In this regard, as in others, the budget lacks 
initiative and innovation.
<P>
	The government could also have found ways to make overtime 
less appealing for employers and workers, so as to lead them to 
provide work for more people. A fundamental change is taking 
place in our society in this area.
<P>
	There are also other avenues to explore concerning employment 
that were left out of the budget. We need a well focused strategy for 
people who do not necessarily have very extensive training, such as 
literacy programs. Incidentally, this is literacy week. Our society 
would greatly benefit from investing in that sector, and ensuring 
that people with reading disabilities have access to all the tools 
they need to learn and to overcome their difficulties. Thus, they 
would increase their chances of finding a new job.
<P>
	Today, most jobs require better reading and mental skills. We 
must allow those who did not get the chance to develop these skills 
to do so. A lot of money could have been invested in literacy, but 
the budget makes no provision in this regard.
<P>
	The budget also seeks to stabilize the monetary policy. More 
could have been done in this area. The government realized that it 
contributed to the recession by being too restrictive in the past. 
There should be an inflation target range. There must also be some 
security inthis regard. We do not find these conditions in this 
budget, and I deplore it.
<P>
	The minister lacked originality, and therefore the budget is not 
very interesting. It is rather dull. One of the financial experts 
invited to comment on the budget before a chamber of commerce 
said: ``I must tell you that I had prepared myself to give you a lot of 
information, but this is a non-budget''. Aside from a few crumbs, 
there are not really any interesting new items in this budget.
<P>
	There is a matter that is particularly close to my heart. More 
specifically, it is the issue of rural development. Why do we not 
find in this budget measures to help build senior citizens residences 
in small municipalities? Our rural communities are in dire need of 
that. The population of rural communities is aging. There is a need 
for 10 to 15 room residences. Seniors could stay in the community 
where they have lived all their life. It would be easier for their 
children to visit. The regional economy would get a boost while 
seniors would have a better quality of life. But there is nothing in 
the budget about that.
<P>
	People at CMHC do what they can, but their mandate is to ensure 
viability in strictly economical terms. The government should have 
undertaken to build senior citizens homes in towns and villages and 
contribute that way to keep these communities vibrant. But it 
shirked these responsibilities. This kind of development would 
have been quite interesting.
<P>
	American pensions is another humanitarian issue I have been 
talking about quite often, and I am disappointed the government 
did not suggest any solution to that. For more that a year now, the 
minister has known that the new fiscal convention between Canada 
and the United States would penalize low income earners. For 
example, a person who gets an $8,000 pension from the United 
States had to declare half of this anount in his income thax return at 
the end of the year. That person only had to declare $4,000 and 
could get back a portion of the tax he paid because his income was 
so low. The tax refund gave him a break.
<P>
	The new fiscal convention signed by the government-and the 
fincnace minister has already admitted it is unfair-will result in 
that tax being deducted at source. So the person who gets $8,000 
from the American government will now see his cheque reduced by 
25 per cent at source. There is no way he can get this money back. 
Therefore, instead of receiving $8,000, this person only gets 
$6,000, $2,000 being paid directly to the American Treasury. There 
is no way for the person to recover that money.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	We are not talking here about high income people. In my own 
riding, some people between 55 and 60 have these pension benefits 
as their only income. That is all they have to pay their rent and their 
food. They have been reduced to utter poverty.
<P>
	The finance minister has acknowledged that problem months 
ago. I know Canada and the U.S. have a tax convention, and it is 
very hard to change that. It can take months or years, but, in the 
meantime, we could have come up with temporary solutions.
<P>
	When calculating the income supplement, for example, we could 
allow such a pensioner to report only the real amount he or she is 
getting from the U.S. But no, the  government refused to be 
flexible, refused to change the legislation in the budget so that only 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9350"> 9350 </A></B>
<P>
the net amount would be considered. So, we still have to use the 
gross amount.
<P>
	This is sheer nonsense. In theory, an individual who receives 
$8,000 in revenue from the Americans must report $8,000 as 
revenue for the calculation of his supplement, even if he is only 
getting $6,000. This is unacceptable, especially since, to correct 
this injustice, we only needed a small change, not a major one, for 
which the government would have got the consent of the 
opposition, but it was not meant to be.
<P>
	Other alternatives could have been considered to ensure that the 
people who receive a small pension are not penalized. Why could 
we not find a way to reimburse them until the tax treaty with the 
United States can be amended? Maybe that is why people are more 
frustrated with the current situation. The government is not acting 
fast enough to remedy human tragedies like these.
<P>
	There always has to be political pressure or media coverage, 
when logic alone should be enough to bring the government to act. 
But it did not in this case. I think the government should have acted 
faster and worked harder to remedy the situation.
<P>
	Thus, this budget does not aim at reducing unemployment. It 
does not have a clear and definite goal. Neither the finance minister 
nor the Prime Minister stood to say: ``From now on, our main 
target will be the unemployment. From now on, we will have 
targeted strategies to be able to solve our problems. In our capacity 
as an employer, we, the federal government will introduce 
measures that will lead to a reduction in overtime and an increase 
in time sharing. For private employers, not only will we create 
favourable conditions such as lower interest rates, but we will also 
introduce measures that will help our young people find a job and 
build a career. We will also see to it that businesses that have been 
in existence for a year or two can get adequate management advice 
to help them through this critical phase''.
<P>
	We do not find any of these things in the budget, and I think the 
Liberal government will be judged on the way it has not fulfilled its 
main mandate. There are still 1.5 million unemployed in Canada. 
The Liberals condemned this situation in 1993 but nothing has 
changed.
<P>
	Is it that the people opposite are not doing their job effectively? I 
do not think so. I think there is a problem with the system as well, 
because it is highly complex: there are two labour codes and there 
are two governments involved in various matters to do with 
employment. It is very complex. I think all these should be 
returned to a single level of government to permit effective action.
<P>
	In the meantime, the federal government has skirted the 
objective that Quebecers and Canadians wanted it to  target: to 
reduce unemployment. There is no such objective, and for all these 
reasons, I think we will have to vote against the budget to make
<P>
sure people understand clearly who decided what and how the 
federal government failed to meet its responsibilities in the matter 
of unemployment.
