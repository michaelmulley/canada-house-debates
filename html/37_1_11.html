</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that Bill 
C-8, an act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada 
and to amend certain acts in relation to financial institutions. 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, Bill C-8 is a major bill, 
over 900 pages in length.  It is, I believe, the biggest ever 
placed before the House.  It is the outcome of a great deal of 
work and consultation in all sectors, including consumers and 
the members of the House of Commons. 
In fact, the latter had already seen this bill during the last 
parliament. At that time it was called Bill C-38. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With it, we aim to reform the strategic framework of the 
Canadian financial services sector, which comprises Canadian and 
foreign banks, trust companies, insurance companies, co-operative 
credit associations and other financial institutions.  We have 
proposed a few minor changes to Bill C-38.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence this is the very same bill but with technical, 
grammatical and editorial improvements, as well as some 
clarifications where stakeholders identified points of confusion 
about the intent or application of the policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Canadian Bankers Association pointed out that 
under Bill C-38 it was unclear whether new financial sector 
holding companies could hold portfolio investments.  The fact is 
that this is allowed and is now clearly stated.  I thank the 
Canadian Bankers Association for its incredibly valuable input in 
the new bill, as well as that of all other industry and consumer 
driven stakeholder associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt that Canada's financial services sector is 
critical to us.  It is critical as an industry, one of the truly 
great industries of the country, employing over 500,000 Canadians 
directly.  It is highly export oriented, with more than 50% of 
the revenue from the insurers and the banks coming in from 
abroad.  Most of the global taxes are paid in Canada, over 80%, 
and close to 90% of their global employees are in Canada.  If we 
set out to devise through an industrial policy an industry that 
would be ideal for Canada, we could probably find none better 
than our financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to us for the role it plays in our society 
and in our economy.  After all, without financial intermediation, 
the capacity to deposit and withdraw funds, and to send funds 
around the world, where would we as individuals and our 
businesses be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go abroad we find in many parts of the world that 
Canadian financial institutions are predominant in those foreign 
markets, giving a role of leadership not only to foreigners but 
also Canadians who want to do business in particular foreign 
jurisdictions.  We have an important responsibility, therefore, 
to maintain the health and the vigour of this great industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because they operate within a legislative framework determined 
by parliament it is essential that we have ongoing reviews of 
financial services legislation.  This is probably the most 
extensive review that has ever been undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of an extensive consultation going back to the 
MacKay task force which reported to parliament, the finance 
committee of the House and the Senate banking committee held 
extensive public hearings and reported back to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister then tabled before the House a white paper in June 
1999, which again allowed for extensive consultation and input 
from all stakeholders.  The bill was finally tabled last June as 
Bill C-38 and but for the election I am sure would have been law 
today.  We are back to do the job, which is the culmination of 
all this great input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four major themes in the bill.  The first is 
encouraging the flexibility of our financial services both 
domestically and globally.  To do so we have put in place a 
number of options and facilitating devices. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first and probably most important is the holding company 
option.  This means that our institutions will be able to compete 
in Canada with the foreign monolines such as credit card and 
lending companies that are coming here in an unregulated manner. 
We will give them that level playing field.  It will also give 
them flexibility in the way they structure their Canadian and 
global operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point in terms of flexibility is that we are 
allowing a change in the ownership rules.  This means that any 
shareholder, which under the current law would be limited to 10%, 
could go up to 20% of equity or 30% of non-voting shares.  This 
is to give our institutions the flexibility to enter into 
strategic alliances and joint ventures with other institutions 
here and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area where we are helping them compete better is with 
respect to the merger review process.  We have set out in the 
guidelines a process which must be followed for the major banks 
to enter into a merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will offer certainty of process.  At the same time it 
envisages hearings before both the Senate banking committee and 
the House of Commons finance committee.  There is a great 
opportunity for public input because the final decision on 
mergers rests with the minister.  He and Canadians must be 
convinced that any merger which takes place is in the best 
interest of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major thrust of the legislation is to encourage 
domestic competition in Canada.  The reason for this is that we 
believe our customers are best served where there is vigorous 
competition in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we doing this?  We want it to be easier for people to 
set up smaller banks or community based banks.  This is why we 
are lowering the minimum capital that a bank must have or an 
institution must have from $10 million to $5 million.  We think 
this will lead to new types of community banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also seeing under the evolution of this sector new banks 
associated with retailing institutions such as President's Choice 
Financial, a relationship between the Loblaws companies and CIBC 
which does their backroom work on a contract basis.  This is a 
bank which now has over 400,000 customers and over $2 billion in 
assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way we are facilitating competition is with the new 
three tier size based ownership regime.  If the equity is under 
$1 billion it can be wholly owned.  Again this will help new 
banks to get established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the new size based ownership regime is between $1 billion and 
$5 billion, up to 65% of the shares can be owned or controlled by 
one shareholder and the rest must be the subject of a public 
float on the market.  If the equity is over $5 billion, such as 
with our major banks and demutualized insurance companies, the 
rule is that these institutions should be widely held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing new measures to encourage domestic competition 
with respect to credit unions, particularly those outside Quebec 
which do not have significant size and therefore economies of 
scale and are thus facing higher costs of operating and serving 
their customers who are also the owners of these unique community 
based institutions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1115

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked very closely with the credit union movement to 
help give them greater competitiveness.  This is why, working 
with them, we have come up with an entity called a national 
service entity.  This would allow them to combine to get 
economies of scale.  It would enable them, for example, to issue 
a common credit card, and they could roll out new service 
offerings across provincial borders.  This is a major step 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a brief word about co-operative banks.  This was a 
very important consideration brought forward by the MacKay 
committee and endorsed by the committees of the House and the 
other place.  We have been working with the credit union movement 
to find out exactly what type of co-operative bank legislation 
should be brought forward.  Unfortunately, the big group with 
whom we were working fell away from this project, but we have 
continued to study it and we will continue to study it, running 
on a parallel basis to Bill C-8.  When the model is in place we 
will issue it and we will have extensive consultations, because 
we know there are provincial concerns and there are concerns 
within the credit union movement.  We will subject that new 
measure to the same type of extensive input from the communities, 
the industries and the consumer groups, so that when we do come 
forward with the legislation it will meet the needs as expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth way in which we are encouraging domestic competition 
here in Canada is through the entry of foreign banks via 
branches.  This legislation was in place a couple of years ago, 
again as a result of extensive consultation, but we have enhanced 
it in this legislation to bring the foreign banking regime in 
Canada up to a level playing field with Canadian institutions, 
again requiring amendments in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fifth way in which we are encouraging domestic competition for 
the benefit of consumers is by opening up to the payment system 
the operations of life insurers, security dealers and money 
market mutual funds.  This means that these new institutions 
would be able to have funds of a customer on hand and the 
customer would be able to exercise chequing privileges on that 
account, again enhancing competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third major heading under this bill is the protection of 
customers.  We think customers are best protected under any 
regime where there is maximum competition, so I have outlined 
what the government is doing in terms of enhancing competition. 
However, even with competition we have found in the past that 
there were those who remained unbanked; basic financial services 
were not available to them.  This is why the government has taken 
measures under the heading of access.  We are ensuring that 
Canadians have access to the financial services they need.  We 
have introduced measures which would require the opening of 
accounts with a minimum amount of ID.  Past credit or employment 
history, provided there is no fraud, would not be a bar to 
cashing government cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I have recently entered into a memorandum of 
understanding, a signed agreement, with eight of the large 
deposit taking institutions, which would make basic bank accounts 
available for Canadians.  They are not all the same.  This is not 
a cookie cutter, because we believe that competition will benefit 
consumers.  However, each institution has come up with its own 
basic account with a minimum number of transactions, be they in 
person or via the Internet.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs are set forth and range among the five from $2.95 to 
$4 a month.  We are making sure that those who can least afford 
it have access to the basic banking they need to get off welfare, 
to be able to deposit that cheque so it is safe and secure, and 
to pay their bills, including rent.  This is important because, 
really, it is almost impossible to get off welfare if one does 
not have access to this type of basic banking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we have put in place rules for the closure of bank 
branches because that could be another way that access to basic 
services might be denied.  We do not treat the banks as 
utilities; what we have said is that if they want to close a 
branch, that is their business decision.  We are not going to 
force them to operate branches that are not profitable.  That 
would undermine the strength of our financial services sector. 
However, what we have said is that they have to give notice.  If 
the branch is in an urban area, they must give four months' 
notice so people can make alternative arrangements.  If the 
branch is in a rural or less populated area, they must give six 
months' notice.  This is so the community itself can find 
alternatives for the provision of these basic banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the alternatives will come from other institutions. With 
the closure of many branches in some of the western provinces, we 
have seen how provincial credit unions have come in and bought up 
those branches, at the same time ensuring ongoing employment to 
all of the employees who otherwise would have been affected. This 
is one of the virtues of giving notice.  The federal government 
is also prepared to play a role in remote communities. Perhaps 
the post office could be the place people could look to for basic 
banking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where we have had the views and interests of 
consumers in mind is the financial consumer agency of Canada. 
Right now there are three federal departments in Ottawa that deal 
with enforcing our laws as they relate to consumers:  Industry 
Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions and the finance department itself.  We are putting 
all of these operations under one roof.  There will be savings in 
the costs of administration in so doing.  It will be much more 
effective and efficient.  We think this is a step forward for 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had in place for a number of years the Canadian banking 
ombudsman.  In this bill we are trying to expand the role of the 
Canadian banking ombudsman so that it covers all financial 
institutions.  In an era of conglomeration where different types 
of financial institutions, such as banks, insurers and trust 
companies, are coming under the same ownership and the same roof, 
we think consumers would be better served if they could go to one 
dispute resolution centre for all their disputes regarding 
financial services, as opposed to having to find different ones 
depending upon what type of financial service they are having 
difficulties with.  We also believe that the financial 
institutions sector will be better served by having this type of 
single dispute resolution centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course under the constitution we cannot mandate that entities 
which are not owned by banks have to come to this centre.  That 
is why we have undertaken to work in very close co-operation with 
the joint forum of financial regulators from the provinces to 
find a way to bring together the disparate dispute resolution 
mechanisms aimed at helping consumers today.  We welcome the 
efforts undertaken by Dina Palozzi of the Financial Services 
Commission of Ontario and Doug Hyndman from the British Columbia 
Securities Commission, who are heading up this task force which 
also has representation from the federal government.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth major thrust of the bill is to ensure that on an 
ongoing basis we have responsible but responsive regulation of 
the sector.  Of course safety and soundness have to be number 
one.  That is why the bill has a number of measures which give 
enhanced powers to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions to intervene where there are difficulties, to remove 
directors if necessary and to impose fines where there is blatant 
disregard of our regulatory regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we want to ease the regulatory burden.  This is 
why we are streamlining the approval system.  Many approvals 
would be done on an exception basis:  a request for an approval, 
if it goes to OSFI and is not denied within 30 days, would be 
deemed automatically passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical as we go ahead that we have in place an evolving, 
dynamic regulatory regime, because we are seeing incredible 
changes with globalization, with exploding technology, with 
conglomeration and with consolidation, all of it taking place on 
a global basis.  Our regulatory regime must be capable of keeping 
up with this.  That is why in Bill C-8 we have reserved to the 
minister many areas of ministerial discretion.  If it were there 
in black and white law, it would require an act of the House to 
change it.  That is why we want, in many areas, to have this 
ministerial discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a minimum, within five years this law will sunset, again 
triggering, I hope, vigorous debate, with a telescope on the 
future looking at where the sector is heading, but because the 
changes in this industry and sector are so dynamic and so global, 
we cannot predict where they are going to be.  We cannot predict 
what types of countermoves or accommodating moves we must make in 
order to ensure that we have a dynamic, competitive sector 
helping our consumers and competing globally.  This is why we are 
committed as a government to reviewing the bill, not just five 
years from now but at any time sooner should it be necessary to 
do so, and then making the necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank the stakeholders, the institutions, the 
financial sector, consumers' groups, members of this House and 
members of the other House.  I particularly thank finance 
officials who have worked so assiduously on this, as well as 
those in OSFI and the other institutions, for bringing the bill 
to fruition in what I believe is a very responsible and critical 
way.  Because the bill has had input from so many, I believe that 
it behooves us as parliamentarians to give it serious 
consideration.  Because we have already had the input, I ask that 
it receive speedy passage.  I would hope that it goes from this 
Chamber as quickly as possible into committee, where the real 
detailed work can be done and the witnesses can be heard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-8 is a bill to 
establish the financial consumer agency of Canada and to amend 
certain acts in relation to financial institutions.  While we in 
the Canadian Alliance are very supportive of the bill in most 
respects, we maintain that the government has been very slow in 
modernizing the regulations in the acts that govern banking and 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in power since 1993.  This is the first 
major piece of banking legislation, or legislation covering the 
other types of institutions outlined in the bill, that the 
government has brought in.  As a result of it being so slow to 
react to global conditions, the global economy and what has been 
happening in industry in other countries around the world, we 
have seen ourselves, our banks, our institutions, our securities 
companies and our life insurance companies being left 
considerably behind other countries that have been more forward 
thinking in modernizing the financial institutions in their 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should have played a more leading role in setting an 
example for other countries to follow.  As parliamentarians know, 
we have one of the safest and finest banking financial services 
industry in the world.  We have been for the most part very 
prudent in setting regulations and ensuring that Canadians had a 
good financial services system to serve them.  At the same time, 
until 1993 we were quite forward thinking in providing the tools 
for our domestic banks to compete in global opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had all the reasons to set Canada up as a standard throughout 
the world for other countries to follow.  Unfortunately the 
Liberal government did not take that initiative.  It has played 
the role of a follower rather than a leader.  For all the talk 
about how much good the government has done and how much 
attention it has paid to this sector of our economy, it has not 
been the leader that it should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I may now have some nice things to say about 
Bill C-8.  It calls to modernize Canada's financial services 
industry.  Canadian consumers have been demanding a more 
competitive financial services sector and more choices as to 
where they do their financial business.  In addition, the players 
in the industry, the banks, the insurance companies and 
securities companies have been requesting more flexibility to 
catch up with their competitors in the global economy so that 
they can take part in opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By catching up, I refer to having the provisions to make 
acquisitions within Canada and having in place a formal merger 
approval process.  If they decided that it would be in their best 
interests and the best interests of their customers to merge with 
another domestic bank, they would have a formal process to 
follow.  They would not have to leave anything to chance nor 
would they have their proposals subject to interpretation by a 
number of different parties that have an interest in this merger. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation there will be a formal process.  One would 
assume that if this is a process that has some sound reasoning 
behind it, two banks will be able to sit down and say that this 
is the criteria they have to meet, these are the steps they have 
to take and if they do, they can expect, according to the 
legislation, approval of the merger.  That allows them to do some 
long term planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this business, as a bank or an insurance company, one has to 
be able to have that opportunity to look far beyond tomorrow, 
certainly in order to set one's business plans in place.  We have 
some criticism with the five year sunset clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the legislation took about seven years, and now the 
government has promised to review it in five years, I believe the 
financial services industry, while welcoming the five year 
renewal in relation to what we have gone through, would like to 
have the opportunity to see far beyond that.  They would like to 
see 10, 15, 20 years down the road.  The government perhaps could 
have put the sunset clause together a little differently or else 
left it out altogether.  It could have simply had an ongoing 
review process where amendments to the act could easily be made 
rather than having a sunset review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many aspects to the bill of almost 900 pages.  While 
we have some areas of concern, I did state that it addresses many 
of the things the Canadian Alliance finance group, of which I am 
the critic when it comes to banks and financial institutions, has 
been pressing the government for a number of years to get with 
the program in relation to making some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to 1994 when I believe the first white paper was 
brought in by a former secretary of state who had many years in 
the banking industry.  Nothing was done.  I think back to a 
couple of years later when there was another study done.  Again, 
nothing was done.  Then we had the MacKay task force report which 
was about two years ago.  Finally, we had the legislation ready 
to go and then the Prime Minister in his wisdom, wisdom and 
Liberals seems to be an oxymoron at times, called an early 
election.  Bill C-38 died at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the secretary of state was delivering his address in 
closing, he thanked a number of people.  I would like to point 
out to him that he forgot to thank the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley.  When I read over the legislation, I was 
quite flattered because I and our party were way ahead the 
government in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998 I delivered a report to our caucus, and to 
anyone in the industry who cared to read it.  It was called 
“Competition: Choice You Can Bank On”.  It covered a whole 
myriad of things in the financial services sector.  It was 
accepted by our party and was applauded by practically everyone 
in the financial services sector as a forward thinking plan for 
the future of financial services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really flattered when I read the bill because our party and 
I used my 1998 report as a benchmark to scrutinize Bill C-38, now 
C-8.  There is an astonishingly close similarity between what is 
in the legislation and what is in my November 1998 report. 
I am sure the secretary of state simply forgot to thank me.  I 
know he read and reread my 1998 report in order to get a good 
grasp on what was needed to be put in here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about some of the points we support such as the 
legislation that allows a bank to develop into a holding 
structure.  It is going to give banks far more flexibility to 
compete, particularly with foreign banks that are coming here, 
not necessarily establishing bricks and mortars but a credit card 
company, or banking by phone or lending by phone.  This will 
greatly enhance our domestic banks to compete with foreign banks. 
Certainly we want foreign banks to establish their branches in 
Canada.   It goes back to giving consumers choices.  We support 
the new provision to allow the banks to restructure under a 
holding company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about increased access to the payment system which 
will allow life insurance companies and security companies to 
basically operate like banks as far as deposits and cash 
clearing.  This will end the monopoly over the payment system 
that the banks have had and will increase the choices once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the ability for credit unions to expand into a 
national bank structure owned by one member one vote.  We noticed 
that was not in the legislation, but we know that perhaps this 
will be dealt with in a separate piece of legislation.  We are 
going to ask the secretary of state to put it on record.   We 
support that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision to allow banks to set up under a smaller 
capitalization is going to increase choice once again.  Those 
parties will be able to set up smaller regional banks with an 
initial $5 million capitalization.  I hope that investors who 
want to get into the banking business will take advantage of this 
provision.  Again, we have increased choice for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the formal review process for mergers and we 
support that.  We are quite pleased about the absence of the 
banks' ability to retail insurance and auto leasing through their 
branches.  That has been left out of the bill and the 
prohibition still remains.  There is no doubt that some day, 
sooner or later, the banks will be in the auto leasing and in the 
insurance business.  I do not know if that is going to be such a 
bad thing.  However, because that provision is not in the bill, 
it gives the auto leasing business and the insurance business, 
which is a very competitive and vibrant business in Canada, a 
chance now to begin to lay plans for the most assured entry of 
the banks into those businesses.  It gives them some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to representatives from the industry and have said 
that the banks will not be out forever, but here is some 
breathing room.  I told them not to miss the opportunity to start 
laying some plans for the impact of the banks coming into their 
business.  I hope they are making plans to mitigate the impact of 
banks coming into that business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the financial consumer agency of Canada, our 
party has some concerns in as much as the agency will report to 
parliament through the Minister of Finance.  We are quite 
concerned with the fact that within the bill there are tremendous 
powers given to the Minister of Finance.  We believe those powers 
should be given to parliament, and by extension, the finance 
committee as opposed to the Minister of Finance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the financial consumers agency as an example. 
While the bill calls for that agency to report to parliament 
through the Minister of Finance, we would prefer that the agency 
report directly to the House.  By extension, this would allow a 
review process to be done by an all party finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that would serve Canadians better in terms of openness 
and a non-partisan look at what the financial consumer agency has 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope we will be able to deal with this in committee.  I know 
the government is anxious to make improvements to the 
legislation, perhaps through amendments in committee, and I am 
sure it will welcome that amendment with open arms and will get 
on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the financial services ombudsman and, 
again, the financial consumer agency.  I just hope and pray that 
this will not be another means for the Liberal government to give 
jobs to its friends, something we have seen so many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect a number of defeated Liberals may appear on these 
boards.  I hope the government will be able to surprise us and 
that we will see some people who have never expressed any type of 
strong Liberal leanings, as impossible as that may sound, when it 
comes to government appointments.  We will look forward to that. 
I see the hon. member nodding his head again so I know he likes 
the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the bill, of course, but we will raise our 
concerns through amendments.  I want to straighten out the 
secretary of state.  He seems to have the idea that regulating 
low cost bank accounts of $2, $3 and $4 a month will somehow get 
Canadians off welfare.  I fail to see the direct correlation 
between having a bank account and getting off welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons why people are on welfare.  First, 
people, through circumstances that are no fault of their own, are 
unable to work.  We have a responsibility to look after such 
people through the social welfare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there are those people who simply do not want to work 
and just love welfare Wednesday, and they will never work whether 
they have a low cost bank account or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other people on social assistance who would dearly 
love to work but unfortunately, in a number of the provinces and 
throughout the country, there simply are no jobs.  This situation 
exists because while we have been able to generate quite a bit of 
revenue from our export economy, our domestic economy still needs 
a lot of help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that the federal government, working in co-operation 
with provincial governments, could do far better in providing an 
environment that would ensure a buoyant economy right across the 
country, and not just in pockets where there are conservative 
governments such as in Ontario and Alberta, which have booming 
economies despite the deterrents presented by the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would prefer that the government, instead of counting on low 
cost bank accounts to get people off welfare, took a serious look 
at how it has been curtailing economic growth and how this has 
not helped investors and businesses create new jobs for people on 
welfare.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my colleague from Saanich—Gulf Islands has a lot of good 
things to say about the bill, both from a supportive point of 
view and a critical point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to committee, as I know do members of the 
government, the secretary of state, his parliamentary secretary 
and everyone connected with the bill on the finance committee. 
They are very anxious to see the amendments we put forward.  They 
will appreciate the wisdom of them and be very supportive. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand on behalf of all people of 
Saanich—Gulf Islands to speak to the bill.  We saw it in the 
last parliament as Bill C-38; it is now Bill C-8.  It died on the 
order paper when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe a huge thanks to the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley who just spoke.  He wrote a very detailed, in depth report 
titled “Competion: Choice You Can Bank On” back in November 1998.  I had 
been elected for just over a year at that time and remember 
receiving a copy of the report. It was very detailed and very 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went into every possible detail of financial institutions and 
banking and how we could improve it for consumers and give them 
more choices.  There was broad consultation with the industry.  I 
was impressed by how much work went into the report and by how 
much knowledge he had on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years later we in the opposition see exactly what work we 
have done.  Actually the government adopted a lot of it and of 
course never gave any credit for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  He has 
done a phenomenal amount of work in the financial services sector 
over the last few years.  He can be proud when he sees the 
government actually adopting a number of his measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what the bill will do.  As we have seen in the 
last few years, a number of major banks wanted to merge.  They 
put forward proposals to do so which were all quashed by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the government has finally come out 
with a formal merger process so that at least financial 
institutions know where they stand.  They literally invested 
millions and millions of dollars to go through the process, only 
to be stopped in the end.  Some would argue it may have been for 
political reasons, that the Minister of Finance was annoyed 
because he did not get advance notice.  That is not the right 
reason to stop mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our interest has to be consumers, to ensure that their savings 
and investments will be secure in these institutions.  We should 
also allow the institutions to compete more in the global economy 
and offer more choices for consumers.  I am pleased to say, as my 
colleague has stated, we believe that will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of very positive aspects to the bill.  We are 
pleased to see that the government left out the auto leasing and 
insurance sectors at this time.  I agree with my colleague.  I do 
not think it is appropriate to bring them in at this point in 
time.  There was a lot of lobbying by financial institutions that 
wanted to get into the market.  They recognized that they had 
huge lists of people to whom they could market and offer package 
services, from auto leasing to insurance to banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insurance and auto leasing sectors right now do a very good 
job and are very competitive.  As the hon. member pointed out, it 
is inevitable that there will be changes in the years to come. 
We should prepare for them, but it is the right decision at this 
point in time not to go down that road.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have some concerns with the creation of a financial 
consumer agency of Canada.  The agency will report directly to 
the Minister of Finance.  We have seen over the last few weeks 
what happens when the government makes appointments based on 
politics, appointments which report to a minister as opposed to 
parliament where there is complete openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when in opposition the Liberals recognized that the ethics 
counsellor should report directly to parliament.  In their very 
first campaign book in 1993, the Liberals stated that the ethics 
counsellor should report directly to parliament so that there is 
openness, transparency and a level of trust for the Canadian 
people.  There have been decisions in recent months that have 
raised many concerns, yet members of parliament have no access to 
the reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same concern is raised here with the financial consumer 
agency.  It would report directly to the Minister of Finance, the 
same minister who I believe will be responsible for appointments 
to these agencies or boards, which may become a political dumping 
ground for defeated candidates or large donors to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that is a bit biased, but the facts speak for 
themselves.  We have seen that so much in the past.  It does not 
end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read a recent press release.  This is enough to make 
anybody throw up.  On Friday, February 8, it stated: “The Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration today announced the appointment of 
Lou Sekora of Coquitlam, B.C. as a part time citizenship judge”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that Mr. Sekora was defeated in the riding of Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam in the last election.  When I 
phoned a few of my colleagues on the other side, Liberal members 
of parliament who are good friends, to tell them about the 
appointment, they started to laugh.  They thought it was 
absolutely hilarious.  It was pure, blatant partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, our concern is when there is not openness and 
transparency.  I have a lot of respect for the Minister of 
Finance but when this type of legislation is introduced it lends 
itself to abuse.  We tend to question whether appointments are 
based on politics or on the real needs of Canadians.  That can 
happen down the road.  I believe the finance committee should be 
given the opportunity to scrutinize and re-look at these 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some concerns we have in the official opposition. 
Again, I only speak from the record.  We also see the massive 
problems with the ethics counsellor.  We will be voting on that 
tomorrow night on the Canadian Alliance opposition supply day 
motion, where members of the government will have an opportunity 
to correct the very same wrong they have put into this 
legislation.  They will have the opportunity to vote on a motion 
to have the ethics counsellor actually report to parliament and 
not to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my colleague from Prince George—Bulkley Valley, who 
is quarterbacking the legislation for the Canadian Alliance, will 
submit proposals to the bill when it goes to committee.  However, 
there are a lot of positives in the bill that we are pleased 
with.  It will give consumers more options and the financial 
institutions the environment where they will be able to compete 
globally, and we are going to a global economy.  Those are some 
areas with which we are quite pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member who first spoke on the bill talked about 
how it would help people on social assistance.  It is an 
incredible stretch to suggest that lower service fees on bank 
accounts will help people on social assistance.  It borderlines 
on preposterous to even suggest that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former premier of British Columbia, Mr. Glen Clark, came up 
with an idea somewhat similar to that by opening a credit union 
in one of the poorer neighbourhoods.  He thought it would help 
those people. 
If the government really wants to help the people who are 
struggling to find jobs and get back on their feet, it should 
adopt some of the tax cut proposals put forward by the member for 
Medicine Hat over the last three years when he was the finance 
critic.  We were pleased to see that the government, almost 
wholeheartedly, adopted a lot of the proposals contained in the 
member's 1998 report entitled “Competition: Choice You Can Bank 
On”, but we would have liked some things to have gone further.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really wants to help people on social 
assistance who are struggling, who do need tax cuts and who do 
need a stronger economy where the business community can thrive, 
it would create economic opportunities for meaningful, 
long-lasting jobs.  That would really help them.  We will 
continue to push these ideas forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new U.S. administration of President Bush, our 
neighbours to the south have embarked on a massive tax cut in the 
neighbourhood of $1.6 trillion.  It believes that the economy is 
beginning to slow down in the United States. I agree with 
President Bush that those tax cuts will likely create more 
government revenues and create more meaningful and lasting jobs. 
It is the private sector that invests money into the businesses 
which creates opportunities for employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the government can create lasting jobs. 
It can create short term jobs and do all types of funding, but at 
the end of the day it does not really create any kind of security 
for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the bill and look forward to it going 
to committee.  I am absolutely confident that we will be putting 
forward some amendments that will strengthen the bill.  This is a 
time for all of us to support the bill, send it off to committee 
where the experts from the industry can scrutinize it and give us 
their input and then put forward some positive solutions to the 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this important bill, Bill C-8—the former Bill 
C-38—to reform the financial institutions and create the 
financial consumer agency of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning of the process leading up to this bill, the 
Bloc Quebecois has been closely associated with the suggestions 
made through the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1998, the Bloc Quebecois also submitted a 
memorandum expressing its view of the MacKay report, which is 
behind financial institution reform. 
We made a number of recommendations in it geared to the 
modernization of the financial sector and especially of the 
environment in which the financial sector and the banking sector 
more specifically were evolving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized the importance of renewing the regulatory and 
statutory context of financial institutions, which had not 
been renewed for five years.  We were in fact behind the time in 
some respects, something that was becoming a cause of concern 
when we could see how quickly the North American and, more 
specifically, the Canadian financial sector was changing.  We 
were somewhat frightened by the thought of developing in a 
context that was already several years out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the first to ask the federal government to change the 
rules on the ownership of financial institutions, which 
prevented businesses from acquiring other businesses in 
complementary sectors, since the financial institutions act did 
not permit it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the brief the Bloc Quebecois tabled in 
1998 with the Standing Committee on Finance, in which we asked 
the government, among other things: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to change the rules on ownership to permit and encourage the 
amalgamation of small and medium-sized financial institutions 
into financial holding companies, as suggested by the 
MacKay-Ducros Report. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, we supported, and we continue to support, changes 
on ownership rules to enable groups, such as insurance 
companies, investment companies or a brokerage firm.  The aim 
was to build strength so that, with markets opening in the 
financial sector and competition appearing from outside the 
country and even from within it, the quality of services 
provided by them could be assessed in a healthy business 
environment and consumers advised of what they would get for 
their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We warned the government against the rule of 10%.  Let me 
explain that, because I think it is worthwhile to do so. It is a 
bit complex, but when we take the time—and I have the time to do 
it this morning—it is easy enough to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the minister introduced his bill, a single individual 
could not hold more than 10% of the banks' shares. This meant 
that 90% of the voting shares of a bank were allotted among the 
public. An individual still cannot hold more than 10% of a 
bank's voting shares and 90% of these shares must be allotted, 
that is they must be widely apportioned among the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes proposed in the bill, we have a totally 
different situation. The 10% rule becomes the 20% rule. This 
means that, in the case of major banks—this applies to them—with 
equity of $5 billion or more, a single individual cannot hold 
more than 20% of the shares, whether that person is a Canadian 
or a foreigner, while 80% of the shares of these major banks, 
again those with equity of over $5 billion, are allotted to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes two other categories regarding ownership. The 
second category includes banks with equity of $1 billion to $5 
billion. For these banks, the degree of ownership is different 
from that of major banks. In the case of these middle size 
banks, a single individual can own up to 65% of the shares. The 
other 35% must be widely distributed among the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major change. We still wonder why, considering that 
the 50% plus one rule is the generally accepted one for full 
control of a business, 65% of the voting shares of a bank such 
as the Laurentian Bank, for example, which has equity of less 
than $5 billion, could be owned by a single individual. The 
other 35% would be allotted among the public in a democratic 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a revolution, a financial one, of course. I call it a 
revolution because, up to now, the philosophy that has driven 
all successive governments since passage of the Bank Act many 
decades ago was to give the financial institutions' shares a 
wide distribution, to prevent an individual from holding too 
much control over the banking institutions or the financial 
institutions in general; as everyone knows these institutions 
have a strategic importance in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of widely distributing the voting shares of a 
financial institution to prevent one individual from holding 
extraordinary power over the Canadian financial sector or even 
industrial sectors stems from a policy that was renewed from 
decade to decade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to realize that the financial sector is a public 
interest sector in the sense that multimedia companies, 
companies in conventional industries or anywhere else have to be 
able to rely on a solid, open and transparent financial sector, 
one that will not be detrimental but rather useful to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a single individual controlling a financial institution, 
that could be a lending institution for SMBs, could give rise to 
touchy situations as far as conflicts of interest are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example. The main shareholder of a medium sized bank 
owns more than 50% of the voting shares of the bank, which makes 
loans to small businesses. But the main investor or shareholder 
of the bank is also involved in the same industry as a small 
business that is asking for a loan from the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shareholder who owns more than 50% of the voting shares and 
therefore has full control of the bank making loans to small 
businesses will have the final say on the loan request of the 
business in the industry where the main shareholder is also 
involved. The main shareholder of a bank can also be an 
industrialist in a given industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, we have avoided this kind of situation where an 
industrialist involved, say, in the steel industry, who has full 
control of a lending institution can sideline his competitors 
because such control allows him to have the last say on loan 
requests from competitors. This has been avoided in the past 
through widely held ownership of financial institutions and 
especially banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a dangerous situation where, in banks with a capital 
between $1 billion and $5 billion, a single person can own up to 
65% of voting shares. That individual has full control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not like this. In Quebec, we have one institution in the 
category of medium sized banks in Canada, and that is the 
National Bank, the bank used by SMBs in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is very dangerous for an institution such as the 
National Bank to end up with rule changes whereby one person 
could hold 65% of shares, while the remaining 35% would be held 
by a wide range of members of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some said that there were no longer any problem, that it had 
been addressed with Bill C-8, formerly C-38, and that in any 
event the National Bank now had equity capital topping 
$4 billion, which could soon reach, and even exceed, the 
$5 billion ceiling, putting it into the category of a major 
Canadian bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that event, the same ownership rules applying to those banks 
would also apply to the National Bank. No one individual could 
hold more than 20% of shares, and 80% of other voting shares 
would then be widely held, thus eliminating the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways of looking at this: the first is that the 
National Bank does not yet have $5 billion in equity capital, and 
it could be months before this ceiling is reached. Also, it is 
clear from Bill C-8 that—even if a bank reached a certain level 
of equity capital, even if the National Bank had over $5 billion 
in equity capital—the Minister of Finance has full discretion to 
determine the number of years or months needed before this bank 
can reposition itself in a new category with respect to 
percentage of shares.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A three year period is specified. In other words, 10 months or a 
year from now, the National Bank could reach a level of equity 
capital exceeding $5 billion, which would put it into the 
category of a major bank subject to the ownership rule of 20% of 
the voting shares being held by a single shareholder, whereas 
the other 80% are widely held. It could be considered as such, 
but it is up to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several clauses of the bill refer to the finance minister's 
discretion. The Minister of Finance is given so much 
decision-making power that, with this bill, the government is all 
but crowning him legislative emperor of the financial 
institutions sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Towards the end of the bill, entire paragraphs contain a 
provision saying that the minister may do this and that. 
Finally, this is a bill that could be called discretionary from 
the minister's point of view. It is all about discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, even if the National Bank reached a level of equity 
capital above $5 billion, the finance minister could decide to 
consider it as belonging to the category of 20:80 percentage 
ratio of voting shares only in three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, subclause 393(2) gives the finance minister the power to 
specify a later day as the day from and after which the 
financial institution must comply with the new provisions of the 
law. So, this creates a situation where, even if the National 
Bank reached a level of equity capital exceeding $5 billion 
within the next year, the minister could decide that the new 
category or ownership rule will apply only in three, four or 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This period of three, four or five years is an eternity in the 
financial sector.  Anything can happen during that time.  The 
National Bank might not be protected from a takeover by a single 
individual or by speculators for resale, thus enriching only 
one, two or three individuals instead of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we take that chance?  As I said, three, four or five years 
is an eternity in the financial sector.  Anything can happen 
during that time, especially when one realizes the speed with 
which changes take place.  Ought we not to set some criteria for 
this ownership issue in order to avoid having the negative 
effects of the new provisions blow up in our faces in the coming 
years in connection with the National Bank or some other 
financial institution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to provide hon. members with a slight idea of the speed 
with which changes can take place, I will quote from the 
MacKay-Ducros report, which is what led to the bill being 
drafted by the Minister of Finance and his secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latter indicated that two virtual banks had cropped up 
within two years, as the MacKay-Ducros commission sat.  In less 
than two years, these two virtual banks started up: the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the rate these changes occurred during the

caused the commission to make certain adjustments at the end of 
its deliberations, anything can happen to the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, as Quebecers, need guarantees and additional safeguards, 
within the bill, to reassure us in this regard and essentially 
eliminate the negative effects of the new rules of ownership, by 
taking specific criteria included in the bill into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec finance minister and the deputy premier, Bernard 
Landry, wrote the federal Minister of Finance last June to 
express his concern on the way the situation was changing and on 
the first draft of his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec finance minister and deputy premier, Mr. Landry, said 
in a letter to the federal Minister of Finance that with 
respect to the National Bank public interest in the present 
matter had to be defined according to four criteria, which he 
identified and which would complement the bill before us this 
morning, to the satisfaction of the opposition.  These criteria, 
included in Bill C-8, could eliminate the risks I have just 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria are as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should evaluate the effect of the change on the banks' 
current activities, including the services available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the effect of the change— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a change in ownership of the National Bank, for 
example. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on the head office and the branches, including on professional 
jobs or jobs requiring certain expertise. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the effect of the change on the economy and technological 
development of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the effect of the change on the financial sector and on 
Montreal's role as a financial centre, including the keeping of 
the ultimate decision-making centres in Montreal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Landry continued, saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the legislation should contain provisions ensuring 
respect for these measures, which would be taken to prevent the 
unfavourable effects of allowing one person to hold more than 
20% of the voting shares in a bank in the previously mentioned 
areas. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, is not alone in its concern. 
All of Quebec is worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, when the secretary of state told me about the 
evolution of the bill in this respect, he told me it would be 
different from the first version.  He indicated that, with the 
publication of the new Bill C-8 on the reform of financial 
institutions, the Minister of Finance had released new 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these guidelines, I can tell the House that it would 
not take much to satisfy us with respect to the ownership rules. 
In fact, all that it would take is for these guidelines at the 
very heart of Bill C-8 to be included, so that the minister has a 
legislative obligation to take into account not only the 
interests of the Canadian financial sector, the solvency of 
those who wish to change the ownership of voting shares in a 
bank such as the National Bank, and the experience of such 
shareholders, but also the regional effects of such a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be easy to take the secretary of state's guidelines and 
include them in Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill already contains a suggestion of them. 
It would simply be a matter of completing them with the 
guidelines that accompanied the bill and that were released by 
the Minister of Finance and his Secretary of State when Bill C-8 
on the reform of financial institutions was introduced a few 
days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 396 defines certain criteria to which I more or less 
alluded, namely: the best interests of the financial system, the 
experience of the shareholders and their track record, their 
character and integrity, their competence and experience and the 
impact of any integration of the businesses and operations of 
the applicant with those of the bank on the conduct of those 
businesses and operations.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could add, at the end of that clause, criteria such as the 
impact of the proposed transaction on the safety and soundness>of 
the bank, on direct and indirect employment at the head office 
and in the branches, including professional jobs or those 
requiring special expertise, on the needs of consumers, on the 
bank's businesses and operations, on the bank's prospects in the 
context of the global marketplace, on the best interests of 
Canadians and, where the bank operates principally in one 
region, such as Quebec, on the best interests of those living in 
that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could even add to these guidelines the last paragraph found 
in the document provided by the government, which reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A proposed transaction that would lead to a change in de facto 
control of a former Schedule I bank with equity between $1 
billion and $5 billion, and raises major public interest 
concerns, would be subject to a similar public review process as 
a merger between large banks. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the guidelines on the rescheduling of banks previously listed 
in schedule 1 and whose equity is lower than $5 billion, thus, 
in the government's reference document, there are some 
provisions that alleviate our concerns, if we find in the thrust 
of the bill a reference to the criteria that I have stated, 
including to the last paragraph, which deals with public 
interest, and which also calls for public review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government not doing this? This morning, during a 
briefing with high officials, we were told that introducing 
these criteria and guidelines in the thrust of the bill might 
constrain the government and prevent the finance minister from 
having some flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the finance minister agrees to introduce 
guidelines and criteria such as those in clause 396 of Bill C-8, 
and talks about the interest of the Canadian financial system 
and about more criteria. Regarding the additional criteria 
contained in a guideline, which he says he wants to apply in 
case of a change of ownership of the National Bank, why are 
those criteria already included in the bill less constraining 
than those in the guidelines he has made public and intends to 
follow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the question we must ask ourselves. When talking about 
the interest of the Canadian financial sector is no problem, but 
it is when it comes to the interest of the regional financial 
system, that is the Quebec system, I do not see openness, I see 
a problem. 
The fact is the Minister does not want those guidelines to be 
included in the legislation because that would impose upon him 
the obligation to take all these effects into account. That is 
what is preoccupying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill only referred to guidelines on medium cap banks, 
this would be a step in the right direction and we would 
consider supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I must say there are other problems. However, we intend 
to propose amendments to this bill. For instance, there is the 
issue of consumer protection. I will come back to this issue 
later. We intend to propose amendments that will improve the 
bill generally. 
If it were not for the major irritant, the change of ownership 
rule applying to medium size banks, we would be a bit more 
willing to work with the government in order to pass this bill 
rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to this point, there has been a positive evolution. I recall 
that about eight months ago, the Minister of Finance did not 
want to hear about guidelines or evaluation criteria regarding 
ownership changes for medium size banks. Today, after the 
election, the government is introducing guidelines. This is a 
step in the right direction, even if it is not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government has shown a good disposition until 
now, showing an increasing openness, which we find satisfactory. 
It would only need to go a small step further and I believe that 
we would be ready to fully support its efforts in that 
direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other concerns with this bill. As I said earlier, we 
will be bringing amendments throughout the legislative process 
leading to passage of Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned before the widely held voting shares of the 
financial institutions, including the banks. The concept of 
widely held shares was used to avoid the problems I raised 
earlier. But this has caused more problems, since with these 
widely held shares, any person holding a mere 10% of the 
shares—the maximum soon to be 20% of the shares—has effective 
control over the bank and the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, we have mentioned and wholeheartedly supported the 
proposals of the Quebec association for the protection of savers 
and investors. Its 12 proposals call for a greater 
democratization of the decision making process and of the board 
of directors of the banks and financial institutions in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These proposals are as follows. It may be time for the finance 
minister to pay attention. While he portrays himself as the 
great champion of democracy, he has allowed the boards of 
directors of the banks to act as if they were feudal lords and 
to completely ignore the needs of the small shareholders and 
investors. They do not even need the support of this majority of 
shareholders to appoint each other to key positions. I appoint 
you, you will appoint me, and we will keep things in our little 
inner circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec association for the protection of savers and 
investors' proposals are as follows, and we support them and 
will continue to support them strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the association asks that the positions of chairman of 
the board and chief executive officer be two separate positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the association asks for a reduction of the barriers 
regarding election to the board of candidates chosen by the 
shareholders, instead of candidates being chosen exclusively by 
the board or by the executives in place and instead of a system 
where I appoint you, you appoint me and we appoint ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the association asks that the number of boards where a 
member can sit at the same time be limited. To avoid conflicts 
of interest, this might be a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the association asks for the implementation of a process 
that is more democratic for the election of board members, 
through votes that are separate and cumulative and without any 
restriction to the list previously drawn up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the association asks for the elimination of potential 
conflicts of interest between board members and those who supply 
goods and services to the institution. Too often we see a board 
member who is also part of a business that supplies goods and 
services to the financial institution. It is easy to make such a 
business flourishing in such an environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, the association asks that it be mandatory for financial 
statements to be submitted for review and discussion during the 
shareholders' annual meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, the association asks that the directors' compensation 
policy be submitted to the shareholders' approval. It would be 
interesting if most shareholders could determine what amount a 
board member receives for the services he provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association asks for the adoption of a code of procedure for 
shareholders' meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association calls for businesses to fully record the minutes 
of all shareholders' meetings and to send those minutes to all 
shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association calls for a reduction of barriers to the right 
of shareholders to make proposals for and during shareholders' 
meetings. They do not have that right today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association calls for giving securities commissions the 
right to decide if shareholders' proposals are in order. It is 
the board of directors that has that right at present; 
consequently, this right is exercized only by a very small group 
of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association calls for limiting the powers granted by proxy 
to executives for shareholders' proposals not yet discussed by 
the shareholders or for extending these powers with 
corresponding means to all shareholders having registered a 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the association calls for giving access to all 
shareholders in the name of the real shareholders. 
Finally, it calls for relaxing the legislation in order to allow 
for communications between shareholders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are proposals to improve decision making within financial 
institutions to ensure that decisions are not made by a small 
number of people on behalf of the majority of shareholders, who 
are small shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to see these proposals included in the 
minister's bill since, as we said earlier, banks and boards of 
directors of banks especially operate in a somewhat archaic, 
feudal way that is not quite democratic. The association has 
done excellent work up until now to heighten people's awareness 
about the fact that they own a few shares, but that they do not 
have any say. 
A limited number of individuals all have the power to determine 
what is good for all the shareholders and what is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the process, we are going to propose amendments 
relating to matters of this type.  In the event we obtain a 
favourable response from the government, hon. members can be 
assured that we are not in opposition just to oppose anything 
the party in power happens to present.  If something is good, we 
will support the government's efforts.  In the past seven years 
we have demonstrated that we are prepared to support good 
provisions coming from government for the good of the population 
in general.  We are not here to block the progress of 
government, particularly when the public interest is very much 
involved, as is the case with reform of the financial 
institutions. 
We shall continue to work very seriously in order to improve 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tells us, moreover, that the bill is in place in 
order to improve the environment in which all Quebec and 
Canadian businesses evolve, so that they may better face the 
major challenges that arise, particularly as borders are opening 
up, as globalization sets in.  As a result, major competitors 
that are highly efficient internationally will be able to 
compete in our markets, and we and our businesses will be able 
to compete with them anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As disciples of globalization, we support this policy and this 
government approach. 
However, we are well placed to see that the government gives up 
when the time comes to take action in very specific areas to 
support business.  It is simply not there for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to give a few examples—we will be coming back to this 
a bit later in the session but I think this is a good time to do 
it—examples relating, for example, to gasoline and petroleum 
products. 
Instead of going in the right direction and increasing the 
powers provided under the Competition Act to hold major oil 
companies accountable and allow us to take steps to prove that 
there is collusion among them to set prices that are detrimental 
to consumers, the government chose not to do anything. It chose 
not to strengthen the Competition Act, not to suspend the excise 
tax for a while, which would have given a reprieve to 
independent truckers who are being gouged at the pumps. The 
government also chose not to suspend the GST on heating oil for 
a while to give a break to those who use that type of heating 
fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some businesses that rely heavily on oil for their finished 
products have seen their costs go up by 15% to 20%. This is a 
huge increase. It is their profit margin. But the government did 
not come to their help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for employment insurance, we asked that the system be 
improved and we also asked for lower contributions, particularly 
in light of the tragic situation of labour intensive businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just take the restaurant business. During the election campaign, 
I was made aware of the fact that in the restaurant business 
40% of the taxes paid by businesses are payroll taxes. This is 
enormous. It is more than the income tax paid by these 
businesses to the federal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There again the government should be sensitive to the plight of 
Quebec businesses. Instead of saying “we have the answer, we 
reformed the financial sector and thus ensured the profitability 
of businesses”, the government should do something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for shipyards. Why did the federal government, 
which claims to care about the development and growth of high 
potential businesses, not implement the shipbuilding policy that 
we have been advocating for years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will come back with the bill and we hope there will be good 
provisions from the government, because before the election it 
seemed prepared to pass the bill introduced by my colleague 
from Lévis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mines are a very promising sector in terms of expansion and job 
creation.  The mining sector is not what it used to be.  It has 
been modernized over the years and is very capital intensive. 
In Quebec alone it accounts for 17,000 jobs.  However, it is 
suffering considerable problems due to fluctuations in 
international prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have drawn on its willingness to help 
businesses, increased, for example, financial provisions for 
mining companies. It could have increased tax deductions for 
exploration, and to give the country a shipping and rail 
transportation network that would make the mining sector in 
Quebec and Canada more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mention of that.  Generally, the government talks of 
supporting business but when it is time to do something 
specific, it is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of e-commerce as well, it is said that over the next 
three years 180,000 jobs could be created in Quebec and Canada. 
The federal government has not shown any desire to shoulder 
this sector.  One hundred and eighty thousand additional jobs is a 
lot.  There are 95,000 at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, these are examples, and we will be coming back to 
them.  For the time being, the financial sector is under 
consideration, thanks to Bill C-8.  Rest assured that, if the 
government responds favourably to our amendments, we will 
support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, it must demonstrate a little greater openness. 
There is already a little more than there was last year. 
We hope that by the time the bill is passed it will be a matter 
of fact.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise 
in the House today to discuss Bill C-8, the financial sector 
reform act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, who has been a member of the 
House since 1968, has been a very active member of the finance 
committee.  A former colleague of the House did yeoman work for 
the people of Canada and for the House of Commons, Mr. Nelson 
Riis.  Mr. John Solomon did great work in the finance committee 
by bringing forward financially related matters to the House of 
Commons for all Canadians. It gives me great pleasure to 
congratulate them and thank them for their work on behalf of all 
Canadians and our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not help but notice that members of the Canadian 
Alliance were patting themselves on the back, saying what a great 
job they had done and how the Liberals had incorporated many of 
their aspects into the legislation.  We in the New Democratic 
Party would also like to congratulate our member from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle for many of his motions and ideas over the 
years that are finally incorporated into the bill.  Also, I will 
be splitting my time with the great member for Winnipeg North 
Centre.  I will take the first 10 minutes and she can take the 
remaining 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go over some of the positive aspects of the bill. 
Before doing so, let me indicate that the bill is 900 pages 
thick.  It changes 4,000 statutes of legislation.  It is 
incredibly complex.  There is no one in the House or in the 
country, even with an array of lawyers, who can figure out 
exactly what it all means in the end. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who says he or she understands it completely is simply 
not telling the truth.  I certainly do not profess to know all 
about it nor could I even attempt to, but our member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle has studied it thoroughly.  He and his staff 
have gone over it fairly extensively and have come up with their 
own concerns about and recommendations on the piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One positive aspect of it is that it expands the access to the 
payment system, which is one of our long held positions.  This is 
a measure that increases competition by allowing insurance 
companies to offer chequing deposit accounts.  Most important, 
and this is something that I personally really like seeing, it 
helps credit unions compete by allowing the creation of a single 
national service entity to support credit union membership.  This 
is a long held New Democratic position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as members know, there are a lot of people throughout 
Canada who have complaints about banks.  Besides bashing the post 
office, bashing the banks in one way or another, whether it be 
for service charges or closure of an institution or facility in a 
rural town, is one of the great Canadian pastimes.  We bash the 
weather, the post office and banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An article appeared in a daily newspaper in Nova Scotia on 
Saturday about something that Scotiabank has done.  It is simply 
outrageous that Scotiabank, a fine reputable institution like 
that, would send out to unsuspecting people in the country 
cheques in the amounts of $500 to $5,000.  They sent these out 
mostly to senior citizens, saying, “here you go, folks, here is a 
cheque for $500 to $5,000”.  A lot of people had no idea what this 
was all about until they cashed the cheque and spent the money. 
Then they found out that in essence it was a cash advance on 
their credit cards.  They did not ask for it.  No one told them 
it was coming.  It just appeared in their mail one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. John MacLeod, the business editor of a daily newspaper, 
pointed out quite accurately that someone in Scotiabank should 
have his or her head taken off for this one.  It is absolutely 
scandalous that a bank with this reputation throughout Canada, 
one of our longest serving institutions, should do that to 
unsuspecting people.  It is simply misleading.  It is like the 
negative billing option with the cable companies.  That is 
exactly what that bank did.  As long as banks partake of that 
kind of practice they will never have the confidence and goodwill 
of Canadians that they need in order to move forward in the 
financial sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a Canadian financial services ombudsman and a consumer 
protection agency, which the bill offers, it would start the 
consultation process whereby the banks can legally be forced to 
provide a low cost account.  This is a position we have held for 
a long time.  We have to offer those people on low and, in many 
cases, no incomes the opportunity to use financial services at a 
low cost that is more beneficial to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say in jest that for anyone to say this will get people 
off the social assistance rolls, it simply is not on, as much as 
we would like to see that happen in a very positive way. I could 
not quite understand why the secretary said that.  That simply is 
not on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also formalizes a process of collecting data on small 
business lending and does not expand the banks' business powers 
into the areas of auto leasing and insurance networking.  This is 
a long held position of ours, in spite of a recommendation by the 
MacKay report which said that they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the negatives in the bill are very clear.  It abandons 
the wide ownership rule, which means that instead of the 10% 
ownership rule it would be 20%.  That means we could have two 
people very closely related to one another owning 40% and 60% and 
so on.  That consolidates too many financial services into very 
few hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that down the road the bill and other legislation 
that will probably come to follow it will eventually lead to full 
bank mergers and full institutional financial mergers.  That 
would mean that instead of having the broad range of competition 
within Canada that we see today or that we have seen before, we 
would see a lot more competition from foreign interests such as 
Europe, the United States or Asia.  That may or may not be a good 
thing for Canadians, but one thing is clear:  a lot of Canadians 
have no deep understanding, no clear understanding, of what the 
legislation means to them in their daily lives.  Another thing 
the bill does, which is rather ironic to be talking about, is 
concentrate far too much power in the hands of the Minister of 
Finance; we call it the new banking czar.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of parliamentary reform, where we are talking about 
loosening the powers of the PMO, various ministers and the 
government side in order to give members of parliament more say, 
clout and power in representing their constituents, it seems 
rather ironic that we are talking about a bill that does the 
complete opposite and gives far too much power to the Minister of 
Finance.  In fact in many ways the devil is in the details.  By 
obscuring the facts, the full impact of the legislation may not 
be understood by many people.  The bill is riddled with 
regulatory clauses changeable by order in council, which means 
that the order in council can ignore the wishes of parliament and 
make changes by decree, thus avoiding the House of Commons and 
any legitimate debate in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another failure of the legislation is something the United 
States has but we have yet to incorporate.  I am talking about a 
community reinvestment act.  This would provide the opportunity 
to force the banks to reinvest a certain percentage of their 
profits in their local communities.  This would be the same as it 
is in the United States.  We believe it would go a long way in 
assisting the more extremely rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the legislation does not do is to in any way stop 
rural bank closures, which is something that a lot of people in 
rural Canada are greatly affected by.  For example, what about 
the closure of the banks in Sheet Harbour or Musquodoboit Harbour 
or anywhere in the country where there are small rural 
communities that need access to financial institutions?  The 
legislation paves the way to make bank closures even quicker, 
especially of the branches.  The argument of course is that 
foreign companies like ING Bank and others can come into the 
country and have virtual banking, with no need for the bricks and 
mortar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a large percentage of Canadians depends on bank 
branches.  They need to see a teller.  They need to understand 
specifically how to fill out the forms for their regular chequing 
accounts, how to fill out their bank books and everything else. 
In fact last week one of my constituents passed on and his wife 
was left with no idea of how to balance a cheque book or do any 
aspect of banking.  Her husband did it all.  In how many families 
in the country does that situation exist today?  If the male 
member of the family passes on and leaves everything to his wife, 
as in that particular case, can she understand all the 
intricacies of her financial account and everything else?  This 
happens all the time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the point made by the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore about making sure that our rural 
communities are not being forgotten in the legislation is a valid 
point.  This was a key point raised in the caucus task force of 
the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along those lines I have another point that is in line with the 
member's thoughts.  In 1993 we had a crisis in the country, and 
it was the attitude of the major financial institutions toward 
small businessmen and businesswomen.  The access to capital for 
these men and women was a travesty.  A number of us from all 
parties on the House of Commons committee on industry worked 
together and designed a report for the House which was called 
“Taking Care of Small Business”.  The focus was on businessmen 
and businesswomen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that in the last few months I have been hearing 
from my constituents more and more that the old attitude is 
starting to creep back in, with the banks losing their 
sensitivity toward the small business fabric of the country.  So 
throughout the debate I hope that members from all sides will 
remind each other that there should be a very direct signal given 
to the financial institutions that the commitment of the House 
toward small businessmen and businesswomen will in no way, shape 
or form be diminished by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
from the governing party for his statement.  He is absolutely 
correct.  We have to keep our eyes on the ball regarding 
individuals in small businesses.  They are the backbone of our 
economy.  We have to ensure as legislators that any financial 
bill that comes forward takes into account the special interests 
and needs of small business. If we all do 
that then the bill will be a positive one and will move things 
forward.  We must think not only of small businesses in the rural 
areas but of young people getting into young entrepreneurship 
programs throughout the country.  We must make sure they have 
access to capital within Canada which meets their needs and meets 
the changing demands of our new economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to follow my colleague from Nova Scotia in 
putting on record concerns and comments from the New Democratic 
Party with respect to Bill C-8.  It is interesting to note that 
the debate has just turned to the whole issue of sensitivity of 
banks to the communities they are supposed to serve and, by 
implication, the role of government in ensuring that the banks 
live up to those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my discussion by referring to the government's own 
discussion paper of June 1997 from the task force on the future 
of the Canadian financial services sector.  In that report it is 
noted that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, like other modern economies, has traditionally relied on 
government to provide some assurance that financial institutions 
are reputable and well-managed, and that they will meet their 
commitments.  In our society, it is accepted that ownership of a 
regulated financial institution is a privilege, not a right. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we look at Bill C-8 from that vantage point 
and from those words by the government and acknowledge that it 
provides a significant framework for financial services in the 
country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assume that there is also an acknowledgement on the part 
of government in Canada today that access to basic banking 
services is a right.  I hope I am correct in making that 
statement.  I hope that is the basis upon which we are 
proceeding, because it is fundamental to this discussion and 
critical to the analysis of this very comprehensive, very 
detailed, very complex piece of legislation before us.  We could 
spend months analyzing and scrutinizing 900 pages of legislation. 
It is a very important piece of legislation and I hope it gets a 
thorough debate in the House before it goes on to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many areas of concern with respect to the bill that I 
could focus my attention on, but I want to do one thing this 
morning and that is to focus on the question of access.  Are we 
as members of the Parliament of Canada fulfilling our 
responsibilities to ensure that in legislation, in the laws of 
the land, people, regardless of where they live and regardless of 
their economic circumstances, have access to basic banking 
services?

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that right now that is not being fulfilled today 
and it will not be fulfilled under the legislation.  I would 
assert that many individuals and many communities are being 
discriminated against by the actions of the big banks and the 
inaction of the government.  It has been noted before in the 
House that many communities have been hit hard by bank closures. 
They have virtually wiped out that right to access personalized 
banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hardship facing rural communities, many that have lost all 
of their banking services, was mentioned this morning.  I do not 
need to mention the many older neighbourhoods, inner city 
communities of large centres across the country that have been 
abandoned by the big banks.  I would like to give a case study of 
Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Winnipeg North Centre, which has a voting population of well 
over 60,000, is noted for the significant degree of economic 
hardship and high element of poverty.  It is known for its higher 
than average proportion of senior citizens.  It is known for the 
strength of small businesses that have built the community. While 
they are prepared to stay, they are suffering daily because 
institutions like the big banks are abandoning our communities. 
That community, which I represent, has suffered enormously by the 
actions of the big banks and the inactions of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the almost four years that I have served as the member of 
parliament for that area, we have seen six bank branches close. 
In a very needy and very committed community, we have been left 
with a very small number of banks branches that people can access 
for basic banking services.  It is an appalling situation. 
People, especially low income citizens, senior citizens and small 
businesses, have been left virtually abandoned without access to 
banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government said in the face of this?  First, delays 
in the legislation, which offers a tiny initiative, a step 
forward with respect to bank closures, have caused the problem. 
The horse is out of the barn.  The government's delay with 
respect to the review of the financial services sector, and now 
the delays with respect to putting in place meaningful proposals 
to stop bank closures, has caused the problem.  This is the issue 
we are dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point in talking about improved access for low 
income Canadians when banks in their neighbourhoods keep closing? 
What is the point of talking about access for people living in 
poverty who want to get off of welfare and break that cycle of 
dependency when in fact there are no banks left to access?  That 
is the kind of situation we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of a bill that talks about four months' notice 
of a closure, when there are no other alternatives?  What is the 
point of legislation that does not first ensure that the banks 
are living up to their commitments and providing the services 
that people have need of, expect and are entitled to by right of 
belonging to a civilized society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens in my community have been dealt one blow after 
another.  Each time one of the big banks closed a bank branch, 
they rallied.  They came forward and said that a message had to 
be sent to the big banks and to the government saying that they 
would not stand for this.  They are hurting their very 
livelihoods and security as members of the community.  We 
continue to run up against a brick wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried to appeal to the sensitivities of the big banks, 
to no avail.  We have tried to get through to the Minister of 
Finance, to no avail.  What did he say in response to appeals to 
him to intervene?  He said the government could not really tell a 
private business what to do and believed that the Bank of 
Montreal had lived up to the spirit of the bill.  That most 
recent closure in my community was really the linchpin and the 
final straw in terms of people's feelings of being abandoned. 
This bank did not even give constituents in my area four months' 
notice.  I realize that the bill has not passed.  We have nothing 
to hold over banks' heads to say that they have broken the law. 
Is there not enough goodwill on the part of the banks and is 
there not enough power in the hands of the finance minister to 
make a difference and make banks to live up to the most basic 
elements of human decency and dignity?  There was no adequate 
notice nor a single bit of consultation with the community about 
the impact that it would have on people in that area, not one 
shred of decent consultation.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states that in some cases if there are questions about 
profitability, there should be consultation.  I know for a fact 
that all of the branches which are closing in my area are 
profitable.  The profits are just not big enough to satisfy the 
big banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the government has a role to play in providing some 
access to basic banking services.  Surely the legislation has to 
live up to that basic fundamental question.  Are services 
available to all citizens regardless of where they live and how 
much income they make?  Is access guaranteed as a right by virtue 
of belonging to a civilized society?  The situation is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the banks have failed communities like mine 
just because they are hard pressed, low income, older 
neighbourhoods and inner city communities; just like they have 
abandoned rural communities.  They have failed those communities. 
The bill hardly does anything to ensure that the situation is 
reversed and that fundamental right of access is guaranteed to 
all citizens.  That is one reason why we cannot support Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in the committee process the government takes these 
concerns seriously.  I hope it is open to amendments to ensure 
that there is some meaningful process in place to ensure that 
people have access to banking services, that communities are not 
abandoned by the big banks, that there is some recognition of the 
loyalty that customers have had in the banks over the years and 
that banks are not left to simply play the casino global 
marketplace without concern for the communities that have made 
them profitable in the first place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech.  I have a lot of 
sympathy for what she is saying.  There are a certain number of 
people in our society who do not have big bank accounts and who 
simply need the basic banking services in order to cash a cheque. 
Sometimes it is a welfare cheque or payment for work.  All they 
need is the ability to cash the cheque.  I agree with her that it 
should be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to say that banks be forced to keep a whole branch open 
in order to provide that service is perhaps stretching it.  For 
example, she said that banking services are a right.  A lot of us 
think access to food is a right.  We do not want to have our 
Canadian citizens starving to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we then pass a law that states that grocery stores must 
stay open in a community whether they continue to lose money year 
after year?  If they lose money, where will the money come from? 
Eventually, they would not be able to pay their operating 
expenses and their employees.  They would not be able to stay in 
business.  Would she apply that same criterion to grocery stores 
as she would to banks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sympathetic to what she is saying.  However, I think 
there are entirely different ways of providing basic banking 
services than just forcing branches to remain open when they are 
experiencing a loss or perhaps are way under target in terms of 
what the profit in a branch should be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the 
issue about how banks are different from the neighbourhood 
grocery store, we all have to keep in mind that we are talking 
about regulated financial institutions that have a responsibility 
to serve society according to a prescribed framework and set of 
laws.  There is a responsibility upon the government to ensure 
that those regulated financial institutions live up to their 
obligations as set out under the law.  We are dealing with 
something quite different than corner grocery stores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government itself acknowledged in a discussion paper, and 
as I said earlier, a regulated financial institution is a 
privilege, not a right.  There are certain powers and benefits 
that have been bestowed upon the banks and that commitment to the 
Canadian people has to be honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question about viability and serving communities, I want 
the member to know that I am not just talking about people living 
in poverty who need to find access to basic bank accounts.  I am 
talking about entire communities that happen to be inner city, 
older neighbourhoods, not suburbia and wealthy communities, that 
are being abandoned by the banks because they are just not 
producing a big enough profit for the bank in question.  I am not 
talking about keeping banks open that are not profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Winnipeg North Centre, eight bank branches have 
closed in just five years.  There is no information about whether 
or not they were profitable because the banks are not 
forthcoming and because the government does not require them to 
prove that they are profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation makes provision for a consultation process in 
the event that there might be seen to be some negative impact on 
the community.  I am telling all members that there is a huge 
impact on my community.  I do not think it is probably different 
from a lot other rural communities and older neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is the banks are calling the shots.  They 
do not have to prove whether or not they are making a profit. 
They do not have to deal with the impact on the consumers, 
citizens and the spirit and health of that whole community.  They 
are abandoning communities and we will have to pay the price down 
the road.  The government has a responsibility to hold the big 
banks to account for that basic principle and to ensure some 
element of decency on that whole question of how many bank 
branches are reasonable, where they should be and what 
communities should have access to them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the response to the last 
question.  I have the same problem.  I come from a constituency 
which is rural based.  Over the last many years the banks have 
basically left many of the small communities.  In fact, there was 
a case where one of the major banks gave up and the credit unions 
took over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a lot of the small communities have a small 
population base.  The credit unions tend to be very people and 
service oriented.  I can say that from my own experience having 
sat on a regional credit union board for many years.  What would 
be the member's solution to ensure that financial institutions 
stay in small communities in rural Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very 
important question.  How do we deal with that situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we try to get the government to amend its legislation to 
have some teeth when it comes to bank branch closures.  The onus 
should be on the banks to prove that they are not profitable. 
There should be a moratorium on any closures until the community 
has been informed and there is evidence that a particular branch 
is not viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we should give greater support to credit unions that 
are reaching out, filling the vacuum and creating some hope for 
rural communities and as in the case of my constituency in 
the inner city urban communities as well.  We have to do moret. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak on Bill C-8.  Since it 
is my first time rising in the House for an actual speech since 
the resumption of parliament, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the people of Kings—Hants for the honour 
and privilege of representing them again. 
I also thank them for their unswerving support in the fall 
byelection when my leader was elected as their representative 
during a very critical time in the history of our party.  I do 
not think they wanted me back.  I think they wanted to keep my 
leader just a little bit longer but the unnecessary fall election 
precipitated changes for which we were not in control.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The global financial services sector has undergone more changes 
in the last 10 years than in the previous 150 years.  No major 
regulatory reform has occurred in the financial services sector 
for the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Canada was ahead of the U.S. in terms of regulatory 
reform affecting the financial services sector.  Today we are far 
behind the U.S. in this critical area of our economies, 
particularly with the last vestiges of the Glass-Steagall act 
being gone now from the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has dilly-dallied, dithered and delayed at every 
opportunity.  It has really been dragged to this point, kicking 
and screaming, to actually address some of the issues of the 
financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, when the MacKay task force came out with a 
comprehensive set of recommendations, which balanced consumer 
interests as well as competitiveness issues for Canada's 
financial services sector, it represented what should have been 
considered a recipe, not a buffet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of taking that report, working with it, treating it 
respectfully for its tremendous contribution to the debate of 
this important public policy area and implementing many of the 
recommendations, the government chose to cherry-pick some of the 
more politically palatable recommendations of the MacKay report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the government made public policy based in many cases 
on perception as opposed to dealing with the realities.  Public 
policy and changes in public policy should always be based on 
reality and not on perception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go further, it is important that I declare I have 
involvements in the financial services sector. I have an 
involvement with an investment bank, not one of the chartered 
banks but with an investment bank.  As such, while there is no 
direct linkage or effect of the legislation on independent 
investment banks, it is important that I do declare that as an 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently Canadian chartered banks are delivering on the whole, 
if one looks at it from a realistic perspective, reasonably good 
value to Canadians.  We have a stable and an efficient system 
with among the lowest service charges in the industrialized 
world.  We have 500,000 Canadians working for banks with a 
payroll of $22 billion, and exports of $50 billion per year of 
services.  Ultimately, at the end of the day, over seven million 
Canadians actually own bank shares directly or indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we balance consumer interests, which are 
essential and need to be adhered to, and the interests of bank 
shareholders because in most cases they are the same people. Many 
of the investment vehicles that Canadians are relying on for 
their future post-retirement financial well-being, such as 
pension funds or mutual funds, have been invested in banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to invest in a mutual fund in Canada 
without investing in a bank.  The percentage of the TSE that is 
consumed by banks in terms of investment capital is significant. 
We are fooling ourselves if we try to divide consumer interests 
from shareholder interests consistently because the two can be 
balanced, and the MacKay report demonstrated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also easy to bash banks, with the possible exception of 
politicians.  Bankers are probably the least popular group in 
Canada.  We should remind ourselves that it is not a legitimate 
reason to attack banks.  We should actually base our attacks on 
some specific issues as opposed to simply doing it because by 
bashing banks we can make ourselves as politicians marginally 
more popular.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several positive features in the legislation. A 
negative feature, however, will be that it will lead to a 
dramatic increase in the level and layers of bureaucracy.  The 
legislation will give the finance minister unnecessarily great 
and sweeping powers to intervene.  It will require banks to 
publish information that arguably is of no practical purpose 
except to appease some of the advocacy groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the positive side, the ownership and capitalization rules 
will be less restrictive.  It will be easier to start a small 
bank.  That is very good for the level of choice that Canadians 
will have ultimately in their banking services.  Banks will have 
wider investment powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to changes in the co-operatives act, which 
will enable credit unions to compete more directly with banks and 
improve the competitiveness factors and services available to 
Canadians particularly in rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign banks will have more flexibility in Canada.  While that 
is a positive feature from a consumer's perspective, and we are 
supportive of foreign banks having greater access, we should 
recognize that foreign banks are gobbling up market share in 
Canada.  Whether it is an MBNA or an ING, whether it is in the 
credit card business, small business lending or Internet banking, 
foreign banks can come in here without the impedimenta of bricks 
and mortar or legacy costs of bricks and mortar and compete 
directly with our Canadian owned banks on very specific areas of 
niche businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By cherrypicking those businesses it expose the napes of our 
Canadian banks to a lot of competition.  These foreign banks are 
not necessarily playing by the same rules in terms of commitments 
to communities, reinvestment and that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are supportive of greater levels of foreign competition 
from the perspective of individual consumers, we have to be 
careful that we do not handcuff our Canadian banks, expose them 
to this competition, and at the same time jeopardize the returns 
of many Canadians who are investing in these banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be greater access to the payment systems for life 
insurers, securities dealers and money market mutual funds.  That 
will lead to greater levels of products and services and a 
greater variety of products and services for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a more transparent merger review process.  It is 
still lengthy and demanding, but at least a basic set of ground 
rules is established by the legislation.  At the end of the day 
the finance minister will still have the final say.  I believe 
that the competition bureau should at the end of the day be able 
to rule on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be sucked back into the vortex of the highly 
politicized merger debate that erupted in the House a couple of 
years ago when the Liberal caucus witch hunt on banks occurred. 
They referred to it as the Liberal caucus task force on the 
financial service sector, but it turned out to be a witch hunt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministerial discretion provided by the legislation in any 
number of areas is significant, with sweeping powers to approve 
or reject mergers and order effective changes to the payment 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard my colleagues in the New Democratic Party refer to 
the minister becoming a banking czar of Canada with the 
legislation.  I do not think that is far off. With the leadership 
considerations of the Liberal Party of Canada, the dual role of a 
finance minister who may be a leadership candidate at some point 
in the future, the potential for politicization of this very 
important public policy debate is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time the minister had an opportunity to negotiate with 
banks to get conditions from banks such that the interests and 
concerns of Canadians were met adequately before mergers were to 
proceed, he simply slammed the door.  I believe on December 14, 
1998, he just slammed the door on bank mergers for short term 
political interests instead of negotiating.. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank had 
committed, if the mergers were allowed to proceed, to a doubling 
of lending to small business from $25 billion to $50 billion. 
They also committed to the establishment of a new bank for small 
business lending, a reduction in service charges and an increased 
number of staffed outlets. 
These are some of the types of things that actually could have 
benefited Canadians if legitimate discussions and negotiations 
were to have occurred, but they did not because of politics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five month approval process for a proposed merger is a long 
time in the hyper-competitive global financial services sector. 
We recognize the importance of the process but we also have to 
recognize the speed with which changes occur and conditions 
change in this environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cross pillar merger restriction is a matter of government 
policy but it could, in many ways, be wrongheaded if we look at 
what is happening elsewhere.  In fact it is intuitive to expect 
that a cross pillar merger would lead to greater levels of 
security not less, and that it would be beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the legislation, the government will have power 
to intrude to a greater extent in the financial services sector 
than in any other Canadian industry.  Banks and other large 
financial services firms with equity in excess of $1 billion 
would need to do public accountability statements on an annual 
basis describing their contributions to the Canadian economy and 
to society, such as small business lending practices, charitable 
donations, community involvement and the location of any branches 
opened or closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have banks in small and rural communities in my riding.  It is 
very important that we work with the banks to ensure the 
continuation of services in these communities.  We have to be 
cognizant that banks are not the only necessary service being 
provided to Canadians by the free market.  Certainly financial 
services are necessary to all Canadians but so is food and 
shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The logical corollary of the government's arguments, as 
presented in the legislation, would be that ultimately we would 
need to force companies like Sobey's and Loblaws to provide free 
food to Canadians regardless of income.  In fact people building 
apartment buildings would have to build some extra apartments 
because there will be a need to provide free apartments by 
the private developers to individuals regardless of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should start first with Canada Post.  Certainly Canada Post, 
as a crown agency, should be giving out free stamps to people 
regardless of income if the government is to follow its own 
logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that a bank closure in a rural community goes 
through the same process as a grocery store closure.  Surely, 
food is as important as banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to point out is that there are near toxic 
levels of hypocrisy in the legislation in the way it treats one 
sector and does not deal with the realities of what we enjoy in 
Canada as a free market.  There are now more banking outlets in 
Canada as a result of technology than there have ever been.  Any 
one of us can withdraw money at a grocery store with a bank card. 
We can use also use bank cards to buy groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology has made a huge impact on improving banking services 
for Canadians at the grassroots level.  I believe that in areas 
where the Bank of Nova Scotia has no branch outlet it has been 
working proactively with the post office in order to provide some 
level of service.  There is nothing at the end of the day, 
particularly for senior citizens, that beats actually dealing 
with a human being as opposed to an automated teller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credit unions' ability to take over banking services in some 
of these communities is the type of transition that needs to be 
encouraged.  Sometimes the government's approach to some of these 
issues is very wrongheaded and is based on the anachronistic 
notion that somehow governments should regulate and overregulate 
until eventually the private sector will do everything the 
government tells it to do.  The effect of that over the long 
term, if we apply it to every sector in the economy, would 
actually be very negative for all of us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting the legislation because by and large the 
positive changes are long overdue and simply cannot be delayed 
further.  This piece of legislation was another victim of the 
early election call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supporting the legislation despite some of the less 
positive elements of it.  Another area of the legislation that on 
the surface sounds very good but has some real problems is the 
new consumer agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is no reason why the agency could not report 
directly to parliament as opposed to the minister.  The agency 
would be paid for by the financial institutions.  Ultimately this 
agency, as well as the increased regulatory burden on our 
agencies, will lead to increased costs for the banks.  There is 
no way around that.  The costs will ultimately be passed on to 
consumers or will result in a lower return for about seven and a 
half million silent Canadian investors who are depending on the 
returns for their retirement incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency and the regulations could have a less than 
desirable impact.  As a result of the law of unintended 
consequences, many of the positive impacts that people foresee 
from this agency and this greater level of regulation may not 
come to pass.  Canadians might see higher costs for banking 
services as the costs are passed on to them in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that we may be further exposing our already 
disadvantaged Canadian banks in terms of the global environment. 
We seem to be handcuffing Canadian banks while exposing them to 
foreign competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation bank holding companies in Canada would 
need ministerial approval for most categories of permitted 
investments.  In the U.S., financial holding companies need only 
notify the federal reserve board 30 days after making a non-bank 
acquisition.  These are some of the disadvantages that could lead 
to significant problems down the road for the Canadian financial 
services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in 10 years we do not look back at this legislation 
and other policy movements by the government and see that they 
were in fact the beginning of or the planting of the seeds of a 
foreign owned Canadian financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all like to complain about the banks.  I have done it a lot 
myself.  However, if there is a worse thing for a guy like me 
from Cheverie, Hants county, Nova Scotia than dealing with one of 
the big banks based in Toronto, it would be dealing with one of 
the big banks based in Zurich, New York or Chicago, a bank with 
no vested interest in the future of this country.  The need for 
strong, Canadian-owned financial entities becomes particularly 
important in the context of national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we do not look back at this legislation and other 
decisions that are being made in this place at this time as 
having been the beginning of the end of a strong, Canadian owned 
financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the Luddite elements of the legislation are at best 
egregious and wrongheaded.  Less generously, I think they are 
dangerous for the future of the Canadian owned financial services 
sector and these jobs that Canadians depend on as we enter an 
exciting 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunities available to Canadians in the global 
environment are almost limitless, but we have to ensure that the 
Parliament of Canada and Government of Canada do not limit those 
opportunities by trying appease to the politics of the short 
term. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Shawn Murphy (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-8 which would 
implement the new policy framework for Canada's financial 
services sector. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I wish to reaffirm the government's commitment to 
provide a fair and balanced framework that preserves the health 
and strength of the sector, while at the same time allowing its 
evolution to proceed to the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new policy framework is guided by four overriding 
principles.  The principles are:  First, the financial 
institutions must have the flexibility to adopt to the changing 
marketplace to compete here and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there must be vibrant competition.  This is necessary to 
ensure a dynamic and innovative sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, consumers, and I am talking about personal consumers and 
small businesses, regardless of income, regardless of whether the 
consumers be big or small or whether they reside in rural or 
urban areas, must receive the highest possible standard of 
quality and service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, the regulatory burden should be lightened wherever 
possible, consistent with sound, prudential and public interest 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although each of these fundamental principles that guide the new 
framework is equally important, I have chosen to focus my remarks 
here today on the issue of consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the financial services sector plays a very 
important and vital role in the everyday lives of Canadian 
consumers.  Financial institutions take consumers' deposits, 
supply access to payment services, such as cheques and point of 
sale debits, and provide mortgages and car loans.  In short, 
financial institutions permeate every aspect of our financial 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While having regard to everyone, I am talking today about 
consumers and businesses who are all dependent on financial 
institutions.  It is vital in Canadian society that consumers 
have protection when dealing with financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dramatic changes brought about by globalization and 
technological innovation, which other speakers have indicated 
here today, have contributed to a much more complex business 
environment.  While consumers benefit from a far greater choice 
of products and services, these choices at the same time are 
being made more difficult by the greater complexity of products 
offered by financial institutions.  Consumers often lack 
information to enable them to make the wisest choice.  This lack 
of information may leave them exposed to unfair or abusive 
commercial practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To promote a better balance in the delicate relationship between 
consumers and financial institutions, it is important that the 
legislation, Bill C-8, ensure that consumer rights are protected 
adequately.  The legislation, which was introduced here last 
week, would address the situation and better protect and empower 
all consumers of financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 would implement a number of measures that go further to 
protect consumers than any previous legislation and, at the same 
time, and this is important, would address the need to provide 
financial institutions with an environment that is conducive to 
their continued growth and success.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that in order to be effective any consumer protection 
legislation must include the following criteria:  an assurance 
that all Canadians have fair access to Canadian banking services; 
accessible oversight and redress mechanisms; and strong consumer 
safeguards including an accountability framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to access, I would note that many Canadians, for a 
variety of reasons, do not have access to basic financial 
services or are unable to access services in a way that fully 
meets their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members may recall, an agreement on access was reached in 
February 1997 between the major banks and the federal government. 
In that agreement the major banks committed to improving access 
to basic services for low income individuals by establishing 
minimum identification requirements for opening accounts and for 
cashing government cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 would legislate key elements of that agreement.  Banks 
would be required to open an account for anyone who has basic 
identification, and neither employment nor a minimum deposit will 
be a condition of opening such an account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation includes regulation making authority regarding 
the provision of such a low cost account.  The government has 
agreed however to hold off introducing regulations for the time 
being.  Instead, it has recently concluded a memorandum of 
understanding with individual banks regarding the provision of 
the low cost account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the low cost account offers a range of choices to 
consumers, it adheres to certain standards that will ensure that 
all Canadians have access to a bank account at an affordable 
price.  This will help ensure that all Canadians have access to 
basic banking services and will address the concerns of consumers 
who do not feel comfortable with the new technology of automated 
banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial consumer agency of Canada would monitor the banks' 
compliance with these undertakings and would consult with consumer 
groups representing low income Canadians as to how the 
self-regulatory approach is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the FCAC find at any point in time that the banks are not 
respecting the terms of the agreements, the government at that 
time will not hesitate to exercise its regulation making 
authority to require banks to offer a standard, low cost account 
with specified features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area that merits government attention is branch 
closures.  The legislation calls for a four month notice period 
to provide consumers, especially low income and 
disabled consumers, with the ability to make alternate 
arrangements.  It also consults with community leaders, to bring 
everyone into the picture for a proper consultation.  This issue 
was recognized in the MacKay task force and it is being 
legislated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial consumer agency of Canada would be a regulatory 
agency, an information gathering and public advocacy agency, 
with the ability to regulate a whole milieu of consumer interests 
that are now dispersed throughout other government departments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I state that the framework of Bill C-8 ensures that 
consumer protection will be at the forefront of Canada's 
financial services sector for the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman from the 
governing party mentioned the positive sides of the bill, but 
there are negative sides to it as well.  He mentioned consumer 
protection but there is no community protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no protection to stop a bank from closing its branches 
in rural areas affecting people who desperately need those 
services.  There is no community reinvestment act in the 
legislation which, by the way, the United States has in its 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member and his party be amenable to amendments in 
these areas in future discussions of the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Shawn Murphy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the learned member raises 
two issues.  The first issue was with regard to bank closures and 
communities.  My response to him is that banks have a fiduciary 
duty not only to their depositors who in many instances are low 
income and disabled Canadians but to their shareholders. They 
cannot be legislated to keep banks open when they are not 
making a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding accountability, banks will be required to file 
annually an accountability statement so that Canadians from coast 
to coast will be able to judge how banks are contributing to the 
economy and to society generally from a regional basis, from a 
provincial basis and from a national basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the new member 
for Hillsborough who replaced George Proud who did yeoman's work 
in parliament on behalf of Prince Edward Island.  I not only 
thank Mr. Proud for his work, but I also welcome the new member 
to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides an awful lot of power to the Minister of 
Finance, the new banking czar, as the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle put it.  We have grave concerns about what 
that kind of power would do to the Minister of Finance.  Has he 
or his party thought about the ramifications of the bill to the 
people of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Shawn Murphy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assume the member is 
speaking about the merger issue.  Everything has to go through 
OSFI.  It has to go to the competition bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any merger has to go through a lot of steps, but it has to go 
back to government.  We cannot have mergers being approved by 
some other agency.  They have to come to the government and the 
Minister of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to be able to enter into the debate on Bill C-8, 
which will establish a new organization of government, the 
financial consumer agency of Canada.  It also involves the 
amendments of a number of acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that we cannot use props so I cannot show the people 
of Canada the size of the bill without actually reading from it. 
I will just open it at random here and read one of its sections: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That subsection (6) does not apply in respect of a particular 
transaction if the bank is acquiring control of an entity whose 
business includes an activity referred to in paragraph 2(b), 
other than a specialized financing entity. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only one of three parts of section 390(7) on page 480 of 
the massive bill.  We obviously see that the task of the 
opposition in bringing a critique to the bill is mammoth indeed. 
For us to go through and decipher the meaning of even one 
paragraph almost stretches the brain to capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be able to go through it entirely.  Nor is that the 
purpose.  However I want to go on record by saying that I agree 
with the bill in principle.  We should send it to the finance 
committee forthwith, so that we can do some detailed study, along 
with our researchers, and listen to the witnesses that come 
before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of being on the finance committee in the 
previous parliament.  We spent quite a bit of time on what was 
then Bill C-38, which was essentially the same bill.  We heard 
from many different interest groups.  Some were very much in 
favour of the particular legislation going forward.  Others came 
to us with very specific concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fast summary I could mention three of the groups had great 
concerns.  Those who ran automobile dealerships and automobile 
leasing companies were very concerned that we should not, in 
amending the way banks operate, give them the ability to become 
involved directly in automobile leasing.  I have not read every 
word in the 900 page document, but as far as I know that 
prohibition is still maintained and we will not have the problem 
of having banks in automobile leasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group was the insurance people. They do not want 
banks to sell over the counter insurance because it would be 
deemed very unfair in the competitive field.  I am not saying I 
agree with it but that was their argument.  They made us a very 
strong presentation.  I believe it is upheld in the legislation 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third group that was very significant in its impact 
statements to the committee represented the down and outers in 
society, the people who do not have large financial holdings and 
in many cases no holdings at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They require basic banking services.  They were concerned with 
monopolization and the concentration of the finance industry in 
fewer and fewer holding companies that they would be even more 
disadvantaged.  They gave presentations to the committee.  I 
believe the bill addresses their concerns to some degree.  I have 
some philosophical questions about the way it does, but it is an 
interesting concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk very briefly about different parts of the bill, the 
financial consumer agency of Canada act. It is appropriate to 
commend the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions for the openness that is apparent on that side of 
the House in listening to the debates and incorporating into the 
legislation the various concerns we as a party and Canadians are 
bringing to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also commend the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley, one 
of our members in the Canadian Alliance, who has worked very hard 
in bringing forward ideas, concepts and principles that should be 
incorporated in the way our financial institutions are run. 
He has done commendable work.  It is interesting that many of the 
things that he first came up with in his report are incorporated 
in the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all the people out there listening in radio land I say that 
the work of a good, effective opposition is useful in parliament. 
We think we could do better if we were on the government side, 
but we on the opposition side are influencing the government. We 
should debate each other in a respectful manner, not the way we 
were forced to debate in the last election campaign.  We should 
debate issues forthrightly and talk about the different options. 
Then debate is useful.  An effective opposition is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also emphasize that we need a very strong financial sector. 
Sometimes the in thing to do is to bash banks.  Many of us 
receive complaints from our ridings about the way people are 
treated in banks.  We have to respond to them. Usually we try to 
get them in contact with the right people so their problems can 
be solved.  Many of the complaints we hear about banks are 
specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having strong banking and financial sectors is absolutely 
critical.  We ought not to get into a malaise of complaining 
about them all the time, although it is appropriate through 
legislation and other presentations for us to put forward the 
wishes of our constituents and the fact that they deserve good 
service from banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently I appeal to the banks to make sure they run their 
businesses properly.  They should do this so that legislators do 
not have to come up with too many 900 page documents to regulate 
and control how they do their business.  My first choice would be 
for them to make their decisions in an honourable fashion so that 
the public does not have reason for complaints or to come to us 
as legislators with a cry to bring in regulations and laws to 
control and restrict the behaviour of banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very real way banks have to exercise a serious social 
conscience.  They have to make sure that they are treating their 
customers fairly.  They have to make sure that all depositors and 
all people who have invested in banks are giving their money in 
trust to organizations that are credible and solid.  The last 
thing we want is a financial organization that is tenuous and 
cannot be depended upon.  It is very important for the banks to 
do this work.  It is also very important for the government to 
bring in regulations and a framework for financial institutions 
which permit that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on some specifics with respect to the Bank Act. 
There is a change in the way banks are governed.  One important 
point is that the ownership of banks is now more flexible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the Greater Toronto Airport Authority for 
its recent initiative in instituting a new ground transport taxi 
permit system at Toronto's Pearson International Airport.  The 
GTAA has demonstrated industry leadership in developing a fairer 
system, which benefits the travelling public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new system lowers economic barriers to entry for new taxi 
drivers.  The cost had exceeded $200,000 in the secondary market. 
The public will no longer have to bear the imputed cost of this 
entry capital.  The number of licences issued will now match 
demand, and market sensitive fees will generate fair revenues for 
airport overheads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the city of Mississauga mayor and council for 
working with the GTAA, allowing access by licence holders to city 
taxi permits on a restricted basis for use in connection with 
airport ground transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is now seeing better service and more efficiency at 
Toronto airport.  We are excited by the future potential of our 
new airport terminal now being built by the hardworking Pearson 
airport team.

Speaker, most people in the world struggle from day to day to buy 
the food they need, but most Canadians have earned enough already 
this year to pay for their food for the entire year.  The reason 
is that farmers in Canada are so efficient and so good at their 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What thanks do they get?  I thank and many Canadians thank 
farmers, but the government really does not seem to care.  If it 
did it would be fighting to remove export subsidies and other 
trade distorting subsidies in Europe, Asia and the United States. 
That would increase the price farmers get for their grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government cared, it would lower taxes and unfair user 
fees so farmers' costs would go down.  If the government cared 
about farmers, it would fix the regulations that hurt farmers. It 
would lower freight costs and allow new marketing opportunities 
for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government's record on agriculture speaks for 
itself.  Now is the time for the government to do the right 
thing.  It really would not hurt to thank farmers for providing 
the best, lowest priced food in the world.

North Beach Provincial Park.  When he heard cries for help from 
swimmers who had been swept to the deeper waters of Lake Ontario, 
Mr. Hoefel and his wife entered the high surf on an air mattress 
and, guided by the voices of the victims, made their way to the 
closest one and helped her back to shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hoefel then re-entered the dangerous waters and battled 
waves until he reached the second woman approximately 1,500 
metres away from shore.  Both struggled to hold on to the rapidly 
deflating mattress as they drifted to shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hoefel certainly deserves to be recognized for his actions, 
which can only be described as selfless and heroic.  He is truly 
an example to all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on January 31, HRDC directed Parks 
Canada to take immediate measures to protect park wardens from 
danger while they are engaged in law enforcement activity.  The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has had three reports since 1993 
stating that park wardens are at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time Parks Canada has been engaged in an ad campaign 
featuring a park warden with the suggestion that all is well in 
the national parks.  Despite the multimillion dollar smokescreen, 
all is not well in Canada's wilderness.  Wildlife is being 
slaughtered while the minister funds false images. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should know that 60 grievances have been filed over 
job conditions in the last six months alone and that the January 
31 labour board ruling means wardens are out of uniform and off 
the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad campaign is a gross misuse of public funds.  It is sad 
that the minister responsible has millions of dollars to spend on 
ads to mislead the public but no money to ensure the safety of 
our park wardens as they protect wildlife in our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions speak louder than words.  It is time to equip our 
wardens to do the job they were trained to do.

other country has the high quality, diverse and inexpensive food 
that we do in Canada.  We spend under 10% of our income on food. 
No other country spends less and some spend twice as much.  The 
reason for this is an extraordinary, diverse and efficient 
agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada farmers and their families produce a huge 
selection of healthy food at minimum costs.  They do this in face 
of subsidized competition overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By paying such a low price, are we not in fact short changing 
farmers?  In some regions and for some crops it appears that we 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all Canadians to buy Canadian food products and to buy 
them as close to the farm gate as possible.  If necessary, be 
prepared to pay a premium for higher quality and freshness.  Let 
us make sure that our agricultural sector remains strong and

Mr. Speaker, it is high time the Liberal government ceases its 
current practice of lowering security classifications to enhance

ludicrous policy of frequently moving killers from maximum to 
medium or minimum security prisons only months into their life 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As prisons like the Kingston pen were set to increase transfers 
by 29%, the solicitor general's order for a review is cold 
comfort to anyone.  The proverbial horse is out of the barn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals tried to deny former CSC Commissioner Ole 
Ingstrup's creation of the 50:50 quota system that established 
the practice of rushing violent criminals through the prison 
system at record pace.  Then CSC incredibly allowed murderers 
like Antonio Lorenz and Michael Hector to receive minimum 
security placements months into their life sentences for violent 
murders. 
With problems and incidents in our prisons up 25% this year and 
dangerous practices of fast tracking and releasing of cold 
blooded killers, the solicitor general should remove his head 
from the sand and instead of simply mouthing the words public 
protection actually do something about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what would be terrific is if the industry minister would 
recant what he said on February 8.  He defended the Prime 
Minister's dodgy involvement with immigrant investor funds by 
claiming that the Prime Minister's shares in the golf course were 
held in a blind trust.  That is 100% false.  He can check that 
with the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This business about who owned the shares, the Prime Minister got 
those shares back on January 27, 1996.  They were his.  He had an 
interest in the hotel right beside the golf course at the Auberge 
Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the industry minister make those claims out of ignorance or 
fear? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, I spoke with the ethics counsellor this morning 
to double check the facts.  I would suggest that the member, or 
any other member, or any member of the media could do the same 
because he is quite happy to convey accurate information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that shares were not held by the Prime Minister 
prior to 1993 because they were sold.  The proceeds from those 
shares were not realized until a much later date.  Indeed, the 
Prime Minister's lawyer, who is also a trustee, in consultation 
with the ethics counsellor and the Prime Minister, sought to 
secure the proceeds from that sale.  That was confirmed in a 
conversation this morning.  I would suggest—

recently, and I quote, “Ministers are required to ensure that 
their affairs are dealt with by putting those in trust, and that 
is what the Prime Minister did”.

a GST refund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to give the money to people, that is 
fine with me, but a lot of people paying heating costs did not 
receive this money, while others, who do not heat, even with 
oil, did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not proof of a purely vote getting measure, improvised

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was obvious there were problems.  The government could have been 
a bit more responsible, rather than adopting a measure on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been more judicious to suspend or reduce the 
GST on heating oil in addition to using refundable tax credits

do did not get any money.

are heated by the crown received cheques for $125 to compensate 
them for their heating costs.

my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Amnesty International urged the Prime Minister and

rights in China, including assaults on freedom of religion of 
Falun Gong practitioners and, in Tibet, torture and the 
suppression of dissent and labour rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How then does the foreign minister explain the Prime Minister's

on human rights? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the member does not share the view of the leader of

<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the minister might want to indicate whether Canada will 
co-sponsor a resolution at the upcoming commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Dutch foreign minister cancelled his upcoming 
visit to China because the Chinese government refused to allow a 
round table to go ahead in Hong Kong with human rights 
practitioners including Falun Gong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is serious about human rights in China, will our

the issue of human rights again during his visit.  He has made 
Canada's position very clear.  It has been our ability to engage 
China over the years because we have been seen by them to be 
their friends.  This is why we have been able to make progress on 
a continuing dialogue on human rights, including the important 
contributions we have made to enhancing the judicial process in 
the People's Republic of China.

dropped his commitment to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the team Canada trip news stories were filled with 
reports of his commitment to human rights in China.  Now that he 
is on the ground there he seems to have changed his tune by 
saying that Canada is too small of a fry to stand up for what is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has endangered species legislation that mandates fines of 
up to $25,000 or six months in jail for people who knowingly 
import products from endangered species, so we ban the

Why is the government prepared to give more protection to African 
elephants than to Chinese prisoners of conscience? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the assertions of the hon. member in his premise are 
absolutely wrong.  The Prime Minister has spoken out vigorously 
on human rights in China during his current visit in his meetings 
with the Chinese premier.  He will continue to do so and maintain 
this dialogue throughout his visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that we will hear more strong words from the Prime

<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess the answer is hurry 
up and wait.  In 1999 Canada imported a staggering $8.9 billion 
worth of products from China.  There are reports everywhere from 
groups such as Amnesty International that some of those products 
are made by prisoners of conscience in labour camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1930 the United States has had a law specifically 
prohibiting the importation of goods made by prisoners or forced 
labour.  In the mid-1990s the American state department began 
working aggressively to ensure that goods made by Chinese prison 
labour were not imported into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When could Canadians expect a similarly tough attitude in 
defence of human rights in China? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are very few countries in the world that can have 
the influence that Canada has with China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raises, in my mind, some questions of exactly 
what the Alliance policy is with respect to trade.  Is it 
suggesting that the Prime Minister and the nine premiers with him 
are wrong in promoting trade with China?  Is the member 
suggesting that the Alliance policy is that Canada should 
withdraw from engagement with China and sit back on the sidelines 
where it can have no influence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is making a difference in China as it is around the

</I></B></P><P align=left>As is always the case, before we make a decision on whether or

Bombardier, we would have a whole different foreign policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

the staff of Correctional Service Canada.  Quite simply, if they 
are under pressure to bring drugs into an institution, and the

it makes common sense that they would not be asked to bring them 
in.

heating rebate cheques after the government proceeded with haste 
before the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government has proceeded with haste.  It has 
ignored its promise to consult with the Union of Solicitor

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have obtained documents under access to information which

fit to support it as strongly as members on this side of the 
House.  Nonetheless, it encouraged a lot of debate on the topic 
of fish and fishermen's rights.  I know that technically this is 
called the fishers' bill of rights.  However, being from the old

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that, on December 29, 2000, Arthur 
Kabunda, a student at Bathurst Community College, in New

country of Burundi. He was killed, along with about 20 other 
fellow countrymen, by a group of rebels.

the people of Burundi and to all the other nations suffering the 
horrors of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the petitioners are asking parliament to 
officially convey to the family and friends of Arthur Kabunda its 
condolences on behalf of all Canadians, and to publicly condemn 
such acts of violence.

people concerned about the lack of housing and care facilities

approximately 10,000 signatures from the west coast of British 
Columbia right through to Atlantic Canada, although it originated 
from a group of very conscientious volunteers in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are concerned about the lack of palliative care, 
the care for those who are dying.  They call upon parliament to 
collaborate with the provinces to provide funding to provide for 
home care and pharmacare for the dying.  They also request 
collaboration with them for appropriate education and training 
for all members of end of life teams, for the provision of 
financial assistance and job protection for family members who 
provide care for the dying as recommended in the Carstairs 
report.  This petition has 10,000 signatures and more will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you again for recognizing this poor little corner 
of the House.  You have been more than generous today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This petition, pursuant to Standing Order 36, petitions the 
House as follows.  The petitioners draw the attention of the 
House of Commons to the following: that the two week waiting 
period for employment insurance benefits is causing undue 
financial hardship for many families; and that the two week 
waiting period system means families must wait four weeks before 
obtaining their first employment insurance benefit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners call upon parliament to revise the 
employment insurance regulations to remove the two week waiting 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to summarize, the two week waiting period to us does not 
mean a lot, but people earning minimum wage it means a lowly $120 
a week benefit.  It puts their family in a very difficult set of 
circumstances in terms of waiting periods. In other words, they 
cannot afford to buy groceries or heat the house, so we are 
calling upon parliament to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest, 
despite his protestations about this corner of the House and so 
on, is an experienced member.  He would know beyond most of us 
that reading petitions is not on.  Indeed he should give a 
summary as he did at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard him reading.  I know he knows that is against the rules. 
I know in future he would not want to set a bad example for the 
newer members of the House and would want to comply with the 
rules in every respect and give a summary instead of reading his 
petitions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in considering it, the Chair has certain options 
available to it.  One is to defer the debate for a further time. 
I am inclined to do that until tomorrow evening.  That gives the

at 8 o'clock, it could start at the conclusion of the votes that 
are scheduled for tomorrow evening at the time of adjournment.

act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, and to 
amend certain acts in relation to financial institutions, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>

I am delighted to continue my speech, which I began before

It is an issue which is very important to all of us who are 
representing ridings that have a fair number of farmers in them. 
We look forward to that debate tomorrow evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue with our debate on Bill C-8, the act to establish 
the financial consumer agency of Canada, before we were 
interrupted I was talking about some of the issues that are dealt 
with in the bill.  As I indicated, we are mostly interested in 
supporting the bill.  It is a bill that is long overdue.  If 
anything, we should probably chastise the Liberal government for 
not acting more quickly.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things in the bill that I consider to be very 
important is that it does provide for more competition.  I have 
observed over the years that not only myself personally but many 
of my friends and, since I became a member of parliament, a 
number of my constituents, appreciate having a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had quite a bit of discussion about airlines lately, 
about the fact that with less competition we seem to be getting 
lower service levels from Air Canada.  It would be wonderful if 
we had a very strong, viable competitor, because that would mean 
we would then get better service as consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is true in the banking industry.  It has happened 
to me more than once in my life that I have been displeased with 
the way I was mistreated by the banks on certain particular 
issues.  I had, in every instance, the option of saying to that 
bank “I am out of here, you are done” and saying that I was not 
accepting its low level of service and the way it treated me.  I 
did that.  I will not mention the specific banks.  I have dealt 
with several.  I have always appreciated the opportunity to go to 
a competitor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just so happens that I have now been a member of the credit 
union in my community for a large number of years.  I should not 
use this venue to advertise for the credit unions, but I am glad 
that this legislation will provide a greater ability for credit 
unions to offer good competition to the banks.  I have found the 
credit unions very responsive to the needs of their members. That 
is because instead of being owned by big investors somewhere, 
they are actually owned by the people who bank there. We have 
membership meetings.  We have shareholders' meetings, and we can 
go to them, listen to the reports and put forward motions. We can 
make suggestions to the board of directors, which usually tries 
to respond to them.  Sometimes, of course, they cannot because of 
various restrictions being put on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the fact that in Bill C-8 there is more opportunity for 
competition.  The rules for starting up new banks have been made 
more favourable.  The requirement that a group now needs to have 
only $5 billion capital in order to start up, as opposed to the 
previous $10 billion, is a good forward move.  There is a 
reduction in the requirement to have 75% of the board of 
directors be Canadian.  That is reduced to 66%.  That is a good 
move because it permits people from other countries to 
participate as well in establishing competitive banks in this 
country.  I believe that can only help our own domestic banks to 
provide better service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also, of course, a better and a more transparent 
process for merging existing banks.  We support in general the 
legislation that is being proposed on that account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an improvement to consumer protection in the bill. 
One of the things we struggle with as members of parliament is 
what happens when a constituent comes to our office with a 
complaint against a specific bank.  There are some cases that are 
very difficult to deal with.  There are some that are impossible 
as they are legal matters and we cannot deal with them. 
Sometimes we find that just being able to show support for the 
person to the bank or the banking ombudsman helps to get these 
problems solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation in Bill C-8 requires that all banks and 
financial institutions have in place complaint procedures.  In 
other words, they cannot just do this on an ad hoc basis.  They 
must actually come up with a formal procedure for dealing with 
complaints, which must be reported to the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions and is subject to 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very good consumer protection change in the bill 
which has to do with the Canada deposit insurance.  Until this 
bill is passed, banks are required to hold insurable deposits. 
That is now being changed so that the banks themselves will be 
insured institutions, so I believe that in general there is 
greater protection for consumers and for depositors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also better access to the access to payments system. 
This is a great improvement.  There are a lot of financial 
institutions that are not banks but transfer great amounts of 
money to Canadian citizens, for example, investment firms, life 
insurance firms and so on.  With their ability to access the 
payments system there is better service for consumers at a lower 
cost, because it basically cuts out one of the middlemen in the 
transaction.  Giving access to the insurance companies, trust 
companies and others means that they can actually set it up so 
that they can transfer money directly into recipients' accounts, 
on an annuity, for example, without having to go through the 
bank, thereby saving money.  It should be a more reliable and 
efficient service.  We support that move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insurance companies are a vital part of our financial base in 
the country.  They are important.  They are one of the pillars of 
the financial structure.  I am sure that essentially everyone in 
the House and, I would hope, everyone listening on TV or hearing 
this later on, will take the time to make sure that they have 
insurance in place.  It is a very important thing to protect 
families and others.  Here again, Bill C-8 provides for a more 
equitable system for establishing new insurance companies.  There 
are lower capital requirements, which hopefully will increase the 
amount of competition and thereby improve service for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there are some other protections for consumers in the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, this bill is worthy of our support.  We should 
probably make sure that it gets to the finance committee as 
quickly as possible.  Hopefully, interested people who have 
identified some amendments they would like to see included in 
this 900 page document will appear before the committee and show 
us, chapter and verse, what needs to be amended.  We as a 
committee will then consider that and hopefully the outcome will 
be a new structuring of financial institutions in Canada, which 
will make them strong in the long run, give us great financial 
stability in the country and make us a major competitor in world 
markets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, when the hon. member started his 
speech prior to question period he mentioned the thickness of the 
bill and its 900 pages.  I am wondering if he could elaborate how 
his party or parliament should break down this 900 pages so that 
it is easily explainable to the people of Canada because, as we 
know, the bill covers over 4,000 statutes.  It 
changes literally everything that we do in parliament when it 
comes to financial concerns.  I am wondering whether he has an 
easier solution to how we explain this to Canadians so that 
everyone in the country can understand exactly what is happening 
with this very important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is very difficult to 
compress into 2 or 3 pages what is contained in 900.  It is true 
that a lot of it is technical and in great detail.  Some of the 
concepts in the bill can be expressed in a sentence or two.  I 
think that what we need to do is make sure that consumers, 
customers of the banks, ordinary citizens, are aware of the 
avenues they can use if they have a complaint. 
They should also have full access to the ombudsman's office.  I 
would recommend that banks put into their offices signs, phone 
numbers and addresses of websites people can visit for more 
information, or to find relief for their complaints if they have 
complaints, or where they can offer suggestions for better 
service from their banks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that banks right now are competitive.  It 
is not in their interest to do things that would send customers 
to other banks, which, as I said in my speech, some banks have 
done to me in my lifetime.  It is usually in their interest to 
keep their customers.  We must rely to a great extent on the 
banks themselves to communicate with their customers and to treat 
them in a way that will keep them there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as parliament is concerned, in communicating this to our 
constituents the best we can do is to pick some of the 
highlights, write a short summary, put it into our local papers 
or into our householders and hopefully it will get through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member stated that we 
should rely on the banks to treat their customers properly.  As 
he probably knows, the Scotiabank recently gave out $500 to 
$5,000 cheques to unsuspecting customers throughout the country. 
These elderly citizens thought it was either a gift or a donation 
from the bank, when in reality it was an unauthorized cash 
advance on their Visa cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Scotiabank does something like that and when the 
business editor, John MacLeod, of the <I>Daily News</I> mentions 
his outrage at this, how can we honestly trust the banks to do 
the right thing in all circumstances? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is, if the Scotiabank attempts 
to get away with something like that on unsuspecting customers, 
should there not be legislation in place to ensure that no bank 
or major financial institution can get away with so-called 
negative option billing or these so-called goodies out of 
customers who are unsuspecting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, one of the dilemmas 
legislators face, of course, is to what degree they should pass 
legislation to protect people from their own negligence.  If I 
get a cheque from someone, especially from a bank, I will read it 
to see what the fine print says.  We all know good and well that 
there is no such thing as free money.  That should be an alert 
right there.  I would think that the primary responsibility is 
with the consumer in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do that in other areas.  We cannot buy any other product 
without the company presenting it in such a way that it will keep 
our business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were one of the people ripped off by the Scotiabank in that 
way—and I would use that characterization of it—I would just go 
to a different bank.  I would tell the bank that I was done with 
it, that I wanted my money back and that I was going elsewhere. I 
know some people cannot do that because only one branch of the 
bank is close to them and the next one is far away, so they have 
limited options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would again say to the banks that if they do things like that 
they are only inviting legislators, like the House of Commons, to 
pass rules that restrict them in how they can advertise their 
business.  They need to use their heads.  The other thing open to 
consumers is a giant class action suit, after which the banks 
would never repeat it again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 7, the Minister of Finance reintroduced his bill to 
reform the financial services industry in Canada.  Last spring's 
Bill C-38, which died on the order paper when the fall election 
was called, therefore became Bill C-8.  Today, we are resuming 
second reading of the bill where we left it off.  This new 
legislation, which will henceforth govern the financial services 
industry, will probably be passed in June at the latest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 introduces a number of new provisions, including one on 
bank ownership. 
First, under the proposed legislation, a single shareholder will 
be able to own up to 20% of voting shares in one of the five 
major Canadian banks.  The ceiling is now 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, single shareholders will be able to control smaller 
banks with assets between $1 billion and $5 billion, such as the 
National Bank and the Laurentian Bank in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, businesses and individuals will also be able to create 
their own banking institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the new bill leaves the door open for major banks to 
resort to mergers, something they have been doing for a very 
long time.  But the bill provides for public hearings at which 
the institutions concerned would be required to defend the 
merits of transactions for the common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-8, an important bill introduced 
in this new parliament.  However, although I am in agreement 
with the spirit of Bill C-8, I am surprised to see that the 
changes we have been told about do not appear in the body of the 
supposedly amended bill.  These changes consist of guidelines. 
This is where we have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is aware of the Bloc Quebecois' interest in amending 
the legislation governing financial institutions.  We 
contributed to the debate by submitting a brief, because we 
believe in the need for a legislative environment which helps to 
increase the capacity of our financial institutions to deal with 
global competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign incursions into Canadian financial services markets are 
already an undeniable reality. 
In recent years, a number of foreign banks have established a 
presence in certain areas, such as electronic banking, credit 
cards, bank investment services and discount trading.  In this 
era of globalization, they are competing with Canadian banks on 
their own turf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the Bloc Quebecois wholly subscribes to the 
spirit of the new legislation and to a number of its provisions. 
That said, certain problems we found during the last legislature 
are still present in the new bill. Even if we note a considerable 
change as far as the demands of the Bloc Quebecois and Mr. Landry 
are concerned, the four points are not incorporated into the bill 
but into the guidelines on the reclassification of former 
schedule 1 banks with assets of under $5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the hon. members what the applicable 
criteria are.  These are: the safety and solidarity of the bank, 
direct or indirect employment, location of the bank's 
decision-making and administrative centre, consumer requirements, 
the bank's business and activities, and the bank's future 
prospects in a global context.  These are the elements set out in 
the guidelines, but not in the bill itself, which concerns us 
somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examination of the bill in its entirety also shows the frequency 
of loopholes such as “the minister may, if he sees fit” or 
“provisions of the act cease to apply if the minister should so 
decide”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is too much room for discretionary powers for a single 
man, namely the Minister of Finance.  Wherever there are 
provisions on banks, insurance companies, trust companies, and 
the financial sector as a whole, the minister reserves the right 
to alone decide, from criteria known to him alone, whether an 
operation is unacceptable or not.  He defines certain concepts, 
such as low-cost deposit accounts.  It is unacceptable that this 
discretionary power has such sway, more even than the law 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general terms, we would have preferred greater clarity in the 
decision making process and greater detail on certain concepts, 
such as low-cost deposits for the disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards consumer protection, the Minister of Finance remains 
vague and expresses more wish than real policy.  The bill 
contains a number of provisions intended to protect and empower 
consumers of financial services.  However, most of the groups 
heard in committee feel that these provisions are vague and will 
complicate the agency protection mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among others, there are provisions that intersect or overlap 
provisions of Quebec's consumer protection legislation.  We 
oppose this.  Consumer protection is exclusively a provincial 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, protection specific to the banks can be a federal 
matter.  But when we talk about consumer protection or the 
protection of personal information, this is a provincial matter, 
exclusively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill talks of new intrusion by the federal government in 
areas of Quebec's jurisdiction.  The Government of Quebec is, 
however, well covered by an array of laws.  They include the 
consumer protection act, the personal information protection 
act, the insurance act, the trust companies act, the Quebec 
savings companies act and the credit and securities act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these acts contain elements of consumer protection. 
How then will consumers know which legislation applies? Will the 
Quebec consumer protection act apply in a specific case? 
Quebecers might wonder when they look at the federal legislation 
and the laws we have in Quebec. How is one expected to know which 
act shall prevail? Will it be the Quebec consumer protection act 
or the new federal legislation? It is really not clear. Let us 
not forget that legislation respecting consumer protection is 
provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer protection also concerns another group, namely the 
poor. The bill provides a definition of “low-fee retail deposit 
account”. Can anyone tell me what is meant by a “low-fee retail 
deposit account”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Minister of Finance, these so-called low-fee 
retail deposit accounts will ensure accessibility to financial 
services for low income people. Even though I got a Bachelor of 
Arts degree, I still cannot figure this one out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one knows who will be entitled to such an account, except the 
minister. No one knows if that account will be accessible 
everywhere, except the minister. Why? Because all these issues 
will be covered by regulations. One must really have confidence, 
or else ignore what is going on. We cannot understand, because 
the bill does not provide explanations.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying “Trust us.  This will be covered in the 
regulations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all we have to go on for now, but it is not an assurance 
that consumers will be better protected under the new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a branch closes and there is a reduction in services 
available to consumers, all the bill requires the bank to do is 
give six months' notice.  Whether the bank is being closed in 
one, two, three or four months, it is still being closed.  What 
good is this provision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister say that such a weak provision ensures 
increased accessibility to financial services?  The Minister of 
Finance is the only one who thinks so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine the case where a bank in a given region decides 
to close its doors because it is not doing enough business.  We 
say that there is nothing in the bill guaranteeing the community 
that the bank must provide services.  The bill says that the 
bank must give six months' notice before closing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this good enough for the community served by this bank, when 
it was the community's savings that improved the bank's bottom 
line?  One day, if business is down, the owners say:  “We will 
restructure it, move it to a larger centre.  You folks can find 
somewhere else to bank. 
We gave you the required notice and now we are closing”.  This 
is unacceptable and it is not looking out for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the real social and community role of banks, we 
would have liked the Minister of Finance to have paid attention 
to the proposals submitted by the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve concerning reinvestment by banks in the 
community.  I know that my colleague will be speaking to Bill 
C-8.  We will have an opportunity to hear him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the problems for consumers, there is a major 
problem in this bill with respect to ownership of major banks 
and financial institutions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I should mention the bill's flexibility in 
allowing financial institutions to pursue their activities, and 
to deal with competition and globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a difference between the flexibility found in 
some aspects of the bill and the fact that some of our financial 
and banking institutions could be literally turned over to one 
investor who could gain total or near total control over these 
institutions or their management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not understand, and there lies the rub, is that in 
the case of the largest bank in Canada, the Royal Bank, one 
individual could own 20% of the shares? It used to be 10%. Now 
the percentage has climbed to 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason given by the minister for not allowing more than 20% 
is that, in his view, it could be dangerous if one shareholder 
owned more than 20% because he could take control. One 
individual could take control of a major bank, a foreign 
investor could take control of the Royal Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in the case of the largest bank in Quebec, the National 
Bank, which is a medium size bank, one individual could own 65% 
of voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why such a difference? Why such discrimination? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should it be more dangerous in this case? The minister says 
it cannot be raised to 30%, 40% or 50% for the largest bank, the 
Royal Bank, because it could be dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in Quebec, the National Bank, which holds the business 
assets of Quebecers, could be bought by one individual who could 
own up to 65% of shares. In this case, it is no longer 
dangerous? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why allow one individual so much control over the savings of 
Quebecers? This does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some of the clauses I have read, they say it is not serious, 
that the National Bank has got to about $4 billion and will be 
governed by the rules for the major banks, where a shareholder 
could not hold more than 20% of voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this could happen, the Minister of Finance reserves the 
right to examine the entire situation and it could take up to 
three years before the bank could be allowed to come under the 
20% rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During those three years, what is there to stop a foreigner from 
coming here and making use of the 65% rule to acquire all the 
power and then transferring the head office and all specialized 
jobs?  The bank would be subject to foreign interests or a 
foreign business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this dangerous in one instance and not dangerous for the 
National Bank?  We still wonder, why take the risk?  Why two 
different measures, one for the big banks and one for the medium 
size ones?  In this case, the risks are the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other criteria to add to this bill, and will do so via 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference has been made to the guidelines.  These are not part 
of the bill, but rather an aside, and the Minister of Finance 
reserves the right to apply them or not, as he sees fit.  It is 
not reassuring to us that they are not an integral part of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance of Quebec had sent a letter to the 
Minister of Finance of Canada calling for him to take these 
provisions into account, in order to reassure the consumers of 
Quebec and the people with savings.  In his letter he wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that a merger of the major banks is in the public 
interest, there is provision that such a merger will subject to 
a process of examination and that approval for the amalgamation 
will be subject to certain predetermined criteria.  If this 
approach is necessary in the case of a bank merger, a similar 
approach is all the more justifiable when an individual is 
allowed to hold more than 20% of the voting shares of a low or 
moderately capitalized banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public interest should be defined, in the present instance, 
according to the following criteria: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—The effect of the change on the activities of the banks, 
including available services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—The effect of the change on employment at head office and in 
the branches and including professional jobs or those requiring 
particular expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—The effect of the change on the regional economy and on the 
region's technological development. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the criteria we want to see and this is why we will be 
making amendments.  I hope the government will support them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, congratulations on your new appointment as 
Assistant Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole.  I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Richmond who is about to 
make his maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to participate 
in the debate on Bill C-8, an act to establish the financial 
consumer agency of Canada and to amend certain acts in relation 
to financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to do this because the financial services sector is 
the largest sector in the British Columbia economy.  Our largest 
banks employ about 26,000 people in British Columbia.  Banks in 
Canada employ about a quarter million people directly and 
contribute approximately $80 million a year to charities in 
Canada and about $4.5 billion annually in taxes to our provincial 
and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the contributions that the banks and other financial 
institutions make, they are a sound foundation as the backbone 
of our economy.  Our banks, trust companies, credit unions, 
mutual funds, insurance companies and others are very important 
to our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to address the calls to modernize Canada's 
financial services industry.  Canadian consumers of financial 
services have demanded a more competitive environment while our 
banks have been seeking approval to merge and to have more 
flexibility in the way they structure their operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is an attempt to catch up to other countries that have 
made changes long ago to their financial services industry.  The 
Liberal government has been dragging its feet on this matter for 
about seven years.  This is too bad because our financial 
institutions must have the ability to make long term plans for 
the future.  Once it is passed into law, we hope the bill will 
give our banks the opportunity they need to perform long term 
planning.  I doubt that will happen because of the five year 
sunset clause in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Prince George—Bulkley Valley has a great deal 
of experience and has been of great assistance to the official 
opposition working on our financial services policy group.  The 
official opposition wrote a banking report in November 1998 
entitled “Competition: Choice You Can Bank On”.  The report forms the 
backbone of our financial services policy.  It is a very good and 
detailed report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses some of the changes we on this side of the 
House have been pressing the government to enact.  The official 
opposition has been carrying the flashlight to show the Liberals 
their darkness.  After ridiculing our policies they have been 
stealing them from time to time.  We encourage them to steal more 
of our policies, but unfortunately they do not get them right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that my colleague on the Canadian Alliance 
financial services policy group will be pursuing the government 
with amendments to the bill at committee stage.  We hope the 
government will show some respect for what we propose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that a strong financial services industry is 
essential to Canada's economic well-being.  This means we need 
strong banks, insurance companies and other financial 
institutions.  We need to create an environment for our financial 
institutions to flourish domestically and have the ability to 
take advantage of opportunities in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has one of the safest financial services systems in the 
world.  We urge the government to ensure that these consumer 
benefits continue and not be changed or lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside the House critics of the bill are saying that in the 
past five years there have been many changes to the world 
financial system.  The bill has been left behind.  The bill used 
to be Bill C-38 which died on the order paper.  It does not go 
far enough to bring our banks up to date with what is going on in

</I></B></P><P align=left>International changes since 1996 are not reflected in the bill 
that is largely the same as what the Liberals introduced in 1996 
but allowed to die on the order paper.  They have been trying to 
pass the bill for far too long.  It is out of date in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who say that the bill is too little too late for 
our banks and that it will not help to strengthen the performance 
and competitiveness of our banks at home and abroad.  They have 
already lost ground and they will not be able to make up those 
lost yards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries are well ahead of Canada.  The United States has 
allowed its banks to merge with insurance companies.  The 
Liberals insist on leaving it to their finance minister to decide 
what mergers can go ahead and which cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By lowering the amount of money required to open a bank, we hope 
that the legislation will allow more banks to be set up in rural 
areas of Canada.  The smaller the capital the more encouragement 
for institutions to jump into it.. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should enhance consumer choice by allowing insurance 
companies and mutual fund firms to use bank cheque clearing 
systems.  If the banks take over the auto leasing and insurance 
industries they may hurt our economy since a significant amount 
of jobs are created by small businesses like car dealerships and 
independent insurance companies.  The further entry of banks into 
the insurance and auto leasing markets should only be allowed if 
major auto financing and insurance companies have access to the 
Canadian Payments Association which they have been requesting. 
Banks must not have a competitive advantage over auto leasing and 
insurance companies.  There must be a level playing field for all 
competitors within a given market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the creation of a holding company 
structure where banks will be able to remove some of their 
non-banking operations, such as credit card businesses from bank 
regulations, by establishing separately regulated holding 
companies.  This new structure would allow our banks to compete 
more effectively against foreign non-bank competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support increased access to the payments system so that life 
insurance companies, money market mutual funds and securities 
dealers will be allowed access to increases in consumer choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support expanding the role of credit unions.  I can say that 
because for about three years, before becoming a member of 
parliament, I was a director of the second largest credit union 
in Canada.  I saw the environment from the inside.  I know that 
the credit unions are not getting the same support as the 
financial institutions.  They are not only consumer and community 
oriented, but they also have a good network of branches that help 
people at the community level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are disappointed that this measure is not included in Bill 
C-8 despite the recommendation in the MacKay report to allow for 
it.  We believe that the government has failed consumers since 
this measure was seen to be a key point in increasing competition 
and benefiting consumers of retail banking, that is by the credit 
unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the measures in the bill that would 
regulate access to financial services.  We are concerned about 
regulating branch closures.  This kind of initiative by the 
Liberals is unnecessary red tape.  The banking industry already 
considers it good business practice to properly justify any bank 
closures and to give fair warning to the communities or their 
customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also proposes a financial consumer agency responsible 
to the finance minister.  These bureaucratic positions would be 
filled with Liberal appointments, like Mr. Lou Sekora, just as 
many other failed Liberal candidates have been given patronage 
plum jobs by the Liberals. 
We would support an independent ombudsman selected by the House 
with penalty enforcement powers and the ability to make binding 
directives when necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we hope the Liberals will pay considerable 
attention and take our amendments seriously.  We hope they will 
listen to the witnesses who will be appearing before the 
committee.  We will support the bill with amendments, 
particularly in the areas of credit unions establishing 
co-operatively held banks; the tremendous power given to the 
Minister of Finance; the bureaucracy created by the new 
commissioner of the FCAC; and the regulation that demands banks 
to provide money losing personal accounts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Richmond, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank the voters and 
constituents of Richmond, which is I think the best place to live 
in the lower mainland of British Columbia, for giving me this 
opportunity to represent them and to be here today to talk about 
this technical but very important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that my maiden speech will be a rather 
technical one.  However, I think it is important to say, as my 
friend from Surrey Central has mentioned, that the Canadian 
Alliance supports the general thrust of the legislation.  We hope 
to offer constructive amendments to it at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to go point by point in a little 
bit more detail than my colleague and talk about the position of 
the Liberal government and how we will be helpful in supporting 
where we believe support is necessary, and opposing in a gentler 
constructive way where we believe that opposition is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Surrey Central talked about the Canadian 
financial services ombudsman.  We all know that this agency would 
be responsible to the finance minister.  It would be designed for 
all financial institutions.  The Canadian Alliance believes that 
it will simply be another bureaucracy with no powers and filled 
with Liberal appointments.  What we should have, and what the 
Canadian Alliance will follow through on at committee stage, is 
an independent ombudsman selected by the House with our 
colleagues, with the powers of penalty enforcement and also with 
the power to make binding directives to the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also talk about the holding company structure. The 
Canadian Alliance does support this new structure because it 
would allow Canada's banks to more effectively compete against 
foreign non-bank competitors and other alternative financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many financial institutions in Richmond.  We have credit 
unions, the TD Bank and the Bank of Montreal.  I was actually 
discussing this proposal with the bank manager of the TD Bank. 
We are in complete agreement with the bill on this and we will 
work very closely with the government to pass the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to expanding the credit union role, I reiterate that 
we are disappointed that the government did not take the MacKay 
report into consideration when dealing with this point.  The 
Canadian Alliance supports the move to restrict widely held 
ownership to 20% because we think it will strengthen the global 
position of Canada's domestic banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to Richmond riding again, we have the TD Bank and the 
Bank of Montreal.  We have a wonderful opportunity to move in not 
only south of the border, where we have many integrations 
occurring in the financial services, but if we are able to pass 
the legislation, we can be world players in the international 
field, particularly in the Asian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of allowing smaller banks, we are talking about the 
minimum capital requirements to establish a new bank, trust 
company or insurance company.  We support this initiative because 
it would provide more consumer choice, which basically is what 
this is all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about percentages and holding requirements.  Even 
though we are in opposition we believe we are a constructive 
force.  Ultimately we are trying to give the greatest choice to 
consumers at the lowest possible price.  The greater the 
competition, the greater will be the incentive to have lower 
costs on service charges and on a variety of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to restrictions on auto leasing and insurance, the 
Canadian Alliance believes that the auto leasing and insurance 
markets are currently very vibrant and competitive industries. 
The banks must continue to be restricted from offering auto 
leasing and insurance products directly through their branches to 
avoid unduly concentrating financial power in their hands.  We 
are talking about competition where we do not want a monolithic 
entity stifling competition and where we can have a variety of 
players in the field such as local brokers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a variety of local insurance agents in Richmond.  They 
work very hard to give the best possible price and products to 
the people of Richmond.  I am sure we have hard working brokers 
across the country.  I take this opportunity on behalf of the 
Canadian Alliance to congratulate the hard working men and women 
who work within these industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to regulating access, my friend talked about the new 
regulations that would set lower ID requirements for opening 
accounts and proof of employment would not be a requirement. This 
is excessive red tape. It is an issue that is not being properly 
addressed.  Let us allow the industry to address it.  We believe 
it is an area that the government should not be delving into. 
Let us allow the forces at play to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the government side for finally dealing with this 
issue.  As my friend from Surrey Central mentioned, we must have 
a very strong and vibrant financial service so that our whole 
economy can function properly.  We are a bit disappointed and 
saddened that the seven year process has occurred with a lot of 
political manoeuvring rather than sound business economic 
decision making.  However, I am sure that in committee stage we 
will be able to work very closely with the government to make 
sure we come up with a top notch bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Richmond on his maiden 
speech in the House of Commons.  Let me be a bit partial toward 
this member for just a brief moment.  We have an alumnus past 
together at Saint Michael's in Toronto.  I celebrate that part of 
his life.  It is just too bad that somehow he ended up with the 
Canadian Alliance.  He had a strong tradition of real liberal 
values and I can only hope that his upbringing and his education 
will be a moderating influence on the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member represents the riding of Richmond but he also has 
deep roots in the greater Toronto area.  I humbly point out to 
the member that it is important that financial institutions be 
reminded constantly that we on all sides of the House are 
attentive to the treatment of and access to capital for small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hoping that perhaps the member would stand in his newly 
minted role as the member for Richmond and commit a large 
part of his time to making sure that our financial institutions 
are very vigilant in looking after small businessmen and women 
and their access to capital activities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me thank my 
friend from Toronto—Danforth for those very kind words.  One 
thing my friend did not mention is that we may have gone to the 
same high school but my friend may have gone a few years earlier 
than I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a note saying that the youth looks at things in a very 
passionate and emotional way and then they simply grow up.  In 
response to my friend's questions on my meanderings and my moving 
over on the political spectrum, perhaps I simply grew up and 
looked at things the way they ought to be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share my friend's concerns about the importance of providing 
capital to small business.  We have talked about big business. 
The Prime Minister is off to China trying to get contracts for 
big companies.  That is a legitimate thing to do, if they are 
actually able to get them.  However, no reputable economic thinker 
disputes the importance of small business to the strength of the 
economy.  If we cannot have access in a fast and efficient way at 
rates which are competitive, we are not going to do things in a 
good way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply thank my friend across the aisle for his comments 
and say that we will work together.  I am sure all of my 
colleagues in the Canadian Alliance would agree that we need to 
have a strong financial services sector with banks and financial 
institutions that offer loans to the small businessman and woman. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am glad to have the opportunity to join the debate on Bill C-8. 
As has been pointed out by previous speakers, the bill is a 
reincarnation of Bill C-38 which died on the order paper last 
fall at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can tell by the amount of debate in the House on this bill 
already today that there is great interest among all Canadians 
to see reform of our financial institutions and the whole 
financial sector.  This stems from a growing feeling on the part 
of Canadians that our current financial institutions are failing 
to meet the needs of the average Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing sense that our chartered banks, which most 
people grew up with as symbols of stability, that they were 
something to be proud of and which were given charters for 
specific reasons, are failing to meet their mandates under 
the terms of which they were given their charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the five chartered banks have an exclusive 
monopoly on certain financial transactions, for instance, the 
right to process credit charges.  These profitable transactions 
are huge.  This is a sector that they have been given exclusive 
right to and the trade-off was that they would meet the needs of 
the average Canadian community and the average Canadian citizen 
for their basic financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can begin by saying that in the riding of Winnipeg Centre that 
has been anything but the case.  In fact, there has been a flight 
of capital from the inner cities across the country, Winnipeg 
Centre being no exception.  There is almost a seemingly vote of 
non-confidence in our communities as people watch these 
institutions fold up their tents, leave and not provide the basic 
services that they were charged with the responsibility to offer. 
In fact, they are doing anything but that.  As was pointed out by 
the previous speaker, small businesses are not given a loan 
unless they can prove that they do not need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more of the basic financial services, such as having a 
neighbourhood branch within a reasonable distance for senior 
citizens or people of low income, are getting to be a thing of 
the past.  These services are being taken over by ATMs or by 
large corporate branches that may be in the centre of the 
financial district, but they are not in the communities and they 
are not in the small towns in and around rural Manitoba.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a growing resentment over this trend of bank 
closures.  This came to light a couple of years ago when the 
banks were anxious to merge to form even larger institutions. 
Many Canadians mobilized at that time, specifically to stop the 
bank mergers.  However, other realities came to the forefront. 
There has been a growing frustration with not only the lack of 
services in the communities.  It forced Canadians to have a 
really serious hard look at what our major financial institutions 
were or were not really doing for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has even mobilized people who own shares in the various 
banks.  There is a growing shareholder movement among people who 
own shares in the five chartered banks.  I had the privilege of 
going to two of the national shareholders' meetings recently.  I 
never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be going to a 
shareholders' meeting of the Royal Bank or the Bank of Montreal. 
I do not own shares in either of those institutions, so I had to 
borrow some proxy votes in order to crash the gates and get in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our point was that at a time when the banks seem to be operating 
on their own and without any input from the Canadian people who 
cause them to be, we needed to seize the issue somehow and put a 
little bit of democracy back into the corporate system.  In other 
words, if we were unable through our elected institutions to 
coerce the banks into doing their job of servicing Canadians, 
perhaps if we mobilized through a shareholders' rights movement 
we could coerce the banks into doing the job that they were hired 
to do or they were given the exclusive right of some financial 
transactions in exchange for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was rather interesting.  I do not know, Madam Speaker, if you 
have ever been to a shareholders' meeting of one of the major 
chartered banks.  Probably many of the people in the room have. I 
certainly had not.  I was very surprised that as many as 1,400 
people crammed the hall in a major hotel in downtown Toronto to 
attend the meeting.  I thought it would be like other meetings of 
its type that I had been to, like union meetings where people 
would move a motion, have it seconded, debate it and the motion 
would either pass or fail based on its merits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, nobody there seemed interested in talking about 
very much except for the actual returns of that quarter of that 
actual fiscal year that was being reported on.  We went there 
with a number of people who moved real motions that we thought 
would benefit the average Canadian.  There were only nine 
resolutions put forward in the whole meeting.  We moved all nine 
and I seconded all nine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the resolutions was to limit the salary of the CEO of the 
bank to ten times that of the average employee, which he thought 
was kind of an innovative move.  It was quite a fair resolution 
too when one thinks about it.  If the average employee makes 
$40,000 or $50,000 a year working for the banks, the CEO would 
then get 10 times that or $500,000 or $600,000 a year.  We would 
think that is pretty fair compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion did not pass.  We seconded it and argued it 
aggressively as to why that would be more fair.  We even pointed 
out that the average CEO of a Japanese corporation makes 10 to 13 
times that of the average worker of the enterprise over which 
they govern.  In the case of the bank presidents of the Royal 
Bank and the Bank of Montreal that figure is 80, or 90 or 120 
times the earnings of the average employee.  Those are wildly and 
grossly inflated salaries to reward these bank presidents for 
doing what?  For cutting off access to services for average 
Canadians.  This seemed to be their reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted there were record profits involved and quarter after 
quarter they were making more money, but all the time they were 
raising service charges, closing bank branches and denying basic 
services like loans to small businesses.  No wonder they were 
making a profit and rewarding each other very handsomely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we looked at that structure, no wonder they were voting 
each other big raises.  They all seemed to sit on each other's 
boards of directors.  I learned a lot when I crashed that 
shareholders' meeting.  As a socialist and a trade unionist, 
attending a shareholders' meeting like that was a real education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learned that one of the boards of directors of the bank, I 
believe the Royal Bank, George Cohon, the CEO of McDonald's, sits 
on 50 other boards of directors. 
Each one of those boards meets about 10 times a year.  That is 
500 board meetings a year that presumably one would have to 
attend, but nobody can do that.  The only board meeting one 
really has to go to is the board meeting when they vote on a 
raise for the board of directors.  Then the other members of that 
board will come to that board of directors meeting and vote for a 
massive raise.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes an incestuous little circle of people who vote each 
other massive pay increases.  That is what motivated us to try to 
interfere with that whole circular process and cap it off. 
Whatever rate of pay one is paying one's employees, one can pay 
oneself 10 times that, but that is enough.  Frankly, we do not 
believe that banks deserve to be rewarded for cutting off access 
of Canadians to basic banking services.  That is one of the 
shortcomings that we pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another motion that we moved demanded gender parity on the board 
of directors; 50:50, female to male.  We came close on that. It 
is really ironic that the person that moved the motion was a 
famous Bloc separatist named Yves Michaud.  He is the person 
whose motions I was seconding.  The results of that vote were 
exactly the same result as in the last Quebec referendum, 49.6 to 
50.4.  There is something about that number that Yves Michaud 
seems to generate in people.  I do not know if it is because he 
moved it.  Perhaps I should have moved the motion myself.  We 
thought that was a good idea.  There was a great deal of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other motions that we moved was the very thing that I 
pointed out with the increasing of CEOs wages, salaries and 
compensation.  Due to the fact that they all sit on each other's 
boards of directors, we also moved a motion that would limit the 
number of boards one could sit on to 10.  If they all want to sit 
on each other's boards, let us make it a reasonable number.  In 
this way we hoped to somewhat democratize the corporate structure 
and give the people who actually rely on the bank's services to 
some say on what the banks do or do not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Winnipeg Centre, we have seen bank branches 
close in an almost epidemic way.  The same is true for my 
colleague from the riding of Winnipeg North Centre.  The banks 
are shutting down branches like there is no tomorrow in the hopes 
to increase their profits even more.  The trade-off was supposed 
to be that we would give them the exclusive right to certain 
financial transactions in exchange for reliable adequate service 
and even some accountability to the community at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in the United States there is a community bank 
investments act which mandates that banks reinvest a certain 
amount of their profit into the community that they serve, even 
if it is not the most profitable venture, or a break even venture 
or marginal venture.  If it is something of community interest, a 
non-profit group that wants to get started but is short of 
capital, the banks would be mandated by the community investment 
act to invest in at least some of these things to move the 
community forward for its own benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 does one thing.  It helps the credit union movement.  I 
should say something positive about that.  Many of those people 
are so disillusioned with the service, or lack of service, that 
they have been getting from the chartered banks.  They have been 
gravitating toward the credit unions in order to get access to 
the financial service that every family and small business need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the positive aspects of Bill C-8 is that it will finally 
allow a national structure for the credit unions, a credit union 
central, so that they would be recognized as an entity that way. 
We think that is a very positive step.  We see it province to 
province.  We have a Manitoba credit union central.  Now there 
can be a national structure along those lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the shortcomings far outweigh those small benefits. 
Canadians are looking to the banks for support for the most 
basic of services and are being denied them.  In a time when the 
banks are showing record profits, one would think that there 
would be some feeling that they should be able to enhance their 
service to Canadians instead of continually reducing them in 
spite of record profits quarter after quarter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is that the banks have done nothing to deserve 
being rewarded with the additional freedoms they would enjoy 
under Bill C-8.  We believe Bill C-8 would, in a small way, 
enable the banks to achieve what they failed to achieve recently 
under the bank mergers.  It almost institutionalizes the concept 
that banks will eventually merge, in that it specifically talks 
about that eventuality and the possibility it would be dealt with 
in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of being dealt with on a random ad hoc basis, it more or 
less contemplates that mergers sooner or later will be a fait 
accompli.  Canadians recoiled at the whole bank merger idea.  The 
society of seniors spoke out vehemently that they were concerned 
that if banks were allowed to merge further and get even bigger, 
their interest in serving the small homeowners or small 
businesses would be even less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that much of the profit the banks are making now is 
really from their offshore and corporate customers, not from the 
average citizen and the small mortgages that homeowners might 
enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that comes to mind, and I wish we had thought of 
it at the shareholders' meetings of the banks, is to protest the 
fact that when the Minister of Finance outlined the recent round 
of tax cuts, the announcement that the corporate tax rate will go 
down from 17% to 16% slipped by without very much notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard different figures as to what effect this will have 
on the chartered banks.  One figure that I heard is that as much 
as $75 million a year will be kept by the banks as a result of 
that one percentage point change in the corporate tax structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the House of Commons and all Canadians what the 
chartered banks have done for us recently to deserve a reward 
like this, a kickback, if we will, of up to $75 million per year 
that they will now be able to keep above and beyond the record 
profits that they enjoy quarter after quarter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might sense that I am quite critical of our financial 
institutions.  We were hopeful that Bill C-8 would come down hard 
and advocate on behalf of Canadians.  We expected the Canadian 
government to be champions of Canadians and not, frankly, to 
cater to the interests of financial institutions and give them 
the enabling legislation they might need to go through with what 
they failed to do last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many seniors have visited me in my riding to tell me how 
disappointed they were that their local bank branch was closing, 
and they wanted to know why.  When they appeal to the banks they 
get a long, convoluted restructuring message on how the banks 
will be better able to serve their customers through e-commerce 
and ATMs, and that now people can bank on the Internet, switch on 
their home PCs and have all those banking services available to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not much consolation for a low income senior citizen on 
a fixed income.  The seniors in my riding resent losing what they 
counted on as being part of their community and part of their 
neighbourhood.  As I said in my opening remarks, it really looks 
like a vote of non-confidence in a neighbourhood when the local 
bank branch does not see fit to stick around because it does not 
sense enough economic activity to warrant keeping its doors open. 
What does a boarded up bank say about one's neighbourhood and 
about the viability of the town, the community or the inner city 
neighbourhood that one lives in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have called the attitude of the banks toward 
ordinary Canadians abusive and unaccountable to the community. 
What we had hoped to see in a bill dealing with financial 
institutions was a return to that accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of a parliamentary junket to Botswana that I was 
invited on.  The outgoing president of Botswana, Masire, was one 
of those African leaders who really was committed to his 
community.  It was one of those countries that was not corrupt 
and that worked hard in the post-war era to try to build a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Masire had chartered banks in his country with the exact terms 
and conditions that we put on ours.  That is what he said in a 
meeting with the minister, which we attended.  However, the banks 
disappointed him and failed to meet their commitments in such a 
way that he said to hell with them.  He said that he was going to 
invite the whole world to come and bank in Botswana because those 
to whom he gave that exclusive privilege had failed the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we are at that point.  I am not saying it is 
quite that drastic for us yet, but there is a growing feeling 
that we are giving chartered banks the exclusive right to some of 
the most profitable transactions.  The processing of credit cards 
is one example.  Every time a credit card is used the processing 
fee must be done by one of the chartered banks.  If we give banks 
that exclusive right, we want something in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to see boarded up banks in our communities.  We 
want a commitment to and reinvestment in our communities.  Banks 
should take some of their record profits and do more than just 
donate to the Winnipeg Ballet or to some other arts program to 
improve their image.  If they gave one-tenth of what they spend 
on TV advertising, which is a huge campaign to try to improve 
their image, people might feel compensated for some of what they 
have lost in service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are huge gaps in banking law.  There is a real need to 
address the overall picture and the way Canadians view the banks, 
whether in terms of providing services, the insurance aspect of 
things, what the banks have been trying to grab, or all of their 
financial activities.  We need to put the reins on them in some 
respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, thankfully, stops short of giving them all they have 
asked for in terms of being a single window shopping centre for 
all financial transactions, whether auto insurance, life 
insurance or whatever.  We have not gone that far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see that banks with some accountability to the 
community and not just to their shareholders.  If they are to be 
motivated by profit alone and by no secondary objectives 
whatsoever, why are we giving them exclusive monopoly on certain 
transactions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I predict there will be a growing shareholders rights movement 
and that more people will be buying 100 shares of one of the 
banks so that they can crash the shareholders meetings, hijack 
the meetings and get some of the amendments we put forward 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians were polled, they would be horrified that some 
people make $8 million a year to run one of the chartered banks. 
The basic salary might only be $1.5 million a year, but when 
stock options and shares are added up, they are making $8 million 
to $10 million a year for not really doing their job.  Why reward 
people for failing to do the job they were asked to do?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have two questions for the hon. member from the NDP. 
Could he tell the House what the return is on capital investment 
of banks?  I want to know how much money they invest in total and 
how much they get in return.  If he knows the answer to that, I 
would appreciate hearing from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, how much of the profits banks make came from service 
charges to consumers last year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was a proxy shareholder 
at the shareholders' meeting.  I do not have access to all the 
inside information that the banks might circulate on what their 
total revenue is or on the amount that they spend in the 
community.  What I am sharing with the House is the frustration 
that Canadians feel over what they see to be a lack of services 
to the community and a lack of reinvestment in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give graphic case by case examples of small businesses 
that could expand in my riding if it were not for lack of access 
to venture capital.  They could expand and grow and hire more 
people if they had better accessibility to capital.  The banks 
are turning them down.  The feeling is that if they cannot prove 
they do not need the money, the banks will not give it to them. 
In other words, if they need it they will not get it.  If they do 
not need it, the banks will give them all they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the intention of the member's questions is to 
act as some corporate shill for the banks.  I do not think the 
banks need his help to defend themselves.  They spend millions 
and millions every year running ads on TV trying to paint 
themselves as warm, fuzzy parts of the community.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the member who asked the question and I know that nothing 
could be further from the truth.  Most of their profits are 
generated from their corporate and offshore accounts.  I attended 
two shareholder meetings and learned that over 50% of their 
revenue was actually from their offshore activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is very little money to be made in handling either ma and

riding.  There is no money in that, and they would just as soon 
get out of it and pass it over to the credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is their attitude, why are they being rewarded, every 
time we turn around, with exclusive rights to the financial 
transactions I mentioned or with another drop in the corporate 
tax rate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Taxpayers Federation is always talking about tax 
freedom day.  On June 26 Canadians enjoy tax freedom day; they 
actually get to keep their money.  There used to be a corporate 
tax freedom day, but it started getting in the way of New Year's 
eve. The parties started to blend together, so corporate tax 
freedom day was stopped because they were getting embarrassed. 
The New Year's eve party and the corporate tax freedom party 
would merge into one event.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member for Winnipeg Centre raised a very 
important issue that must be addressed by the House as we pursue 
Bill C-8.  The issue has been invisible to date, and I am 
surprised that more members are not speaking up about the impact 
of bank closures on their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about rural communities, isolated northern 
communities, inner city older neighbourhoods, and whole 
communities that have been abandoned by the big banks and that do 
not seem to be addressed in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre and I have experienced numerous 
bank branch closures over the last several years.  Low income 
residents, senior citizens and small businesses are not able to 
get the services they need and deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member have any suggestions for the government 
to improve the legislation?  Would he support the idea of a 
moratorium on bank branch closures until such time as we can put 
in place proper mechanisms for addressing profitability and 
community viability?  Would he agree with the idea enunciated by 
our colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle about some form of 
obligation on the part of the banks to reinvest back into the 
communities that gave them their position of profitability in the 
first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre asked me the number of bank closures in my 
riding in the past seven years.  I can give her the number since 
I was elected in 1997.  Twelve branches have closed in my riding 
alone during that period.  It is an epidemic.  It is an absolute 
flight of capital from the inner city, or at least the presence 
of bank branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also asked what we would have liked to have seen 
in the legislation that might have mandated some accountability 
or some reinvestment in the community from the banks that have 
been allowed to prosper under their exclusive privileges.  There 
were repeated calls at the committee stage throughout the 
development of Bill C-38 to put it in language similar to the 
community reinvestment act of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is the ultimate free market country.  Nobody 
is saying that the community reinvestment act somehow gets in the 
way of the free movement of capital.  It is a sensible 
restriction on banks.  Yes, they can make profits and yes, they 
can prosper and flourish, but some designated amount must be 
reinvested into the community that gave them the profits they 
enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not have been difficult to do this.  It is a huge 
shortcoming in the bill and a missed opportunity for us to be 
advocates and champions for Canadians instead of being champions 
for the big banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use the term corporate shill.  Are we shilling for the banks 
with this legislation?  Is that what we are really doing, or are 
we standing up on our hind legs and advocating on behalf of 
Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Madam Speaker, earlier I asked 
the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre two questions and did not 
receive any answers.  I hope he takes a few hours tonight or 
tomorrow before he comes to the House to research the questions 
in order to give me the appropriate answers, because I am looking 
for them.  They are very valid and important questions for the 
taxpayers of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, it was kind of a 
non-question.  I did take the hon. member's first questions very 
seriously but could not answer them with specific numbers.  I do 
not think anyone in the House of Commons today could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we know is what Canadians are telling us.  They sense that 
the profits are not going into the community, that the profits 
are sometimes leaving the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the argument on the other side that we all enjoy 
the benefits when the banks make money because we are all 
shareholders in the banks and that even if we are not personally 
shareholders, maybe the pension plan that we belong to with our 
union invests in bank stock, so we want them to flourish and 
prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we also want something to go directly into the 
community.  That is not an unreasonable request.  When the banks 
are enjoying record profits quarter after quarter and do nothing 
about their service charges and the increase in fees, with an 
increase of up to 150% in recent years, it is no wonder they are 
making a profit.  It is not unlike the Liberal government's EI 
system, whereby if government takes in more money than it gives 
out obviously there will be some left over.  We want a tangible 
return to Canadians, a real hard return, one that benefits the 
community and not just the shareholders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill 
C-8, an act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada 
and to amend certain acts in relation to financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill replaces Bill C-38, which as they say died on the 
Order Paper when parliament was dissolved last October, after the 
Prime Minister decided to call an early election, having not yet 
completed four years of his mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, this is essentially the same bill. Bills C-38 and 
C-8 are twins.  But they are not identical because, in addition 
to a few minor amendments to ensure a closer match between the English 
and French texts, there is a major change with respect to 
the demands made by the Bloc Quebecois and by Bernard Landry, 
Minister of State for the Economy and Finance and Deputy Premier 
of Quebec, a change which would ultimately make the bill more 
acceptable by adding amendments anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that the federal government decided to respond in 
part to the demands and expectations expressed by minister Landry 
by incorporating in its bill four points the Government of Quebec 
felt were important.  However, these points were incorporated not 
in the bill itself, but in the guidelines on the reclassification 
of the banks listed in schedule 1 whose equity capital is under 
$5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines that accompanied the release issued on the day 
the Minister of Finance introduced his bill, clearly stated 
that, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any transaction involving a recategorization will be considered 
on its own merits, and should demonstrate that it would foster 
opportunities for the bank to grow and better serve the 
customers of the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In considering whether a proposed transaction involving a 
recategorization is in the public interest, the Minister shall 
take into account all matters that the Minister considers 
relevant, including: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>safety and soundness of the bank; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>direct and indirect employment; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>the location of the mind and management of the bank; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>needs of consumers; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>businesses and operations of the bank; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>and prospects for the bank in the context of the global 
marketplace.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since these elements were not included in the act, they 
could be changed by the minister who could, for example, yield 
to the pressures of powerful international lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I must say without any hesitation that Bill C-8 
raises many questions in my mind. When I think about what I have 
seen and observed with this government over the past eight 
years, I am concerned. I am concerned by, among other things, 
the government's arrogance, its contempt for democracy, its 
inability to fulfil its own promises and by the ease with which 
it yields to the pressures of the well-to-do and crushes the poor. 
I could go on and on, because there are so many reasons to be 
concerned about this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at a few things that are scary in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 gives full power to the federal Minister of Finance to 
decide, alone, the future of Quebec banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-8, the Minister of Finance will be able to decide 
alone, at his own discretion, the future of Quebec banks. I find 
it truly unacceptable that this discretionary power is as strong 
as if not stronger than the act itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is concerned that a single shareholder could, 
with the agreement of the Minister of Finance, own 65% of the 
shares of the National Bank, the number one bank in Quebec. 
There is no need for the Minister of Finance to authorize this 
excessive control to ensure the flexibility of the National 
Bank. How is it that a shareholder owning 65% of a bank will 
give it more flexibility than 65 shareholders owning 1% each? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need legislative guarantees against any negative impact these 
new ownership rules might have on employment, for example, on 
consumer services, on small business services, on decision 
centres and, most of all, on Montreal's role as a hub in the 
area of international finance. The stakes are just too high for 
Quebec to rely on only one person, the federal Minister of 
Finance, especially since Bill C-8 offers no real legislative 
guarantees. 
As I said earlier, the bill does nothing more than list some 
elements to consider that do not go far enough and that are 
under the sole control of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse, it seems to me that the finance minister's bill is 
full of holes which should be cause for concern to any person of 
goodwill. Why must the government write such thick bills if it 
does not seek clarity? How will this government be able to judge 
the clarity of others if it is incapable of seeing its own lack 
of clarity? One factor which contributes to clarity is 
precision. See for yourselves. On page 55 of the bill, clause 
385 sets out the public holding requirement for banks. However, 
we learn a little further on, in clause 388, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On application by a bank, the Minister may, if the Minister 
considers it appropriate to do so, by order exempt the bank from 
the requirements of section 385, subject to any terms and 
conditions that the Minister considers appropriate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well we see that the provisions of the act cease to apply if 
the minister so decides.  In other words, this is a bill with 
flexible parameters, one that will allow Ottawa and the Minister 
of Finance to decide unilaterally on the future of the National 
Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not obvious that the federal Minister of Finance's bill as 
presented will ensure healthy competition in the national 
market.  Yet this competition is more important to future 
economic development than striving to be bigger internationally.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Minister of Finance has decided to make legislation in 
favour of the big banks, even if by so doing he has to sell out 
the banks of Quebec, including the National Bank, the one known 
as the bank of small and medium size business in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of the way certain individuals, including the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and member for 
Saint-Laurent, want to see Quebec suffer, I tell myself this is a 
really powerful weapon in the hands of the federal Minister of 
Finance, if ever the federal government decides to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I say to my fellow Quebecers, here is another 
really good reason, just one more, to create our own country, so 
that we can make our own decisions on what we want to do with 
our banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards consumer protection, the Minister of Finance remains 
vague and expresses more wish than real policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 will establish the financial consumer agency whose 
purpose, according to the finance minister, will be to protect 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is and has always been a protector of human 
rights and citizens as evidenced by the debate held in this House 
on Bill C-54 that dealt with the protection of personal 
information and died on the order paper in 1997 to be 
reintroduced as Bill C-6 and given royal assent on April 13, 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that Quebec already has several laws 
protecting consumers. For instance, there are the consumer 
protection act, the privacy act, as well as all the legislation 
on insurance companies, trust companies, savings and credit 
unions and securities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new agency will only create duplication in regulations, 
given all the measures that have already been taken by the 
Government of Quebec in this area which, need I remind the House, 
is under provincial and not federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister takes the credit for including in Bill C-8 
a measure, the low-fee retail deposit account, as described in 
section 448.2, that would provide low income people greater 
access to financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this famous low-fee retail deposit account, 
nobody except the minister knows exactly what it is all about. 
Nobody knows what are the prescribed characteristics mentioned in 
this clause and which would entitle an individual to a low-fee 
retail deposit account. Nobody except the minister of course 
knows whether such an account will be available everywhere, in 
every bank in Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, as we are talking, the minister is the only one 
who knows the answer to all these questions? It is very simple. 
The minister is the only one who knows, because all these issues 
will be defined in the regulations. As we are having this debate 
in the House, we do not have a clue about what will be in the 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True enough, if the regulations had been made an appendix to the 
bill, it would have increased the thickness of an already 
voluminous piece of legislation. For the time being, all we have 
to go by is the minister's word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once bitten, twice shy, however. Members of this government have 
made so many promises during three election campaigns, in 1993, 
1997 and 2000, without keeping their promises or being true to 
their word, that I must say the fine words from the Canadian 
Minister of Finance are not enough to be able to categorically 
state that consumers will be better protected under this new law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also question what is in the bill regarding branch closure; I 
wonder what will happen with the reduction in services available 
to consumers. The only measure provided by Bill C-8 is that a 
bank must give a four month notice before closing a branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before, people learned about the closure the very morning their 
branch was to close. With the finance minister's bill, they will 
know about it four months ahead of time.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government can do precious little to 
prevent, through legislation or coercion, the anticipated closure 
of a branch. With a clause that is so unrestrictive, how can one 
claim, like the finance minister does, that this bill will 
improve access to financial services? The minister is the only 
one who can have this kind conviction and optimism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 does not provide any concrete measure to ensure greater 
access to financial services for the poor. That would have been a 
step in the right direction. The minister should know by now that 
there is a real problem there. He could have made use of the bill 
introduced by my colleague and friend, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, in the second session of the 36th 
parliament. The bill was entitled an act to amend the Bank Act 
and the Statistics Act (equity in community reinvestment). Its 
main goal was to ensure that certain branches of banks take 
measures to facilitate access to credit for persons who have a 
residence or a place of business in a federal electoral district 
in which the branches are located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 does not give any guarantee that the minister will take 
into consideration the specificity of the financial system in 
Quebec. 
Madam Speaker, if you and I could have a conversation on the 
subject, I am almost convinced that you would tell me “The hon. 
member is well aware of the fact that the minister is himself 
from Quebec, and he takes Quebecers' interests to heart”. I 
would regretfully have to tell you that the minister is indeed 
the member for Lasalle—Émard, but that he ignores or purports to 
ignore that Quebec is a people whose financial system has its own 
specificities, and that the minister in no way takes that into 
account in Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that we would have this conversation if you did not 
hold your present position. I know that you now have to be of the 
utmost neutrality. But if you were a backbencher, as I am, we 
could have had this little chat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, the members for St. Hyacinthe—Bagot and 
Drummond, who are finance critic and assistant finance critic, 
respectively, will propose amendments to Bill C-8 on behalf of 
the Bloc Quebecois to counter the inequity towards Quebec's major 
banks. I hope the extended Liberal caucus from Quebec will keep 
its promise of standing up in Ottawa for Quebecers. To this day, 
this caucus has given its support to the government each time it 
has introduced bills going against promises made during the 
recent campaign. Will I be forced, once more, to conclude that 
the population has been misled? I am waiting for proof and it is 
much too long coming.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first, I want to congratulate my colleague from 
Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis for her eloquent speech. We can see 
that she has really studied what she was talking about and has a 
very good grasp of it. You are missing a fine discussion with 
her, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we cannot talk about banks and the Bank Act without 
talking about a distinguished Quebecer who tackled the issue in 
the last few years. The hon. members know that I am talking about 
Yves Michaud, a former Quebec delegate to Paris and who, instead 
of taking a very comfortable and well-deserved retirement, 
decided instead, in spite of his age, to put all his energy, all 
his talent and all his eloquence—and has plenty of all that—at 
the service of not only the consumers, but also of small equity 
investors. He wanted to make the operations and management of the 
banks and probably the Bank Act itself more democratic and more 
beneficial to those who put their trust in this very important 
system in our social and economic culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I would like to honour Mr. Michaud for the very 
important things he did for the nation and people of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis made me realize 
that there is one more argument to add to our long list of 
arguments in favour of promoting sovereignty.  We sovereignists 
have so many arguments that we need to update the list 
regularly.  However, there is one that was offered to us on a 
silver plate in this financial institutions reform, and it is 
the terms and conditions governing special treatment, the 
special status.  I think it is most appropriate to use this 
expression in relation to the National Bank, the national bank 
of Quebecers, the bank of SMBs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 20% foreign ownership of major Canadian banks becomes 65% in 
the case of Quebec's national bank. 
I would like my colleague, the member for Rimouski-Neigette-et-la 
Mitis, to tell us what, according to her, might be the 
intentions of the federal government in granting a special 
status not to Quebec but to its national bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without imputing motives to the federal government, what is its 
purpose in putting the National Bank in such a vulnerable 
position, totally exposed to foreign control?  A crucial sector 
of our economy could end up in the hands of foreign interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member has an opinion on this, on 
the deeper motives of this government toward Quebec and the 
national bank of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, this is an extremely 
important question. Of course, I do not know what were the 
government's motives behind such a decision. There is however 
one thing I am trying to understand. When I looked into my 
crystal ball this morning, on the train— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where you were served in English only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> —where I was served in English only, I 
realized that the Government of Canada wants the banks to be the 
key strategic components of its economic development plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has decided to protect the banks, especially 
those operating in Canada, against foreign invaders. It has 
therefore set the limit at 20% of shares per shareholder, and 
will not go higher than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the case of the National Bank, a bank operating 
mainly in Quebec, which helps out small businesses which in turn 
greatly support the economic development of Quebec, should the 
proportion of shares be allowed to increase to 65%, there could 
be a takeover that would change the whole political situation 
and result in the National Bank not lending so much money to 
small businesses anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure what it is, but what I realized this morning is 
that there is some danger here, a trap, or a trick, to use one 
of the favourite expressions of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. There is more here than meets the 
eye. There is again a double standard that is meant to hurt 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my fellow citizens will understand that we now have one 
more reason to create our own country: to make what we want out 
of our bank.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment to the chair.  We 
look forward to you presiding over the Chamber with a great deal 
of wisdom, most of which you may have acquired in the various 
committees of the House.  I congratulate you on behalf of myself 
and, I am sure, my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just a few things to say about the bill.  As many people 
have pointed out, this is a bill that was before the House before 
the election.  It is a very large bill of 900 pages.  Bills 
having to do with banks tend to be like that, which is probably a 
good reason for getting it into committee as soon as possible 
after everybody has his or her say with respect to the principle 
of the bill and what is in it and what should be in it but is 
not.  That is what I will talk a bit about today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with respect to the positive aspects of the bill, which 
our critic, the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, has already 
highlighted on a number of occasions, one of the things we see as 
a positive in the bill are the changes with respect to the role 
of credit unions.  This is something the NDP has advocated for 
many years.  The changes with respect to credit unions are 
certainly seen by us as a positive development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some of the other things that have the appearance of 
being progressive are not necessarily as progressive as we would 
like.  I am referring to the agency the bill will create, which 
will be headed by a commissioner appointed by the governor in 
council.  We would have liked a more democratic structure, with 
representatives from various stakeholders overseeing the FCAC to 
ensure that it does not become a watered down consumer agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation includes only cosmetic measures to improve 
access to basic banking services.  At a time when service charges 
are on the rise again and banks are forcing us to pay for our own 
laptop banking, the government has abandoned its commitment, 
which it made in June 1999 in its financial policy paper, to 
force banks to provide a low cost account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, banks are moving to make it almost impossible to have a 
low cost account, even the kinds of accounts which many people 
have had for many years.  People are receiving correspondence 
from their banks instructing them that many of the things that 
they used to be able to do as part of their basic banking service 
will now be a matter of the banks charging for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough that the bank presidents already make 30 and 40 
times more than the tellers who work in their banks.  It is not 
enough that these people make these obscene amounts of money. No, 
they are going to ding the poor just a little more, in the name 
of what, I do not know.  Is it in the name of greed?  Or is it 
that euphemism for greed we hear so often in the language of the 
marketplace, is it that they have to be more “competitive”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same logic which I am sure will lead, thanks to other 
elements of the bill, to renewed talk of mergers and to renewed 
talk of megabanks.  Of course with the loosening up of the 
foreign ownership provisions, we will see not just new merged 
banks but new merged banks that are owned more by non-Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the objections that we have to the bill.  It 
seems to me that at a time when we hear so much from the private 
sector about the deficiencies of government services, the banks 
themselves, as major institutions, have become so user unfriendly 
in terms of charging people for everything they do and for every 
service they provide that it is a wonder that there are not more 
people turning to credit unions or hiding their money under their 
mattress or turning to almost anything but the banks.  The banks 
are absolutely ravenous, it seems to me, when it comes to their 
pursuit of profit through nickel-and-diming ordinary Canadians 
who are in the habit of dealing with banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I would like to see in terms of financial 
legislation that I do not see here.  Perhaps it would not be 
appropriate for it to be in this particular bill, but then again 
it might be.  It has to do with bankruptcy legislation itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still dealing with people in my constituency who were done 
out of wages, severance pay and holiday pay when particular 
companies went under.  Ordinary workers are the last people on 
the list.  Everybody else gets paid off first.  Many of these 
people find it very difficult to turn the page, because they know 
that a great injustice has been done to them and yet there is no 
legislative framework in which to pursue the justice they are due 
in these kinds of circumstances. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What justice is achieved is often achieved over the course of 
many years.  I am thinking, for example, of the people who were 
put in a terrible situation by the privatization of CN Express 
and the eventual closing down of that privatized company, or of 
the workers in my riding who found themselves in a similar 
position with respect to the sale of CP Express.  I am sure the 
list is much longer.  These are just a couple of examples that I 
am familiar with, where people have really been done in by 
existing legislation or the lack of protection in existing 
legislation when it comes to bankruptcies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I think we need to have more of a debate on in the 
House is what has happened to our whole monetary system.  It 
seems to me that when banking legislation is before us it is an 
opportunity to reflect on this.  I do not claim to be an expert 
in these matters, but there is a growing body of opinion in 
regard to this in the country, particularly among those who 
either write for or subscribe to the newsletter put out by the 
committee on monetary and economic reform, which I think is sent 
to all members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so many years ago our system was changed radically when we 
abandoned the role by which the Bank of Canada created a certain 
amount of the money that was available to the Government of 
Canada for the financing of government programs, social programs, 
et cetera.  There is a growing body of opinion, which seems to me 
to be a minority opinion, that something wrong was done when the 
private banks were given the exclusive right to create money and 
then subsequently given the right to create that money without 
having anything to back it up, so that the money that is created 
in the country today is money created by the creation of debt. It 
is debt created by the private banks.  This is not unrelated to 
the situation in which governments find themselves in terms of 
deficits, debt and the payment of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that a debate about money reform in the country 
is long overdue, as is a debate about looking at ways of 
recreating, perhaps with some changes—because the world does 
change and some possibilities remove themselves and other 
possibilities open up—the role of the Bank of Canada as a place 
where money can be created and where the government can act in a 
way that makes it less dependent upon the creation of debt by 
private banks in order to create money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some of the comments that I saw an opportunity to 
make in the context of this particular debate.  I hope that this 
does not lead somewhere down the line to us having to go back 
into the trenches, or however you want to describe it, in order 
to fight more and bigger bank mergers.  There is every reason to 
believe that this legislation sets up a process and creates the 
opportunities for those very same kinds of bank mergers that the 
government stood in the way of only a few years ago, albeit after 
much encouragement by the opposition and, in fairness, by some of 
their own backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were serious about preventing these kinds of 
mergers and preserving competition in a Canadian context, it 
would not be creating a situation where, by allowing Canadian 
banks to merge we, in order to get competition, then have to open 
up our borders to American competition.  I am reminded of what 
has happened in the airline industry:  if we get enough Canadian 
mergers it almost seems to be an instrument by which, ironically, 
we could end up with more American ownership. 
As a result of the merger of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
what people are asking is how we are going to get more 
competition.  They are saying that we have to open up our borders 
to competition from American airlines.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can see the same thing happening with respect to banks.  If 
we allow our economy to be dominated by one or two big Canadian 
megabanks the next thing we know we will be hearing the argument 
that we need more competition, so let us allow Chase Manhattan to 
open up on every corner across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I heard an Alliance Party member ask 
what is wrong with that.  The Alliance Party members never did 
get it.  These are people who make absolutely no differentiation 
between foreign ownership and Canadian ownership.  That is their 
position, but it is not the NDP position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be the Liberal position.  There was a time when the 
Liberal Party was known as a party that tried—sometimes in its 
own feeble way, but nevertheless it tried—to defend the 
interests of Canada and to defend the notion of Canadian 
ownership against foreign ownership or at least against a 
percentage of foreign ownership that was seen to be a threat to 
Canada's ability to control its own destiny.  Those days are gone 
forever, it seems, those days of the Liberal Party's foreign 
investment review agency, the Liberal Party's national 
energy policy and the Liberal Party that was against free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have, with the exception of the NDP, and sometimes only 
recently the Bloc, and then again only some individuals, a 
political monoculture in the House that seems to accept that it 
is just fine to have a marketplace dominated by the Americans, 
aided and abetted by a weak Canadian dollar which provides an 
opportunity for our entire country to be bought up at fire sale 
prices by the Americans, a political monoculture that says this 
is just the invisible hand of Adam Smith working itself out.  God 
is in his heaven and the invisible hand of Adam Smith is doing 
its work here on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not subscribe to that particular creed and never have.  We 
see this bill as one more opportunity for not what we would call 
the invisible hand but more like the mailed fist of Adam Smith 
crushing the possibility of Canada ever becoming anything like 
the independent country that it used to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least my Conservative colleagues, a shadow of their former 
selves numerically but obviously not in intellectual stature, ran 
in 1984 and said they wanted to get rid of the foreign investment 
review agency and the national energy program.  They wanted to 
let the marketplace do all these things.  They at least were 
intellectually honest about what they wanted to do.  I am being 
more than fair to them, because there were a few things that they 
were not really honest about.  By and large they said they wanted 
to deregulate.  They said they wanted to sell out the country and 
when they got elected they did sell out the country, so people 
got what they voted for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real tragedy here is the Liberal Party.  This is the real 
source of pathos, tragedy and betrayal in Canadian politics.  The 
Liberals are the people who once said they wanted to defend the 
country.  These are the people who used to be in favour of 
regulating foreign investment.  These are the people who said 
they were against free trade.  These are the people who used to 
worship at the knee of Walter Gordon and others, yet not one of 
them would qualify any more as a disciple of Walter Gordon.  They 
probably have never even heard of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the real tragedy in Canadian politics, that those who 
would defend the country, its economy and its ability to have 
some control over its own economic destiny have been reduced to a 
remnant by the political monoculture that has ensued since the 
passage of the free trade agreements.  This particular bill is 
just one more step along the way.  We register our opposition to 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member from the New Democratic Party who just spoke 
talked about selling out the country and American ownership.  I 
would suggest that if we want to slow down the Americans who are 
buying Canadian companies, we do it by pursuing fiscal policy 
that will cause the dollar to increase.  The dollar is at an 
artificially low level and that certainly does make it very easy 
for Americans to buy us out instead of Canadians buying their own 
companies.  I would like the member to comment on that.  That is 
the way to have Canadians buy Canadian companies and keep 
Canadian ownership:  through pursuing proper fiscal policy, which 
will cause the dollar to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further though, the member opposite talks about the Canadian 
Alliance wanting to privatize everything and having that type of 
policy.  I say that is not true.  In fact, we have an example 
today of where we do not support the government, which talks 
about privatizing the administration of the Firearms Act and 
privatizing the enforcement, if we can believe it, of the 
Firearms Act.  That is completely unreasonable.  I do not support 
it and my party does not support that kind of policy.  It is 
a crazy policy.  It is a taking privatization to the extreme.  I 
would like the member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, if there are limits to 
the Alliance's affinity for privatization, it is good to know it, 
but I notice that the <I>National Post</I> was kind of soft on 
this idea today in its editorial, so by next week the hon. member 
might be singing a different tune.  He should not be so sure that 
his party is dead set against this, because the people who really 
call the shots in the hon. member's political culture might be 
entertaining a different notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question about the low dollar, I wish life 
were as simple as the member makes it out to be.  It seems to me 
that right after the free trade agreement when we had the very 
deficits that the government has sought to eliminate, we had a 
high dollar.  In fact, one of the conspiracy theories at the time 
was that there had been an agreement to keep the Canadian dollar 
high so that the free trade agreement could not work to Canada's 
advantage.  That was within the ambit of the free trade argument 
itself.  That was at a time when the government had not dealt 
with the debt and the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government has dealt with the debt, much to the damage 
of our social programs and of a lot of individual Canadians 
because of the way it was done, and the dollar is low.  We have 
been assured for five or six years now that the government got 
the fundamentals right.  How long do we need to have the 
fundamentals right?  Is it a sentence?  Do we have to get the 
fundamentals right for 10 years or 15 years or 20 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that to the member in the sense that I do not think it is 
as simple as that. I do not think it just has to do with fiscal 
policy.  I am not sure exactly how it works.  I am not sure 
anybody is exactly sure how it works.  I am sure the Minister of 
Finance sometimes goes to bed at night wondering how it works and 
why the Canadian dollar is the way it is.  However, just to 
assume that if we were to adopt Canadian Alliance policies 
somehow the dollar would go up is a bit on the simplistic side.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I have not had an opportunity to congratulate you on your 
appointment.  I wish you all the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I enjoyed the hon. member's wide ranging speech.  I was at times 
hard pressed to know what it had to do with the subject of the 
debate, but I heard him talk about fiscal policy, monetary policy 
and the apparent demise of certain political parties.  I was a 
bit hard pressed to understand the relevance of the bill to those 
subjects.  Then the hon. member opposite brought up national 
energy policy and firearms legislation.  I suppose there are a 
few things left to debate, but I just do not know what else they 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member whether he believes that the 
passage of the bill will in fact lead to a more rational and 
sensible process with which the Government of Canada can deal 
with the demands of the marketplace and the demands of consumers 
with respect to the whole process of bank mergers and 
“rationalization” in the fiscal marketplace, and whether he 
thinks that this bill does bring some sense and some relevance to 
what is presently a somewhat chaotic process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, my impression from the 
discussions I have had with our finance critic is that what the 
member says is only partly true.  What he is not saying is that 
this really is setting up a process, not just for the 
rationalization of banks, but so the government can rationalize 
the rationalization of the banks in a way that it was not able to 
do under the previous legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is setting us up so that the next time this issue comes up, 
the Liberals can say that they followed the process in place and 
that due process was served.  When only two banks are left, the 
Liberals can also say that they followed due process and what 
else could they do.

tend to be raucous at times. I know you are passionate about and 
attentive to the proceedings of this House, so I have no doubt 
you will do a very good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel like I am watching an old movie. Bill C-8, formerly Bill 
C-38, is one of these old movies being shown in the House these 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the same arguments a few months ago, the same issues 
were raised, and the same positions seem to be more entrenched 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate on Bill C-38, now Bill C-8, Bloc members had 
expressed several reservations regarding the bill, which were 
shared by the Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Landry had stressed four main points. Before Bill C-38 was 
introduced we had been told not to worry. They were going to 
deal with it, everything would be all right, our concerns would 
be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were somewhat surprised—I would even say disappointed—to find 
the elements we wanted to see not in the bill itself, or in any 
piece of legislation passed by the House, but in the regulations 
that will be appended to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, unlike a bill that must be amended by this 
House in order to be changed, regulations may be amended at will 
by the executive or the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we are being asked to trust this government and in 
particular the Minister of Finance and to hand over a blank 
cheque.  You will understand that we have some difficulty with 
that, to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 gives full power to the Minister of Finance to decide on 
his own the fate of Quebec banks without providing any guarantee 
in connection with Quebec's distinctiveness.  Heaven knows 
Quebec is different.  The bill provides no specific measure.

colleague, who said “wicked Americans, wicked capitalists, let 
us turn the world upside down”, I agreed with him nonetheless on 
certain points, including the importance of giving the 
disadvantaged, who are often left out, greater access to 
financial services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, we will remember, is 
the excellent representative of a region on the island of 
Montreal hard hit by poverty.  He has introduced many good ideas 
on community investment—I will return to them—which, unfortunately 
were not included in Bill C-8.  That is regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only be concerned by the fact that a single shareholder 
could, with the agreement of the Minister of Finance, hold 65% 
of the shares of the National Bank, the largest Quebec bank.  It 
is the bank of the Quebec small and medium businesses.  There is 
an economic model in Quebec, and the National Bank is one of the 
cornerstones of this model, based on entrepreneurship and the 
SMBs. 
Should Quebec lose control of as important a financial 
institution as the National Bank, I think it would be very bad 
for its economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need legislative guarantees against any negative impact 
these new ownership rules might have on the employment of 
professionals, consumer and small business services, decision 
centres and the role of Montreal as an international financial 
centre. The stakes are just too high for Quebec and its economy 
to be left to the sole discretion of one man, the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure—and I would say our whole position on Bill 
C-8 is based on this argument—that the future of Quebec's 
banking system is not in the hands of one man. I think most 
people would agree with that. 
Giving anybody too much discretionary power is bad; giving a 
federal minister too much power over Quebec's economy is even 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 does not show a firm willingness to protect consumers, 
particularly low income consumers, on the part of the 
government. The bill provides for the establishment of the 
financial consumer agency of Canada. I have my doubts about the 
kind of authority such an agency could have in an economic 
climate which, unfortunately, does not look too rosy, as we 
know, as the United States are about to be hit by a recession. 
We must ensure that not only middle income people but also low 
income people have access to financial services. Unfortunately, 
Bill C-8 remains vague and has more wish than real policy with 
regard to accessibility and consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to return briefly to the importance of 
reinvesting in the community.  As I said earlier, the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve introduced a bill in the last parliament 
which would have required financial institutions to reinvest in 
the communities in which they are located.  It was based on the 
community reinvestment act, American legislation—so we cannot be 
accused of being leftist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, this legislation would require a regulated 
financial institution to show that its branches serve the 
deposit and credit requirements of the community for which they 
are chartered.  This is where this issue becomes very important 
for, as my colleague said, and I stress this point, branches 
have an obligation to help meet the credit needs of the local 
communities for which they are chartered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a global context, with people looking at the broader picture, 
there is also a tendency to move closer to one's own 
neighbourhood and community. While we believe that the Canadian 
financial system must be strong and able to withstand the 
buffeting of the global economy, this globalization must not 
leave out individuals and entire neighbourhoods who are 
unfortunately ignored in the rush to prosperity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I strongly urge the government to include the 
four points we raised during consideration of Bill C-38 not in 
the regulations, where they would be subject to the discretion 
of the Minister of Finance, but in the actual legislation which 
will be passed in the House.  I also urge it to include the main 
features of the bill on community reinvestment introduced and 
strongly defended by the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these inclusions, the government could expect a much more 
co-operative attitude from the Bloc Quebecois.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 5 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-2, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and 
the Employment Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, kudos go out to my critic from 
Acadie—Bathurst, a member who travelled the country to debate 
the EI changes of 1996 and the affect it had on workers, 
families, businesses and communities clear across the country.  I 
honestly believe it was his report that pushed the government 
into movement and to understand the terrible assault, for a lack 
of a better word, it had on workers, their families and small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that the member from White Rock, in her 
opening statement about the EI changes, said that the bill was 
nothing more than a Liberal Atlantic Canada re-election strategy. 
That is an insult to all Canadians. 
In fact it is a graver insult to those of us in Atlantic Canada. 
After the comments from the member for Calgary—Nose Hill, from 
one of their colleagues, John Mykytyshyn, and now comments from 
the respected member of the House from South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley basically slamming Atlantic Canada for the EI 
changes in the bill, as if the changes to EI only affect Atlantic 
Canada, it is simple nonsense.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that western Canada, to use their words, drains more 
from the EI fund than Atlantic Canada.  The fact is that the 
sooner the Alliance Party realizes and understands that, quite 
possibly it may have some success east of the Manitoba border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the changes in the new EI reforms, such as the intensity 
rule, are very positive.  We are quite glad that the minister and 
the government have realized and recognized the error of their 
ways and will change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very crucial aspect of EI funding is the labour training.  In 
a changing economy, our party, and I am sure many 
parliamentarians, are encouraging young people to not just have 
one academic aspect in their lives, such as computer training for 
the new economy, but to have a vocational trade as well.  Many 
young people take vocational training but those who take the EI 
training are penalized for two weeks in the initial start of 
their training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg has indicated that we should 
eliminate the two week clawback during training because it 
penalizes workers who are trying to adjust to the new economy by 
upgrading their skills.  We believe the government should 
recognize, honour and commit to that amendment.  Workers should 
not be penalized for trying to upgrade their skills.  All 
Canadians want to be productive members of the economy but they 
need assistance.  Some need literacy training while others need 
training in social skills and various labour skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere we go in the country we see help wanted signs in most 
service areas.  We have a tremendous amount of help wanted signs 
in my own area of Sackville, Nova Scotia which are more or less 
entry jobs at Burger King, Swiss Chalet and so on, paying the 
minimum salary.  The workers in those areas, although proud to 
have those jobs for now, want to upgrade their skills and improve 
their lot and their family's lot in life.  They want to be able 
to move forward and be more progressive in the so-called new 
economy and the demands of the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as legislators should provide people with the assistance they 
need to get training, especially in the cases of single women 
with children.  It is very difficult for them to move forward and 
get the training they require, not only vocationally but 
academically, when they also need adequate care for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases, especially in the rural parts of my riding, the 
father has taken off and has abdicated all his responsibilities. 
The mothers are left behind to raise the children.  It is very 
difficult to get child support from the father if he is not 
working.  What else can she do?  She does not want to be a drain 
on society.  It is not something she wished upon herself or her 
children.  It is a circumstance of today's reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should we do as government, as opposition members or as 
legislators?  We must ensure that we can offer that woman and her 
children hope.  We must provide the resources she needs to care 
for her family and to get the proper training she will need to 
get a decent job.  We must ensure that she can become 
self-reliant, look after her children and move forward.  That is 
the least we can do when there is a surplus of over $30 billion 
in the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the money is technically gone and spent.  The 
Liberals have admitted that.  I also believe the member from 
Mississauga, who is a great speaker in the House when he gets up 
on his hind legs and bellows out the Liberal rhetoric, has also 
admitted that the money was spent on other programs and 
initiatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that it is not the government's money.  That money 
belongs to employers and employees.  It does not belong to the 
Liberal government to do as it wishes and give, for example, tax 
cuts to major corporations, to the gun registry or anything else 
it proposes to do.  That money does not belong to the government. 
It did not have the moral right to take that money and put it 
into any program it so desires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money belongs to employers and employees.  It is up to the 
workers and the businesses to decide collectively what should be 
done with a massive surplus like that and what should be done 
about the future of the EI concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment insurance is sometimes called employment insurance. 
It is the Liberal way of reversing itself on its head. When it 
first came in it offered great protection for workers and their 
families in the unlikely event that they lost their job either 
through a layoff, a company closure or anything of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auto sector is going through a large upheaval.  Thousands of 
workers, especially in the Windsor area, are about to lose their 
jobs.  What would happen to those workers if there were no 
employment insurance fund or payments in order to look after 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money is essential to maintain their families, to maintain 
some income for their households, and to look after small 
businesses in the surrounding communities.  It is essential that 
the government get it right this time.  Instead of pounding away 
at workers and small businesses, it should start to realize that 
unemployment insurance fund or employment insurance fund is a 
vital part of the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the workers and the businesses that put money into the 
fund.  It is certainly not for the Liberal government to decide 
what to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of members in the House who have since been defeated, 
Peter Mancini and Michelle Dockrill, two great members from Cape 
Breton, fought very hard for fairness in the employment insurance 
fund throughout the country, not just in their region of Cape 
Breton.  They fought hard not only for the Devco miners but for 
the Sysco workers, fish plant workers and other workers in their 
area.  Their eloquence and their stand to defend and fight for 
what was right have finally moved the government in some ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the Canadian Labour Congress is supportive of 
the initiative in some aspects, but it does wish to have some 
amendments go through.  We are hoping that eventually the 
government will listen to some sound amendments by our party to 
make the EI fund more accountable to businesses and more 
receptive to workers and to communities throughout the entire 
country.  If the government does that, it would be very positive 
indeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

respect to the second reading of Bill C-2, an act to amend the

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Employment 
Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, be read a second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—L'Érable, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first, as it is the first time I have had the floor 
during this 37th parliament, I am very happy to begin by thanking 
my constituents of the great riding of Lotbinière—L'Érable, who 
have returned me as their representative in the House of Commons. 
This victory by the Bloc was reflected in all of the 50 
municipalities of my great riding and this victory is due to the 
500 volunteers who worked hard to keep the riding of 
Lotbinière—L'Érable with the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the campaign, I would like to remind the House of 
certain things that were said at the time, specifically on 
employment insurance. Before going deeper into this bill, I am 
going to bring forward some facts that marked the last election 
campaign. During the next minutes, I am going to show, once 
again, that the Liberals have not been true to their word, to 
their promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember the interview on an English language network 
where the Prime Minister apologized and was very remorseful for 
the devastating effects of the EI system reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That week, the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport adopted a 
similar tone when he said that, when the Liberals returned to 
power, it would be time to propose major changes in order to meet 
the expectations of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember that one week before the election, when the 
Prime Minister was in New Brunswick and spoke so eloquently about 
his election commitments, he forgot to mention that he would look 
after the unemployed. One of his advisers immediately reminded 
him that he should talk about the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this confirms that once again we have been the victims of a 
real misinformation campaign. The unemployment issue has indeed 
created confusion in parliament. No one has a clue. Everybody is 
looking for the facts. We are trying to find out what the 
government intends to do, but to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reflect on the highlights of the reform, on certain 
recommendations that the Bloc Quebecois intends to make. I will 
also deal with the report tabled last week by the auditor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a few years now the Bloc Quebecois has been openly critical 
of the surplus in the employment insurance fund. Only last week, 
the auditor general said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 2000 report, the Chief Actuary of Human Resources 
Development Canada has estimated that a reserve of $10 billion to 
$15 billion should be sufficient to guarantee the stability of EI 
premium rates over a business cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the Employment Insurance Account's accumulated 
surplus has grown to $28.2 billion, almost twice the maximum 
amount considered sufficient by the Chief Actuary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wondered. What did the Government of Canada, what did the 
Liberals do with the surplus? The auditor general told us in a 
rather direct manner: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Account's operating surplus, in effect, provides a source of 
revenue and cash flow for the government and helps reduce its net 
debt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the government has taken money from the 
unemployed, it has taken EI contributions to pay off the debt and 
particularly to set up programs that often infringe on Quebec's 
jurisdictions.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on in this parliament is totally unacceptable. A 
few moments ago, the government House leader announced a first 
time allocation motion, a first gag order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should we make of this whole issue? During the election 
campaign, the big names in the Liberal Party of Canada said that 
parliament would take its time to discuss the employment 
insurance issue. Now that we are back here in the House we find 
that the House leader is again playing the same game that he 
started during the last session by moving gag orders to prevent 
democratically elected representatives from saying what they have 
to say about the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is strongly opposed to Bill C-2, a pure and 
simple imitation of Bill C-44. However, it would be interesting 
if the current government divided Bill C-2 in two, to ensure it 
would respond more realistically to the expectations of 
unemployed people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a series of recommendations to make. I would like to say 
that, already in the last parliament, the Bloc Quebecois had 
been very forward looking, since it had introduced six bills to 
improve the operation of employment insurance, to try to find 
better solutions to respond to the needs of unemployed people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's requests are very clear. We ask for the elimination 
of the intensity rule. This bill talks about this. We also ask 
that the maximum insurable earnings be increased from 55% to 60%, 
which would be much more realistic. 
We also ask for the elimination of the discriminatory clause 
towards new entrants to the labour force. We know this applies 
to young people and women. We also ask for the elimination of 
the qualifying period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-2 it is announced that the premium rate is to be 
reduced to $2.25, but the auditor general's report has much more 
precise calculations. This government is already late when it 
says it wants to reduce premiums to $2.25. The chief actuary, an 
employee of the Department of Human Resources Development, 
believes that employees' premium rates should be between $1.70 
and $2.20, which would cover the long term costs of the 
employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its planning documents, the Department of Human Resources 
Development predicts that the accumulated surplus will reach 
$34.6 billion by March 31, 2001. On August 31, 2000, the 
unaudited balance of the fund's accumulated surplus was $32.4 
billion.  These figures disgust the public.  These surpluses are 
upsetting, they make no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the Liberal government is trying with Bill 
C-2 to hide the truth.  It is trying to legalize what has always 
been called the hold-up of the unemployed and the small and 
medium businesses.  If Bill C-2 ever passes, no one, including 
the auditor general, will be able to intervene to bring this 
government back to order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of late we have witnessed all sorts of operations making this 
government, this parliament, increasing antidemocratic. 
In the riding I represent and in all ridings in Quebec, there 
are seasonal workers, men and women who return to the labour 
market, young people who come onto the labour market.  These 
people, because of measures that are very difficult to 
understand, cannot draw employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine that a young person has to work 910 hours before 
being entitled to draw benefits.  A worker paying 
benefits—depending on the region—must accumulate between 420 and 
700 hours to be entitled to employment insurance benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current act, which will not be amended by Bill C-2, 
discriminates seriously against young people and women, who are 
affected by this rule, that is, they must work 910 hours if they 
return to the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I look at Bill C-2, especially if I refer to the many promises 
not kept by the federal Liberals in the latest election, it is 
very thin in content. It offers no hope to the unemployed 
waiting for major changes, which could have met their needs and 
corrected the injustices committed against them by the Prime 
Minister and his government in the last session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about what happened during the election campaign 
and when I hear all the balderdash on employment insurance 
coming from the other side, I wonder who knows the truth. 
Fortunately, the Auditor General of Canada brought back some 
kind of order last week. He gave some indications to try and 
clear things up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is an insult to the unemployed. There is nothing in it 
for them. It only mentions the abolition of the intensity rule 
and some minor changes when everyone in Quebec and in Canada was 
expecting so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are laughing at the unemployed. They did it 
throughout the election campaign and continue to do so here, in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Bloc Quebecois will continue to fight for 
improvements for the unemployed. Fortunately, we have in the 
House of Commons 38 men and women to protect the interests of 
Quebecers. Even with the government trying to muzzle us and take 
away our freedom of speech, I hope that, in the little time we 
have, we can prove that Bill C-2 is an empty shell, that it 
brings almost no changes to the system and is an insult to the 
unemployed in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am a bit 
stunned. I am a new member and I think the debates we have in 
this House in which we criticize certain aspects of a bill are 
very useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just learned from the House leader that the government intends 
to limit debate on this bill. It is the first time that I 
witness such a request. I think this request comes rather 
quickly in that each comment I heard and each speech made by 
members of all parties, particularly the Bloc Quebecois, have 
clearly shown that there is abuse. That is why I am very 
surprised to hear this request at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report dated February 6—today is February 
12—confirmed some of the questions we have been asking about 
this bill. So it has been only six days, and the government has 
already decided to limit debate. 
I am sorry, but we are in the House of Commons where there are 
301 members, including 38 from the Bloc Quebecois, and each of 
these members would have something more to say. I have not 
counted the exact number of members who have spoken so far, but 
I am sure there are speeches that should be heard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague from Lotbinière—L'Érable. In 
his riding, as everywhere in Quebec, figures are circulated 
saying that the fund has a surplus of $7.2 billion for an 
accumulated surplus of $28.2 billion. The auditor general has 
told us that this was double the authorized amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are forgetting the numerous self-employed people in 
Quebec and in Canada. There are also the young students. We hear 
fine speeches about young people, and the desire to help them. 
Why then do they have to pay employment insurance premiums, when 
we know that 30% or 40% of them will not be able to collect any 
benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has to be asked. 
How do these people react in Lotbinière—L'Érable and across 
Quebec when they are told that surpluses of over $28.2 billion 
have been accumulated, as the auditor general said? And yet, the 
government says we do not have enough money to say “Let us amend 
the act. Let us at least take this opportunity to discuss it, to 
try to improve it and to draft a clearer bill that will give 
people access to this money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Madam Speaker, my constituents have been 
the victims of a partisan misinformation campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On television, during the campaign, they accused the Bloc 
Quebecois of not fighting for the interests of Quebecers.  In 
spite of that misinformation, 40% of Quebecers put their trust 
in us.  They knew that if they sent 38 members to the House of 
Commons, these members would continue to fight for their 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found a new word to describe what is happening on that 
side.  We hear about autocracy and democracy.  I would call 
whatever happened in the House of Commons during the last 
session and during the last campaign and whatever is going on 
right now “chrétinocracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> This is a new word for the 
dictionary. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
member said that this bill offers nothing and that there are no 
substantive changes, so I would have to assume that he would have 
no problem if someone wrote to his constituents, listed the 
improvements that are in the bill and said that the Bloc was 
against the improvements. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Madam Speaker, it is easy to answer that 
question. There are almost no changes. Therefore, the list would 
be very short; I would have no problem at all with that list 
being presented to my constituents in Lotbinière—L'Érable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of 
all I want to congratulate you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question of the new member for Yukon, I could 
read the list, because it is indeed not very long. There is the 
abolition of the intensity rule, the abolition of discrimination 
in the rule of tax clawback, the change in the definition of new 
entrant, the indexing of the maximum yearly insurable earnings 
and the reduction of the premium rate to $2.25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that answers his question and his interest for this 
subject. In a spirit of co-operation, he too could oppose this 
bill, because that is what the people in his riding would ask 
him to do if they had the same information available to them. 
Unless he must follow the party line, which would be very sad 
for a new member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, as my colleagues did the first time they rose in 
the House, I would like to thank the people in the riding of 
Repentigny for putting their confidence in me. This is a riding 
that you know well, Madam Speaker, as you visit it regularly. 
Since you represent the other end of the island of Montreal, you 
have the opportunity to come by often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the great riding of Repentigny is an urban riding composed 
for the most part of young families that have elected me and 
given me their confidence for a third mandate. To all those who 
voted for me I want to give my wholehearted thanks and assure 
them that I will work hard, as I have over the last seven years, 
to stand up for their interests here, in the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to talk about the previous bill, 
because before we talk about this one, we have no choice but to 
put it in context and look at its background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating today Bill C-2, but it is really a new 
incarnation of Bill C-44. Technically, Bill C-44 died on the 
order paper, because the government House leader, with all his 
goodwill, made sure the Liberals did not call an election after 
passing such a revolting bill. He did not see fit to use closure 
or other parliamentary tricks to gag the opposition. 
He made sure the bill would die on the order paper so they could 
appear, during the campaign, to be more open on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-44, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, has 
disappeared. The Prime Minister, who is in China today, has made 
this comment about the bill: “We realized that this was not a 
good decision, and we should not have done this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that Bill C-44 was not a good idea, 
but one of his ministers is much more talkative. The minister 
responsible for amateur sport often stumbles in his public 
statements. Hon. members will certainly agree with me. He never 
misses a chance to voice his strong opposition when a government 
decision is not to his liking. If he does not agree with me, the 
minister will get a chance to say so during the questions and 
comments period, and if he does not say a word, it is because he 
agrees— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Silence is consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Silence is consent, says my colleague. 
This minister said that after the election of a majority Liberal 
government, I suppose he had a crystal ball at that time, it 
would 
re-establish the process and ensure that the right 
changes were made, those responding properly to the majority of 
the realities and needs of the people of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean 
and of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He must have made this statement in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean 
region, which is why he named it.  He concluded his statement by 
saying “I am committed—this minister is very big on 
commitments—to changes in the law, and we will make changes”. 
This is what the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport said.  I 
welcome his contradiction of my quotes, if he is not in 
agreement, during the question and comment period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two quotes which strike me as very eloquent.  The 
Prime Minister said that they were wrong. As for the eloquent 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport, he said they were going to 
make changes—“I assure you of this, I promise this” he said. 
Still we find ourselves back with Bill C-2 and its very modest 
changes, as I have been able to confirm to the hon. member for 
Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, brought back despite those two statements, despite 
all the promises each MP and each prospective MP made in their 
respective ridings, makes me think of a still more important 
promise made by the Liberals, one they have also broken.  If I 
asked the Liberals to tell me which one I mean, I would have a 
lot of different answers.  Some would say the GST, some free 
trade, but these are not the ones I mean.  We will not hold a 
contest, because there would probably be too many responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promise that was not kept, and the two quotes prove it, is 
the 1993 one in red book one, with respect to the public's trust 
in the government and elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, all parties are in the same boat.  In 1993, the 
government promised to restore the public's trust.  I challenge 
Liberal, Bloc Quebecois and Canadian Alliance members to go to 
their ridings and check out the public's general level of trust 
in us.  This level of trust is very low, even after a promise 
made seven years ago.  Why?  Because we have the proof, in the 
two earlier quotes, that politicians, especially when they are 
in power, too often make clear statements, but do not follow 
through on their promises.  The Prime Minister said he liked 
clarity.  Here was the proof:  it was clear they were going to 
make changes, they said.  They said it even more clearly in 1980 
and 1995.  These changes did not happen, however, and there is 
still no sign of them.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the most important promise this government broke 
was the one it made in 1993 to restore confidence in this 
institution.  If we had statistics on the votes of confidence in 
1993 and those of today, I think that the rate would be down, 
and it would be for reasons like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The red book also promised an ethics counsellor appointed by and 
accountable to parliament.  This political adviser appointed to 
restore trust, is another failed Liberal promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To restore trust, we might have expected fewer criminal 
investigations; there are many of them, including several in the 
riding of the Prime Minister, among others, on a golf club he 
previously owned and on a hotel he also owned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To restore trust, perhaps we should listen to the most eminent 
official in parliament, the one who, unfortunately for the Prime 
Minister, was not appointed by him, that is the auditor general. 
I believe the Prime Minister likes to say that we have the “best 
and most beautiful country in the world” and the “best Prime 
Minister in the world”. I congratulate him for the two Olivier 
awards that he won yesterday as the year's best international 
humorist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in this “best country in the world”, there is a good auditor 
general. 
The latter said in 2000 and repeated in 2001 that the way the 
surplus in the employment insurance fund was being used was 
outrageous and almost illegal. The Employment Insurance 
Commission establishes a premium rate according to the economic 
situation. The chief economist of the Royal Bank, who is here, 
could confirm that the employment insurance premium rate has to 
be defined according to the economic situation, whether things 
are going well or not so well, according to the money that is 
already in the employment insurance fund, and according to the 
current rate and to the current surplus in this employment 
insurance fund, which is twice what it should be, that is about 
$30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general says this is outrageous. He repeats that is 
outrageous, and the Prime Minister says “It is the opposition 
that is wrong”. It is not the opposition that says that. The 
opposition is quoting the auditor general, who has been 
repeating that there is too much money in the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does having too much money in the EI fund mean for workers 
and employers? Thirty billion dollars is an impressive figure, 
but it has been said that this is too much. First, the money is 
not used to help the unemployed but to reimburse the Canadian 
government's net debt. Once again, the auditor general is the 
one who says so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government deliberately took money out of the 
pockets of the employers and the employees to eliminate the 
deficit. That is a tax on salaries. If the government really 
wanted to be clear and honest, it would levy a tax on salaries. 
But once again, it prefers to disguise the truth to hide the 
fact that it is not fulfilling its 1993 promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have very little time left, I will conclude with this. I 
call upon the government members to accept that at the very 
least the bill be divided in two so as to allow members from the 
Bloc to vote in favour of the very minimal amendments proposed 
to the employment insurance. If they accept, they could reach a 
larger consensus. I would also ask them to give us the 
possibility to express our opinion on the outrageous theft of 
the EI fund surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> I remind hon. members that 
debate is now limited to 10 minutes and that there is no period 
for questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to the bill, 
formerly Bill C-44, which has generated a great deal of debate 
and discussion around the country.  It is certainly a matter of 
great interest in my constituency in Nova Scotia, 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that we are discussing result from callous changes 
that were made by the Liberal government to the insurance plan in 
1997 which resulted in a public backlash that was attempted to be 
remedied by the government in the wake of the 2000 election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now in typical Liberal fashion, the call of the election 
resulted in the death of the bill.  We saw that with a number of 
important pieces of legislation.  While on the hustings though, 
the Liberals dangled former Bill C-44 in front of the faces of 
Atlantic Canadians in particular.  Seasonal workers of course 
were those who were most vulnerable on this particular piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, this early calling of the bill, the debate that has 
ensued and the opportunity again to revisit these issues at the 
committee is an indication that the Liberals are in fact quite 
serious about passing this legislation and bringing about 
improvements that will enhance the ability of seasonal workers to 
benefit from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough the problems 
with employment insurance are major issues of concern.  Whether I 
spoke to workers at Trenton steel plant, farmers in Lismore or 
fishermen in Canso, the same complaints were prevalent when 
addressing their EI concerns.  The issue of undeclared earnings 
was by far the number one complaint throughout the riding and was 
given particular priority by those who engaged in shift work at 
the Trenton Works Ltd. steel plant in Trenton, Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to elaborate, there is a loophole in the undeclared 
earnings section of the Employment Insurance Act which allows the 
government to claw back moneys from individuals as an overpayment 
even though the claimant never receives the benefit.  That is the 
crux of the issue.  In essence, the government is taking money 
back on earnings that were never actually realized by the 
employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to members of the HRDC local office who administer the 
EI claims in the maritimes and they too have expressed concerns 
over the manner in which this particular section is implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, during the weeks where a shift worker is employed, 
the worker does not expect, nor does he receive any EI benefits. 
At the end of hard week's work, the worker then fills out an EI 
claim and sends it to be processed.  However, the problem arises 
if the worker is then asked to work overtime.  That is there is a 
change in the situation because of an overtime job that requires 
the worker to be called back in.  The worker, in some instances, 
has already sent in the card.  This is not an issue where the 
individual is trying to deliberately mislead anyone, it is simply 
a change in circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What then happens is the overtime hours will not be included in 
the declaration of hours worked.  Often a worker does not bother 
to phone the HRDC office to report his or her additional hours 
because the person knows that he or she does not qualify for 
benefits for that particular week.   The person knows that making 
a change in the original card submission will only cause delays 
in the processing.  Sadly, those who are reliant on these 
government cheques are in a catch-22.  They are afraid, in 
essence, that they will receive no benefits if they are 
forthcoming with this information.  There is also a shortcoming 
in their ability to communicate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there have been attempts to deal with this anomaly by 
setting up a 1-800 number.  Again, it is very difficult for the 
worker on shift work to provide that information to the local 
office.  The delays often result in a longer wait for claims 
where individuals are not able to work or are not called in to 
work and are therefore in receipt of no income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still when an EI representative phones the employer to confirm 
how many hours the employee has worked, the discrepancy becomes 
evident quite quickly.  The employee is then penalized for having 
submitted a fraudulent claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an issue that has to be addressed.  There is an 
opportunity in this particular bill to address this anomaly.  The 
penalties for fraudulent claims are enormous and unnecessary. The 
penalty covers the entire period of pay as opposed to the pay 
week where the infraction occurred.  There is almost an issue of 
double jeopardy here.  Thus the employee's penalty would claw 
back the much needed money even from weeks where the hours of 
work were properly reported and a blanket penalty would be 
imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this may sound convoluted to any individual who has never 
availed themselves of seasonal employment and been on the EI 
system.  For those who have, this is a real dilemma for seasonal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is short.  I look forward to the opportunity to 
continue participation in this debate when we resume the matter 
tomorrow.  I know the time is here to conclude for the day, but I 
respect the Chair's indulgence and look forward to further 
participation.
