<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BORROWINGAUTHORITYACT,1995-96">BORROWING AUTHORITY ACT, 1995-96</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 20 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority for 
the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 1995, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the 
government's overall fiscal plan.
<P>
	The budget which deals with raising money and how it is spent 
and the borrowing powers which make up for the shortfall in 
revenue go together to make up the government's fiscal plan for 
the coming financial year. At least that is how an economist 
might explain it.
<P>
	In reality, there is no plan to reduce the deficit to zero 
allowing us to address the country's mounting debt. The budget 
falls short of pointing out the means by which Canada is to get to 
ground zero: zero deficit.
<P>
	As well, the borrowing bill, which has been and is the subject 
of debate in this Chamber, is usually explained as necessary to 
make up for the shortfall in revenues, revenues being less than 
expenditures. In reality the money borrowed has nothing to do 
with the shortfall in revenues. It is the failure of the government 
to cut its expenditures which necessitates a borrowing bill of 
this size.
<P>
	This is a failure that will haunt us for years to come, for if ever 
there was a time when the people of Canada were ready to see 
tough decisions made and leadership shown, it was on February 
27. However, the government, afraid that its standing in the 
polls might suffer, took the tried and true Liberal way out. It put 
off tough decisions for another day. If it puts these decisions off 
for more than three years, they will not be this government's 
decisions to make.
<P>
	The budget can be compared to a bad science fiction novel or 
movie. It is lost in time; it is lost in space.
<P>
	It is lost in time because it comes a year too late and proposes 
some tough measures, but even they are to start only next year 
and are phased in over a number of years. If they had begun this 
year and not been phased in they would have substantially 
reduced the deficit. This is a major complaint.
<P>
	It is lost in the broad space or expanse of Canada because it 
does not meet head on the problems of our economy. It seems to 
be a classic case of misunderstanding the mood of the people of 
Canada with this budget.
<P>
	The space in history, the history of making tough decisions 
was there for the finance minister and his merry band of 
followers from the finance department to enter but they 
declined. They chose instead to nibble around the edges of the 
problem rather than meet it with courage and a plan for the 
future.
<P>
	This is not the type of budget we in the Reform Party would 
have brought down. This is not the type of fiscal planning the 
Reform Party could have entered into. It is for these 
fundamental reasons that I cannot support this budget or any of 
the bills that flow from it.
<P>
	What then does the budget do? It raises taxes. The finance 
minister made grand gestures of self-congratulation for not 
raising personal income tax. Yes, he is right. He did not.
<P>
	Instead, he imposed a tax increase for gasoline, a commodity 
consumed by Canadians rich or poor. As well, changes were 
made to RRSP rules so that those who receive severance 
packages when they leave their employment will only be able to 
contribute $2,000 to an RRSP instead of the current $8,000, 
harming their future plans for retirement.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	The timing is off here as it is with the rest of the budget. 
Canadians are now entering an era when they are concerned that 
private pension plans or even the Canada pension plan will not 
meet their retirement needs.
<P>
	The rate at which the $40 billion Canada pension plan is 
deteriorating surprises even those who researched and wrote the 
15th statutory actuarial report which was recently tabled in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10938"> 10938 </A></B>
<P>
House of Commons. The last such report was written and tabled 
five years ago. Between then and now the report author found 
that two of the primary reasons for the deterioration have been a  
doubling of the number of disability claims and a lowering of 
contributions because of job losses during the recent recession.
<P>
	As a leading financial adviser and retirement specialist from 
Vancouver stated recently: ``I now look at CPP in the same way 
that I view UI. We all pay it but many of us will never collect it''.
<P>
	Will the Canada pension plan still exist for baby boomers as 
they begin to retire 15 or 20 years from now? The chances of 
CPP as we know it today surviving that long are very slim. I 
suggest there are none. This reality caught our attention last 
month when the Liberal government actuarial report concluded 
that if CPP contributions are not increased and benefits continue 
as now legislated, the plan which today supposedly contains just 
over $40 billion will be gone by the year 2015.
<P>
	This is not only a boomer issue. The future of CPP will have a 
greater impact on the generation Xers who are destined to 
struggle in the wake of the baby boomers for at least half their 
job seeking and working lives.
<P>
	At present five Canadian workers support each retired CPP 
collecting pensioner, with middle age boomers making up the 
majority of today's workers. However, by the time boomers start 
to collect CPP there will only be two to three workers to support 
each pensioner. Will the generation Xers, who are having it 
tougher economically than their boomer parents, be willing or 
able to pay a lot more in CPP contributions to support their 
parents' public pensions?
<P>
	If the government had seriously addressed this year's budget 
and made the necessary cuts, then Canada could be on the road to 
recovery and the future for our future senior Canadians would 
not look so bleak.
<P>
	Canadians were looking for a tougher budget. If over the last 
25 years governments had been responsible, if thousands of 
dollars had not been given away in unnecessary grants which 
have already been talked about in this House, if new programs 
such as multiculturalism had not been devised to initiate help to 
groups of people who have always been strong enough in their 
feelings and respect and pride in their distinctive culture to 
establish and fund their own commemorative centres and 
festivals, if the past governments had managed the taxpayers' 
hard earned dollars, their tax dollars instead of mismanaging 
them, and if the present government would seriously look at 
cutting programs which drain our resources and seriously 
cripple the government's ability to maintain necessary seniors 
programs, the government would not be so desperate to raise 
more revenue on the backs of those very Canadians who trusted 
the past Liberal and Conservative governments to spend those 
tax dollars wisely.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am beginning to think I am in front of one of the 
chatty classes I have had over the past 30 years.
<P>
	The government had an opportunity to put in force measures 
which, although tough, would actually help the taxpayer and not 
increase taxes, or revenue in the form of more taxes. However, 
that is not the case.
<P>
	What does the government do to collect a little more revenue? 
It changes the RRSP rules, another hidden tax. If we think that is 
bad, how about this? Lessen the payouts for unemployment 
insurance but not the premiums because the government wants 
to build up a surplus. Unemployment insurance is a payroll tax 
and by not reducing premiums, another hidden tax is involved. 
However, this tax-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I wonder if 
I could ask the co-operation of the House to allow whoever 
might have the floor the opportunity to be heard. Certainly, I am 
beginning to encounter some difficulty in hearing the member.
<P>
	While the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam still has two 
minutes remaining in her time, I wonder if she could clarify for 
the Chair whether in fact she will be splitting her time with a 
colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I will be splitting my time. I 
should have mentioned it beforehand. Thank you for trying to 
bring a bit of order back to the House.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has raised corporate taxes and imposed a tax 
on bank profits. Who does the government think will pay for 
these taxes? Maybe it does not know. I can tell everyone these 
taxes will be paid by the little guy, the consumer. Anyone who 
believes they will not be passed on to the consumer should 
immediately sign up for a reality check. There is only one 
taxpayer: the ordinary taxpayer like you and me.
<P>
	It is my belief that the tax increases we have seen in the budget 
are an admission of failure by the government, failure to cut 
spending sufficiently. Above all, why would the government 
assume people are willing to go on through a tax increase, 
paying more for more government? Was the government not 
listening to the people of Canada? It cannot ignore the people for 
too much longer.
<P>
	I am concerned about the long range effect of this budget. 
While the deficit reduction contained in it amounts to a first 
tentative step in the right direction, this reduction will be 
quickly eliminated if interest rates rise or the dollar does not 
remain strong. If we enter another economic downturn, all 
calculations will be off considerably.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10939"> 10939 </A></B>
<P>
	I am concerned the government will not follow through on its 
plans to reduce personnel. No matter how governments try, and 
many have, to reduce the size of the public service, the 
bureaucrats seem always to prove more resolute in keeping their 
jobs than politicians are in getting rid of them.
<P>
	Departments disappear or are amalgamated, but is there a 
reduction in staff? Not usually. If it does occur, it is usually 
because the public servant found another public service job in 
another department. There is no real reduction. We will be 
watching the government closely to see that it meets its 
reduction target.
<P>
	What would the Reform Party have done in these 
circumstances? Unlike prior opposition parties, people actually 
do know what we would have done. We set it out quite clearly in 
the taxpayers budget. The taxpayers budget sets out exactly 
what we would have cut as far as programs are concerned.
<P>
	By not following the Reform Party's plan, over $50 billion 
will be paid to service the national debt in 1996-97. The 
government's target of having the deficit lower than 3 per cent 
of the GDP is just nonsense. Either we have a deficit, or we do 
not. Either we believe it should be eliminated, or we do not.
<P>
	We believe every effort should be made in the next three years 
to eliminate the deficit. Once the deficit is eliminated it allows 
us room to move, room to explore programs that would open up 
new doors for business and industry. More money would be put 
back into the economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. 
member and I think that she certainly deserved our attention, as 
do all the other members of the House.
<P>
	She spoke briefly about unemployment insurance, and it is on 
this subject that I would like to comment and ask a question.
<P>
	In its budget, the government established a human resources 
development fund from the surplus that will be generated in the 
unemployment insurance fund. Does the hon. member not feel it 
would have been a much better idea to consider a quick 
reduction in unemployment insurance premiums so that both 
individuals paying their own premiums and business could 
enjoy the savings right away and put this money back into the 
economy? Does she not feel that approach would have a more 
immediate direct effect on employment than an artificial fund 
created solely to enable government to get around jurisdictions 
and intervene in a whole lot of areas under provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	Does all of this not strike the hon. member as a course of 
action that runs contrary to the federal government's fine words 
about really intending to reduce the size of government? Is it not 
actually going to increase  intervention by the federal 
government in areas of activity that are not in its jurisdiction and 
where it has proven to be ineffective?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question although I am surprised he heard 
anything I did say. I was having difficulty.
<P>
	I must tell the hon. member the UI program should be exactly 
what it was designed for when it was first brought in. It is for 
temporary job loss. It should be sustained by the employees and 
the employers and only those people. I strongly think there 
should be no artificial fund. The size of government should be 
cut down.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening to what the Reform member was saying, and I did not 
have much to add until she made her last point on the topic of the 
debt. Although the government is dealing with the debt, the way 
it is doing it is not to her liking. I agree with her. But, I have the 
impression that the Reform Party takes the following position: 
any person in debt will have to starve for the next three years.
<P>
	That seems to be the case, and that is what I am having trouble 
understanding. Of course, we can cut year after year and try to 
reduce the debt, strive to reach the three per cent benchmark, but 
we cannot say, tomorrow, that we will stop eating. I would not be 
able to keep working, I would not earn very much and I would 
not be able to pay very much either. I would be interested in 
hearing how her draconian cuts would reduce over the next three 
years the some $30 billion deficit we have now and which is 
mostly caused by the debt, and I agree with her in principle that 
it must be done. But I would like to know more about her 
starvation ideology.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member who raised 
those interesting questions; certainly questions that boggle my 
mind.
<P>
	If he would like a real in depth explanation he can get our 
alternate budget and it would certainly explain it.
<P>
	There have been a lot of remarks in the House suggesting that 
people who suggest cutting things are mean, or lean and mean, 
or are miserable people, or do not care about anyone. I am sick 
and tired of this. This is a lot of nonsense.
<P>
	The only way we will ever help anyone, the only way we will 
sustain medical health for the country, the only way we will help 
those destitute, those people who need the help, is to stop those 
who are taking who do not need it. We have to get serious.
<P>
	No one knows any more than I do. I have been through serious 
problems. Fortunately I had enough strength to pick up and help 
myself but others around me were also there to sustain me. 
Never did I blame anyone for what had happened. I tried my 
best.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10940"> 10940 </A></B>
<P>
	People have to be responsible. Those who cannot we have to 
help. The bottom line is if we do not get this deficit and debt in 
control the country will not be able to help anyone. We had 
better stop laughing about it and get serious.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
stand today in what is a very solemn debate. We have been 
talking on and off about the budget since the Minister of Finance 
introduced it in the House. We need to begin very seriously 
asking questions on what is wrong and what we can do to correct 
it. It is time to lay aside the meaningless rhetoric and deal with 
reality.
<P>
	One of the flaws in the thinking of governments past is they 
have assumed that deficit budgets are okay. In the next few 
minutes I would like to talk briefly about the urgency of 
reducing the deficit in order to stop adding to our debt.
<P>
	A lot of Canadians are not well informed on the budget. A lot 
of Canadians are of the impression that because there are these 
cuts our debt is going down. That is not the case at all. Our debt 
is increasing.
<P>
	I am not going to say we ought to stop decreasing it this year 
but we have a soft target which allows the debt to go on and on, 
even with this present plan if the government meets its stated 
goal, which the minister has said it will do. He has a neat little 
couplet which is normally not in my vocabulary. He said they 
will meet the budget deficit targets.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	That is great, but what after that and where are we headed in 
the long run? I often say that Wayne Gretzky is one of the 
greatest hockey players but not because he knew where the puck 
was, not because he knew where it was going, but he knew where 
it was going to be. He has an uncanny ability to be at the right 
place. That was because he is able to think ahead. We need to 
start on behalf of Canadian taxpayers seriously thinking ahead.
<P>
	Peter Cook in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> just before Christmas said: 
``Our government problem is that we have politicians that have 
ignored deficits and debts for too long and even now put forward 
inadequate solutions. Rising rates make it less easy to postpone 
the inevitable. The level of government in Canada is simply too 
large for the private sector to support and must be cut back to 
what is affordable, and the sooner the better''.
<P>
	I ask all listening to consider what wealth is. From what do we 
derive our standard of living in Canada, which we all enjoy 
bragging about so much? If we were to ask that question we 
would realize that primarily our wealth derives from the 
transformation of our resources into goods that are saleable 
around the world to ourselves and also to others.
<P>
	Furthermore, we have people who provide certain services. 
For example, when I go to the dentist, the amount of material he 
uses is very small but I benefit  greatly from his skill in fixing 
the problem I have with my teeth at the time.
<P>
	We have these benefits that derive from creation of real 
wealth. No matter how you cut it, when we have a large 
burgeoning government, that is mostly a drain on the production 
of our wealth.
<P>
	I admit there are areas where what government is doing is 
necessary. We have the transportation network probably most 
efficiently done by government. There are other things which 
government can do well, but it is not accurate to assume without 
challenge that unless government is doing it, it will not be done. 
I resent greatly the implication that the Reform Party's plan will 
make things worse for so many Canadians. That is not true. Our 
plan is to stop paying so much interest so that we have more 
money available for the things we value highly.
<P>
	Why the hurry? I did a little spread sheet on our present fiscal 
situation and I took our current debt and I extrapolated it using a 
very simple assumption. This may not be accurate because we 
do not know what the future holds. I assumed an 8 per cent rate 
of interest and I assumed a 3 per cent growth in our economy, 
both of which are assumptions anyone can make but no one 
could really defend because we are not able to accurately predict 
the future.
<P>
	Who would have ever guessed in the mid 1970s that the 
interest rates on mortgages would go from 6.5 per cent to 16 per 
cent? That was not predictable.
<P>
	When we talk about our debt it is true that if the interest rates 
rise dramatically, we are captives. There is not a thing we can do 
about it; neither for our internationally held debt, nor for our 
domestically held debt because everybody who has lent Canada 
money will want it back or we will totally blow our credibility.
<P>
	It is mandatory that we get our debt and deficit under control 
because with the government's plans, using the assumptions I 
have stated, 3 per cent growth, 8 per cent interest, by the year 
2010, which at my age is right around the corner-when you get 
to be over 50 the years just fly, 15 years is nothing-our debt 
will have grown to one trillion dollars. Our annual interest 
payments, assuming interest is still then only at 8 per cent, will 
be $80 billion per year. That is $80 billion taken out of the 
economy just for interest. This is money that will not be 
available to help poor people, to provide health care and 
education.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	One may ask what the big deal is on this. I did a little 
calculation and found if our total expenditures were to be 
brought down rapidly we would very quickly be able to pay off 
the debt. In other words, if we were able to reduce the rate at 
which we are adding to the debt to zero, we would call that 
elimination of the deficit, we would simply stop borrowing. Our 
plan calls for doing that in three years. If we could reduce the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10941"> 10941 </A></B>
<P>
debt, our  interest payments would go down instead of 
continuing to escalate, which is so important.
<P>
	We must remember it took the Liberals only 10 years 
approximately to increase the debt to $100 billion in the 1970s. 
However, according to the plan we have before us, it will take 
them only three to four years to add another $100 billion to the 
debt.
<P>
	The plan the minister has presented will increase the debt by 
$100 billion in the next three years. That is not acceptable. It is a 
premise we reject and it is one which I think all Canadians 
should be very concerned about, particularly members of the 
House.
<P>
	I would like to quote what was said to me by a voter, a 
taxpayer, from Edmonton Northeast. When we were discussing 
these things he said to me: ``Where were our leaders in the last 
30 years? Surely there are experts in the Department of Finance 
in Ottawa. Surely there are politicians who are businessmen who 
could think and see what was happening when they were 
presuming on the future with this borrowing way back then. 
What was it that motivated them? Where were they? What were 
they thinking?''
<P>
	I challenge us all to start thinking right now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very attentively to the comments made by my colleague from 
the Reform Party and I would like to tell this House that the 
difference between the Reform Party and the Liberal Party is 
that the former apparently wants to make cuts and take away 
from this country's middle class and low wage earners, while the 
latter have hesitations. They do not know whether they should 
make the wealthy pay more taxes. They do not dare.
<P>
	During the last recess, I had the pleasure of meeting with one 
of my constituents, a wise old man, who told me that the rich 
will end up paying for the deficit because the middle class is 
overtaxed and the poor do not have any more money. The 
question I want to ask my colleague is this: Does he not believe 
that the time has come to collect the money from those who have 
benefited the most from this system in the last 30 years, namely 
Canadians and Quebecers who have money today and do not pay 
their fair share, by taxing them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to surprise my hon. 
colleague by saying I agree with him, there should be a fair tax 
system.
<P>
	The Reform Party has said all along that our taxation system 
should be fair. We believe in a flat rate tax. We think it is 
certainly reasonable that if a person makes twice as much money 
he or she should pay twice as much tax. However, the real 
problem is one of spending.
<P>
	When we look at what the Liberals have done in terms of the 
budget, which is what we are debating here, talk about a tax grab 
from the middle class, the poor and basically from everyone 
which is being given on the fuel. They tell us a 1.5 cent per litre 
tax. That is inaccurate. It is a 1.605 cent tax per litre because 
what we are forgetting is that on the tax is added the GST.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	The present government likes taxes on taxes. I did a little 
calculation. Let us say I want to buy $1 worth of gasoline. I have 
to earn $2.78 in order to buy it. When I earn $2.78, $1.11 is 
income tax, leaving me with $1.67. Then I go to the pumps and 
67 cents is needed for gasoline tax and I am then left with $1 of 
gasoline.
<P>
	When I buy $1 of gasoline and pay $1.78 in tax that is a tax 
rate of 178 per cent and that applies to everybody, the rich and 
the poor alike. Everyone who benefits from our transportation 
system and everyone who drives to work pays that tax. That is a 
tax grab on the poor as well.
<P>
	We think taxes ought to be reduced in total. Income tax should 
be a flat rate tax which is fair. All the areas in which people can 
avoid paying their fair share of taxes should be reduced.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish my hon. colleague from the Reform Party would 
take the good news to his party because, for the past 15 months, 
all we have heard the Reform Party suggest is that we continue 
to deal with the deficit and debt problem on the backs of the 
workers, the unemployed and the disadvantaged.
<P>
	As for tax fairness, I would say this is another piece of good 
news he could pass on to his colleagues because every initiative 
put forth by the Bloc Quebecois at the finance committee to 
eliminate unfair advantages flowing from family trusts, to 
eliminate all those inequities in the tax system that have enabled 
very high income earners as well as large corporations with 
large profits not to pay a cent in taxes since 1991, every time we 
have come up with such an initiative, the Reformists have voted 
against our proposal.
<P>
	So, before claiming that they want tax fairness, before 
claiming that they want to restore fairness in the tax system, I 
think that the hon. member should go back and check in his party 
what his party really wants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, actually I do not need to check with 
my party. What I said today I got from my party. I think people 
have not been listening or have not been hearing. We promote 
tax fairness. We promote reduction of taxes by reducing

<P>
	There is an important assumption that we must challenge. I 
believe both members of the Bloc and the Liberals go on the 
assumption that if the government does not fund it then it will 
not be done.
<P>
	If the member were to examine our proposals in detail, he 
would find that working people are much better off under our 
proposals than they are under this one. We reject the supposition 
that it is efficient to send half of our money to Ottawa and there 
allow politicians and bureaucrats to divide it up and decide who 
is eligible to get it back.
<P>
	We are saying that we need to bring back the sense of 
independence and self-sufficiency which is ultimately best for 
everyone, particularly the working class.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise when you are in the Chair. 
I believe I have 20 minutes. You will understand that I want to 
make sure that this is indeed the case.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in the debate on the borrowing 
authority and, consequently, on the budget. This is the second 
Liberal budget and we must keep in mind the truly disastrous 
economic context which affects the unemployed. Once again, 
the Minister of Finance did not provide anything for the 1.4 
million jobless. This budget is particularly unfair to Quebec, 
primarily because no concrete decentralization measures are 
proposed. There is no indication of a willingness, on the part of 
the federal government, to transfer to the provinces fields of 
jurisdiction which, in many cases, the provinces would be better 
able to look after.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	In the case of Quebec, there is of course the issue of 
manpower training. As you know, there is a very strong 
consensus in Quebec, which includes chambers of commerce, 
unions, as well as the Quebec government. They all agree that 
Quebec would be better served if its government looked after 
manpower training which, as you know, is one of the links 
between social and education policies.
<P>
	Yet, there is nothing in the budget that leads us to think that 
the federal government wants to fulfill the commitments it made 
earlier. As the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot said 
repeatedly, this budget is unfair. It is unfair because nothing is 
done about family trusts. In this issue, the government acted 
somewhat like Star Trek, in the sense that it announced a 
measure, but ``beamed it up'' or rather beamed it forward to 
some time in the future.
<P>
	Indeed, it was announced in the budget that the rules 
governing family trusts would be reviewed; however, the 
changes will take effect just before the year 2000. What is a 
family trust? It is a despicable scheme which legally allows a 
number of wealthy people to avoid paying taxes  by using a truly 
outrageous provision. Yet, nothing is provided in this budget to 
tackle the problem.
<P>
	It is also an unfair budget-this has been pointed out 
repeatedly but it does not hurt to say it again-since farmers in 
Quebec will lose $32 million, especially dairy producers, a 
sector which has undergone major consolidation at the 
instigation of the various governments we have had in Quebec in 
the past ten years. It is an unfair budget because farmers and 
dairy producers will lose $32 million, while western producers 
will receive an additional $2.9 billion.
<P>
	One of the worst aspects of this budget, and this is one of the 
areas where the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois agree, is 
that it fails to provide anything in the way of tax reform. Take 
the banking sector. When we look at who benefited most from 
the 1982 recession and the subsequent recession, it is clear that 
the banking sector finished first. The big chartered banks in this 
country with their many branches across the country have made 
absolutely outrageous profits during the past few years. And 
they are the only ones that managed to emerge unscathed from 
the first and second recession.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you think the government would have had the 
guts and the social conscience to tax the profits and capital gains 
of the banks? Of course not. And that is probably the true 
measure of this government. A modest tax of $100 million is 
peanuts. Just look at the banks' profits in 1993-94 alone: $1.2 
billion. That being said, we are convinced that the government 
could have asked the chartered banks in this country to 
contribute more.
<P>
	What does the government do? It asks for a piddling $100 
million, when the Royal Bank alone, the open-minded bank, 
made a profit of around $1.2 billion. The government could have 
asked the banks to contribute more, but it did not. Of course, one 
does realize there is a definite connection between the financing 
of certain political parties, and I am not naming any names but I 
am looking at them, and this timid treatment of the banks.
<P>
	Another issue that gives cause for concern and which people 
are worried about, and no wonder, is transfer payments to the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The issue of transfers to the provinces, as you know, Mr. 
Speaker, is absolutely central, because it has to do with the 
balance of relations between the central government and the 
provinces. It is therefore an absolutely vital issue. Three 
characteristics are identified with respect to federalism, 
Canadian federalism, which some of your pages are studying in 
political science courses across the country.
<P>
	It is a two level form of government, usually with a central 
government and a lower level of government, which could be 
provinces or townships, but there are two levels of government. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10943"> 10943 </A></B>
<P>
It is a system with a constitution providing that the governments 
are autonomous in all jurisdictions under their authority. A 
court, in this case  the Supreme Court, acts as arbiter in these 
matters. Why am I saying all this? Because provincial transfers 
have been and remain the central government's traditional 
method of destabilizing provincial public finances.
<P>
	How do you think individual provincial ministers of finance 
can manage to plan and establish coherent economic 
development policies, if the central government destabilizes 
public finances in every province by reducing transfers out of 
hand, unilaterally and without consultation? Allow me to give 
you some specific figures in this regard. The federal government 
will cut $2.5 billion in transfers to the provinces in 1996-97 and 
$4.5 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	These are not insignificant amounts and this will have a major 
impact on the provinces' ability to plan. In the case of Quebec, 
transfers will be cut by $700 million in the coming year. This 
means that Quebec will shoulder 27.1 per cent of the total cuts, 
whereas it has 24 per cent of the population. Things will not 
improve in 1997-98, because it will then have to shoulder $1.88 
billion in cuts to transfer payments.
<P>
	What is shocking in all this, and this is where the connection 
must be made, is that the present cuts to the provinces will 
obviously be on top of what has been cut since 1982. If you add 
up all the cuts in transfers to the provinces from 1982 to 1998, 
you will discover, hon. colleagues, that the provinces will be 
facing a shortfall of $48 billion. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, you 
will understand that this way of doing things goes totally against 
harmony in the federal system.
<P>
	In any case, and the Government of Quebec is not the one 
saying so, two premiers from the west who, after reading the 
Martin budget, declared that it was the death knell for Canada, 
because there is no way for the provinces to develop coherent 
economic development policies if the federal government keeps 
on shamelessly cutting transfer payments. As we all well know, 
transfer payments are not something theoretical, not just 
rhetoric; they directly affect the provinces' ability to provide 
health and education services, and these services are at the heart 
of our citizens' quality of life.
<P>
	However, I will focus my speech today on the pitiful trick 
played on the unemployed. The history annals of Canadian 
federalism for the early 1990s to the year 2000 will tell the story 
of the slow and despicable dismantling of the unemployment 
insurance system. Please remember that unemployment 
insurance is the only social ``insurance'' program offered by the 
Canadian government, ``insurance'' as opposed to assistance, 
that is, meaning that workers and their employers share the cost 
of the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	As you all know, in 1990, the Canadian government went as 
far as completely stopping its contributions to the 
unemployment insurance fund. This means that, as I speak, 
Canada is the only western country with an unemployment 
insurance system where the government  does not contribute to 
its UI fund. This means that virtually all of the benefits paid out 
to workers are paid for by the work force and their employers.
<P>
	We must acknowledge the fact that Canadian workers are in 
mourning. They have been since 1990, because from that point 
on Conservative and Liberal governments alike have derived a 
sadistic pleasure from dismantling the unemployment insurance 
system.
<P>
	I would just like to remind you of what governments past have 
done, without, of course, forgetting the Chrétien government, 
which, led by the Minister of Finance, has disgracefully ganged 
up on the unemployed.
<P>
	It all began in 1990 with Minister MacDougall, who dealt the 
first blow, who made the first attack on the unemployment 
insurance program. You will recall that in 1990 when the 
government decided that it would no longer contribute to the 
unemployment insurance fund, Mrs. MacDougall proposed an 
increase in the minimum qualifying period and a reduction in 
the maximum benefit period, with the overall result that, for the 
first time, a government reduced by 10 per cent its costs of 
financing the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Not content with this initial assault on the program, in 1993 
Mr. Valcourt-whom the voters, thankfully, did not 
re-elect-came back to the charge and lowered benefits from 60 
to 57 per cent of insurable earnings. Remember that in the 
1970s, benefits were at 70 per cent of insurable earnings. Now 
they have dropped to 57 per cent and are often below the poverty 
level. This is a disgrace.
<P>
	What does this mean financially? Cuts in benefits of $850 
million in 1993 and $1.6 billion the year after. The Liberals are 
obviously no better than their predecessors. And this is why the 
Bloc Quebecois has always said that, red or blue in Ottawa, the 
future is black without the Bloc. What has the Martin budget 
done for unemployed Canadians in 1994? Increased the 
minimum qualifying period and reduced the maximum benefit 
period. And we are not talking about 57 per cent coverage, but 
about 55 per cent. In 95 per cent of cases, we can expect 
claimants to get 57 per cent of insurable earnings. This is the 
kind of social solidarity that this government has decided to 
have with the unemployed. Did you think that the finance 
minister was going to stop there? Certainly not. The budget that 
has just been tabled talks about cutting benefits by $750 million 
in 1996 and 1.5 billion the following year.
<P>
	In the early 1940s, UI was intended as a generous program on 
which all the provinces agreed. It was the first amendment to the 
Canadian Constitution. Look at what happened to 
unemployment insurance under the repeated attacks of the 
Tories and the Liberals. UI has become an exclusion program. In 
fact, the UI account, which posted a $3 billion deficit in the 
1990s, will show a $5 billion surplus at the end of the fiscal year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10944"> 10944 </A></B>
<P>
	One would think that this government would have done the 
right thing, that it would have shown enough solidarity to use 
this $5 billion to create and maintain jobs for the unemployed. 
No, this government shamelessly attacked the unemployed. It 
will arrange for a surplus to be deposited in a deficit fighting 
reserve fund, although funding of the UI account does not have 
anything to do with the government's ongoing operations. The 
Liberal government has appropriated the Tories' shameful 
legacy.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Allow me to make a final point. We would have expected the 
Liberals, in accordance with the red book, to put forward 
defence industry conversion measures. As we know, 10,000 jobs 
are threatened in the coming days. That is no secret; it is a 
well-known fact. Both the aerospace industry and the provinces 
demand defence conversion measures. This demand is not 
exclusive to Quebec. What conversion measures did the 
government take? It did not put forward any concrete measure.
<P>
	It is unable to plan for the future and use its leverage to help 
workers. There is no vision. This is an attack against the 
unemployed. That is why we have no qualms about presenting 
the golden raspberry award to the Minister of Finance for all he 
has done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize that 
my hon. colleague from the official opposition would have 
needed more time to deal fully with the subject at hand. 
Nevertheless, I appreciated his hint at the government's failure 
to keep its word with respect to defence industry conversion. As 
we know, in my riding of Lévis, MIL Davie's shipyard suffered 
greatly from the government reneging on its promises, with 
nearly 2,000 jobs lost last year.
<P>
	My question will not be on this. Instead, I would like my 
colleague to give me his thoughts on the Minister of Finance 
making cuts last year to the Unemployment Insurance Program 
to reach the financial targets set in his budget, and using the $2.5 
billion surplus generated by these cuts to reach his targets. I 
would like his to tell me: is it right for the Minister of Finance to 
hit on the disadvantaged to reach his financial targets?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will have noted our 
colleague's high degree of social concern from his question and 
I want to thank him for it.
<P>
	I think that, if we were living in a normal country, a country 
committed to showing greater solidarity with the workers, the 
government would have taken this money and used it to 
implement full employment policies. What is dishonest about 
the government's decision is that it gives the impression that 
cutting UI will reduce this government's debt, when in fact, 
since 1990, the government has nothing to do with UI, except for 
administration that it does not pay for naturally.
<P>
	I think we should consider, and urge a number of organized 
bodies such as the labour movement, with which I understand 
you are rather closely associated, to consider legal action to 
have the courts overturn the government's decision to withdraw 
from the financing of UI while at the same time continuing to 
deprive workers of services to which they are entitled.
<P>
	I think that, all together, in this House, we should try to figure 
out if these shameful and unacceptable measures could not be 
invalidated through legal action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the hon. 
member, who gave a good presentation on the Minister of 
Finance's budget, and who clearly showed that there is a world 
of difference between the Liberals in opposition and the Liberals 
in office. I am reminded in particular of Expro, a company in my 
riding which needs technical and financial support for its 
conversion. When the Liberals formed the opposition, they were 
adamant that conversion was the way to go, and they urged Mr. 
Mulroney to set up a conversion program.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member made an in-depth review of the Martin 
budget, and I would appreciate his comments on the discrepancy 
between the budget and what the Liberals said they would do 
when they sat in opposition.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate 
with the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, I may 
remind the House that members should refer to a minister by his 
title. For instance, we should say ``the Minister of Finance, the 
hon. Prime Minister'', without giving their last name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, some team, some question, would 
you agree? The opposition is in fine fettle.
<P>
	That being said, I think the hon. member mentioned that the 
government had the perfect vehicle for setting up a defence 
conversion program. That vehicle is referred to in English as the 
DIPP.
<P>
	The DIPP is the Defence Industry Productivity Program. In 
the eighties the program had a budget of about $300 million. The 
Liberals have emasculated the program to the point that next 
year, its budget will be only $21 million. Actually, the Federal 
Office of Regional Development, the Department of Industry 
and the Montreal Urban Community have set up a joint task 
force which is to make specific recommendations on defence 
conversion. With the modest sum of $25 million, it would have 
been possible to conduct market surveys and help businesses 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10945"> 10945 </A></B>
<P>
that are involved in defence production to go the route of 
conversion.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will say that, in the end, defence conversion is 
a matter of political will. Today we have the tools to make this 
happen. However, this government is acting in a very 
hypocritical way, and speaking out of both sides of its mouth.
<P>
	Do not despair, the opposition will be there to remind the 
government of its promises, and we will keep up the pressure on 
this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
present-day Canadian federalism is a dead end sheet. In the year 
2000, the cumulative deficit will be $800 billion, and Quebec 
Premier Jacques Parizeau said not so long ago that it was high 
time for Quebec to get out of this system, and that if Quebec 
decided to stay, their taxes would go up.
<P>
	In his presentation the hon. member gave us a very clear 
picture of the current situation. What he said this morning is 
exactly what all Quebecers are thinking.
<P>
	Is it not time for Quebecers to consider getting out, to 
consider doing what the Premier of Quebec suggested?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only applaud the 
clairvoyance of the hon. member for Shefford who has an 
uncanny knack for predicting the future.
<P>
	What the hon. member is saying is that in the eighties, when 
we went through the first referendum, scare tactics were used. 
Remember that at the time, the federal debt was $75 billion. 
They told us: If you leave the Canadian federation, you will end 
up with an economy that is not viable.
<P>
	So we stayed. We stayed, and now we have a debt of $600 
billion. What the hon. member is saying is that Quebec has 
everything it needs, together with its own economic 
infrastructures, to administer its own finances.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, it being 11 a.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
statements by members under Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr.

has been harshly treated. That is an understatement.
<P>
	What happened to Canada's outstanding rower at the Pan-Am 
Games in Argentina was unfair, unjust and uncalled for. Let us 
hope that she was not a pawn in an international game of politics 
as is perhaps indicated by the premature release of her name 
before the official report on the incident.
<P>
	Her story is already familiar to millions around the world. 
Silken Laumann came down with a cough and cold. As most 
people do, she took medication. She was told it was an approved 
remedy for athletes. That was wrong. It was a banned substance. 
Someone had goofed and it was not Silken Laumann. For that 
she and her team were stripped of a gold medal.
<P>
	The Canadian Olympic Association will fight the 
disqualification. We think it should. Justice demands that Silken 
Laumann's name be cleared. Ms. Laumann is an honest

Manitoba MLAs, Saskatchewan MLAs, representatives of the 
city of Churchill, representative of the Hudson Bay Route 
Association and others.
<P>
	I go on record as recommending to the government that it pay 
heed to the recommendations of the task force and of the 
delegation. Given the possibilities for the spaceport in 
Churchill, new possibilities perhaps for the port of Churchill as 
a port and a number of other things, the money that needs to be 
spent there would be money well spent.

anniversary of a significant day in our history. Twenty years ago 
today Bill C-373 received royal assent, officially proclaiming 
the beaver as the national Canadian symbol.
<P>
	The beaver appeared on Canada's first postage stamp, on our 
five-cent piece and was generally considered a symbol of 
industry and the sovereignty of the nation.
<P>
	My predecessor, Mr. Stan Darling, tells the story of a call he 
received 21 years ago from Kearney resident Mr. Ralph Bice. 
That set the ball rolling for Stan who worked diligently with Bill 
C-373's originator, Mr. Sean O'Sullivan, to safeguard the 
beaver as a Canadian symbol. As the story goes New York State 
was trying to beat us to it.
<P>
	In the words of the originator: ``There must be things to touch 
one's soul, heart and emotions if we are to be complete persons 
and a whole nation''. ``That'', he said, ``is the importance of 
symbols''.

reputation to fight for the protection of women worldwide.
<P>
	Sadly some people still do not get it. Some people think that 
the torture and imprisonment of women for not wearing a veil is 
no different from the requirement that men wear jackets in our

committed against homosexuals happens when political and 
social leaders trash gay people, when they equate gays with 
pedophiles, and when they state that granting gays rights 
enjoyed by other Canadians is granting them special privileges.
<P>
	A Reform member opposite recently stated that gays are 
responsible for bashing gays and that gay bashing is simply one 
gang going against another gang. These actions give gay bashers 
encouragement and justification. These politicians are equally 
responsible for the violence that ensues.
<P>
	In spite of what the Reform member opposite thinks, hate 
crimes against gay men and lesbians are a harsh reality. We must 
take these hate motivated crimes seriously so that our streets are

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, government administration in Canada is in crisis. 
The federal public service must become smaller, work better and 
be more cost effective. If it were a private conglomerate it would 
be in receivership.
<P>
	Public enterprise must focus on outputs, what gets done; make 
decisions transparent, accessible and reliable information; 
provide real incentives for performance and consequences for 
failure; establish constraints through modernized budget 
techniques; promote competition by enhancing consumer 
choice; and develop competitive benchmarks with the private 
sector using multiple suppliers.
<P>
	Contracting out is favoured such as more non-profit 
organizations for social care. The federal public service can be 
smaller and provide services more competitively. Government 
must be more businesslike. We must change our expectations 
and let the public service concentrate on what it should do. Let it 
work to become smarter rather than larger.

<P>
	It is jeopardizing jobs across Canada. This is an irresponsible 
action causing jobs to be lost nation wide. The Bloc could not 
care less about Canadians and the Canadian economy, including 
that of Quebec. It is wasting public money, the money of 
Canadians from all regions of the country.

	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Canadian economy.
<P>
	In Etobicoke-Lakeshore the strike has affected activity at 
the food terminal, passengers using the Mimico station, and 
manufacturing, industrial and commercial businesses in the 
area.
<P>
	As rail service slows so too has the export of manufactured 
goods, grains and natural resources. While trains sit idly in the 
yards so do the thousands of workers whose jobs are dependent 
on the rails to ship their products across the country.
<P>
	The self-interest of the Bloc Quebecois in this labour dispute 
has resulted in the suffering of small and medium size business, 
commuters, and Canada's reputation as a reliable international 
supplier.

	Every morning $200 million worth of exports to the United 
States are being interrupted. This week alone the delay will cost 
the Canadian economy $3 billion to $5 billion worth of

	Somehow the image of the Bloc as champions of the 
collective bargaining process is shattered by the fact that even 
Buzz Hargrove of the Canadian Auto Workers has said there is 
no benefit whatsoever to delaying the legislation.
<P>
	The Liberals strongly believe in collective bargaining, but 
when it fails and results in economic turmoil the government

Mr. Speaker, with each passing day we see how carefully the

their campaign to attack the working conditions of their

National about the importance of rationalizing the company.
<P>
	These messages were certainly not put together in the course

Is it not completely unacceptable that the employer is running 
down its employees publicly, on the eve of the 
mediation-arbitration process that the federal government so 
prefers to what the Bloc has proposed?
<P>
	If CN is so confident, it is because it knows it has the backing 
of the federal government, which in the end bears sole 
responsibility for the present labour conflict. Through its 
collusion with the employers and its inflexibility with respect to 
the special legislation, the federal government is disrupting

<P>
	Deathnet, an on line Internet service, is based in my riding and

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, comments made yesterday by the Minister of Transport 
and CN President Paul Tellier confirmed the government's 
strategy, which had been described by Commissioner Hope.
<P>
	That strategy is obvious: for 18 months, the government and 
the railway companies let the situation deteriorate; for 18 
months, they hinted at the possibility of special legislation; for 
18 months, their only concern was to create an impasse so they 
could impose terms and conditions of employment.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Labour realize that with this legislation, 
she is merely finishing the job of breaking the unions so that CN 
can be quickly privatized?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Bloc Quebecois realize that since last Sunday 
it has been obstructing back-to-work legislation that has a 
major impact on the Canadian economy from coast to coast? Is it 
aware of the repercussions of its decision not to co-operate on 
the passage of this bill?
<P>
	We had to table this bill in the House as a last resort. We did 
because we saw it as our duty to do so, and today, we would ask 
the Bloc Quebecois to act accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is to blame for blocking a settlement. 
If the minister is so concerned about the economic 
repercussions, why did she not deal with the problem on 
Monday, on the basis of proposals made by the Bloc Quebecois 
which, in fact, worked very well in the case of the Port of 
Montreal? Employees would have been back to work five days 
ago if this government had not stubbornly insisted on this 
indecent settlement mechanism.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the members of the Bloc Quebecois to stop 
playing politics with the Canadian economy. Millions of 
workers are affected because the railways are not operating. Do 
we realize that? What does the Bloc Quebecois hope to achieve 
by obstructing this bill? This week, we heard the Leader of the 
Opposition say ``on with the referendum''. Now, Mr. Speaker, 
let us get on with this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was never any explanation from the other side of 
the House for refusing the solution proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois, which provided for a return to work on Monday. 
Sixty days, no strike, no lockout. Never! The only explanation 
given by the government was that negotiations had been 
dragging on for 17 months. Does the minister realize that in the 
Port of Montreal, negotiations had been dragging on for 25 
months and that thanks to the proposal by the Bloc Quebecois, 
work has now resumed in the Port of Montreal?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr.

who appointed a mediator in the Port of Montreal. They have a 
real identity problem. They really have a problem, I must say.
<P>
	I decided to appoint a mediator in the Port of Montreal 
because the circumstances so required. I have already said that 
we consider each particular situation in the railways on its 
merits. All these discussions and negotiations have been taking 
place for more than a year. Unfortunately, we have reached an 
impasse. And at least one member of the Bloc Quebecois agreed, 
the hon. member for Longueuil.

does Canada intend to submit this sensitive matter to the UN

trying to dialogue with the group and respect their cultural 
rights.

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
week long rail stoppage has cost Canada dearly. Canada has lost 
over $5 billion, of which farmers have lost $100 million, 
exporters have lost $1 billion and $2 billion has been added to 
the public debt. These are just the short term costs. The total will 
climb even higher because our clients have lost confidence in 
our transportation system.
<P>

<P>
	My question is for the Minister for International Trade. What 
plans does the minister have to address these long term costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I understood the question.
<P>
	The question refers to the long term impact of the current rail 
strike. Indeed, as the hon. member said, the impact is in a sense 
cumulative. Each day the situation becomes worse. Rail cars 
become stranded and unable to provide the necessary services 
and exports are hindered.
<P>
	What we are intending to do in the short run is to complete the 
legislative process to ensure the restoration  of full rail services 
in Canada. Then we will accelerate in every way we can the 
export of Canadian goods following the restoration of the rail 
services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Tuesday the Minister of Transport said that the Government of 
Canada had a responsibility to maintain a rail system that is 
viable, competitive and affordable. Over the past week I submit 
that the government has failed to do all three of these things. It 
has failed farmers, manufacturers, consumers and commuters. 
Why has it failed? I believe it is because the government does 
not have a plan.
<P>
	Why has the government not tabled a long term plan to ensure 
that rail stoppages are a thing of the past?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not the Government of Canada that is 
preventing the return of the rail services, it is the Bloc 
Quebecois that is preventing their return.
<P>
	We are making every effort on this side of the House. We will 
complete the process in short order to ensure the restoration of 
the rail services. As for the longer run, we are under the 
excellent leadership of our Minister of Labour who is reviewing 
all aspects of the relevant legislation to ensure that this sort of 
situation does not occur again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
simply not true that only the Bloc and the NDP are responsible 
for the damage to the Canadian economy. The government has 
had nearly a year to deal with this problem and to come up with 
some long term legislation which would prevent this sort of 
thing from happening.
<P>
	Once back to work legislation is finally passed, will this 
government take legislative steps to resolve the transportation 
problems once and for all? After all, the team Canada approach 
depends on a viable rail service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government still believes in the collective 
bargaining process. If the hon. member from the Reform Party 
believes in a much more drastic solution, that is not our policy. 
We still believe in this process. Indeed, the majority of labour 
disputes in Canada are settled through collective agreements.
<P>
	True, the normal collective bargaining process is difficult to 
apply in the railway industry. However, since we are currently 
reviewing the Canada Labour Code, we will surely have to 
propose solutions to this kind of problem in the future.

<P>
keep a watchful eye on the  provinces and penalize those who try 
to exclude essential care and services from medicare coverage.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that repeated budget cuts to federal 
transfer payments to the provinces will force the provinces to 
make agonizing choices like closing thousands of beds or 
limiting access to costly chemotherapy treatments, at the risk of 
cutting back on care and services available under medicare?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr.

care. They will be preserved. We will make sure that every 
dollar we spend is well spent and that essential services are

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr.

called non-essential health services, such as eyeglasses, 
wheelchairs and ambulances, when we know that the provinces 
also have to close thousands of hospital beds?
<P>

very important issue of health.
<P>
	But I do, and so does the Prime Minister. I can tell you that no 
jurisdiction in Canada is telling us that more money is what is

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Notwithstanding any objection to the quotas, NAFO 
regulations give Canada the authority to carry out inspections on 
any ship in the NAFO regulatory zone. Why has Canada stopped 
doing these inspections while fishing is going on?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have carried out many dozens of 
inspections over many years in the NAFO regulatory zone.
<P>
	What those inspections tell us-this information has been 
made public in the past-is that there are repeated examples, in 
particular by the Spanish fleet, of every rule of conservation 
being violated by those that participate on the Grand Banks.
<P>
	The reason we are not doing inspections at this time is that the 
Canadian patrol vessels out there have already participated in 
one armed seizure of a Spanish vessel. In that circumstance and 
given the tension that exists between those officers and the 
Spanish fleet, sending a couple of unarmed officers aboard at 
this time may not be in their personal best interest or safety.
<P>
	We will do nothing that will needlessly or recklessly put our 
officers at risk when we know with certainty that this fleet is 
cheating, is not following the rules, is fishing indiscriminately. 
The action we need is not inspection but enforcement by Spain, 
enforcement by the EU or failing that, enforcement by Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
minister's record of protecting Canadian resources is not great.
<P>
	NAFO regulations give inspectors the right to wait until the 
net is hauled in and then inspect all areas of a ship. Why, while 
the minister has held office, did we inspect the <I>Estai</I> at least 11 
times and only issue one citation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

previously admitted to a police officer and psychologist that he 
fantasized about killing a child.

from informing the community about the danger posed by

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	At the Rio summit, Canada was priding itself on being in the 
forefront in environmental protection. Today, we realize that it 
has joined the ranks of the countries threatening the credibility 
of the convention on climate change.
<P>
	Next week, in Berlin, the Minister of the Environment will be 
attending a meeting at which the European Union is expected to 
propose that levels of emission of greenhouse gases established 
at the Rio conference in 1992 be extended beyond the year 2000.
<P>
	Would the Minister of the Environment tell this House what 
position her government will take with respect to this proposal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the government's 
position is as follows: there must be an exchange of technology 
between developing countries and countries like Canada. For 
this reason, we are going to propose an analysis of credit 
transfers, which will not only stabilize the greenhouse effect, 
but reduce it. This is our position.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
view of the fact that Canada has not met its objectives for the

Environment go to Berlin with a view to taking credit for

reductions in gases achieved by Canadian companies in 
developing countries?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government will be going to Berlin with a position which we 
believe is not only defensible but will enhance the capacity of 
the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
	We will be proposing that we work together with countries 
like China and Brazil that are interested in Canadian technology 
to ensure technology transfer for credit. That will permit us to 
pursue our objective which is not only to stabilize greenhouse 
gases around the world but to reduce them.
<P>
	I hope that the member would use her good offices to convince 
the Government of Quebec to come to the table so that we can 
have a Canadian position, where federal and provincial 
governments work together to establish not only stabilization 
but the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

about it as well.
<P>
	This is a remarkable accomplishment for that province when 
we look at the fact that there has been a collapse of the Atlantic

has balanced its budget through spending reductions and not an

	Newfoundland has a planned balanced budget. Alberta has a 
plan to balance its budget. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New 
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are doing the very same. 
They have a plan to balance their budgets.
<P>
	When is the Government of Canada and the Minister of

federal budget? When can they do that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

Newfoundland has been successful in balancing its budget. It is 
the first time it has done so since 1949. It has taken a long time. 
The most recent government has taken several years to do so.
<P>
	This government, however, is going to do it in rolling 
two-year targets. We are going to keep to our target and get the

little difficult to understand why well meaning people feel 
refugees and immigrants cannot pay their own way. That is not 
the history in this country. They are proud people who want to 
contribute to Canada. They want to take their share of the burden 
and they will do so.

repayment rate is over 95 per cent. I know the hon. secretary of

dated Monday, February 7, 1994, on the taking of divisions of

<P>
	The committee recommends that the House not go ahead with 
the taking of divisions by electronic means at this time. On 
behalf of the whole committee, I wish to thank the members of 
the subcommittee on this issue: the hon. member for 
Bellechasse, the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who is the Chief Government 
Whip in the House, the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River, and the hon. member for Fraser Valley West-

	He said: Mr. Speaker, in view of the fact that Canadians 
everywhere are grossly overtaxed, it gives me great pleasure to 
introduce this private member's bill to lease out Stornoway, the 
official residence of the Leader of the Opposition, when not in 
use.
<P>
	The reason for the bill is to use it as an example for other 
government infrastructures that are not being used and are 
costing taxpayers a great deal of money while not in use. I hope 
we can rent out, lease or sell some of the other assets that are not 
in use and prevent them from being a drain on the taxpayer.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BORROWINGAUTHORITYACT,1995-96">BORROWING AUTHORITY ACT, 1995-96</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning on April 1, 1995, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been listening with great interest over the last number of weeks 
to the debate on the budget while I waited for my opportunity to 
participate. I have been truly amazed with the disregard the 
government is showing for the intelligence of the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	The budget represents a betrayal of the red book or election 
platform on which the government was elected; also the betrayal 
the dishonesty and the deceitfulness of the rhetoric surrounding 
the cuts that must inevitably come if we are some day to reach a 
balanced budget.
<P>
	Canadians were told by the Liberals during the 1993 election 
platform that the Liberals could solve the deficit problem 
through economic stimulation and job creation. Today 
unemployment is still unacceptably high and the deficit is still 
out of control.
<P>
	Canadians were also told by the Deputy Prime Minister 
during the 1993 election that they would eliminate in the GST in 
one year or she would resign. To my knowledge she is still a 
member of the House.
<P>
	Another inconsistency the Liberals told during the 1993 
election campaign was that they would never cut the civil 
service. Upon making this promise they were viewed as the 
friends of the civil service, unlike the Tories. We must wonder 
what these same civil servants are now thinking with 45,000 of 
them being shown the door.
<P>
	Canadians who voted for the Liberals in 1993 believed they 
would never cut transfers to the provinces in support of health 
care, education or social services. All seniors believed the 
Liberal Party would never cut old age security. Lo and behold 
only a year and a half later the Liberal government has done a 
total flip-flop on these and other election commitments.
<P>
	Are Canadians to believe the Liberals really believed these 
commitments to be realistic or was it really the old political 
strategy of telling the people what would get them elected 
because a long time ago Canadians gave up holding politicians 
accountable for election promises.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians will forgive so easily. I will do my 
best to see they do not forget. I will remind Canadians the Prime 
Minister's red book commitment to rebuild respect and integrity 
in government was simply more empty political rhetoric.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign the Reform Party 
presented a plan to balance the budget in three years and the 
Liberals labelled us the slash and burn party, the destroyers of 
health care and old age security. Now only one and a half years 
later in the budget the government has implemented many of the 
zero in three cuts and even went further than that zero in three 
plan, not because it would choose to do so but because as we 
predicted there was no alternative.
<P>
	This year again Reform put forward a budget and a plan to 
balance the budget in three years and again the Liberals rile and 
rave about the proposed programs and put their spin doctors to 
work to sell their own deceitful budget and hide the reality of 
what must inevitably come.
<P>
	They continue to hide the realities in rhetoric like the 
following: ``By consolidating our existing resources into one 
human investment we can then sit down with the provinces as we 
are doing now on issues of child care and literacy and work out 
new partnerships and new arrangements with the provinces and 
municipalities and private sector partners. It gives us the 
flexibility we need now to engage in a new generation of social 
programming that really fits both the reality and the changed 
circumstances that the country finds itself in''.
<P>
	This is the best example I could find of the dishonesty of the 
rhetoric being thrown at us. I will leave members opposite to 
surmise which member might have spewed that gem on us.
<P>
	The truth must be told and we must face the music now as 
painful as that may be because if we postpone balancing the 
budget to somewhere in the future, say the year 2000, the debt 
could then be approaching $800 billion and the cost of interest 
on the debt will have risen  to the point at which we can no longer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10961"> 10961 </A></B>
<P>
sustain even the core of our social safety net programs which 
have made Canada the most desirable country in the world to 
live in.
<P>
	I have heard the howls of disbelief from the members 
opposite. They say they are a caring and compassionate 
government. They say what about the human deficit.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I listened carefully and the arrogant hypocrisy makes me very 
angry. Who do these people think they are that only they have 
compassion or care about people? The single most important 
reason I joined what is now the least respected profession in 
Canada, at least outside of this place, is my concern for the 
future of this country and what 30 years of Liberal and Tory 
governments have done to the future of my children and 
grandchildren.
<P>
	What this government is doing to future generations of 
Canadians is not caring or compassionate, it is greed and 
selfishness; it is the me generation saying: ``I am not going to 
live within my means and the next generation cannot only pay 
for my greed but can no longer enjoy the benefits and the 
standard of living this me generation has had''.
<P>
	The best example of this greed is the refusal of the Liberal 
caucus power brokers to give up their gold plated pension plan. 
As long as I am a member of the House I will do everything 
within my power to see that the first pensioners who do not 
receive an old age security pension check because the country is 
broke will be the same greedy politicians who mismanaged this 
country to the point we are at today.
<P>
	The examples of mismanagement are everywhere. A few 
examples lie within my portfolio as natural resources critic. 
Petro-Canada is one of my favourites. Every budget since 1984 
has promised to privatize Petro-Canada. Canada's window on 
the energy industry was created by the Liberal government at a 
cost of over $5 billion. Petro-Canada has never provided any 
benefit to Canadians that could not have been provided by the 
private sector. Governments since have never had the courage to 
admit to Canadians they will only be able to recover less than $2 
billion of the $5 billion it cost to create Petro-Canada. Although 
this is the second Liberal budget that has promised to privatize 
Petro-Canada, I doubt very much if it will happen soon.
<P>
	Let us have a look at how this budget and this government in 
past budgets have squandered Canada's natural advantage in the 
world marketplace. Gasoline, a favourite cash cow for 
governments, has always been a cheap source of energy. It has 
allowed compensation for Canadians for the great distances we 
must move our produce and our people compared with other 
countries.
<P>
	Governments have gone back to the well so often that in the 
last 10 years taxes on gasoline have risen by over 500 per cent if 
one includes the 1.5 cent increase in this budget. Almost 25 
cents of every 50 cent litre of gasoline is tax. At the same time 
the government is moving to eliminate transportation subsidies 
across the country.  Long gone is our natural advantage. The 
U.S. is importing Canadian crude oil with a $1.40 dollar, 
refining that oil and selling the same gasoline at almost half of 
what we are paying in Canada.
<P>
	The final example is the elimination of the income tax 
transfer on privately owned utility companies. The finance 
minister stated in his budget that if government does not need to 
run something, it should not and in the future it will not.
<P>
	How many provincially owned utility companies will ever 
consider privatizing under these circumstances? In spite of 
vowing to prevent discriminatory taxation against Alberta 
during the election campaign, the Minister of Natural Resources 
remains totally silent on this issue in the House.
<P>
	I could go on endlessly but time does not permit. The budget 
does, however, represent a dramatic reversal in Liberal 
philosophy which the reform Party can take some credit for. 
That shift is so dramatic that even some of the Liberal dinosaurs 
in the Liberal caucus have threatened to withdraw support for 
the budget.
<P>
	As dramatic as this change might be, it does not go far enough 
to break the back of the deficit. If in the next three years the 
government cuts $12 billion from spending and the interest 
costs rise by $12.7 billion, I hardly think the monster has been 
mortally wounded and I am sure after a short respite it will be 
back to threaten to destroy our economy.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	Already the real agenda begins to leak out in well planned 
trial balloons. The Prime Minister says our health care system 
will be reduced to the provisions of 50 years ago. Liberal 
members are suggesting that the minimum pensionable age will 
have to be raised to 67.
<P>
	These adjustments to our social safety net may indeed be 
necessary, but who knows? This government clearly has no plan 
to balance the budget in the foreseeable future.
<P>
	One fact is indisputable. By postponing the balancing of the 
budget to the year 2000 or beyond, the cuts that will have to be 
made will be far more destructive and devastating than those 
proposed in our taxpayers budget. This is where the deceit and 
the dishonesty in the Liberal budget lie.
<P>
	I think the Prime Minister and the finance minister would do 
well to heed the words of a very wise man, F. J. Clark, when he 
said: ``A politician thinks only of the next election. A statesman 
thinks of the next generation''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to point out one item of reference in the hon. 
member's remarks and then ask him a question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10962"> 10962 </A></B>
<P>
	I suppose it was primarily rhetorical in his remarks but he did 
refer to a deceitful budget. I am sure he and his colleagues 
recognize that a budget is a budget is a budget. Canadians can 
add and subtract. They can assess the wording in the statements 
of the Minister of Finance, the positions of the government and 
the Prime Minister and at the end of the day Canadians will 
make up their minds.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians believe that they have been seduced 
or have been dealt with deceitfully in any way or that they even 
see deceit as part of the intent of the government. I hope the hon. 
member will accept the comment that the deceit referred to by 
him is purely rhetorical and not helpful in analysing the budget. 
He is certainly entitled to his views.
<P>
	In an economy like Canada's when the measured 
overspending in the economy runs up to $25 billion or even up to 
$40 billion, a material proportion of overspending, if we were to 
simply stop or reduce the federal spending by approximately 20 
or 25 per cent, if the overspending was that great, there would be 
a serious negative macroeconomic impact. This would put the 
country again in recession and would defeat the kind of 
economic growth that permits the country to build its way out of 
the recession and the overspending at the same time. Would the 
member not agree?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, the deceit that I speak about is not 
in the figures in the budget. It is the failure to tell Canadians 
honestly and truthfully the measures that will inevitably have to 
be made. We have no alternative but to cut another $25 billion 
from government spending or increase taxes to reach a balanced 
budget. That is where the dishonesty and the deceit lie in this 
budget.
<P>
	To answer the question, I do not think the hon. member is 
correct in the assumption that those kinds of cuts would have a 
destructive effect on the economy. Certainly that has not been 
the case demonstrated in Alberta where government costs over a 
three year period have been reduced by 20 per cent. In fact, the 
exact opposite has been true. Those cuts have had a stimulative 
effect in the private sector and unemployment continues to drop.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak for my constituents about 
Liberal fiscal policy.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	On March 10 I held a town hall meeting in New 
Westminster-Burnaby. I heard firsthand how the budget is 
viewed. I regularly consult with my constituents about what 
they want in fiscal behaviour from this government. There are 
usually a variety of views expressed but there is one theme that 
is clear.
<P>
	Our constituents may not be sophisticated economists or 
financial analysts, but they know in their hearts that the country 
is in deep financial trouble. They know that the economy is 
performing well below its potential.
<P>
	When they ponder a little bit about what is wrong, they very 
quickly mention all the taxes they give to the government that 
are being frittered away in unproductive interest payments 
instead of being applied to social development and basic 
services. It is a simple concept for my constituents to grasp.
<P>
	They also do not like the cutbacks that will be necessary to get 
the fiscal house in order. They ask: How did it get out of hand? 
Why are we planning to waste 50.7 billion tax dollars in interest 
to service past debt? That money could be spent on so many 
needy things or much of it should be left in the hands of the 
taxpayers for them to invest for their needs under their own 
control.
<P>
	My constituents do not buy it when the finance minister says 
that everything is okay, government is on target and that they 
should trust it. My constituents know that each week when they 
go to the grocery store it costs a lot more to fill the shopping 
cart.
<P>
	Some of my constituents know what it is like to line up at the 
food bank or to search hopelessly for a job. Some of my 
constituents suffer directly from the fortunes of the economy. I 
do not blame them if they get a little cynical and radical in their 
language when they express how the economy is not working for 
them.
<P>
	If the finance minister keeps promising that some day a better 
employment picture will be there for them, make it clear that 
consistent deficit financing kills the economy. Government 
annual borrowing beyond the capacity of the economy to 
support the debt really hurts people. This government is hurting 
people.
<P>
	Governments cannot create lasting jobs but they sure can 
affect the climate of private commerce where jobs are created. 
Governments can very easily mess things up through misguided 
intentions and mistaken assumptions.
<P>
	The message I give to the Prime Minister is this: Your policy 
is callously hurting the Canadian people. The uncaring 
arrogance of pursuing discredited deficit targets is immoral. 
Three per cent of GDP is a scandal. The verbosity of the finance 
minister that reflects the bankrupt Liberals' social philosophy is 
a cruel hoax upon those on the margins of the economy: the poor 
and those who are helpless dependents on the social safety net.
<P>
	Successive deficit financing kills the economy. Deficit 
financing eats the heart out of the social safety net. This Liberal 
budget plans only for more deficits. It is a plan that admits 
defeat in all its projections and then expects praise for the 
capitulation.
<P>
	Chronic unemployment hurts the soul. Folk in my riding want 
a job. They also want hope. They want hope that there is light at 
the end of the tunnel, and hope that someone in government has 
set a course to a new Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10963"> 10963 </A></B>
<P>
	My constituents are willing to pay their fair share of taxes. 
However they get very angry about the conspicuous waste of this 
government, especially in view of the finance minister 
insincerely usurping the Reform Party pledge to have a 
government that lives within its means. Then he delivers budget 
numbers that betray that pledge.
<P>
	I am standing here in this Chamber today on behalf of my 
constituents to say what they want me to say for them. Their 
message is clear. It is a message of two words, just two words, 
two elusive words which I prophesy will never be grasped by 
these Liberals. The two words are: balanced budget. One can be 
a little disappointed that those words are so easy to say and so 
easy to contemplate, but sadly never to be obtained by this group 
of old-fashioned Liberals, the tired system defenders.
<P>
	What is the government planning for us in its wisdom that it 
says we need? A deficit. A deficit of $24.3 billion in 1996-97. 
The sad part is that the finance minister says he is proud of this. 
He is a blind system defender instead of an agent for change, 
hope and renewal.
<P>
	I know the minister listened closely to the leader of the 
Reform Party when the taxpayers budget was presented on 
February 21. The plan proposed to lower the deficit to zero in 
three years. The numbers are all there in black and white. It is a 
wise and reasonable target and a pragmatic plan. However, the 
minister simply did not have the courage.
<P>
	People expect governments to do the right thing. They expect 
governments to keep spending under control. They expect 
governments to always keep their financial house in order, for it 
all is in a trust relationship on behalf of the citizens.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	What has this budget done to prove to the public that the 
government is on the path to solving this fiscal crisis? It is clear 
to me is that the only way we go after the accumulated debt is to 
first go after the annual deficit.
<P>
	Last month was the finance minister's chance to really make a 
difference. The political mood in the country was there, but no 
resolve was taken by the minister. Canadians will surely suffer 
because of this irresponsibility of the government. It is a legacy 
of missed opportunity.
<P>
	With this budget the debt is going nowhere but up. As a 
percentage of GDP, the net public debt for 1993-94 was 71.4 per 
cent. For 1994-95 the prediction is 73.2 per cent. For 1995-96 
the prediction is 73.5 per cent. For 1996-97 the prediction is 
73.4 per cent.
<P>
	The minister boasts of his deficit as a percentage of GDP. 
Well, what about the debt percentage? What a pitiful shame. We 
are getting nowhere. Even more significantly, the overall real 
debt that must be served by this one Canadian economy and our 
one group of  Canadian taxpayers is more like $1.7 trillion, if all 
factors are considered for our population of 28 million.
<P>
	The Reform Party has shown with the taxpayers budget that it 
is serious about moving forward and manifesting substantial 
innovation. Should the Liberals follow through on their election 
promise to be more innovative with economic policies, may I 
suggest that they take a closer look at the Reform Party's 
taxpayers budget. Just in case members opposite do not know 
what this is called, I remind them that it is simply called 
leadership by example.
<P>
	In his speech the finance minister said that the budget must 
focus on cutting spending, not raising taxes. I think I have 
missed something here because when I was driving to the 
Vancouver airport this past week I noticed that the gasoline 
prices have really jumped. I thought the minister said he was not 
raising taxes. I heard one Liberal member say that at least there 
were no personal tax increases. Well, the last time I filled my car 
with fuel, I used my cash to pay for it and that makes it a 
personal tax.
<P>
	South African author Nadine Gordimer summed it up best: 
The truth is not always beauty, but the hunger for it is. Canadians 
want the truth and they rightly deserve it. They want a 
government that bases its principles on honesty and integrity.
<P>
	The budget of the finance minister puts the best face on a sad 
situation and yet he smiles. The minister is a well meaning 
gentleman who does not take kindly to my words about him 
being cruel to Canadians, but his face is covered over with his 
Liberal social philosophy. The captain of the <I>Titanic</I> was also 
well meaning. Former British Prime Minister Chamberlain kept 
hoping beyond hope in face of dark storm clouds, a nice 
individual.
<P>
	We need a dramatic course correction. We do not need to hit 
the berg. We need a reality check against false hopes. We need to 
take immediate remedial action.
<P>
	I call on the finance minister to table a plan that will balance 
the budget and save social programs. Table a plan that begins to 
wind us out of the national debt trap and lowers taxes so the 
economy can take off again and produce those badly needed 
permanent jobs.
<P>
	Through you, Mr. Speaker, I have a message for the Minister 
of Finance: We know you are only a Liberal, but take courage 
and Reformers will help you. Save this country and lead us 
responsibly. Lead us by example with true fiscal responsibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the speech of the Reform member and I 
must admit that there was some truth in it when he said that, 
whatever happens, Canadians will have to deal with a huge 
global debt in the future. Some people ask how Quebecers will 
ever pay their part of the federal debt if they choose to form a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10964"> 10964 </A></B>
<P>
sovereign state. We  can say for sure that if they remain within 
Canada, they will definitely have to deal with that debt.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not agree that this colossal and 
uncontrollable debt is not so much the result of inefficiency on 
the part of individuals-although there might have been some of 
that-as the result of an unhealthy competition between various 
levels of government? Were we not overly greedy for visibility 
and did we not try to make sure that provincial and federal levels 
would invest equal amounts in any project on the map? 
Sometimes we announced projects which were not entirely 
realistic, the investment in Hibernia for example, just to make 
up for the weaknesses of the economic policies implemented by 
the central government.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Did we not also lose control over the budget largely because 
of the confusion of jurisdictions? We never know who is 
responsible for a specific issue, the federal government or the 
provinces. Does the hon. member not believe that the solution 
lies in a major change in that area so that each level will know 
perfectly what are its own responsibilities and what it will have 
to deal with in the future?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member talked about 
unnecessary duplication between provincial and federal 
governments. I remind the Bloc member that a lot of the 
duplication found in Quebec is because the Quebec government, 
with its independent mind, wanted to unnecessarily duplicate 
federal services.
<P>
	He should also bring the message to Quebecers that under the 
Reform Party plan Quebec could truly be master of its own 
house and provide some of the services they have talked about. 
A Reform Party government would find that vision. That is the 
message that we want to get through to Quebecers.
<P>
	On the other issue of deficit financing, is he suggesting that if 
Quebec leaves Confederation it will abandon its social 
responsibility and abandon the debt created in its name? Studies 
have shown that although Quebec represents about 25 per cent of 
the population, consistently over time it has received about 30 
per cent of government spending.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thanks to some now well known communication 
technology, the minister of finance had organized the release of 
his 1995-96 Budget so that the Canadian public would be 
prepared for the worse.
<P>
	The medias took part in this, and we could hear or read 
comments from reporters, analysts and doomwatchers 
predicting, before the fateful day, that the Budget would really 
hurt. So we had to take advantage of these last moments before 
the axe would fall.
<P>
	On the said day, everyone was almost unanimous. It was not 
so bad after all. Only the opposition members were criticizing. 
And criticisms from Bloc members and Reform members are 
normal, since that is their job. That is why they are here.
<P>
	So, instant relief replaced the anxiety of the day before. And 
the ink that was used to print that budget had hardly dried before 
that the relief was replaced with concern. Why? Because several 
of the cuts announced will once again affect the poorest of our 
society, or the middle class which, ultimately, pays more than its 
fair share. Because several government decisions were put off 
indefinitely.
<P>
	Subsidies to transportation in the East were eliminated. The 
federal government will now have to agree with the Quebec 
government on what to do about the $80 million, or $15 million 
a year, needed to compensate for the loss of subsidies in 
transportation. There is some uncertainty about whether that 
money will be used to build many kilometres of highways or to 
create permanent jobs.
<P>
	Are we going to be bright enough to devote only a small part 
of these millions to asphalt and the major part to an investment 
fund to promote the creation of lasting jobs in eastern Quebec?
<P>
	Changes in unemployment insurance rules, but the reform is 
shelved for now.
<P>
	As for old age pensions, the universality principle is 
questioned due to the introduction of a family income principle 
which, when implemented, will be detrimental to many women 
who will be deprived of their pensions because their husbands 
have high incomes.
<P>
	Transfer payments to provinces are being reduced through the 
creation of what the hon. member for Outremont called the 
NCST. I hope it is not a venereal disease, although it might be 
just as bad.
<P>
	Post-secondary education financing and the loan and grant 
system for students are being modified.
<P>
	The defence budget was not cut enough.
<P>
	Family trusts will remain unchanged until 1999.
<P>
	Taxpayers are the only ones to foot the bill through increases 
in the price of cigarettes and gas.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The lobbying by banks and large corporations worked well, 
their tax increases were so insignificant that we are almost 
justified in saying that the rich were spared by the last budget. 
The poor, the unemployed will pay about 120 times more than 
these large corporations. Yet, the banks had profits of $5 billion 
last year, which was not the case of the unemployed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10965"> 10965 </A></B>
<P>
	Now that we are over the sigh of relief that followed the 
budget, we have to face reality. Several reforms will wait until 
after the referendum. Liberals are asking the people of Quebec 
to vote no. Yet, if we believe the recommendations of the C.D. 
Howe Institute, voting no means saying yes to hard times. The 
federal government is offloading its problems onto the 
provinces and there is no doubt that Quebec and Ontario are the 
hardest hit.
<P>
	The deficit is still too high and the budget is doing nothing to 
deal with the debt. How is all this going to affect Canada's 
famous credit rating? There is still a lot of suspense regarding 
this budget, and we do not yet know its complete aftermath. 
Already, some of those who, at first, gave it the benefit of the 
doubt, are getting disillusioned. This budget does not stand up to 
a serious analysis. Tomorrow might be too late.
<P>
	While we are waiting for the government's real agenda to be 
exposed, let us have a closer look at the Department of Canadian 
Heritage budget. Although the CRTC is holding hearings on the 
information highway, even though the department has already 
recognized the critical role of information in the economy of 
today and tomorrow, the budget makes further cuts in the 
so-called cultural industries.
<P>
	Conservative and Liberal budgets come and go and are almost 
identical, but for the fact that Grit cuts are going to be more 
drastic that Tory cuts, without solving the issues of the deficit or 
the debt. Therefore, one must wonder who really benefits from 
this budget. Certainly not the CBC since, in spite of the stubborn 
denial on the part of the Canadian heritage minister, the 
announced cuts from parliamentary appropriations will indeed 
amount to $350 million over the next three years. We never saw 
the likes of this under the Conservatives who at least had the 
decency to keep up appearances.
<P>
	Important cuts were made to Telefilm and the National Film 
Board which stand to lose $17 million in 1995-1996 alone, and 
that is over and above the more than $100 million they have lost 
since the Mazankowski reduction plan went under way.
<P>
	The budget also indicates that the department intends to order 
a review of the mandate of these three agencies and to readjust 
their funding accordingly. Some people are concerned about this 
operation, and rightly so, given the importance of the presence 
of Quebec and Canada in this North-American sea of English.
<P>
	The publishing industry will also be hard hit. For example, we 
expect over the next three years a 24 per cent cut in the mail 
subsidy program which is considered a direct subsidy to help 
Canadian magazines pay part of their mailing charges. These 
charges will now be offloaded onto the subscribers. So, for us, 
this will mean another indirect tax.
<P>
	Indeed, following the program review process, Heritage 
Canada will lose over three years around $676 million, almost 
25 per cent of its total budget. At this  time, we have no further 
information on how these cuts will be made. We only have 
concerns.
<P>
	We also know that some programs relating to our Canadian 
identity are doing fine. For example, lieutenant-governors will 
be awarded a pay increase next year. Why are these individuals 
not subject to the same rules as the rest of the public service, and 
members of Parliament and senators, whose wages have been 
frozen for three years?
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Why are lieutenants-governors an exception to the rule?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> It is a disgrace.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> You said it.
<P>
	The Council for national unity will continue to benefit from 
Ottawa's generosity. It will receive over $800,000 from the 
Open House Canada Program, which allows young people from 
the middle and upper class to travel across Canada, learning to 
love their country through official propaganda. The overall 
budget of this program is $2.2 million.
<P>
	We also have to add to the Canadian identity budget the 
expenses that will be incurred for the six trips that the royal 
family will make to Canada during the year, at our expense of 
course.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government announces a 21 per cent cut in the 
arts program, a 13 per cent cut in the heritage programs, a 24 per 
cent cut in the cultural industries program, a 20 per cent cut in 
the official languages support program, the major part of which 
will be passed on to the provinces through cuts in second 
language training funding. It also announces a 20 per cent cut in 
amateur sport just one year before the Olympics in Atlanta even 
though, when interviewed by the CBC in Lillehammer, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage had promised the world to our 
athletes. This promise has changed into a 10 per cent cut in 
funding.
<P>
	At the same time, the increase in corporate management 
services spending will be 13 per cent. Thirteen per cent more to 
manage a department whose minister never has any clear idea of 
what he should be doing. I hope that he will at least take 
advantage of those 130 extra jobs in his department to answer 
our questions.
<P>
	Fortunately, the cultural affairs budget of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs will remain unchanged, at $4.7 million, 
although there has been a change of policy and the emphasis is 
on the NAFTA countries, and Europe is left out. That way, 
Quebecers will have no more visitors from the Francophonie. 
Are we to understand that some ministers wield more influence 
than others?
<P>
	Most of my remarks have been on cuts in the cultural sector 
and what I consider frivolous spending subsidized by the 
department. While in times of austerity and financial difficulty 
it is normal for the government to try to rationalize its 
expenditures, it should establish a set of  priorities to do so. The 
priority 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10966"> 10966 </A></B>
<P>
for the Department of Canadian Heritage should be cultural 
products. Even in times of budget restraint, cultural products 
should be protected from cuts, since they are the key to the 
future. The government should invest more in this area.
<P>
	We can readily support our cultural industries and find money 
for research and development in artistic creation with cuts to 
departmental expenditures and by eliminating empty programs 
like the campaign promoting the Canadian flag, raises to the 
lieutenant-governors and grants to federalist organizations, 
without naming any, to enable them to do their propaganda work 
during the referendum.
<P>
	The minister is sacrificing the production of cultural works 
for programs that attempt to promote an empty, artificial 
identity aimed at imposing a national identity on everyone and 
denying ours. The situation at present in cultural and 
communications matters clearly indicates that the head of the 
department cannot give us what we need to go forward.
<P>
	Worse, if the present is an indication of the future, we will see 
that the minister is more inclined to protect programs promoting 
Canadian identity, like promoting the flag, than programs that 
provide for investment in cultural products as such, something 
that would be more in keeping with the requirements of our 
historical context.
<P>
	Heritage Canada still sees culture in folkloric garb, when it 
long ago moved into the age of telecommunications and the 
information highway.
<P>
	As we live through the technological revolution, it is vital that 
we have a Minister of Canadian Heritage who is credible and 
capable of defending cultural interests in cabinet. We are 
therefore asking Mr. Chrétien to act accordingly.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think that the Heritage critic did a good job of 
demonstrating how inefficient the Department of Canadian 
Heritage is.
<P>
	I would like to comment on transportation subsidies in 
particular. For decades now, certain businesses in the east of 
Canada and in Quebec as far east as Lévis or La Beauce have 
received financial assistance to transport their products.
<P>
	The government decided to cut these subsidies. I do not think 
that people strongly disagree with this decision, but the regions 
affected would have wanted the government to do an impact 
study first. Instead, the regions are facing radical cuts, the 
short-term economic impact of which is hard to predict. The 
decision will affect each industry differently, some favourably, 
some extremely unfavourably.
<P>
	The hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata's speech 
contained some novel ideas and some interesting suggestions on 
which I would like her to elaborate. In particular, will she 
specify how we can ensure that the money invested in the 
compensation fund will have lasting effects? How can we avoid 
finding ourselves saddled with investments that we will be 
forced to abandon five years down the road? Will she propose a 
solution which will guarantee that the money invested will have 
a lasting impact and enable the economy of eastern Quebec to 
turn the tables around and, once and for all, enable it to harness 
its strengths, skills and its bountiful natural resources and break 
free from the central system?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will certainly not make 
myself very popular by replying with my usual frankness, but 
there is, I believe, in our region, a politician who has built his 
career on the Cacouna-Rimouski highway. I think that it would 
be a monumental error to invest the whole $80 million in 
asphalt. In five years, the few companies that laid the asphalt 
would have benefited financially, and in another five the road 
would be full of holes again and there would be no money to pay 
for more asphalt.
<P>
	I think that it is important to use some of the money-say 25 
per cent-to do some resurfacing if necessary, widen the 
highway in spots, bypass a few towns, do some grading. There is 
work to be done. But I think that the greater part of the $80 
million, around 75 per cent, should most definitely be put in an 
investment fund for the development of eastern Quebec, to 
create sustainable jobs. Eastern Quebec needs jobs if people are 
to stay.
<P>
	When we have a highway and everyone has gone to Montreal, 
we will need something more to interest tourists in visiting the 
Gaspé. And that something is people, development, 
infrastructure. We need an investment fund if we are to succeed, 
money that would be loaned to companies and that they would 
have to pay back.
<P>
	This would ensure a long term fund that would continue over 
20 or 30 years, because those who left would pay us back and we 
would always have money for job creation in Eastern Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to congratulate my hon. colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, who, with his well-known verve and 
oratorical skills, demonstrated that this budget is even more 
conservative that the one the Tories dared to table when they 
were in power.
<P>
	She put her finger on one of the government's shortcomings 
by saying that there was no one to defend culture on the 
government side. On hearing that there was no one to defend 
culture, I wondered who, in the last year and a half, has been 
defending the most disadvantaged as well as students, seniors, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10967"> 10967 </A></B>
<P>
middle-income earners and workers? They have shown how  
trigger-happy they are in their handling of the rail dispute.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals are knuckling under. They even knuckle under 
history when we ask them to correct it. Last night, I felt sick 
when the Liberals on the other side of the House refused to 
correct history regarding the high treason charges against Louis 
Riel. They even refused to refer the matter to a committee of the 
House. I was appalled.
<P>
	So there is no one to defend the most disadvantaged, to defend 
culture, to defend students, middle-income earners and 
workers, to defend history. What has happened to the Liberals 
since the election campaign, when they presented us with a red 
book full of humanitarian and social democratic principles as 
well as promises to defend the most disadvantaged? What has 
happened since then? I am putting the question to my colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> This 
is an excellent question, Mr. Speaker. I must say that, as usual, 
the question was planted and I am stuck. Anyhow, as far as 
knowing what happened to the red book is concerned, I say it is 
at the National Archives. That is what happened to it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha!
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are in the red.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage runs his department so well that 
he must have hidden the book carefully, or in the National 
Archives. Or perhaps it is in the waste basket.
<P>
	I think, dear colleague, that you have drawn the essence of 
what I wanted to convey in my remarks: this budget is worse 
than any budget tabled by the Conservatives. The Liberals are 
making cuts that are more severe, in a way. They boast left and 
right that they want to manage properly their great Canada, the 
best, the number one country in the world, and so on. But they 
are forgetting one thing: they are not getting money from those 
who have it. This way, those who keep sending them money 
during their fund raising campaigns instead of spending it on 
taxes will be able to continue supporting them. So, the wheel 
turns and traditional parties are maintained in power because of 
this.
<P>
	We are often accused of having our motherhouse, or head 
office, in Quebec City, but it is well known that theirs is Power 
Corporation. Just take the piece on satellite television published 
in <I>La Presse</I>. They sought the opinion of the public, but on the 
corporate side, they only sought that of Power Corporation, 
while this a very widely known issue. They could have met with 
officials from Cancom, Expressvu and others, but no, Power 
Corporation of Canada managed to get exclusive coverage in <I>La 
Presse</I>, to show off. Everything else was left out.
<P>
	It is all in the family and it is clear that they failed to check 
their red book carefully before preparing their budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take a few moments to compliment the 
hon. member on her excellent speech. I think it hurts the 
government to hear the truth, to hear what is really in this 
budget. My question will be very brief. I know that the hon. 
member is a formidable defender of the status of women. I 
would like to hear from the hon. member what this budget has to 
offer women in the way of unemployment insurance and wage 
equity, for instance.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
very quickly, because I do not have much time left, I think that 
as far as women are concerned, the budget is again a total loss. 
The government wants to apply the principle of family income 
to unemployment insurance and in so doing will put women at a 
disadvantage. The government transferred the equal 
opportunities for women program from the Department of 
Human Resources Development to the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, but funding was reduced. Since this was discretionary 
funding that could be used for political purposes, the program 
was transferred to the Department of Canadian Heritage. How 
much are they going to give?
<P>
	The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, the 
only agency that did research on the status of women, was shut 
down. It is no more. So this government has chosen to ignore 
women, youth, the poor, the elderly, gays, and just about 
everyone, except the rich who line the party's coffers.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate it if you would 
give me one minute's notice before the end of the period for 
government orders so that we can proceed as agreed with respect 
to the division on this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the official 
opposition Whip also wish to take part in the debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In that case, the hon. 
member has 20 minutes, and I will interrupt his speech at 1.29 
p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to this bill, and I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10968"> 10968 </A></B>
<P>
have the impression that what I say could be used next year, 
since most of the decisions will not come into force until then.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> This will be two speeches rolled into one.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Save on words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> In athat case, take only ten minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> No, I will take all the time allocated to me. You 
will learn something. People can learn something at any age, 
even on the other side of the House.
<P>
	The government talks about decentralizing but and the only 
thing they have decentralized is the deficit. They have shipped it 
out to the provinces, and this is pretty obvious in the case of 
Ontario and Quebec, where these provinces will assume 71 per 
cent of the cost of transfers that will no longer be made. There is 
nothing for jobs in this budget either. They campaigned on the 
slogan: jobs, jobs, jobs. There were two ``jobs'' too many. The 
infrastructures project lasted a year. However, it is now being 
extended to get ready for the next election, and then they will 
extend it again. This is like politicians who promise a bridge 
during every campaign, even when there was no river.
<P>
	This budget also maintains the privileges of the wealthy. I am 
thinking of family trusts. The government says it did something 
about family trusts, and oddly enough, that something will kick 
in in 1999. The government is giving these people plenty of time 
to get ready. It is saying: watch out, we are coming, but not right 
away, there are still plenty of tax loopholes. I suppose the 
government even points them out. Meanwhile, it claims that it 
has done something about family trusts.
<P>
	The same applies to flags of convenience. This is a rare 
occurrence. Not often do you see senior government officials 
who own companies. Of course they declare those interests; they 
do not manage their companies while they are cabinet ministers. 
However, some companies use flags of convenience, including 
Canada Steamship Lines, which belongs to the Minister of 
Finance and whose ships fly a Panamanian flag. This is unusual 
indeed. The example comes from the top. Taxpayers are told: 
make an effort, pay your taxes, but this does not apply to me. 
K.C. Irving also used convenience flags.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Great Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Great Canadians. Mr. Irving also received the 
Order of Canada, while in the Bahamas.
<P>
	Is this the ferocious attack against the wealthy? As long as the 
example will not come from the top, do not expect people to 
make efforts and to see black market activities stop.
<P>
	Take Canadian Pacific. The company made profits of $422 
million last year but did not pay taxes. The teller at the Royal 
Bank pays more taxes than the Royal Bank itself. This is 
incredible.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>We are told that banks will have to pay $100 
million in new taxes over a two-year period. Yet, the Royal 
Bank, and let me check to make sure I am not mistaken, made 
profits of $1.2 billion last year, and we are told that all the banks 
together made-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Five billion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Five billion dollars. And we are told that all the 
banks together will have to pay $100 million in new taxes over a 
two-year period, in addition to being able to take advantage of 
all the existing tax loopholes. If this is the government's effort 
to make the wealthy pay some taxes, what would it be like if the 
government did not do anything?
<P>
	In the meantime, the government targets the public service. I 
agree that some cuts must be made and the Bloc Quebecois can 
propose ways of achieving this.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	However, who is this budget going after? The public servants, 
not Paul Tellier. Paul Tellier gets an annual salary of $345,000, 
plus approximately $50,000 in expenses and has an interest free 
loan of $400,000 at the Royal Bank, a ``friendly'' arrangement. I 
feel so sorry for these kinds of people. These are the people with 
the gall to say: ``Let us get to work. Do not exaggerate; we have 
to tighten our belts''.
<P>
	We do not touch these people, but we hit the poor public 
servants. Eliminating 45,000 jobs in the public service 
represents 14 per cent of public servants. In Montreal, there are 
21,000 public servants, more than in Hull, where there are 
20,000. Montreal has the second largest pool of public servants 
next to Ottawa-Hull, which has 104,000. Since we know that 
there are 20,000 in Hull, that leaves 84,000 in Ottawa. As luck 
would have it, yet again.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Luck has a hand in a lot of things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> It is like the research centres that are on the 
other side of the river as well. It is a pretty tricky business.
<P>
	So, for Montreal, this means 9 per cent of all public servants. 
Taking a look at the main departments and the cuts likely to be 
made in Montreal, it is clear the cuts will be huge ones, 
especially when we know there are no measures to soften the 
blow. No measures are planned.
<P>
	If a total of 45,000 positions are cut nationwide, the total 
number that Montreal would lose of the 20,000 or 21,000 
currently located there would be 2,730. That is a huge number! 
They are unionized jobs, generally well paid. It is a question of 
2,730. But that is not all. Canadian National employs 
approximately 7,000 people in Montreal. We know that they 
want to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10969"> 10969 </A></B>
<P>
privatize. The Canada Post Corporation is also a big employer. 
The CBC employs 3,723 people. Everybody at the CBC in 
Montreal knows this, only the French section of course, and 
when I say everybody, I mean everybody except the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The people who watch the news on Radio-Canada, which 
probably does not include the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
know that 750 positions will be cut. I see my colleague, the 
government whip, gesture that, yes indeed, he knows that 750 
positions will be cut.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> He is nodding yes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He agrees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> He would make a much better Minister of 
Canadian Heritage than the person currently occupying the 
position.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> It is true that almost anybody else could 
do a better job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I concede that that is not much of 
a compliment because there are many people out there who 
could be a better minister.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha! Ha!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Those 750 positions at the CBC are also 
worrisome, quite worrisome. A Franco-Ontarian colleague who 
is here knows that this attack on the French section of the CBC 
will reduce the flow of information which is supposed to reach 
francophones outside Quebec, and I suppose that he is rather 
concerned about the government's decision, although the 
heritage minister is not. I would imagine that the government 
could function without the heritage minister.
<P>
	Therefore, we could say that there are lots and lots of cuts. 
Cuts in the semi-public sector. I mentioned the Canadian 
National, we can see what is happening now. The rail strike was 
prepared jointly by companies, with the complicity of 
government, and this was very clear yesterday in the 
presentation of Paul Tellier. He said that he believed that people 
were making too much money, and that salaries and work 
conditions would have to be lowered; not his though. He is a 
wise man. He knows that charity begins at home.
<P>
	They want to privatize, to reduce the number of jobs, the way 
they did it at the Angus yard, not far from my riding. At one time 
it had 8,000 employees. It is closed now, completely closed. 
People were promised the best job security plan, but today the 
railways are reneging on this promise.
<P>
	These are major job losses at the Canadian National, major 
job losses at the CBC. If we add it all up, we are talking about 
6,500 jobs that will be lost in the Montreal area within two 
years. I recall the excellent document prepared by the present 
Minister of Finance, when his party was in opposition, which 
proposed a strategic plan for Montreal. It received very good 
coverage in the press. There were two or three very good articles 
about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> You were against it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> No, we were for it. The economist who 
prepared this plan for the Minister of Finance was Pierre-Paul 
Proulx. When he realized that the Minister of Finance was 
dropping these principles, the man who was writing the 
speeches of the Minister of Finance joined the Bloc Quebecois, 
saying: It is hopeless. He was fed up and that is what he did.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I believe that the finance minister himself understood that had 
he been elected in Calgary, he might have implemented the plan 
for Montreal, which, I must admit, he knows well. But, because 
he preferred to be a minister with all the accompanying 
trappings, rather than being true to his ideas, he gave them up. 
Six thousand seven hundred jobs were cut in Montreal and 
nothing was done about it.
<P>
	And yet there were groups in Montreal, organizations 
working to get the economy going again. I am thinking of 
community and economic development corporations or CDECs 
which work with community groups, employers, labour, and 
municipal, federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	This is what we call partnership. During the 1993 election 
campaign, the Liberals promised the moon to these groups, 
giving them specific examples. Especially the minister 
responsible for Quebec regional development, who can still deal 
with community and economic development corporations, 
though he is prevented from dealing with other types of 
corporations. Such is the case of shipyards he can no longer be 
involved with since he has an interest in them. The same is true 
of trucking, and air transport, in both of which he also has an 
interest. He has lots of interests, but little time or no availability 
to get involved since he would be in conflict of interest. And yet, 
he still is responsible for regional development. These 
corporations came and still come under Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The province and the federal government accepted to extend 
the agreements for three years and Human Resources 
Development for six months. For now, the development of these 
corporations has come to a standstill. We are told in confidence 
that the CDECs are expected to no longer come under the 
Department of Human Resources Development, but rather under 
the Federal Office of Regional Development. Considering the 
tripartite agreement that was reached, why not give immediate 
approval for another three years? The government is 
jeopardizing not only the very existence of these corporations, 
but most importantly all the work they carry out. This is crucial 
to the current situation in Montreal, because employment in this 
area will be affected not only by government cuts, but also by 
the lack of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10970"> 10970 </A></B>
<P>
measures to help workers and private corporations to adjust to 
NAFTA.
<P>
	We were promised these measures by the government during 
the last election campaign. What good did they do? Hitachi is 
leaving; Northern Telecom is leaving. They are all leaving 
Montreal. Now I have heard some Liberals tell us: Yes, they are 
leaving the Montreal area. But why? Because of political 
instability. Of course. Now that the sovereignists are in office in 
Quebec, private companies are fleeing to settle in a more stable 
environment.
<P>
	This is incredible. What about the stability in the country they 
have chosen to settle in, Mexico. The former president has fled 
the country, because his brother is charged with killing another 
candidate, with an assistant charged with killing two people. 
There is the rebellion in Chiapas. What a stable country. These 
people have the nerve to tell us that they are leaving Quebec to 
settle in a stable country, Mexico. That reminds me of Laurent 
Beaudoin, of Bombardier Inc., who stated in 1992 that investors 
are not interested in politically unstable countries. It made the 
headlines. And all the federalist politicians started saying the 
same thing without really trying to understand. If Beaudoin says 
it, it must be true because he is our friend, he pays. We help him 
and we have only nice things to say about him.
<P>
	However, in the same week, there was a meeting at 
Bombardier and Beaudoin told us that the company's largest 
international investment at that time was the purchase of North 
Corporation. I do not want to frighten you, but North 
Corporation is in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Does it ring a bell? 
These kinds of arguments are worthless. We have to get back to 
this budget. Let us look at unemployment insurance.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It bothers them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> There would be a lot to say on this, my friend. 
It is the Liberal's turn. If you want to speak, just rise. If you do 
not have anything to say, then stop. The unemployment 
insurance fund will suffer a 10 per cent cut again.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	We are being told that there are fewer unemployed workers in 
Canada. It is just like a physician saying that there are fewer sick 
people in the hospital because they are all dead. People who are 
no longer on unemployment insurance are now on welfare. And 
the government is proud to have reduced unemployment.
<P>
	How can unemployment be reduced? By creating employment 
or by reducing access to unemployment. The Liberals thought 
that it would be easier to reduce access to unemployment. They 
look at the statistics and say that there are fewer unemployed 
workers. They are magicians. Choquette, the famous magician, 
looks like an amateur compared to them.
<P>
	They can make unemployed workers disappear in an instant; 
they just reduce access to unemployment insurance. No 
unemployment insurance, no unemployed; no unemployed, no 
unemployment. Easy. Again, it will cost Montreal millions of 
dollars, because there are more unemployed people in that city 
than in the four Maritime provinces combined. That is terrible.
<P>
	They take on the unemployed, not unemployment. Yet, how 
often did the Liberals talk about this when they were the 
opposition? In Montreal, 29 per cent of families live below the 
poverty level. I suppose that in the next budget they will decide 
to reduce that to 15 per cent: the poverty level now being set at 
$20,000, they will drop it to $10,000 so that there will be fewer 
people living below the poverty level. That is Liberal magic. 
This is a hocus pocus government.
<P>
	The red book contained a hidden promise: Vote for us and you 
will be in the red. That is exactly what we see happening. I have 
to say that it is a promise well kept, no doubt about it.
<P>
	The Biosphere and the St. Lawrence Centre plan come to 
mind. What is happening with this plan? Two or three press 
conferences were held about it. Actually, under the Liberal 
strategy, nothing happens before it has been announced ten 
times in press conferences. Therefore, it will be announced 
regularly over the next few months and then it will get under 
way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> We have to make repeated announcements, so that 
you can understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Yes, and all the announcements are patterned 
after the original, to repeat the same message. And the Liberals 
are happy about that.
<P>
	The design and fashion industry support program also comes 
to mind: we have heard nothing yet about it. I am reminded of all 
those programs like the National Film Board and Telefilm 
Canada that will be affected. One has to have a lot of nerve to 
make all those promises during an election campaign and go on 
and on about Montreal, only to come up with such meagre 
results. However, we have to wonder if the government, during 
the 1995 referendum campaign-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> When?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> In 1995, my friend. There are twelve months in 
a year. I see that my time is up. We will soon continue the debate 
about Montreal in greater detail.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. Members:</B> Question.

	The House resumed from February 13 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to 
Motion No. 314.
<P>
	When we debated the motion last month the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food told the 
House that the federal government had been taking steps for 
some time to reduce overlap and duplication and that we had 
been doing so in close co-operation with provincial and 
municipal governments and the private sector.
<P>
	I will not go into detail about the initiatives we discussed in 
the House at that time, initiatives that clearly demonstrate the 
ongoing efforts of the federal government to reduce both 
overlap and duplication among the various governments.
<P>
	However I should like to remind members of some of them. 
They include in depth discussions among the federal 
government, the provinces and the private sector regarding the 
implementation of a Canadian inspection plan, a 
federal-provincial protocol for the development of trade and the 
promotion of new markets, and talks we are holding with the 
provinces aimed at increasing the  efficiency of the delivery of 
financial services to the agri-food sector.
<P>
	As far as the last point is concerned, the Farm Credit 
Corporation and interested provinces are discussing strategies 
to reduce duplication of government services in the sector. As 
part of the process the FCC has acquired the $37.4 million 
portfolio of the New Brunswick Agricultural Development 
Board. We are also attempting to combine the lending services 
of the Farm Credit Corporation and the Alberta Financial 
Services Corporation into a single delivery point. Needless to 
say the initiative is exactly what is needed.
<P>
	I could go on at length about the federal government's 
initiative to reduce overlap and duplication but I am limited by 
time constraints. Today I will focus on the content of Motion No. 
314 and certain key aspects of the discussion on the motion, the 
basis of which I find puzzling.
<P>
	The motion attempts to provide a starting point for 
negotiations based on the following three questions. First, what 
does it mean to reconfederate agriculture and why do we need to 
do it now? Second, what role should government play in 
agriculture? Third, what role should the agri-food industry 
play?
<P>
	If the motion were adopted, the federal government would 
have jurisdiction over trade policy, trade distortion adjustment 
support, whole farm income stabilization programs, health and 
safety standards, and macrophysical monetary and taxation 
policy.
<P>
	The provinces would be responsible for human and material 
resources, while the private sector would be responsible for all 
aspects of the business plan, from design to the sale of goods and 
services.
<P>
	While all the reforms put forward in the motion may at first 
glance seem clear cut, a number of points are far from clear. Let 
us begin with the transfer of responsibility for all income 
stabilization programs to the federal government.
<P>
	Such a measure is inconsistent with the significant progress 
recently made by the federal government and the provinces 
together, in the interest of Canadian producers. As a result of 
their concerted efforts, much progress has been made in this 
area.
<P>
	We can think back to the situation that existed in Canada in the 
area of the income stabilization programs in the late 1960s and 
the early 1970s. The federal and provincial governments had 
their own completely independent rival income stabilization 
programs which distorted market signals to some extent.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10972"> 10972 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In December 1994 after extensive discussions with the 
provinces we reached a federal-provincial consensus aimed at 
developing a renewed national whole farm income stabilization 
program. The program is an example of close co-operation 
between the government and is more in line with the interests of 
the sector.
<P>
	In addition, as announced in the federal budget brought down 
on February 27, the $600 million allocated to the annual costs of 
the new whole farm safety net program will be increased by a 
contribution from the provinces and from the federal 
government, bringing total annual government support to 
producers to $1 billion.
<P>
	A rational and effective national delivery system is what 
Canadian producers including the producers of my constituency 
of Dauphin-Swan River wanted. That is what we are 
attempting to give them.
<P>
	It is in the interests of both federal and provincial 
governments as partners to play an active part in becoming 
financially responsible because their common goal is to 
contribute to a stable economy that will benefit all producers, in 
fact all Canadians.
<P>
	A second point in Motion No. 314 that puzzles me concerns 
the proposed trade adjustment assistance program designed to 
counter the export subsidies imposed by the United States and 
the European Union. It seems clear to me that the cost of the 
proposal would be exorbitant and that it is largely inconsistent 
with our commitments under GATT and the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	Adopting Motion No. 314 would be a large step backward. 
Given the current trade regime, no producer, processor or 
government can afford to lose 15 or 20 years of partnership, 
close co-operation and dialogue.
<P>
	We owe it to Canadians including the people of my 
constituency of Dauphin-Swan River to move forward with the 
current policies and to build, to be innovative and to 
demonstrate ingenuity. The government has already initiated 
serious discussions on the issue with the provinces and the 
private sector. It has also launched many initiatives that have 
allowed it to transform itself into an innovative, flexible 
organization that is ready to face today's market and the market 
of tomorrow.
<P>
	Therefore I feel I must defend the interests of a sector that is 
so important to me. Consequently I urge the members of the 
House to reject Motion No. 314.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with a great 
deal of pleasure that I rise in the House today in support of the 
motion of my colleague and friend, the member for Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre.
<P>
	I do not think I need to spend a lot of time explaining why 
overlap and duplication are not good. We talk about that all the 
time in the House. My colleagues have dealt with or will deal 
with various issues concerning jurisdictional problems that 
exist in the agricultural industry at this time. However there is 
one aspect of the matter that I want to discuss in the time allotted 
to me today, that is the general thrust of the bill.
<P>
	Members of the House have heard me refer on many occasions 
to the recent observation by the Auditor General that there is 
widespread failure in our national government to carry out 
proper evaluation of legislation. We see a problem; we pass a 
law. We see another problem; we pass another law and so on. We 
never ask ourselves whether the problems we see are the sorts of 
things that can be solved by legislation at all. Often they are not. 
Nor do we really ask ourselves whether it is the right piece of 
legislation. Often it is not. The old line parties all too often fail 
to ask whether many of our problems are not the result of 
legislation in the first place and not a lack of legislation.
<P>
	During the debate on any given bill the government says it is a 
good bill and the oppositions say it is not a good bill. However 
the government, having more members, will make sure that it 
passes in the House. The government keeps on saying it is a good 
bill and the opposition keeps on saying it is bad. Neither of them 
says how it should be measured.
<P>
	When another election comes along both sides promise a lot 
more laws to solve a lot more problems, real or imaginary. 
However how often do say they will get rid of a law? I leave 
aside the promises of current government members to abrogate 
NAFTA or eliminate the GST because by now everybody knows 
they were just kidding. That is what I am supposed to say.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The result is that we keep getting more laws. We do not revisit 
them. Government bills on the whole ought to contain sunset 
clauses. Every law should have a sunset clause that would 
require it to cease to exist after five years unless it was 
specifically reauthorized. That would mean that Parliament 
would spend a lot less time passing new laws because it would 
be too busy re-passing old ones.
<P>
	It would be good because it would be much easier for 
government to get rid of a law that had been a mistake if it could 
just quietly not re-pass it. It would be a lot easier than having to 
stand and say: ``Gee, we goofed. We are sorry'', which is what it 
would have to do now. I am in favour of a sunset clause because I 
do not believe that we need a whole horde of laws, certainly not a 
whole horde of new ones. We need to get rid of some old ones.
<P>
	For instance, we were saved forever from scary guns that go 
bang by drastic gun controls in the 1970s. Now we are 
considering even more drastic gun control legislation. Should 
we instead be pondering whether to bother re-enacting the old 
law or whether the whole  enterprise should be scrapped? Maybe 
we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10973"> 10973 </A></B>
<P>
should stop measuring political success by the number of laws 
passed and start measuring it by their quality.
<P>
	American humorist P. J. O'Rourke talked about this point in 
his book entitled ``Parliament of Whores''. After quoting the 
purposes of the U.S. constitution, which are ``to form a more 
perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, 
provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, 
and secure the blessings of a liberty to ourselves and our 
posterity'', he asks: ``Are we done yet? When can we quit 
passing laws and raising taxes? When can we say of our political 
system let's stick a fork in it and see if it is done?''
<P>
	Our federal government exists to provide peace, order and 
good government. That is a bit of circle, a government that 
exists to produce good government. When can we stick a fork in 
the government and say stop passing laws; we have enough and 
they are the right ones? The essential first step would be to stop 
passing new laws all the time and start spending some of our 
time evaluating the old ones.
<P>
	I urge the House to support Motion No. 314. Let us stick a fork 
in our agricultural policy and ask whether it is done. If it is not 
thoroughly cooked, let us ask if it is even cooking. Let us make 
sure we have not put a roast in a shoe box instead of an oven. Let 
us start evaluating our laws to see if they are working and 
abolish or replace old ones that do not work before we pass new 
ones. Let us start right here with this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should like 
to make a few comments on Motion No. 314 sponsored by the 
member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre.
<P>
	I will use my time in the debate to discuss how the federal 
government has been working closely with the provinces, 
municipalities and industry to develop a new Canadian food 
inspection system responsive to consumers and industry.
<P>
	We set out to achieve common standards in legislation and 
delivery for food safety and quality at all levels of government. 
At the same time we are committed to maintaining the high 
safety standards Canadians have come to expect. Our high 
national standards and systems have ensured that Canadians 
from coast to coast enjoy a food supply among the safest in the 
world.
<P>
	The standards earn Canada a quality reputation that often 
provides Canadian industry with a competitive advantage in 
international markets. Our current food inspection systems 
involve all levels of government and their regulatory 
organizations. As a result, there is some evidence of duplication 
of inspection services.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	For someone in the food industry there is nothing more 
irritating than to be visited by two or three inspectors from 
different levels of government, and  worse still from different 
departments of the same government.
<P>
	This is what the federal and provincial governments, in 
conjunction with industry, are trying to correct with the 
Canadian food inspection system.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has already entered into 
pilot projects for sharing inspection responsibilities with a 
number of provinces. The department is negotiating with other 
provinces, and arrangements will provide for one agency to be 
responsible for inspection in any given plan.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Health Canada and other 
federal departments involved in food inspection are working 
with provincial agriculture and health officials, representatives 
of municipal authorities and agri-food industry representatives 
to develop a new Canadian food inspection system, a system 
with common approaches and standards and an emphasis on 
efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
	The benefits of a Canada food inspection system would be to 
streamline delivery of inspection services and to enhance 
market performance and industry competitiveness. Progress is 
being made in eliminating duplication in food inspection and we 
expect to have a fully integrated system in place in the near 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger): </B>Before we resume debate, 
I note that the hon. member for Jonquière would have liked to 
participate. But we must go back to the opening statements on 
Motion M-314, on February 13, 1995. The hon. member for 
Lotbinière asked for unanimous consent and said: ``I will be the 
only speaker during the three-hour debate''. I then replied: 
``-as the only spokesperson from the Bloc Quebecois on this 
bill-''
<P>
	There might have been some confusion, but since the House 
gave its unanimous consent to the hon. member for Lotbinière, 
in all justice, I must also request unanimous consent to allow the 
hon. member for Jonquière to participate in this debate.
<P>
	Are there any questions? At this time, I clearly state that I 
must ask the question to the House and obtain unanimous 
consent before I grant leave the hon. member for Jonquière to 
participate. There had been a commitment and the House had 
given its unanimous consent.
<P>
	If I may explain more clearly, for government members, 
unanimous consent was requested by a Bloc Quebecois member 
who had prepared a twenty-minute speech and wanted to deliver 
it in full, even though the time limit was ten minutes. The House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10974"> 10974 </A></B>
<P>
gave its unanimous consent to the Bloc member and, at the same 
time, according to me, the hon. member for Lotbinière stated 
clearly that he would be the only member to participate in the 
three-hour debate on that motion.
<P>
	Therefore, the House must give unanimous consent for the 
hon. member for Jonquière to participate in this debate today. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Jonquière.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to be part of the debate on the motion introduced by the 
hon. member for Moose Jaw-Lake Center and to support it.
<P>
	The hon. member suggests in his motion that the government 
immediately pursue negotiations with the provinces in order to 
re-assign jurisdictional responsibilities in agriculture and 
eliminate overlap. I support the motion because since I have 
been in politics, I have always been very critical of overlap in 
various areas in Canada.
<P>
	The Reform member has realized that overlap is harmful to 
agriculture and probably to the whole Canadian economy, then I 
am happy to see that he has woken up, at least in that area.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	On the other side, it is ironic that a member of the Reform 
Party-which often claims to support Canadian federalism and 
refuses to see that there is an urgent need for a change in 
federalism, if it were possible-would introduce such a 
proposal. This is the kind of speech we have heard for a long 
time in Quebec, whether in the 1950s under Mr. Duplessis, in the 
1960s under Mr. Lesage, and Mr. Lévesque who was a minister 
under the Liberal administration of Mr. Lesage in the 1970s. All 
nationalists in Quebec have opposed jurisdictional overlap in 
Canada and have used that argument to defend the idea that 
Quebec should become sovereign. Jurisdiction would then be 
clear and everyone would know exactly who is responsible for 
what.
<P>
	I find ironic that a member of the Reform Party, which stands 
as a supporter of Canadian federalism, would present such a 
motion. Perhaps it means that it is possible that the Reform 
Party can one day reassess Canadian federalism. At the same 
time, I think it shows the Reform members' naivety. We have 
learned from experience in Quebec that, in matters of 
jurisdiction, the federal government never gives in.
<P>
	During the 1960s and 1970s-I am not going back to the turn 
of the century here-, at a time of intense discussions on 
jurisdiction, the federal government was asked to get out of 
jurisdictions which are clearly the provinces'. It always refused 
because it views constitutional matters from its perspective of 
imperialistic federalism.
<P>
	The federal government is held, by federalists, to be 
responsible for everything that goes on in Canada, to be entitled 
to intervene in any field where Canadians may have interests, no 
matter who has jurisdiction or what the constitution says. Every 
time that the Quebec government or Quebecers have addressed 
the federal government to point out that its jurisdiction had 
clearly been violated, the federal government, without denying 
that the Canadian constitution does not give it jurisdiction in a 
given sector, has relied on its spending power to intervene.
<P>
	So, it uses its spending power to intervene in education, 
health, agriculture, manpower, in all fields about which 
provinces have protested, because Quebec is not alone in 
protesting against the central government's encroachments. 
Over the years, various provinces in Canada have defended their 
rights with the same results. It is always under its spending 
power that the federal government has intervened in provincial 
fields of jurisdiction.
<P>
	In a sense, this was to be expected. Canada was built on a 
duality, on the fact that there are two peoples in Canada. Over 
the years, the federal government has grown. Other provinces 
were created and, in 1982, we found ourselves with a Canada 
made up of ten provinces, all of them having the same rights. Of 
course, Quebec rejected this unilateral change in the rules of the 
game. But the federal government, supported by the Supreme 
Court, proceeded to revamp the constitution. At that point, 
Quebec was, I would say, morally excluded from Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	That is why my support for the Reform Party's proposal is in 
line with the demands and philosophy of the nationalists in 
Quebec. At one time, in the nineteenth century, many Quebecers 
saw a future in Canadian federalism based to some extent on 
national duality. They were disappointed. We saw the federal 
government encroach on our jurisdictions. We saw Canada 
define itself without us. And this year, we fully intend to act 
accordingly.
<P>
	We want to become a sovereign country, to ensure that our 
rights are defended as they should be, and that the Quebec 
government is able to intervene in all areas, in our best interests. 
In the longer term, we want the people of Quebec who have been 
around for centuries in Canada, who tried Canadian federalism 
and were disappointed, we want the people of Quebec to 
continue as such for centuries to come, to preserve their identity 
and take their place among the nations of this world.
<P>
	Proposals like the Reform Party's motion confirm that our 
analysis of Canadian federalism is the right one, and we are 
increasingly convinced that the option we have proposed, which 
is to establish in North America a sovereign, French-speaking 
state, will mark the end of all these constitutional squabbles that 
are so counterproductive in Canada and Quebec and create a  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10975"> 10975 </A></B>
<P>
political and economic situation that is not in the best interests 
of the people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak on the motion of the hon. member for 
Moose Jaw-Lake Centre on jurisdictional responsibilities in 
agriculture.
<P>
	The federal government shares the view of the hon. member 
that we must constantly strive to eliminate overlap and 
duplication between areas of government jurisdiction. We must 
also ensure the public sector is directing its resources 
appropriately and for the greatest possible benefit to Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	These are priorities for our government. As my colleagues 
pointed out during debate on this motion in February, we have 
been working to these ends since the day we took office.
<P>
	Given the tight fiscal restraints facing all levels of 
government it is quite clear that the key to the continued success 
of those and other efforts to support our agriculture and 
agri-food section will be co-operation; all stakeholders in the 
agri-food section working together toward common goals. It 
sounds like a dream in this Parliament but we will try.
<P>
	We must first define a shared long term vision for the sector. 
We can then determine the appropriate role for each partner in 
making these goals a reality and adjust our programs and 
policies accordingly. That is exactly what the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has done.
<P>
	Last September the minister put forward a vision for the 
future of Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector, where we 
want to be in the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and beyond. He has 
invited all agri-food stakeholders to help refine that vision and 
develop a business plan to bring it to reality.
<P>
	The vision which has been well supported by agri-food 
stakeholders across the country is for a growing, competitive, 
market oriented agriculture and agri-food sector; a sector that is 
profitable and responds to the changing food and non-food 
needs of domestic and international customers; one generally 
less dependent on government financial support and helps 
sustain a good quality of life in rural communities; a sector 
founded on farm financial security, environmental 
sustainability and a safe, high quality food supply. The federal 
government has built further on that vision in the 1995 federal 
budget while also ensuring that the agri-food programs and 
policies are consistent with current fiscal realities.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Under the budget the government will change the western 
grain transportation system to encourage greater efficiency and 
more market responsiveness; diminish transportation and other 
subsidies that distort production and marketing decisions; 
revamp the safety net system so farmers are less dependent on 
government dollars for  their incomes and so we are not open to 
countervail by Canada's international trading partners.
<P>
	We must emphasize adaptation, trade, marketing and rural 
development to ensure continued growth in all regions of the 
country. We must involve the private sector more directly in 
government research and inspection activities.
<P>
	In addition, as a result of the recent budget decisions, 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's budget will be reduced 
from $2.1 billion in this fiscal year to $1.7 billion over the next 
three years, a net reduction of 19 per cent.
<P>
	The department will be implementing new ways of organizing 
activities to improve efficiency and maintain the level of service 
to the public. It will amalgamate and privatize a range of 
programs to save costs and improve efficiency. The 
department's workforce will decline by about 18 per cent over 
the next three years, a reduction of over 2,000 positions.
<P>
	The staff reductions to be carried out at Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada are substantial. It is very important to make 
sure they are viewed in the proper perspective.
<P>
	In introducing Motion No. 314 last month, the member for 
Moose Jaw-Lake Centre stated that in Canada at this time there 
is one public sector employee working in agriculture for every 
14 farms, or one person on the public payroll for every 19 farm 
operators.
<P>
	I would not argue with the hon. member's arithmetic, but it is 
important to note that the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food is not solely devoted to supporting Canada's primary 
agriculture sector. The department and its employees are 
involved in nearly all aspects of agri-food business, from farm 
inputs such as machinery and fertilizer to processing and 
packaging to inspect and retail.
<P>
	This is an extremely large and complex industry, accounting 
for some 18 per cent of Canada's GDP and directly and 
indirectly employing 1.8 million people, or some 15 per cent of 
the Canadian workforce. All 27 million Canadians benefit from 
our inspection systems to ensure the safety of the food we eat.
<P>
	In considering the future, I do not think it is useful to compare 
apples and oranges or to consider one sector of the industry in 
isolation from others.
<P>
	It is critically important that we ensure that the changes ahead 
help build toward our overall vision for the agriculture and 
agri-food sector. Industry stakeholders must move forward 
together in a co-ordinated and co-operative manner so that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10976"> 10976 </A></B>
<P>
can take full advantage of our unique strengths and we do not 
waste our limited resources by duplicating each others efforts.
<P>
	To those ends, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-food 
has extensive consultations planned or already under way in 
areas such as marketing, safety nets, grain transportation and the 
use of the new adaptation funds announced in the budget.
<P>
	We will also be continuing our efforts with the provinces to 
amalgamate services in areas such as farm lending, trade and 
market development, inspection and industry adaptation.
<P>
	The conclusion of the new GATT agreement last year and the 
announcement in last month's budget have resolved many 
longstanding uncertainties for Canada's agri-food sector and 
have helped to set a more definitive course for its future. As well 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food has been working to 
develop shared long term goals for the sector and a plan for how 
to achieve them.
<P>
	It is moving ahead with those efforts in a co-operative, 
forward manner and not by initiating a new process to 
completely reshuffle the jurisdictional deck, as proposed by the 
hon. member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, that we can best 
ensure the future growth and security in the agri-food sector and 
the most effective use of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	For those reasons I must vote against this motion and 
encourage other members to do the same.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are debating a motion that should be addressed by 
every natural resource in Canada, how to eliminate the overlap 
among three major forces, namely industry, and provincial and 
federal governments.
<P>
	I have given this matter considerable thought due to my role 
as forestry critic for the Reform Party of Canada. Today I want 
to address my remarks primarily to what I believe should be the 
federal government's unique role regarding agriculture.
<P>
	Agriculture is important in my riding of 
Okanagan-Shuswap, employing nearly 6 per cent of the 
workforce in the north Okanagan regional district and 4.5 per 
cent in the Columbia Shuswap regional district.
<P>
	Central and northern Okanagan has 2,252 farms, producing 
last year 21,000 pigs, plus 3.46 million chickens and 2.3 million 
dozens of eggs.
<P>
	In addition to B.C. cattlemen, we have dairymen producing 
milk from some 5,850 dairy cows. Part of the milk goes to the 
major brand name cheese in my neighbouring town of 
Armstrong. Chicken processing is also important with Colonial 
Farms handling five million chickens in 1994. We also have 
local hatcheries, seed companies and feed mills.
<P>
	Small scale and home business suppliers are becoming the 
mainstay of farmers' markets like the one at Vernon with 180 
members drawing big crowds every Tuesday and Thursday, 
excluding the winter months.
<P>
	Perhaps the most obvious agricultural aspect of life in the 
Okanagan and our entire region of British Columbia are the 
2,000 tree fruit growers that employ over 5,000 people on farms 
plus 2,500 in packing houses and support industries. Direct 
returns to the B.C. fruit industry include annual sales exceeding 
$140 million, generating over $700 million in B.C. economic 
activity. Even at the north end of the commercial tree fruit 
activity, the Vernon area has 3,270 acres of orchards, mostly in 
McIntosh and Spartan apples.
<P>
	Those orchards of blooming trees every spring transform the 
rolling hills of the 200-kilometre long Okanagan valley into a 
kind of beauty one must see to believe. It is a big tourist draw.
<P>
	In round figures, the Okanagan valley supplies 100 per cent of 
Canada's apricots, 39 per cent of its plums and prunes, 38 per 
cent of its sweet and sour cherries and 34 per cent its apples.
<P>
	Of course Canadian consumers also buy fruit originating 
outside Canada. On the west coast during Christmas holidays 
people eat tons of Japanese oranges. That was one of the 
surprises of my coming to Ottawa, finding Christmas oranges 
called Clementines coming from Spain and Morocco.
<P>
	I mention these points to lead into the fact that agriculture 
today is experiencing an earthquake in changes regarding the 
very foundations of trade.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade gave a speech March 14 
in Australia. He mentioned the many recent developments, 
including the birth of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	The Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum has agreed 
to reach free trade among its developed economies by the year 
2010 and free trade among its developing economies 10 years 
later. The countries of the entire western hemisphere have set 
the year 2005 as their target for free trade. Therefore 10 to 15 
years from now, Canadian farmers will be marketing their 
products in a totally free trade environment.
<P>
	When the movement of goods, of capital and ideas was 
limited to the speed of a sailing ship or a camel caravan, 
individual rulers could hope to run their countries in whatever 
fashion their local people would tolerate. Today, technological 
innovations are rebuilding the world of trade from the bottom 
up. Children in our schools are logging on to the Internet and 
learning to communicate almost instantly with people all across 
the planet.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10977"> 10977 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	If a supplier cannot get the desired product quickly, reliably 
and at a reasonable price from one farmer, he not only can ask 
the neighbouring farm, he can even phone or fax the 
neighbouring country or even the neighbouring continent.
<P>
	As an illustration of what is happening in international trade, 
the March 10 issue of ``Export News'' listed some coming 
agricultural events: Foodaworld `95, the third international food 
processing systems fair; the 11th international ice cream show; 
the third international bakery show. None of these international 
events in agriculture or in agri-food is taking place either here, 
in Europe or North America. China, Turkey and Argentina are 
the places.
<P>
	International trade in agriculture is a far cry from the day 
when Sir Walter Raleigh told Queen Elizabeth I of England that 
natives in the new world were growing a peculiar leaf so they 
could roll it up and smoke it.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports free trade and has supported it for 
many years. However, we also demand that free trade mean fair 
trade. The federal government must work for a level playing 
field.
<P>
	During these transition years there will be many international 
disputes involving natural resources; some because of short 
supply like the current fish war with Spain. Many other trade 
disputes will involve claims like the apple dumping dispute last 
year in which many Canadian growers faced bankruptcy because 
the dispute settlement mechanisms involved a delay far too long 
for something as fragile as apples.
<P>
	No body but the federal government can straighten out these 
international trade disputes and ensure that dispute settlement 
mechanisms built into all our free trade agreements provide 
adequate protection for Canadian growers.
<P>
	The federal government must assign top quality people to 
handle all agricultural trade disputes which certainly lie ahead 
for our nation.
<P>
	I see this international trade expansion as being the primary 
and permanent role of the federal government regarding 
agriculture.
<P>
	A second federal role derives from the first one. In recent 
years the dismantling of the Berlin wall has become a symbol of 
what will happen to our farm marketing boards. Quotas, tariffs 
and subsidies to farmers will certainly soon become as rare as 
grand-daddy's pocket watch. International free trade will 
require them to come apart brick by brick just like the Berlin 
wall.
<P>
	Farmers must be assisted in making the transition from 
Canada's old supply managed economy to the fast paced world 
of free trade. Farmers' voices must be the ones heard when 
government asks how to proceed. Monopolistic and 
non-democratic groups made up of government appointees such 
as the Canadian Wheat  Board will become as outdated as the old 
steam thresher parked at Three Valley Gap's ghost town in my 
riding of Okanagan-Shuswap.
<P>
	Therefore, the federal government must not only negotiate 
well to start with, it also must provide gradually reducing 
income support for farmers being hit by these changes.
<P>
	It has been the position of the Reform Party that Canada must 
move to free and fair trade and that policies and programs to 
support the agricultural sector during this transition must be 
developed by the federal government.
<P>
	A third role for the federal government in agriculture flows 
from the unpleasant probability that worldwide free trade may 
reduce suppliers to the least common denominator. By that I 
mean that if agricultural workers in any one nation can be forced 
to handle toxic agri-chemicals, agricultural workers around the 
world will suffer.
<P>
	It is a sad fact that agricultural workers in the United States 
today suffer from the highest incidence of skin cancer in North 
America. They have the highest exposure to toxic industrial 
chemicals used as herbicides and pesticides. Agricultural 
workers need protection. Treaties must be negotiated to ban 
toxic agri-chemicals and encourage environmentally safer 
controls. Therefore, the federal government must do essential 
testing, precommercial research and regulating regarding 
chemicals.
<P>
	Consumers around the world also must be protected regarding 
honest labels accurately listing all agri-food ingredients. 
Therefore, the Canadian government and all national 
governments must strive to achieve international agreements 
about safety in the agricultural workplace as well as consumer 
protection standards and enact the needed regulations to support 
the treaties.
<P>
	These areas should summarize the federal government's long 
term role in agriculture: negotiating treaties and settling 
conflicts arising from the movement toward worldwide free 
trade; negotiating and legislating necessary protection both in 
the agricultural workplace and in the production facilities, 
advertising and labelling for agri-food.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	I see a temporary role for federal income support for farmers 
and growers. It would assist them in adjusting to moving away 
from the supply managed protectionist kind of trading, and I do 
mean temporary.
<P>
	First and foremost, according to the Constitution natural 
resources fall under provincial jurisdiction. My personal wish 
would be to greatly downsize the federal role in all natural 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10978"> 10978 </A></B>
<P>
resources and therefore reduce the burden on the people caused 
by excessive regulation and taxation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am rising today to speak against Motion No. 314.
<P>
	Let me begin by reminding members of this House that 
according to the hon. member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, and 
I quote: ``Motion No. 314 is based on the premise that it is time 
to examine not only how government works but also what 
government does''. I agree with him because our budget of 
February 27 represents perhaps the most fundamental 
rethinking of how government can work better for Canadians.
<P>
	The motion presented to the House also proposes that the 
government pursue negotiations with the provinces and the 
agri-food industry in order to reassign jurisdictional 
responsibilities in agriculture and eliminate overlap and 
duplication. I also agree with that. I agree with him because the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has in fact worked 
effectively with his provincial colleagues over the past 16 
months to reduce overlap and duplication in the inspection and 
financial services for the agri-food sector. Those are just two 
examples among many others.
<P>
	It is ironic that the proposals in Motion No. 314 to reduce 
overlap and duplication themselves duplicate to a certain extent 
the work this government has already initiated since it took 
office. If the hon. member's proposals were to be implemented, 
federal spending would be increasingly directed to price support 
and income stabilization.
<P>
	While the government recognizes that stabilization is very 
important to Canadian producers, spending on research and 
market development have been shown to generate significantly 
higher returns on investment. We have clearly demonstrated in 
the last few months and with the 1995 budget that this is the road 
we have taken and intend to follow for the benefit of Canada's 
agriculture and agri-food sector.
<P>
	Stabilization measures are important to agriculture, but we 
are finding that stabilization is most effectively done in a cost 
sharing partnership with the provinces, not by one level of 
government alone. It has not resulted in overlap and duplication 
but instead has led to a co-operative approach which better 
meets the needs of producers.
<P>
	Thus, I strongly believe that Motion No. 314 is irrelevant at 
this time. I must urge the members of this House to reject it. It 
would only duplicate what this government, the provincial 
authorities and the industry are already doing together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured 
to rise today to address the motion before us by my colleague, 
the hon. member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre. Before I get into 
the things I plan to say, I would like to take a few seconds to 
address my hon. colleagues, particularly those in the Bloc party.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the speech given by the member for 
Jonquière. He expressed surprise that the Reform Party was 
promoting a motion such as this. I assure him this should come 
as no surprise.
<P>
	I believe the issue we are facing with respect to the federal 
government in Ottawa is probably very similar for three groups: 
those in the west where the Reform Party is now the strongest; 
those in the province of Quebec; and those farther east. Because 
of their geographical location and special circumstances, they 
feel somehow left out of the federal government except when the 
federal government intrudes where we do not want it to intrude.
<P>
	I say to all members and particularly those from the province 
of Quebec and the people they represent that the difference is 
that they have given up on federalism. I am so sad about that. 
They have decided that Canada is no longer a place where they 
are welcome and they want out. That is the message I think I hear 
correctly from them. The difference between them and us is that 
we want in. We want to be part of the Canadian federation, but 
we do want it to work better.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign a number of people in my 
area were sporting bumper stickers on their cars which read: My 
Canada includes Quebec. We think of the people across this 
entire country as our fellow citizens, as our brothers and sisters. 
We invite them to try once again to make Confederation work, to 
work together with us rather than trying to separate and divide 
the country.
<P>
	In this regard, I had a short conversation with a person not 
long ago who asked: ``What is the matter with those people in 
Quebec?'' I told him that the problem was not Quebec, but that 
the problem was Ottawa. After talking about it for a bit we 
decided that was probably true.
<P>
	The federal government, by overly utilizing its spending 
power has intruded on areas of provincial jurisdiction. Members 
here are focusing on a problem that we really do need to address 
and solve.
<P>
	Getting back to what we are here for, this private member's 
motion addresses this question. It says that we want to represent 
Canadian people in the very best way.
<P>
	Once again, if I can indulge in a short analysis, I look at it in 
the following way: We have around 28 to 29 million Canadians. 
Many Canadians, over 250,000, are farmers. We have a 
relationship between farmers and the rest of Canadians. Strictly 
speaking, neither the farmers nor other Canadians are terribly 
interested in which level of government is regulating their lives, 
controlling their actions and reducing their freedom.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10979"> 10979 </A></B>
<P>
	I get the message over and over again that Canadians want a 
devolution of power nearer to the people. Too many people feel 
disenfranchised. They feel powerless to have anybody hear them 
on any issue. That ranges all the way from taxation, which keeps 
going up, up, up even with this government, to gun control, 
which is a very important issue in our area, to agriculture, where 
the federal government intrudes into an area where there is no 
jurisdictional warrant for it.
<P>
	This does not need to be said. We all know how important it is 
that we have a strong agricultural industry. All one needs to do is 
to read some history to recognize that any country which 
becomes dependent upon outsiders for its food supply is 
extremely vulnerable.
<P>
	We could all live for a minute or so without air. I agree with 
the environmentalists who say we should keep our air clean. We 
could live for maybe a week or so without water. I agree with the 
environmentalists who say we should keep our water clean and 
safe.
<P>
	Depending on who the individual is, I am sure some members 
here would only live for a week or so without food, but some of 
us with larger bank accounts might last a little longer. We need 
to have a safe food supply and that is one thing we can have. It is 
such a privilege to live in this country where we have a plentiful 
and safe food supply. That comes from our agriculture and 
agri-food industry.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	If there is anything worth preserving in this country it is the 
strength of that industry because our very lives depend on it. Our 
freedom and our independence from other countries depend on 
it.
<P>
	How can we best arrange our affairs between the supplier, the 
producer, the farmer and the consumer, those other citizens who 
are eating the food being produced? We ought to reconsider and 
probably reject the premise that the federal government has to 
have a lot of involvement in it.
<P>
	The nearer one gets the regulation, the nearer one gets the 
subsidization if there is that, the nearer one gets the controls to 
the actual producers and consumers and the further one gets it 
away from Ottawa the better it is for the industry as a whole.
<P>
	That is not to say the federal government has nothing to do. 
That is the purpose of the bill. It asks us to carefully examine the 
areas where the federal government has a role, and there are 
some.
<P>
	To my hon. colleagues from Quebec, their separation is not in 
any way going to alter the necessity of having a relationship 
with the rest of North America. They have often said they would 
like to use our currency and have free movement across our 
borders. They have even mentioned they would like to use our 
passports. All they are saying is they recognize the need in our 
world to live together. They will have to live together in one 
system or  another which will require working together which 
will solve this.
<P>
	I am simply submitting in the most emphatic way I can that we 
need to return to provincial governments those areas of 
jurisdiction which are best served there. We need to retain in the 
federal area things like international trade, the rules of trade and 
the barriers toward movement of agricultural goods back and 
forth. Those are going to apply whether there is a different 
government there or not. There is an overriding government 
which will have to apply to these relationships.
<P>
	My appeal to the members is to support the bill because it 
would require us to look at those areas which should be devolved 
to provincial levels and to the private sector.
<P>
	One of the large weaknesses or hindrances of our present 
economy is there has been too much movement toward 
regulation by government away from the business people. This 
is very important.
<P>
	To quote the bumper sticker on my farmer brother's half-ton: 
``When you complain about farmers, don't talk with your mouth 
full''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
private member's bill presented by my colleague from the 
Reform Party is one we in the farm community feel very 
strongly about. It is an idea whose time has come.
<P>
	The federal government over the long haul has been in many 
areas of duplicity. Some of the areas the provincial government 
could probably handle better are agriculture, forestry and 
mining. This bill deals with agriculture but the principles 
involved would also apply to those other areas.
<P>
	As my colleague has said, there is also some sentiment in the 
Bloc for this division of powers and a little less power in our 
central government. This motion is very worthy of 
consideration of all of the House. I encourage members opposite 
to look very closely at this motion and to consider very strongly 
their support for it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., pursuant to order adopted on Thursday, 
March 23, 1995, this House stands adjourned until 9 a.m. on 
Saturday, March 25, 1995.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
