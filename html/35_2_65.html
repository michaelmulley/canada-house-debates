I recently visited the David Livingstone Elementary School in 
Vancouver and met with the very young but very bright students at 
their invitation.
<P>
	They are concerned that replica handguns and other weapons 
that are astonishingly realistic are readily available in local 
convenience stores. Such replica guns have been used in hold-ups 
and similar acts of violence. Police officers report that in crisis 
situations they have been unable to distinguish them from the real 
thing.
<P>
	The David Livingstone Elementary students want the federal 
government to ban the importation, sale and manufacture of all 
such replica guns in Canada. They have put together a petition of 
more than 2,000 names which I have passed on to the Minister of 
National Revenue for consideration.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, from 
July 5 to 14, the international community will meet in 
Drummondville, the major centre in my riding, for the World 
Folklore Festival where, for 10 days, over 1,000 artists 
representing 20 countries will delight the crowds with all the 
charms and treasures of folk arts and traditions.
<P>
	In 15 years, the World Folklore Festival has become the largest 
of its kind in the world. The festival, which now attracts 1 million 
visitors a year, owes its huge success mostly to the 2,500 volunteers 
who run it.
<P>
	I invite all my colleagues in Parliament and their constituents to 
come to Drummondville's glorious fair between July 5 and 14 to 
celebrate the world and its cultural wealth.

Healthy Environment Awards program. Four of those finalists were 
from my riding of Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	Verna Hall, Tim Roark and Charles Young from Maple Ridge 
were finalists in the arts, media and communications category.
<P>
	I especially want to recognize Sarah MacEachern, of Maple 
Ridge Secondary School for winning the top award for Canada. Her 
achievements?
<P>
	Sarah produced a video entitled ``For all Living Things'' and 
sent it to all elementary schools.
<P>
	In grade 9 she co-chaired and in grade 10 she chaired the 
school's Global Awareness Club. This club is so active it won the 
Minister of the Environment Award for British Columbia.
<P>
	Sarah has organized earth weeks, guest speakers, recycling 
programs in the cafeteria, composting in the schools, raised money 
for Christmas food banks and planted many trees. Sarah was also a 
member of the Youth for Global Awareness Conference provincial 
planning committee.
<P>

the environment is.

was referred to a committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4068"> 4068 </A></B>
<P>
	One thing I would like to put on the record having discussed 
this with a number of people who work on the railroad, 
particularly locomotive engineers, is the need for the legislation 
to address, if it does not now do so and I do not think it does, 
the need for double arms at controlled railway crossings. At 
present our railway crossings have a single arm but in Europe 
there are two on either side which prevent people from running 
through. As a result, a lot fewer people are killed trying to run 
through railway crossings.
<P>
	This is something we should look at for this country. Fixing up 
these railway crossings would create short term jobs and in the end 
it would save a lot of Canadian lives. I recommend this measure to 
the committee.

you know that in my riding this year many Quebecers will have to 
watch the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade on television?
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	The fact is that, this year, the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste has 
invited only Quebecers not wearing their national costumes to take 
part in the June 24 parade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My friends, we are all welcome, but only if we leave our foreign 
costumes at home. Take off your saris, remove your boubous and 
your lederhosen and pull on your wool sweaters.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as reported by the Armenian newspaper <I>Abaka</I> in 
Montreal, on April 24, 1996 Yvan Bordeleau, Liberal MNA for 
l'Acadie, was refused the consent of the  Pequiste government to 
introduce a motion to commemorate the 81st anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide of 1915.
<P>
	This unfortunate decision ends a 16-year old tradition in the 
National Assembly of Quebec. Ironically on the 81st anniversary of 
the Armenian genocide, the Parliament of Canada unanimously 
passed a historic resolution that will see the week of April 20 to 27 
each year set aside to remember the victims of atrocities, 
inhumanities and genocide.
<P>
	I am appalled at the actions of the Pequiste government in failing 
to continue the tradition of recognizing the first genocide of the 
20th century.
<P>
	I call on the Bloc Quebecois members to encourage their 
colleagues in Quebec to once more recognize in an official way the 
anniversary of the Armenian genocide. It is time to put an end to 
this hypocrisy.

Mr. Ray Karlson.
<P>
	Yesterday Mr. Karlson, the superintendent for mail operations in 
Dauphin, Manitoba, received the Golden Postmark Award in 
recognition of outstanding contributions to Canada Post and his 
community.
<P>
	Fair, courteous, resourceful, compassionate and an all-around 
terrific boss are the words used to describe Mr. Karlson by his 
co-workers. Mr. Karlson is known for going above and beyond the 
call for employees and the people of Dauphin and area, whether it 
means coming in on weekends or delivering a parcel personally.
<P>
	Mail service is of crucial importance to rural areas. I would like 
to take this opportunity to salute Mr. Karlson and all Canada Post 
employees in rural Canada for their commitment to their jobs and 
communities. They deserve our stamp of approval.

Speaker, Trois-Pistoles has been shaped by over 300 years of 
history and presence in America, but it is also the site of the Basque 
adventure on this continent. The Basques, a people of proud sailors, 
started hunting whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the late 17th 
century. The ovens they used to melt blubber can still be seen on île 
aux Basques.

even named their regional county municipality RMC des Basques. 
I wish to congratulate the people behind this project. Knowing 
where we come from makes it easier to determine where we are 
going.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians know that you need a strong foundation to build a sturdy 
home.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade however is building his 
house on the shaky foundations of the federal export quota. The 
minister mistakenly believes that his recent lumber deal with the 
United States is helping the lumber industry. He hopes the 
Canadian lumber industry will provide him with the materials 
necessary for this construction. But even quality Canadian lumber 
will not be able to hold up this ill-conceived design.
<P>
	As a result of the minister's faulty construction, the lumber 
industry is suffering as lumber shipments have slowed to a crawl. 
Now, instead of dealing with the Americans who have been 
hacking away at our lumber exports, 2,600 Canadian companies are 
watching as their own government is taking an axe to the whole 
works.
<P>
	If the minister is serious about building a sturdy home fit for our 
Canadian climate, he had better design a new blueprint.

Ross of The Pas. Sonia was the second aboriginal woman to die 
violently in The Pas area in recent months, the first being Dorothy 
Martin who died on April 26.
<P>
	While both of these matters are now before the courts, the 
apparent circumstances raise serious questions about the safety of 
women in situations of domestic violence.

des Laurentides, in Québec-Est and in Brome-Missisquoi, we will 
commemorate Wilfrid Laurier's election victory as the first 
Quebecer to become Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	Remembering our roots 100 years later, on the eve of 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, is a fitting way to honour one of Canada's 
great Prime Ministers. He was the one who gave a definition of 
Canada that allows the Quebec Liberal Party and experienced 
politicians in Ottawa alike to talk today of ``two founding peoples 
forming one nation''.
<P>
	On the basis of the ten provinces, the five regions and-we will 
remember the right of veto-the two founding peoples and the 
nation they form, I state loud and clear in this House:

the workshop of a young Valcourt designer.
<P>
	On Bombardier's drawing boards, we can now find plans of 
Seadoos, high speed trains and business aircraft lying next to plans 
for the Skidoo that made Bombardier famous.
<P>
	At the stockholders' meeting held in Montreal yesterday, 
participants found out for themselves that vitality and innovation 
are indeed the driving force of this business, which brought in $7.1 
billion in revenues for fiscal year 1995.
<P>
	Company executives are working very hard to secure a contract 
worth $1 billion to build 50 regional aircraft.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great sadness that I rise to inform the House and all Canadians 
that yet another victim suffered a grievous assault last night. As the 
victim was respected and well regarded by members of this House, 
I feel that details of the assault ought to be made public so that we 
can all express our outrage at the injustice that was suffered.
<P>
	The deed was nasty, brutish and short. The attack stripped the 
victim of formerly sound and healthy features leaving only a 
mutilated shell. Then the perpetrators of this foul deed each made a 
solemn affirmation to not even report the sad result.
<P>
	Last night, Liberal members of the justice committee ruthlessly 
did away with Bill C-234 which would have eliminated early 
parole for first degree murderers. They left in its place Bill C-45, a 
pitiful and toothless caricature.
<P>
	Over the past several weeks the victim, Bill C-234, had provided 
hope and encouragement to many Canadians looking for greater 
truth and trustworthiness in sentencing. How sad that last night's 
attack replaced their hope with betrayal and senseless loss.

Mr. Speaker, the first ministers' conference begins tomorrow but, 
for some time already, we have been hearing comments from 
certain provinces regarding the content and the objectives of the

<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister clearly explained that, as far as he

turned into another last-ditch attempt, where participants would 
work until they dropped to renew Canadian federalism.
<P>
	The purpose of the meeting is to discuss and to settle concrete

create jobs, stimulate economic recovery and redefine social 
programs. This is the mandate the Prime Minister gave himself and

	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been a week since Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute said that 
Newfoundland was a morally bankrupt society and that 
Newfoundlanders do not even think to ask what they can do to 
solve their own problems, they ask what Ottawa can do for them.
<P>
	After a week of waiting there has been no apology from the 
Reform Party nor from Michael Walker, who himself is a 
Newfoundlander. I can only assume that all sitting members of the 
Reform Party endorse this statement of intolerance and feel that 
Newfoundlanders are not worthy of being Canadian.
<P>
	This is quite an attitude to have toward fellow Canadians for a 
party that has the audacity to call itself a government in waiting. I 
cannot imagine the devastation which that party would bring upon 
our nation if hon. colleagues opposite were some day to sit on this

	Once again, Mr. Speaker, I ask through you that the Reform 
Party apologize to the people of Newfoundland.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FIRSTMINISTERS'CONFERENCE">FIRST MINISTERS' CONFERENCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the eve of the first ministers' conference, we are 
discovering the intentions of the federal government little by little 
and we now know what will be on the conference agenda. The 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs confirmed yesterday that the 
conference agenda reflects choices made by the federal 
government.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister 
confirm that the federal government will be deciding on the agenda 
and on what will or will not be discussed with the provinces? Will 
he confirm that he alone will be setting the table?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the dinner will be held at 24 Sussex, it will be hard for 
me to have people from every province come and get the table 
ready. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4071"> 4071 </A></B>
<P>
provinces were in fact consulted. I myself have been speaking to 
the various  premiers over the past few weeks, to discuss subjects 
that might be raised.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has travelled around 
the country. He has talked with governments and made his report. 
We have prepared an agenda, and it will be the job of the meeting 
chair to prepare discussion. In general, the premiers were aware of 
the direction of discussions, and I think we will have more on the 
table than we can deal with in a day and a half.
<P>
	My relations with the premiers are generally fairly cordial, and if 
there is something urgent to discuss, we are prepared to do so, but 
there is more than enough on the agenda for a one day meeting and 
a dinner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Prime Minister acknowledge that, regardless of 
the subject chosen for discussion and the potential focus of 
decentralization, his approach and that of his government are 
always the same: the central government will always have the 
power to dictate national standards, to set broad guidelines, and the 
provincial governments will always be seen as playing a supporting 
role as administrator?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the Canadian Constitution, the jurisdictions are clear. In 
many areas, the provinces decide and do things that we do not 
approve of and we do not make a great song and dance of it every 
day.
<P>
	Under certain circumstances, when it is in the interest of all 
Canadians, as in the area of health, for example, we have five 
conditions that the provinces have accepted. A few weeks ago, the 
Government of Alberta was not prepared to go along with the 
notion that there should be no user fees. The Minister of Health 
persuaded the Government of Alberta, following discussions, to 
agree to the five conditions.
<P>
	These conditions are acceptable to both the provinces and the 
federal government, because they are in the interest of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is quite true that the Constitution sets out the areas of 
jurisdiction. The problem with Canadian federalism, however, is 
that the Prime Minister has this incredible propensity for getting 
into areas of jurisdiction that do not belong to him. That is the 
problem.
<P>
	The throne speech indicated that the government will not use its 
spending power without the approval of a majority of the provinces 
in a given sector.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister confirm that, if the majority of the 
provinces joined forces to ask the federal government to intervene 
in an area of provincial jurisdiction such as education, Quebec 
could opt out with full compensation only if it complied with the 
national  standards set by the majority of the provinces asking the 
federal government to intervene in this area?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, the question is purely hypothetical. There is no 
question of any intervention in the field of education at the 
moment. However, I think the federal government's statement is 
very clear.
<P>
	We have said we have no intention of interfering in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction without the consent of the 
majority of the provinces. Moreover, the provinces have the right 
to withdraw if they wish. Obviously the matter of compensation 
would be negotiated if we ever got to that point.
<P>
	At the moment, it is out of the question. We have said we do not 
want to do it any more. We will focus on our own programs and 
manage them well so we can ask the provinces to do the same in 
their jurisdictions.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, at a press conference on the occasion of his 
speech to the Ottawa-Carleton Economic Development 
Corporation, the Prime Minister expressed an interest in the 
creation of a national program jointly administered by the federal 
and provincial governments and aimed at improving the situation 
of disadvantaged children. Members will recall that this program 
was inspired by the work of the Ministerial Council on Social 
Policy Reform.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that this is an unprecedented 
centralizing offensive, with the federal government attempting to 
disguise under noble intentions a desire to grab control of all social 
problems, which are administered by the provinces and come under 
their exclusive jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, through tax incentives, the federal government assists in 
this area, and this was announced in the budget.
<P>
	I think the Minister of Finance has improved the system so as to 
use the taxation system to help the children of disadvantaged 
families who are at risk. This we have been doing for some time. 
The provincial governments have a similar system. They are asking 
if there might not be a possibility of our working together. This 
request originated with the provinces and I am prepared to sit down 
with provincial representatives.
<P>
	As you know, Bloc Quebecois members love to rant and rave in 
front of an audience, but they ought to know that it was the 
provinces which asked the federal government for this. If they do 
not want us to talk about it, I think the losers will be the 
disadvantaged children of Canada.

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given the way the federal government wishes to exercise 
its spending powers, and given the Prime Minister's response, are 
we to understand that Quebec, which never agreed to take part in 
this consensus with the other nine provinces, will have to conform 
to the standards set by Ottawa and the nine other provinces, if it 
wishes to obtain full and total compensation in pulling out of this 
program?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will discuss that. We are in the field. We already have 
some tax incentives to help poor families provide for their children. 
Some provinces have similar programs and they would like to talk 
with us.
<P>
	I know that the people of Quebec, not the Bloc Quebecois, would 
like all governments to work together to have a better society in 
Canada and in Quebec at the same time.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister said that job creation would 
be the number one priority at the first ministers' conference. The 
key to job creation is not public works projects but genuine tax 
relief.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House when government ministers were asked 
why tax relief was not front and centre on the agenda of the first 
ministers' conference, they had no explanation.
<P>
	If job creation is one of the Prime Minister's top priorities, why 
is tax relief not high on the agenda of the first ministers' 
conference?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at this time the priority is to eliminate the deficit both at 
provincial and federal levels.
<P>
	I would like to read to the leader of the third party what was said 
by the member for Capilano-Howe Sound who argued recently at 
the Reform convention in Vancouver that there should not be tax 
cuts until the deficit is eliminated. At the same meeting the 
member for Calgary Centre said that a proposal for cutting taxes at 
this time was ``voodoo economics''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a problem. 
I do not know who is on the side of voodoo in that party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister had read a little further he would 
know that if the Reform taxpayers' budget had  been implemented 
in 1993 his government would have a surplus next year and be in a 
position to offer tax relief.
<P>
	Four months ago in this House the Prime Minister admitted that 
governments do not create jobs. Yesterday he revisited the idea of 
an infrastructure program run by government as the principal 
instrument of job creation.
<P>
	The government seems unable to grasp the 1990s principle of job 
creation that a dollar left in the pocket of a taxpayer creates better 
and more jobs than that dollar in the pocket of the finance minister.
<P>
	Instead of committing billions of dollars to another temporary 
infrastructure program, has the government ever seriously 
considered how many real jobs would be created by a multibillion 
dollar federal tax cut?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few weeks ago I was in the beautiful city of Calgary. The 
mayor of Calgary and the mayors of all the cities of Canada were 
congratulating this government for the initiative two years ago to 
have a good infrastructure program. In doing that a lot of things 
have been repaired, restored and ameliorated in Calgary and in all 
the cities of Canada.
<P>
	The mayors would like us to be there. We will discuss that with 
the premiers later this week. It has been a great success. We have 
managed to reduce the deficit and we have managed to reduce 
interest rates. With the good management of the financial affairs of 
the nation, the Canadian economy has managed to create 600,000 
jobs since the day we became the government.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	I think that is why the people in Hamilton two days ago made 
sure that the Reform Party and its policies finished fourth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's answer is straight out of the 1960s. 
We have 1.3 million people unemployed. We have two to three 
million people under employed. We have one out of four Canadians 
worried about their jobs.
<P>
	The Prime Minister does not have to talk to the House about 
creating jobs in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. He 
has to talk about creating jobs in the millions if he is going to 
address this question.
<P>
	I ask him again, and I will put it very simply. Has the federal 
government analysed-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Don't use big words, Preston. Remember 
who you are dealing with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Has the federal government analysed how many 
real jobs could be created by a federal tax cut? Yes or no.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to tell the leader of the third party that-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> The fourth party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> The fourth party, yes, that is so. 
It is very confusing these days. The fourth party, I mean.
<P>
	I remember that the sixties were not that bad. I was a member of 
Parliament and the premier of Alberta was Mr. Manning. In those 
days Albertans were bragging about what a good government we 
had in Alberta and in Canada.
<P>
	We can do things the right way when we are making sure that we 
can reduce the deficit but at the same time we can improve the 
infrastructure of the country which will be an improvement for 
generations to come. I think that is good economic policy and it is 
why the people of Canada prefer our policies to their voodoo 
policies.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister wants us to think that his first ministers' 
conference will make it possible to decentralize the federation. 
How could that be when, on the one hand, he is withdrawing 
partially from manpower training, and on the other, he is 
announcing his wish to be fully involved in the whole issue of 
social programs.
<P>
	Is that the Prime Minister's decentralization model, to withdraw 
partially from one jurisdiction in order to more easily take over 
another?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will be examining with the provinces a report 
presented by the provincial governments to the federal 
government. We think it is possible to improve the state of social 
programs and to ensure that they are available to all Canadians in 
the years to come.
<P>
	I think it is incumbent on all governments to speak to one 
another in order to ensure that the social safety net is there for the 
poorest members of our society today, tomorrow and for many 
years to come in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am going to give the Prime Minister another chance to 
answer my question. At the conference, he is getting ready to pull 
out of certain provincial areas of jurisdiction, provided he is 
allowed to take over securities.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister say that that is not his 
decentralization model-give with one hand and take with the 
other?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the national securities measure, as proposed by the 
Minister of Finance, is voluntary, and the provinces that wish to 
participate can participate, and those that do not, will not. I think 
this is a good way to ensure that we eliminate duplication, but those 
who like duplication can keep it.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The doubling of Canada pension plan premiums will result in a 
very significant pool of Canadian taxpayer retirement cash 
accumulating in the hands of government.
<P>
	What Canadian in his or her right mind would trust a government 
that has our country $600 billion in debt with the income for his or 
her retirement? Why should Canadians trust the government to 
manage their retirement income?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this question was discussed at considerable length during the very 
valuable consultation process that was undertaken by the federal 
chairman of the consultation process, David Walker, as he went 
across the country.
<P>
	It was discussed quite extensively yesterday with the finance 
ministers. There was general agreement that if such a fund were to 
be created, it would be managed best by a group of investment 
advisers on market principles at arm's length from the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is good news. I am sure Canadians would feel much 
more secure if the fund were made politician proof so that this huge 
fund of resources could not then become a slush fund for political 
parties or politicians.
<P>
	Following up on the response, will the 20 per cent investment 
rule be waived? Second, Canadians need to be assured that the 
retirement income of today's retirees and those who will retire in 
the immediate future will be protected. Those of us who are 
grandparents understand that our grandchildren should not pay a 
disproportionate share of both the national debt and retirement 
income.
<P>
	Has the government done any studies or background work on the 
impact of this fund on job creation and growth, particularly to those 
in the 20 to 45-year age group?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member asked a series of question and it is somewhat hard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4074"> 4074 </A></B>
<P>
to decipher exactly what he is driving  at. I believe he is trying to 
address a very important problem.
<P>
	There was discussion of the 20 per cent rule at the meeting. 
There were those who felt it should be waived, and others felt it 
should be maintained. Obviously this will be part of the ongoing 
discussion. The issue is whether there should be one set of rules for 
this fund and another set of rules for other pension funds. On the 
other side, of course, is the tremendous investment weight that this 
fund might have.
<P>
	That is the only one of the many questions the member asked. I 
am sure he will ask the others subsequently and I will answer them 
at that time.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, six provinces asked that the GST be listed on the agenda 
of the first ministers' conference. Yesterday, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs told us to wait for the results of the 
finance ministers' conference. Nothing has been settled, as the 
provinces' request was turned down by the federal Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	The Prime Minister put the securities commission on the agenda 
because, he said, the provinces asked him to. He also put social 
programs on the agenda, again because the provinces asked him to. 
Will the Prime Minister put the GST on the agenda because, once 
again, the provinces have asked him to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we discussed the GST issue yesterday. We also discussed other tax 
issues. It was a good discussion. There were differences of opinion, 
not only between the federal government and some of the provinces 
but also among the provinces themselves. That is quite normal.
<P>
	The issue was put on the agenda of the finance ministers' 
meeting at the provinces' request, and it is there that it should be 
discussed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance has just decided where the issue 
should be discussed, even though the provinces have asked that it 
be considered at the first ministers' conference. The minister has 
decided that it would not be discussed there.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Perhaps he is the boss.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Yes, perhaps he is the boss.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister state that economic issues are at the 
top of the agenda when he refuses to discuss the GST, which is 
nothing if not an economic issue, as it enriched federal coffers by 
close to $17 billion in 1995? How can they set aside such an 
important question and  try to convince people that economic 
issues are at the top of the agenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the GST was put on the agenda of the finance ministers' meeting, 
not because I asked for it, but at the provinces' explicit request. The 
finance ministers from Alberta and Quebec asked that it be 
discussed at the finance ministers' meeting, and that is what we 
did.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
heard that Canada pension plan premiums are to double over the 
next few years, which means the government will increase payroll 
taxes by another 5 per cent. The Minister of Finance has said 
payroll taxes kill jobs. Nevertheless, he is going ahead with this tax 
increase.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance explain to those people who cannot 
find a job why he intends to destroy their careers in order for him to 
achieve his Canada pension plan objectives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is unfortunate but it is a reality that in order to ensure the Canada 
pension plan will be there for succeeding generations, premiums 
will have to be increased. That is the view of not only the federal 
government but of the chief actuary, the vast majority of 
knowledgeable commentators and the view of each and every one 
of the provincial governments at the meeting yesterday.
<P>
	There is something else. The Reform Party has put forth its 
alternative plan. It ought to be very clearly understood that not only 
would that alternative plan of the Reform Party destroy the Canada 
pension plan as it is now, it would increase the premiums 
substantially above that which the ministers are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it may be a 
reality that Canada pension plan premiums have to go up but it is 
also a reality that the government taxes every Canadian at every 
opportunity it can. The GST has been harmonized and it is costing 
us billions. We have seen gasoline taxes go up and so on.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Finance get off the backs of the job 
creators, the small business people, cut spending, lower taxes and 
allow some tax room for the higher CPP premiums he is talking 
about?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the real question is when will the Reform Party stop talking out of 
both sides of its mouth?
<P>
	The Reform Party has proposed the decimation of all those 
initiatives which help small business. It has brought forth a budget 
which would make it impossible for small  business to develop new 
technologies. It has brought forth a budget which would make it 
impossible for small business to export. It has come up with a 
retirement savings plans which would impose a burden on small

<P>
	Speaking before an audience of business people yesterday, the 
Prime Minister announced his firm intention to invade the area of 
securities, an exclusive provincial jurisdiction, in spite of the fact 
that Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia object to such an 
invasion.
<P>
	Did the Prime Minister mean to tell us yesterday that he intends 
to pursue promoting the creation of a Canadian securities 
commission, even if, according to Quebec, Alberta and British 
Columbia, this will have the effect of concentrating Canada's 
financial community on Bay Street, in Toronto, at the expense of 
other parts of the country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is mistaken. First of all, we are acting at the 
provinces' request. This was discussed yesterday and what the 
federal government said is that, if this is the wish of a significant 
number of provinces, we would be prepared to accommodate such 
an approach, but this is at the request of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	In fact, I have to tell the hon. member that the Government of 
Alberta supports the project. There is a difference of opinion with 
Ontario, but Alberta is on board. He is mistaken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since this debate on the federal government's 
encroachment on the area of securities started, the Minister of 
Finance has told us one thing and another. He said there is very 
strong support for his project across the country. I would like him 
to name a few associations that support his project, because I have 
a whole list here of people who are opposed to it.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does he not realize that, 
no matter who is making the request or why, creating a national 
securities commission would constitute a glaring and unacceptable 
violation of the Canadian Constitution that he so fiercely defends?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, it does not violate the Constitution. Second, there is no 
invasion of provincial jurisdiction, as it will only be a delegation of 
provincial responsibilities  to a national institution. Third, in our 
discussions yesterday, it was very clear that we are acting at the 
provinces' request.
<P>
	I cannot understand why the hon. member wants to deny the 
other provinces the chance to compete with foreign countries. If the 
hon. member has a list of brokerage firms, I would appreciate it if 
he would give it to me. I would like the hon. member to give me his 
list of Montreal brokerage firms that are refusing to participate. Let

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a little 
over a week ago a group of small businessmen from the used goods 
sector sat down with the finance officials to discuss the minister's 
new tax grabbing, business gutting, job killing changes to the GST.
<P>
	At that meeting the finance department's taxation tsar informed 
them that if they wanted to save their own hides from these changes 
``all you really have to do is get your provinces to harmonize with 
the GST''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4076"> 4076 </A></B>
<P>
	Can the minister say extortion? Why is the finance minister now 
resorting to strong arm tactics and job killing taxation policies to 
coerce the provinces into this bogus harmonization plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is absolute nonsense. I am glad to see the hon. member finally 
admits that tax harmonization would lead to far greater job 
creation, and there is no doubt that it would.
<P>
	What the Department of Finance is saying is that if the provinces 
harmonize consumer prices will go down and the cost to small and 
medium size businesses will go down, which means our exports go 
up and more jobs are created.
<P>
	I am delighted to see the hon. member for Medicine Hat has 
finally seen the light of day. Harmonization creates jobs. Good for 
him, he finally recognizes it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
forcing these people to go along with his plan to get him off the 
hook for the GST promise he and his government broke, all he is 
doing is delivering the tax equivalent of a horse head into their 
collective beds.
<P>
	Is the finance minister so desperate now to force a harmonization 
agreement that he is prepared to make these small businesses an 
offer they cannot refuse if they want to save their industries from 
job killing taxation measures? Is that real Liberal leadership?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is not the horse's head that the Reform Party has to worry about.
<P>
	The Department of Finance is certainly prepared to sit down and 
work with small and medium size business on this. There would be 
no attempt to coerce anybody. We want to work out problems. 
There are problems and members on this side of the House have 
raised a number. The department is working on the problems. It 
would be very helpful if the hon. member would try to be as 
constructive as Liberal members.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Last week, the minister wanted details about certain flaws in the 
national blood supply system. Well, here are some. Luc Simon, 
from Montreal, and other hemophiliacs recently had to send back 
blood products to the manufacturer, Bayer. These products could 
not be used, because factor VIII was turbid for reasons which 
remain obscure, since no report was published to explain this 
incident, which the minister claimed to ignore.
<P>
	Considering that Health Canada has a responsibility to do its 
utmost to ensure that blood products are perfectly safe, from the 
time blood is collected from a donor until it is administered to a 
patient, why did hemophiliacs have to use their own initiative to 
force Bayer to withdraw faulty products?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
any responsible company that receives complaints from consumers 
with regard to its products must do investigations. Bayer is 
investigating those complaints. Health Canada is working with the 
company and the consumers to examine the nature of the 
complaints and the extent of them. When the investigations are 
complete the information will be readily available.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary. In order to prevent such incidents from occurring 
again and reduce the risks for users, will the minister pledge to 
define a set of rules to be followed in such cases, and will he 
delegate all safety issues to a single agency to which hemophiliacs 
could report any problem related to the safety of supplies?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I know the question from the hon. member is a serious one, but I 
wish to inform her there is already in place a regulatory agency, 
Health Canada, which monitors these kinds of concerns. There are 
from time to time complaints which consumers will make, and 
those complaints have to be investigated thoroughly.
<P>
	If the hon. member is suggesting there are some real substantive 
shortfalls relating to this product, if she has that evidence I would 
be happy to receive it and to make certain the investigation is 
underway and is very thorough.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, prior to the Sawatzky decision, Canada Customs under the 
direction of the Canadian Wheat Board seized a number of trucks 
and property belonging to farmers from the Yorkton-Melville

<P>

farmers have their private property returned to them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting that the revenue minister is covering the 
ag minister's behind here. I think the revenue minister knows the 
courts found these people innocent. The revenue minister has 
publicly stated she has no sympathy for farmers who have had their 
trucks seized. Now she has no respect for court decisions or 
property rights.
<P>
	These farmers are being denied the use of their property and the 
right to due process of law.
<P>
	When will the minister show some respect for property rights 
guaranteed these farmers under the Canadian Bill of Rights when it 
guarantees every Canadian the right to the enjoyment of property 
and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of 
law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am gad the hon. gentleman made 
reference to due process of law.
<P>
	He will know that in the case of the litigation underway in 
western Canada there have been two conflicting court decisions, 
one earlier this spring in a case called McMechan and Cairns that 
went in one direction, and another decision in the Sawatzky case 
that went in the other direction; both decisions by the same 
provincial court level. That obviously creates a conundrum in 
terms of future interpretation. Some of those matters are at this 
moment under appeal.
<P>
	I remind the hon. gentleman the appeal process is a part of the 
due process of law.

<P>
	On page 70 of the red book there is a commitment to Canada's 
role in the global reduction of greenhouse gases which cause 
climate change. Our commitment is to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions 20 per cent by the year 2005.

	Can the Minister of Natural Resources inform the House whether 
she is on target in delivering on this important promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what I would like to do is clarify the exact 
commitment made by the Government of Canada. We made a 
commitment at Rio to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 
levels by the year 2000.
<P>
	The hon. member is right, but in the red book we talk about 
working with other stakeholders. We talk about working with the 
provinces, the municipal governments and other important 
stakeholders to attempt to go beyond stabilization and to reduce 
greenhouse gases further.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

underlying objectives of the criminal justice system that the 
government has put before the House legislation to improve section 
745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The changes will screen out applications to ensure that only 
those that are meritorious will get before a jury. There are changes 
to ensure that once the case is before the jury, the shortening of the

light of these devastating costs and concerns about huge donations

from Labatt's; $46,000 from Imasco, will the minister now commit 
to bringing in a long overdue bill on tobacco advertising? Will he

pregnant mothers?
<P>

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order regarding Questions Nos. 25 and 26 on the Order 
Paper which have again languished on the Order Paper for 45 days 
without a response.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you are aware I first introduced this question in 
the House on December 1, 1994. On June 21, 1995 I raised a first 
point of order in the House. The then parliamentary secretary to the 
House leader said: ``We will get him the answer. It is nearing 
completion''. The hon. member even added: ``I hope he has a long 
holiday coming up from Parliament so he can sit down and read it 
when he gets it'', but I did not get it.
<P>
	On October 26, 1995 I again raised a point of order on the 
delayed response and the same member responded: ``Eighty per 
cent of the questions that have been placed on the Order Paper 
during this session have been answered''. He said the government 
had been ``assiduous in attending to its duties'', but I still had no 
response to my question.
<P>
	When Parliament returned after prorogation I reintroduced the 
question, confident that a reply was imminent since the 
government had led me to believe it was days away from a reply at 
the end of the session. However, a spokesman for the government 
House leader's office was quoted in the newspaper as saying that 
the government would not divert personnel to answer my question 
since my request was outrageous.
<P>
	This apparent obstruction of my parliamentary duty prompted 
me to raise a question of privilege on April 24 in this House. The 
response of the deputy leader of the government was to assure me, 
this House and the Chair that the government wanted to answer 
every question. The chief government whip echoed the sentiment 
and promised that when the information was available it would be 
responded to. You, Mr. Speaker, recommended that an attempt 
should be made by the government to answer these questions as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Because of these promises, Mr. Speaker, your ruling on May 6, 
1996 found that it is very difficult to accept the veracity of the 
remarks allegedly made by an unidentified person in the 
government House leader's office. However, after having reviewed 
all of the papers you did emphasize that the government must in all 
respects endeavour to respond to questions, adhering to the spirit of 
the rule. You also added that written questions posed by members 
are an important tool at the disposal of members of the House and 
are used to solicit information as well as to help hold the 
government  accountable for its actions. It is precisely for this 
reason that members of the ministry are responsible to the House 
for the actions taken regarding the preparation of responses to these 
questions.
<P>
	Despite this clear and forceful recognition of the importance of 
questions on the Order Paper and the responsibility of ministries, 
despite the assurances to myself, to the Chair and to the House 
from the deputy government House leader's office that an answer 
was forthcoming, despite waiting almost one year since I was told 
that the answer was nearing completion, I have again waited the 
requisite 45 days for a response and have yet to receive a reply to 
my question.
<P>
	I see a pattern here, Mr. Speaker. On May 6 your ruling was 
based on assurances that an answer would be made available, and 
that has not happened. Not only have I been repeatedly misled by 
indications that my question was to be answered, so has the Chair. 
Promises, patience and due process have amounted to nothing.
<P>
	Should I go directly to the Minister of National Revenue and ask 
that the Income Tax Act be applied to all order in council 
appointments? Short of this, Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing 
Order 39(5)(a), and in the spirit of your ruling of May 6, 1996, I ask 
you again to look into the matter to find out why, after a year and 
one-half, three points of order and a question of privilege I do not 
have a response from the government to Questions Nos. 25 and 26 
on the Order Paper.

well aware of the concerns of the hon. member. As one who is a 
staunch defender of access to information, I regret this.

	May I just say that the parliamentary secretary to the House 
leader is unavoidably absent from the House. I ask that we continue 
this point of order in tomorrow's Routine Proceedings so that there 
may be a proper response from the people who are informed on the 
issue.

wonder, if the government is offering to do this, if it would do the 
same thing for-

the House would be willing to wait until tomorrow and would agree 
to that particular request.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

table a consultation paper on federal financial institutions 
legislation which presents a series of proposals to safeguard the 
interests of consumers, to make improvements to the legislative 
and regulatory environment in which the federal financial 
institutions operate, and to start the process of fundamental 
thinking about the framework the sector will require as it moves 
through times of rapid change into the next century.
<P>
	Canadians can be proud of having one of the strongest financial 
systems in the world, a system that is efficient, effective and stable. 
It offers a good balance between  competition and the stability of 
financial institutions. We want to continue to make sure this is true.
<P>
	The federal government monitors developments in the financial 
sector and looks for ways to improve the system. In 1992 many of 
the restrictions preventing financial institutions from fully 
competing with each other were removed. The general consensus 
appears to be that these changes produced positive results.
<P>
	When the 1992 legislation was passed it was agreed that the 
legislative framework should be revisited in five years. After 
extensive consultation and analysis, the government has concluded 
that the framework established in 1992 should be kept largely 
intact. There is room, however, for a number of important 
adjustments to be made.
<P>
	We want to do the following. We want to strengthen consumer 
protection. We want to ease the regulatory burden on financial 
institutions and keep the legislation current with evolving trends. 
We also want to ensure that we raise our eyes to a broader vision of 
the future.
<P>
	We recognize that the financial sector operates in a rapidly 
changing environment in Canada and abroad. Fundamental 
questions have been raised by the stakeholders in consultations. 
These questions, mainly involving the structure of the industry and 
the role played by financial institutions, must be addressed to 
ensure that we continue to have a strong and secure financial sector 
that supports economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	The issues raised are complex and they must be addressed in a 
broad context. A task force on the future of the Canadian financial 
services sector will be established to provide advice to government 
on public policy issues related to the development of an appropriate 
framework.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	I will ask the task force to consider a number of factors in its 
deliberations. First, what changes to the framework are necessary 
to ensure that the financial sector contributes to economic growth 
and job creation? Second, how can this sector meet the emerging 
needs of Canadian business and consumers? Third, how to promote 
competitiveness and efficiency in the sector. Fourth, how to foster 
innovation. Finally, all of this is done while maintaining the safety 
and soundness of the Canadian financial system. We will provide 
further details of the task force mandate and composition in the 
fall.
<P>
	Ultimately, the question I want addressed is what should be done 
to make sure that Canada continues to have one of the best financial 
systems in the world. The study will shape the next round of 
amendments to the legislation which the government proposes take 
place no later than five years after the passage of the 1997 
legislation. The government will be counting on this  group for

important proposals in the paper, the proposals to further safeguard 
the interests of consumers. This is a matter of significance to the 
government.
<P>
	We recognize the efforts made by the financial institutions to 
address privacy concerns over the past few years and plan to build 
on their successes. We propose to introduce regulations governing 
the use of consumer information by federal financial institutions.
<P>
	The government will work with the banks, trust and loan 
companies to simplify and improve methods of providing 
information about their fees. Financial institutions will also be 
required to provide more detailed information about the cost of 
credit.
<P>
	We will work with consumer and community groups and with 
the financial institutions to develop and put in place a strategy to 
improve the access of low income Canadians to financial services.
<P>
	The government will also work with stakeholders to determine 
whether there is a need for new measures protecting consumers 
from abusive tied selling.
<P>
	In addition to these significant consumer protection initiatives, 
the paper contains important initiatives to streamline and clarify 
regulatory requirements, and to minimize delays when regulatory 
approvals are required.
<P>
	The paper also recognizes the importance we attach to reviewing 
the regulatory structure supporting the payment system. A safe and 
sound payments system is a vital part of the operations of a 
modern, sophisticated economy.
<P>
	The Department of Finance will establish an advisory committee 
to study payment systems issues. The committee will provide 
important input to the broader work of the task force on the 
development of a suitable framework for the financial sector in the 
21st century. With regard to the legislative proposals contained in 
this paper, the government will begin a consultation process. Both 
the House Standing Committee on Finance and the Senate 
committee on banking, trade and commerce will hold hearings. I 
look forward to their input.
<P>
	I urge hon. members to read this paper and to become familiar 
with the proposals. I will be pleased to receive comments before we 
move to legislation in the fall.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as I was saying earlier, we in the official opposition can 
only deplore the many delays surrounding the tabling of the white 
paper on the review of the Bank Act.
<P>
	We also deplore the fact that the secretary of state is once again 
turning over the work he should have done  over the past year and a 
half with respect to the review of the Bank Act to select 
committees, which will probably work behind closed doors, a habit 
the government took to in the taxation review process and in the 
scandal surrounding the transfer by family trusts of two billion 
dollars to the U.S., tax free.
<P>
	In conclusion, the official opposition will be extremely vigilant 
when it comes to this important matter of the review of the Bank 
Act and, in particular, the federal government's respect of 
provincial jurisdictions, the effects of such a review on the 
concentration of the financial market, and the real defence of the 
interests of consumers in Quebec and in Canada. Quebecers and 
Canadians must and can count on the official opposition, on the 
Bloc Quebecois, to defend their real interests.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, members of the Reform Party of Canada welcome the 
opportunity to respond to the minister's long awaited white paper 
on the review of financial institutions legislation. We all know how 
important a stable, efficient, competitive and innovative financial 
system is to a complex economy like Canada's, so the impending 
review is viewed with a great deal of seriousness.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The four pillars of the financial sector, banking, insurance, trust 
companies and securities dealers, have crumbled as deregulation 
and technological progress has blurred the lines of distinction. The 
banks have been applying pressure ever since to enter into other 
sectors such as retail insurance, auto leasing and increasing their 
interest in the securities market.
<P>
	Further deregulation and the subsequent increase in the size of 
the banks, however, could reduce competition in the financial 
sector and hurt consumers.
<P>
	Reform believes that the protection of the consumer and a more 
competitive environment are the two key elements that must be 
addressed in this review. While Canadians acknowledge that we 
have a strong and stable financial system they are clearly 
suspicious of the power of some of our institutions.
<P>
	While we commend the minister for placing the interests of 
consumers at the top of his list of priorities, we believe that in order 
to strengthen the confidence of consumers, these issues must 
remain paramount and the process must be, above all, transparent. 
Canadians must be able to see the process in order to put faith in it 
and to be certain that all interests were considered.
<P>
	A special concern for me is the issue of privacy and how the 
banks handle confidential personal information. Canadians are 
extremely concerned about the subsequent use of personal 
information that they must provide to financial institutions in the 
course of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4082"> 4082 </A></B>
<P>
doing business. I  hope that this important issue will be given 
serious consideration .
<P>
	Canadians are more knowledgeable about their financial system 
that many in the industry give them credit for. They realize that 
banks are more than a place to keep their money or to cash a 
cheque. This was evident in our party's recent assembly in 
Vancouver where the grassroots passed the following resolution:
<P>
	``Resolved that the Reform Party ensure that federal legislation 
on financial institutions protects Canadians from experiencing a 
monopoly of financial services by any one sector. Particularly, 
banks should not be allowed to further enter into the insurance 
industry or the auto leasing business.
<P>
	``The Reform Party further recommends that a moratorium be 
placed on any further, partial deregulation until a thorough review 
of the entire financial system with the aim of increasing 
competition within the financial sector. Such a review must also 
assure the stability of the financial system and retain prudential 
regulation for the protection of consumers''.
<P>
	We need to know a good many things. How do financial 
institutions interact? How do they operate in relation to other 
sectors of the economy? What are the strengths and weaknesses of 
the current regulatory structure? Not only will these answers reveal 
whether true competition exists within the banking sector and thus 
whether they should be allowed to expand into other financial 
services, the answers will determine the veritable strength of the 
financial sector as it heads into the 21st century.
<P>
	As lobbyists from all sides pressure members of Parliament to 
take sides and others try to frame the issue within the overtly 
political constraints of a war between big and small business, the 
challenge will be to keep our eye on the ball, to ensure true 
competition exists and is free to function within the marketplace, 
that stability is maintained in the respective financial sectors and a 
prudent regulatory structure is in place to protect the consumer. If 
the bottom line is met, Canadians and the Canadian economy will 
indeed emerge as winners.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today on a point of privilege. I feel it 
is incumbent upon me as a member of Parliament to bring to your 
attention a matter of the most serious importance.
<P>
	The following description of events is lengthy and complex but 
will clearly show that actions taken by the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee are an affront to the House and amount to the 
utmost disrespect for Parliament.
<P>
	Page 123 of the twentieth edition of Erskine May defines 
contempt as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It may be stated generally that any act or omission which obstructs or 
impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or 
which obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce 
such results may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of 
that offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Furthermore, in Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I> contempt respecting documents is defined as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Similarly, should any person present documents to to a committee of the 
House of Commons which have been forged, falsified, or fabricated with intent 
to deceive such committee or the House, or, to be privy to such forging or fraud, 
this will constitute contempt of Parliament because it is an obvious affront to the 
House of Commons to present it with such documents. The House of Commons 
is not only entitled to but demands the utmost respect when material is placed 
before it for its scrutiny, investigation or study.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The following description will show that SIRC's actions led 
directly to the Solicitor General of Canada's unknowingly tabling 
on December 15, 1994 a report contemptuous of the House.
<P>
	On December 15, 1994 the SIRC report on the Heritage Front 
affair was tabled in the House of Commons by the Solicitor 
General of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	In chapter 8 of the report the following is written: ``On October 
17, 1989 the service decided to formally investigate the alleged 
$45,000 contribution. CSIS said that they could not go back to the 
informant, as all contacts had ended on December 31, 1988. The 
service authorized a three month, level one investigation entitled 
``LNU/FNU (Unknown Contributor(s) to Preston Manning's 
Electoral Campaign)''. The service cited section 12, paragraph 2(b) 
of the CSIS Act as the legal basis for the investigation''.
<P>
	On December 16, 1994 SIRC appeared before the national 
security subcommittee. I asked the following of SIRC. I quote page 
5:32 of the <I>Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence</I> of the 
Subcommittee on National Security: ``Can you have your officials 
go back to CSIS and have them examine the hard copy of the 
original authorization of the level one investigation on the Reform 
Party and a foreign government, not just the corrected copy? 
Specifically, can your employees examine the caption on the file?''
<P>
	SIRC member Michel Robert responded: ``About this specific 
question, the last one, I do not know. I will examine that. I am not 
in a position to answer now but will certainly look at the files''.
<P>
	In other words, Mr. Robert mentioned nothing about knowing of 
any name change in the investigation entitled ``LNU/FNU 
(Unknown Contributor(s) to Preston Manning's Electoral 
Campaign)'' when the SIRC report on the Heritage Front affair was 
tabled in the House of Commons on December 15, 1994 by the 
Solicitor General of Canada.
<P>
	However, in a letter dated January 27, 1995 from Maurice 
Archdeacon, executive director of SIRC, Mr. Archdeacon informed 
the member for Scarborough-Rouge River, the chair of the 
committee on national security, that the file caption was indeed 
changed: ``The caption she referred to for the targeting authority 
dated October 17, 1989 was Preston Manning. The caption was 
revised on March 30, 1990 to state: `LNU/FNU (Unknown 
Contributor(s) to Preston Manning's Electoral Campaign)'''.
<P>
	On March 30, 1995 the Solicitor General of Canada appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
accompanied by his deputy ministers, including Ward Elcock, the 
director of CSIS.
<P>
	Mr. Elcock was asked why SIRC was unaware that the file was 
originally in Mr. Manning's name. Mr. Elcock's response, 
according to the <I>Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence</I> of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Issue 95, March 
30, 1995, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4084"> 4084 </A></B>
<P>
pages 95:17 and 95:18 was: ``I don't know that in fact that SIRC 
was unaware. I don't know why they would not have put it in their 
report or would have chosen not to do that. That is  SIRC's business 
and you would have to address that question to SIRC''.
<P>
	After further questioning about whether SIRC knew about the 
investigation name change, Mr. Elcock went on to say: ``My belief 
is that they did have that information, but I will certainly check that 
for the hon. member''.
<P>
	The following day, on March 31, 1995, I wrote to the hon. 
Jacques Courtois, chair of SIRC, asking for clarification of Mr. 
Elcock's comments of the previous day: ``Was any member or 
employee of SIRC aware that the original TARC investigation 
launched on October 17, 1989 [was] in the name of Preston 
Manning and not ``LNU/FNU (Unknown Contributor(s) to Preston 
Manning's Electoral Campaign)'' when the Heritage Front report 
was tabled December 9, 1994?''
<P>
	Mr. Archdeacon responded for Mr. Courtois in a letter dated 
April 7, 1995. He said in his reply to my letter that contrary to what 
the SIRC report and committee testimony from SIRC members had 
led the House to believe, SIRC did indeed know of the 
investigation's name change at the time of the tabling of the report 
by the solicitor general: ``SIRC staff saw the original title of the 
targeting authorization as well as the corrected titled and all other 
documents pertaining to this investigation''.
<P>
	The evidence presented bears witness to the fact that the actions 
taken by SIRC are in contempt of the House. SIRC deliberately 
omitted from its December, 1994 report the fact that the name of 
one of CSIS's investigations was originally entitled ``Preston 
Manning''.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	For whatever reason, the caption of the TARC investigation was 
changed to ``LNU/FNU (Unknown Contributor(s) to Preston 
Manning's Electoral Campaign)'' two months after the expiration 
of the investigation.
<P>
	These facts are by any measure crucial and their absence from 
the report is inexplicable and deliberately contemptuous. The 
actions taken by SIRC amount to an attempt to mislead a minister 
of the crown and to obstruct the House by offering admittedly 
incomplete information.
<P>
	This should have been the conclusion of my question of 
privilege, as the evidence is clear. However, over the past two 
months SIRC and CSIS have provided new information that is 
completely contrary with their own evidence to this point.
<P>
	In a letter sent to CSIS on November 9-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Could the hon. 
member please be brief and show the House how her privilege in 
the House has been breached.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I am trying to but the evidence 
is on record in minutes of meetings. I would like to bring it to the 
attention of the House. The Solicitor General of Canada has been 
mislead and tabled a report that is misleading to the House. If I may 
continue, Madam Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the hon. 
member consider that her privileges have been breached?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I do I am trying to outline the 
reasons and the evidence that support that breach.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I remind the 
hon. member to please be brief.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, in a letter sent to CSIS on 
November 9, 1995 the subcommittee asked questions about the 
caption on October 17, 1989 targeting authority, originally entitled 
``Preston Manning''.
<P>
	Among the many questions asked were: ``How was a caption 
change made on the form 4002? Was the original form altered or 
was the original form destroyed and a new backdated and 
reinitialled form created?'' The subcommittee also asked questions 
about the November 10, 1989 transit slip, form 3040, from the 
chief of counter-intelligence, general desk, to the general director 
of counter-intelligence.
<P>
	Specifically, questions were asked about item five of the form 
which stated: ``Caption is considered appropriate under policy 
provisions''. Among questions asked were: ``Can you provide the 
subcommittee with an explanation of this assertion in light of the 
fact that at the time the caption read `Preston Manning' and was not 
changed until March 30, 1990? If the caption was''-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> This is the 
second time I am asking the hon. member to please point out 
immediately how the point she is raising occurred.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not realize there was any 
limit on a question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Can the hon. 
member put forth her question of privilege now.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I am trying to put forward my 
question of privilege. If you want-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The House 
will now resume with presentation of committee reports.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker , I wish 
to point out that in my two and a half years here I have heard many 
questions of privilege. Each member has been given the courtesy, 
the time, the respect and the silence to present their question of 
privilege.
<P>
	Members of both the government and the other party are 
concerned about the length, although it was never brought up 
before. I do not think the power of the Chair is being applied fairly 
and evenly. I would expect the Chair to interpret the rules on our 
behalf in the same way as was done for previous members. We 
should be given the same respect. I feel that our colleagues should 
be able to-
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The Chair 
applies the rules equally, period.
<P>
	We will now return to Orders of the Day.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to know where in 
our rules there is a time limit on a point of privilege and why I have 
been denied my privilege of giving the evidence to support my 
point of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The Chair has 
ruled. You had limited time and I have asked you, at least twice, to 
be direct and to point out in a succinct way your point of privilege.
<P>
	We will now go to Orders of the Day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise with respect 
to a matter of privilege in the House. It is stated very clearly in 
Beauchesne's that one of the responsibilities of the Speaker on a 
matter of privilege is that the Speaker must carefully hear the total 
story with respect to the privilege so that a judgment can be made 
whether a question of privilege exists. In order to do that, full and 
detailed information must be provided.
<P>
	The hon. member who is making the presentation has to go into 
the details of the matter in order to completely describe the point of 
privilege. I know that in her  presentation so far she has presented 
some of the preliminary information, but has not clearly indicated 
what the privilege is.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I refer you to citation 26(3) of Beauchesne's 
where it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a question of privilege is raised the Speaker's function is limited to 
deciding whether the matter is of such a character as to entitle the motion, which the 
Member who has raised the question desires to move-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That means you must look at it in its entirety. Therefore, I would 
appreciate the Speaker's reconsideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, under the rules the Chair has to be satisfied on a 
number of issues. First, notice has to be given to the Chair 
describing briefly the essence of the point of privilege. The Chair 
will decide whether that has been properly done. The exception is if 
the event occurred as a result of something that was going on 
during the current deliberations of the House, in other words, 
immediately prior to the raising of the question of privilege.
<P>
	As I understand it, this is an event which occurred in a 
committee. We do not have before the House a report from that 
committee in which the committee itself alleges that there was a 
contempt. None of that was produced before the House, except a 
long speech by a member before the House and before Madam 
Speaker today, without satisfying in a brief way and in the 
customary manner, what the question of privilege was.
<P>
	Citation 114 of Beauchesne talks about raising a point of 
privilege and citation 865 tells us the procedure to be utilized when 
such a point refers to the proceedings of a committee.
<P>
	If something is generated from a committee, it seems to me that 
we should have before the House a report from that committee 
which attests to the fact that there has been such a breach and then 
the House can judge on the contents of the report which makes that 
allegation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be very brief. Standing Order 48(1), which covers 
this question, states very clearly that a written statement shall be 
given to the Speaker one hour prior to making the point of 
privilege, which was done, as I understand it.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	The rest of the procedure is contained in the custom of this 
Chamber. The custom of the Chamber is that the statement must be 
brief when it is presented to the House. I presume that the hon. 
member would be brief in presenting the statement.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will go back 
to the question of privilege from the hon. member, requesting for a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4086"> 4086 </A></B>
<P>
third time that from the start she  demonstrates how her privileges 
were breached; from the start.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, are you asking that I start over? 
You said from the start.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am 
reminding the hon. member for the fourth time this afternoon that 
when she rose on a question of privilege that from the minute she 
starts talking, she points out immediately how her privileges were 
breached.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, my privilege was breached 
when information was provided to a committee of the House of 
Commons that was incorrect. That information is documented and 
I will provide written copies of what I would have said so that the 
Speaker can go through it for the evidence.
<P>
	The information that was provided to the committee a year ago 
was contradicted by the same individuals one year later. The 
information that they provided to the committee showed that the 
report which has just been tabled in the House of Commons is 
inaccurate, that it deliberately has information in it that is not true, 
that documents have been changed and falsified to support the 
report that is in the House.
<P>
	It is a breach of my privileges and is a breach of the privileges of 
all members in the House of Commons when the information that 
is provided to us as members of Parliament is not treated with the 
respect that is due.
<P>
	I would like permission of the members of this House to table

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-318, an act respecting the protection of whistle 
blowers and to amend certain other acts in consequence thereof.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the bill I am introducing today has two 
objectives. The first is to encourage federal public servants to 
disclose any actions or institutional practices which would 
constitute an offence under a public service act or directive or 
would represent a risk to health, safety or the environment, or a 
significant waste of public funds.
<P>
	The second objective, which sets the framework for the first, 
protects federal public servants against reprisals by their employer 
for any whistle blowing that takes place under this bill.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-319, an act to amend the Consumer 
Packaging and Labelling Act (recombinant hormones).
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, basically this bill states that no 
prepackaged food product shall be sold that contains an ingredient 
derived from an animal to which a prescribed recombinant 
hormone has been administered unless that product has applied to it 
a label containing a declaration of this information.
<P>
	Recombinant growth hormone or rBGH is a genetically 
engineered hormone sold by Monsanto Chemical Corporation. 
Dairy cows injected with rBGH every two weeks produce 10 to 20 
per cent more milk than untreated cows.
<P>
	Since Canadians have yet to be assured that the use of the 
recombinant growth hormone injections into dairy cows is safe for 
humans and animals, it is up to elected legislators to make sure 
laws protect the consumer.
<P>
	Therefore, if Health Canada issues a notice of compliance to 
Monsanto, Canadians must know if the milk and milk products 
they are buying contain the recombinant growth hormone. It is with 
concern for all Canadians, especially women and children who are 
major milk drinkers, that this bill is put forward.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Minister of Human Resources Development indicate what 
recommendations were made by the committee analysing the restructuring of 
service points in Quebec, on the advisability of locating the regional Human 
Resource Centre of Canada in Shawinigan or Trois-Rivières?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> All Department of Human Resources 
Development Canada (HRDC) points of service were studied 
during 1994 and 1995 as part of the review of government spending 
announced in the 1994 and 1995 budgets. A committee was 
established in each of HRDC's 10 regions to review all points of 
service and recommend a new service delivery structure.
<P>
	The committees considered all relevant factors in forming their 
recommendations, and all recommendations were subsequently 
approved by the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As a result of the committees' recommendations, HRDC's new 
service delivery structure will have 308 offices across Canada, 
some of which will be administrative centres. Quebec will have a 
total of 78 offices, of which 28 will be administrative centres.
<P>
	The Quebec regional committee recommended that HRDC's 
administrative centre for the Mauricie be situated in Shawinigan. 
The committee chose Shawinigan because this location provided 
the opportunity to share space and services with Revenue Canada, 
thus meeting the government's objective of reducing costs and 
ensuring the least possible effect on HRDC client service 
resources.
<P>
	The committee used the same approach for the Saguenay-Lac 
St-Jean area, where it chose Jonquière as the site for HRDC's 
administrative centre because the regional taxation data centre was 
already there.
<P>
Question No. 21-<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Minister of Human Resources Development indicate whether 
representations or interventions were made by officers, employees or other 
persons from the Privy Council Office or the Office of the Prime Minister to 
officers, employees or officials from Human Resources Development Canada, 
in order to ensure that the regional Canada Human Resources Centre would be 
located in a municipality in the constituency of Saint-Maurice, rather than 
Trois-Rivières, and, if so, who were the persons who intervened, and what 
reasons were given for the move?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> To the best of the department's knowledge, 
no representations were made to officials of the department by 
political staff from the Prime Minister's office or personnel from 
the Privy Council.
<P>
Question No. 22-<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Minister of Human Resources Development Canada indicate 
whether, as part of its restructuring of service points in Quebec, Human 
Resources Development Canada carried out comparative studies on the 
advisability of locating the regional Canada Human Resources Centre in 
Shawinigan or in Trois-Rivières and, if so, what were the findings of those 
studies?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> In the organization of the Human Resources 
Development Canada (HRDC) service delivery network, the 
important element was maintaining high quality service for clients. 
The committee recommended four Human Resource Centres of 
Canada (HRCC) be located in various areas of the Mauricie 
region-Trois-Rivières, Shawinigan, Louiseville and La Tuque.
<P>
	The location of the administrative centre had to be put in a place 
that was accessible to all offices and that offered the best 
opportunity for realizing savings in overhead.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4091"> 4091 </A></B>
<P>
	The taxation data centre in South Shawinigan met these 
requirements as it is centrally located in the region and is a 
federally owned building. In addition to maximizing utilization of 
Government of Canada space, this choice enables the department 
to continue the reduction of costs by sharing services, systems and 
resources with other departments. The Mauricie region has no 
other Government of Canada sites that offer similar advantages.
<P>
	The committee also discussed establishing the administrative 
centre in Trois-Rivières, primarily because of the department's 
existing lease commitments in the area. Given the lease expiry date 
(1999) and the need to plan for longer term reductions that were set 
for the Quebec region, it was obvious that administrative resources 
had to be concentrated, as soon as possible, in sites that were 
owned by Government of Canada. The location of the 
administrative centre for the Mauricie region in Shawinigan will 
enable the department to save a minimum of $3.7 million over the 
next 10 years.

Question No. 23-<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B>

department's moving to, arranging, and settling into new premises to be located 
in the Shawinigan area according to the government's plan?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Further to the federal government's mandate 
to reduce space and accommodation costs, Human Resources 
Development Canada (HRDC) is proposing to combine and 
relocate the Trois-Rivières and Shawinigan Human Resource 
Centres, the Reseau Office, the InfoCentre and Unemployment 
Insurance Telecentre to the Shawinigan-Sud Fiscal Centre on April 
1, 1997. The relocation provides the opportunity to share space and

	The relocation to Shawinigan-Sud results in a requirement for 
reduced space at a combined annual rent of $490,451.00 (a saving 
of $386,279.42 per year over the current rental costs). All fit-up, 
moving and renovation costs are estimated to be $633,180.00;

Question No. 38-<B>Mr. McClelland:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the government's potential $ 1.5 billion liability to settle pay 
equity complaints dating back to 1984: (<I>a</I>) what provisions has the government 
made to fund this potential liability going back 12 years, to 1984 and (<I>b</I>) how 
are private sector compensation and benefit levels for persons performing 
similar functions factored into the Treasury Board's evaluation when 
considering ``equal pay for work of equal value'' in the public service?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> (a) In the 1995 budget, cabinet 
instructed the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of 
Justice to negotiate a settlement with the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada (PSAC) on terms similar to the agreement with the 
Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC). 
Funds have been set aside to resolve pay equity complaints and any 
overlap will be offset through reallocations as per the expenditure 
management system regulations.
<P>
	(b) The legislation does not require the government to consider 
the wages paid in the outside labour market for similar 
occupations. Equal pay for work of equal value focuses on the 
compensation and benefits relationship of male and female 
workers who are performing work of equal value within the same 
establishment. Pay equity is about internal equity.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to amend the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act to include a special two year opting out provision permitting those prairie 
producers who believe they are missing market opportunities the flexibility and 
choice to market their wheat and barley outside the jurisdiction of the board.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to move the 
motion in the House today that this House urge the government to 
amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act to include a special two year 
opting out provision permitting those prairie producers who 
believe they are missing market opportunities the flexibility and 
choice to market their wheat and barley outside the jurisdiction of 
the board.
<P>
	The Canadian agriculture sector has proven over the years that it 
is prepared for the challenges it faces. We have seen this in the past 
and we will continue to see it in the future. If there is a need for a 
disease resistant breed or variety of seed, Canadians develop it. If 
there is a need for better farm equipment, Canadians invent it. If 
there is a need for an irrigation system, Canadians build it. If there 
is a need for more soil nutrients, Canadians apply them. If there is a 
need to produce more food, Canadians work harder and longer.
<P>
	There have always been doubters and naysayers when it comes 
to agriculture in Canada. When Palliser was surveying the prairies 
in the 1800s he said the land in southern Saskatchewan and Alberta 
was too poor and dry for farming. Today that land has turned into a 
bread basket for the world. Why? Because farmers saw the 
potential.
<P>
	Today the doubters are saying we cannot grow this type of wheat 
because the growing season is too short, or we cannot produce 
grains from the land because it is vulnerable to wind erosion when 
it is cultivated, or we cannot water our stock because it is too dry. 
Canadian know-how has resulted in the development of varieties 
that mature more quickly, the invention of no till drills to combat 
erosion, and the development of some of the best irrigation systems 
in the world. Apply a little Canadian ingenuity to a problem and 99 
times out of 100, Canadians can fix the problem.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore why does the minister of agriculture listen to all the 
negative whiners who cry that the Canadian Wheat Board will be 
destroyed if prairie farmers have a choice as to whether they 
market their own wheat and barley through the Canadian Wheat 
Board or outside of the board? Frankly, I do not know the reason 
other than the obvious conclusion that they have no confidence in 
the board which is a conclusion I do not share.
<P>
	I could focus my speech on the past and in great detail explain 
past shortcomings and failures of the board, such as the creation of 
the board as a wartime act to keep prices to producers low, or how 
the board literally missed the boat on barley sales last year, or how 
the board fails to serve niche markets adequately. In all fairness, 
others could point to the successes of the board, such as large sales 
of wheat to communist China, the former Soviet Union and Brazil.
<P>
	The point and purpose of this debate is not to see which side of 
the ledger can chalk up the most impressive total. The purpose of 
this debate is twofold. We need to ask and answer the questions: 
Can dual marketing work in the Canadian prairies? Should 
producers be compelled against their will to market wheat and 
barley through a state run marketing agency? This is the crux of the 
matter. This is at the root of the debate that is gripping the prairies 
at the current time. It is important that this House come to grips 
with those two questions.
<P>
	I want to address the question of whether or not a dual market 
will work. A functional dual market in Canada is a workable and 
viable option. Just to define what a dual market is, it really means 
the right or the ability to market in a pooled account where farmers 
share together the proceeds from the sale of that grain or to market 
their produce individually, either through a marketing agency such 
as the Canadian Wheat Board or outside of that directly on a cash 
for purchase or cash sale basis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4093"> 4093 </A></B>
<P>
	Dual marketing could be accomplished in Canada. It would be 
far more easy to accomplish that than it was to put a human on 
the moon, or to split an atom, or to get an NHL hockey team for 
Saskatchewan, or perhaps even a bit facetiously, to get a winning 
team here in Ottawa.
<P>
	We currently have dual marketing for feed grains. It is a matter 
of fact. Farmers have the option to go through the board to market 
their feed grain or they can do it independently from the board. 
There has been a dual market for barley in the past. On August 1, 
1993 the Government of Canada removed from the control of the 
Canadian Wheat Board the sole authority over barley sold into the 
United States.
<P>
	Although a continental barley market was a short lived 40 days, 
it showed that a dual market system was in fact viable. During 
those 40 days it was estimated that between 500,000 and one 
million tonnes of barley were sold into the United States. Prior to 
this 40 day record level of sales, the most feed barley the Canadian 
Wheat Board ever previously sold in one entire year was 240,821 
tonnes and the average annual sales were close to a mere 98,000 
tonnes. While other factors played into the increased barley sales to 
the U.S., such as the severe weather, it still illustrated the important 
market for prairie barley in the United States.
<P>
	There is also a form of dual marketing in Australia under the 
Australian wheat board. This is not a concept that has not been 
proven and tried. The domestic grain market in Australia is now 
deregulated. The Australian wheat board pricing options offer a 
range of pools for wheat and other grains. It also offers forward 
contracts for a fixed price or a minimum price requiring active 
involvement in overseas futures markets. With Australia's move 
toward a deregulated system, the Australian wheat board has 
assumed many of the characteristics of private grain traders in the 
services that it offers to its suppliers and customers. As well, the 
greater flexibility of the operations of the Australian wheat board 
has increased the commercial orientation of grain growers.
<P>
	Can a dual grain marketing system work in Canada? I believe the 
answer is yes. There is no doubt that some reforms to the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act will be required. This is not a negative option but 
a constructive one. The board needs to be reformed regardless of 
whether or not grain marketing moves to a dual system.
<P>
	Should farmers be able to opt in and out of the board at will? 
This is a question I hear debated across the prairies from the grain 
elevators to farm meetings that I have attended. Maybe or maybe 
not.
<P>
	Today's motion simply calls for producers who wish to market 
outside of the board to have that choice for two years. We are not 
talking about opting in or out. We are talking about producers 
opting out and staying out for two years, out altogether, no holds 
barred. It would be a test case allowing both sides in the argument a 
chance to prove their point. If dual marketing works, let it continue.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	The minister has not allowed a prairie-wide plebiscite to decide 
this issue. Having broken his promise on this issue, I urge him to 
save face and allow the simply worded plebiscite: Do you want to 
continue having the choice to voluntarily opt out of the Canadian 
Wheat Board for a two-year period voted upon at the expiry of the 
first two years?
<P>
	There was a plebiscite on this issue but it was not initiated by the 
minister of agriculture or the current government. It was initiated 
by the province of Alberta. I believe some of my colleagues from 
the province of Alberta will elaborate on whether or not farmers 
knew what the question meant, what it actually stood for, and what 
the consequences of a yes or a no vote would mean.
<P>
	In that plebiscite the participation was high. Nearly 16,000 
farmers cast their votes, a far greater number than in the vote for 
the advisory board elections which were held a couple of years 
previous to that. These are the percentages of producers who 
wanted marketing choice, to be able to market outside of the 
Canadian Wheat Board: barley producers were 66 per cent and 
wheat producers were 62 per cent.
<P>
	Members opposite could say that is just Alberta and not all of the 
prairies. The province of Saskatchewan also initiated a poll which 
surveyed Saskatchewan producers. Saskatchewan is a province that 
strongly supports the Canadian Wheat Board. I want it on record in 
the House that I support the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The first question asked whether or not the participants in the 
survey supported the board. About 80 per cent of the respondents 
said that they did support the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	They were also asked: Does the Canadian Wheat Board 
generally get the highest prices for Saskatchewan producers? 
Forty-three per cent said yes and 47 per cent said no. Saskatchewan 
producers were divided on whether or not they thought the 
Canadian Wheat Board got them the very best prices available.
<P>
	They were also asked if they agreed that participation in the 
Canadian Wheat Board should be made voluntary, which is what 
we are talking about today in terms of whether we should permit 
dual marketing. Fifty-eight per cent said that participation in the 
Canadian Wheat Board should be made voluntary. This was in the 
province of Saskatchewan, the province that the minister of 
agriculture resides in. Thirty-six per cent disagreed. We now have 
the minority ruling the majority. The 36 per cent group has its way 
and the 58 per cent group of Saskatchewan producers surveyed is 
being left out in the cold.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4094"> 4094 </A></B>
<P>
	Other questions in the survey included the level of support for 
allowing the direct sale of grain to a domestic food market. I 
outlined the scenario which occurred in Australia. About 70 per 
cent offered support for the concept of dual marketing at the 
domestic level. If they asked about a continental market, in other 
words a dual market into the United States, support dropped. In 
Saskatchewan it was about 50 per cent. Half of producers wanted 
to be able to market directly into the United States outside of the 
board and the other half did not.
<P>
	The last question I will put on record was the question: Should 
the federal government have less control and influence over the 
Canadian Wheat Board? That is another whole subject. A 
resounding 67 per cent of respondents felt the federal government 
should have less of a hold over the Canadian Wheat Board. Only 25 
per cent of the respondents disagreed with that position.
<P>
	It seems clear there is growing support in the prairies for the 
concept of a voluntary nature to marketing wheat and barley. the 
minister of agriculture on several occasions has stated that once 
there is a dual grade marketing system we cannot go back. He has 
mentioned that in this very House. Can the minister supply the 
evidence that would support his claim? I believe the minister is 
more interested in maintaining and expanding his empire than 
allowing farmers the option to market their own grain as they see 
fit.
<P>
	Are farmers prepared to meet the challenges of marketing their 
grain independently from the Canadian Wheat Board? The 
unequivocal answer is yes. Can dual marketing work? Again the 
answer is yes. Let us at least try it.
<P>
	This leads me to the second question I asked earlier: Should 
producers be compelled against their will to market wheat and 
barley through a state run marketing agency? The answer to that 
question is obvious. It should be no. It is not morally right and 
perhaps it is not even constitutional. The case has never come 
before the courts because the wheat board has used delaying tactics 
to prevent dealing with this issue.
<P>
	Let me use a hypothetical case to prove my point. What if all of 
the authors in Canada had to market their books through a state run 
publisher? I can hear the argument the state run publisher would 
use to support his existence: ``A single book seller will get the 
highest price. There is no way a mere author could know who wants 
to buy his or her books, so he would be at the mercy of the 
multinational publishers who would underprice his book. There 
would never be any censorship, even if the book blasted the state 
run publisher or the government that controlled it. Trust me''.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	They would say: ``By the way, we will sell your hard cover, 
illustrated, well written book and we will sell that  cheap paperback 
novel to the customers and then we will average the return and give 
you half the proceeds after we subtract our selling commission and 
shipping and handling costs. Oh, no, we must not tell you what our 
costs are. That may give those other cheap shot publishers some 
sort of an unfair advantage. An advance? Oh, no, not an advance, 
not until the first books hit the stores. We will settle up after the 
final copy has been sold, both yours and the cheap paperbacks''.
<P>
	Members know full well that Canadian authors would scream at 
100 decibels if they were subjected to such an unreasonable 
marketing scheme for their product. Yet farmers are branded as 
greedy and ignorant if they question the monopoly powers of a 
single desk seller.
<P>
	Farmers realize their wheat or barley is not really their property. 
Farmers realize they have to share the return of their labour in a 
pool account with other producers. Nobody lets them share the cost 
of producing these commodities. That is never considered.
<P>
	Some farmers protest. They are scorned by the minister. They 
are harassed by Canada Customs and the RCMP. If need be, the law 
is quickly changed to keep them in check.
<P>
	The rigidness of the Liberal government is making martyrs out 
of those who challenge the current system. The minister and the 
Liberal government are the ones threatening and weakening and 
potentially destroying the Canadian Wheat Board. I want to 
reiterate that fact.
<P>
	It is not the Farmers for Justice, those who cross the border, who 
are destroying the wheat board. It is the minister of agriculture and 
the unwillingness of the Liberal government to reform the board 
which is causing the board to fall into disrepute.
<P>
	I know there are many people who work within the Canadian 
Wheat Board who want to see it reformed. I wonder why the 
minister is dragging his feet. Why will he not enter the 20th 
century-we are almost into the 21st century-and build a 
marketing agency for the 1990s and not be stuck with one designed 
for the 1930s?
<P>
	It is those with the courage and confidence to propose 
constructive change who will secure a future for the Canadian 
Wheat Board and also provide farmers with the choice they are 
demanding.
<P>
	Farmers know they can market their own produce. Talk to the 
canola, oats or potato growers and the cattle producers. Give those 
who wish to market wheat and barley the same freedom to do so, 
come what may. Let those who are happy to market through the 
Canadian Wheat Board pool their returns free from the worry or 
stress that comes from the pressures of the traditional market.
<P>
	I was asked by a reporter today that if this measure passed would 
I market my grain through the wheat board or would I market it 
outside the board. I said it would  depend on who gave me the best 
options. I think that is wonderful. Right now there is no competi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4095"> 4095 </A></B>
<P>
tion. The wheat board can basically do whatever it wants. If I had 
an option to market through the board or outside the board, I would 
look at what was proposed and what the final pool return was and 
what the buyers of the grain outside the board offered. Then I 
would make a decision which would provide me with the best 
bottom line in my business. That is what farmers are asking for and 
that is what a responsible government would provide for prairie 
producers.
<P>
	In a free and democratic society there are treasured freedoms and 
rights as well as responsibilities and requirements. We should obey 
the law but the law should guard our rightful freedoms. Our laws 
should respect the rights of Canadians to market legal goods to 
whomever they choose.
<P>
	The Western Grain Marketing Panel will soon be providing its 
report to the minister. Conveniently the report will be tabled after 
the House recesses for the summer. The tabling of this report will 
not be an excuse for inaction on the part of the minister. If the 
minister fails to remove the monopoly powers of the Canadian 
Wheat Board he fails to respect the principles of ownership, 
democracy and fairness, and the principle of keeping his word. 
Simply put, if he does not act, he fails. That is why the Reform 
Party moved the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to amend the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act to include a special 2 year opting out provision permitting those prairie 
producers who believe they are missing market opportunities the flexibility and 
choice to market their wheat and barley outside the jurisdiction of the board.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	We will have an opportunity to hear a response from the 
minister. I would like to see a positive response which looks at 
reform of the board, that has confidence in a board that can 
function in a continental market or an international market and in a 
domestic market, one that is open to competition, one that would 
roll up its sleeves and face the challenges ahead of it, not one that 
would bury itself away in a defensive little corner in a shell and not 
be open to the challenges facing us in marketing our products in the 
21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
really have to stretch our imagination to come to any kind of 
conclusion to support this kind of motion. The member talks about 
if the minister acted on the motion. If the minister acted on the 
motion we would be irresponsible as a government in terms of what 
the member is proposing.
<P>
	The member talked a lot about choice. What Reform is really 
prepared to do in terms of the choice here is throw an entire 
industry with a worldwide reputation for reliability and quality into 
chaos. That is what it is prepared to do with this motion in order to 
satisfy the short term demands of a few law breakers.
<P>
	His proposal would not take us forward, as he is proposing. He 
should learn a little from history. It would move us back to the late 
1800s and 1920s when the grain robber barons and the railway 
monopolies were able to take advantage of farmers. That was why 
the Canadian Wheat Board was created in the first place. I think the 
member knows this.
<P>
	I have have a unique experience in that I am from eastern Canada 
and when I was president of the National Farmers Union I could not 
at first understand why western farmers were so enamoured with 
the Canadian Wheat Board. They were so supportive of it. I 
examined in detail the Canadian Wheat Board. Perhaps the member 
should examine in detail the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	He talked about dual marketing. He talked about moving barley 
to the United States. Does he not recognize that yes, there was more 
barley moved but in the final analysis it was shown it was sold at a 
lower price.
<P>
	Does the member not recognize the advantage of single desk 
selling? We cannot have orderly marketing and dual marketing 
working side by side. It does not work that way.
<P>
	If we move away from the single desk selling of orderly 
marketing what we are really allowing is Canadian farmers to 
compete against each other in terms of driving prices down. The 
orderly marketing of single desk selling gives strength and 
marketing power to producers, and the hon. member should 
recognize that.
<P>
	Does the member not recognize that the pooling system allows 
all producers to take advantage of the booms and to limit bad prices 
when they occur and that the nation as a whole benefits?
<P>
	I want to table some facts. We did not get many facts from the 
member in his presentation. I encourage him to read the Kraft, 
Furtan and Tyrchniewicz report. It concluded based on the analysis 
of the Canadian Wheat Board performance that additional revenues 
for wheat sales averaging $265 million per year, or $13.35 per 
tonne, would be lost if the single desk were replaced by multiple 
sellers.
<P>
	It estimated that the Canadian Wheat Board added between $557 
million and $690 million per year, or $27.84 per tonne to $34.50 
per tonne over what multiple sellers would have realized in wheat 
marketing between 1985-86 and 1993-94. The member should 
realize those are some of the facts.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Dual marketing, to which the Reform Party's proposal would 
lead, would destroy-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It scares the hell out of you.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4096"> 4096 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> The member says it scares the hell out of me. It 
scares the devil out of farmers. There is no question about it 
because they support strongly the Canadian Wheat Board system.
<P>
	The Reform Party's proposal would destroy the ability of the 
Canadian Wheat Board to work effectively in producers interests. 
Anybody with any sense in terms of economics knows the lowest 
seller establishes the price.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party not realize this motion will destroy the 
ability of the Canadian Wheat Board to operate effectively in 
producers' interests, thereby undermining farmers as a whole in 
terms of maximizing returns?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I hope I have as much time 
to answer as the member had to rant and rail.
<P>
	I addressed most of the answers in my speech. I was very clear to 
underscore that I did not want this to become a spitting match to 
see who could run up the highest score. Obviously we can talk 
about a lot of ways the wheat board has failed. That is not the 
purpose of the motion. The purpose of the motion is to break the 
log jam we are currently in.
<P>
	The hon. member for Malpeque talked about his great 
experience with western agriculture-I am sure, coming from 
Prince Edward Island. He suggests that only through the Canadian 
Wheat Board do we have reliability. That is a slap in the face to 
canola producers who have had to leave wheat to keep their farms 
above water. They would have gone broke during the tough years of 
the eighties and nineties had they not been able to market outside 
the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	My father was a pioneer on the prairies. When he was a lot 
younger than I am now he had to load 60 bushels into a wagon and 
pull it 26 miles with horses. There was one buyer at the end of that 
trip. Whatever that buyer offered him for the grain was the price he 
had to take. If he did not want to take it, he had to drive the 60 
bushels all the way back to the granary. It did not make sense. He 
could not even phone ahead. There were no fax machines. There 
was no modern method of communication. That was in the 1920s.
<P>
	Now we are almost in the 21st century. We have fax machines. 
We have more marketing options available than my father could 
have dreamed of when he was driving those bushels to market.
<P>
	Dual marketing has been done and it can be done. The member 
has the attitude that it cannot be done. I guess he cannot do it. That 
is fine. That is his problem, not the problem of the prairie 
producers. I mentioned that Australia uses dual marketing. It has 
been done in Canada. It has worked. It has not been a problem.
<P>
	The member said that if we do not market through the Canadian 
Wheat Board the mark will be set by the lowest price. That is not 
the case in other commodities. It  certainly was not the case with 
canola. It certainly was not the case with peas. It certainly is not the 
case with potatoes. I wonder why it happens to be the case with 
wheat. It does not make sense. What is it about wheat? Is it because 
it is a different colour than potatoes or flax? Is it because it is a 
different weight than barley or oats? Is that why it will draw the 
lowest price? I wish the member would get his facts together and be 
a little more forthright with members in the House.
<P>
	I mentioned there is a log jam. There is a big fight going on in 
the prairies. The minister of agriculture is upset because people are 
crossing the border without getting wheat board permits as required 
under the wheat board act.
<P>
	Why do we not do something positive to fix this mess rather than 
continuing the fight? Why do we not let these people out of the 
wheat board if they want to market elsewhere?
<P>
	There was a member of the Liberal Party who was not very 
happy with what the Liberal Party was doing about the GST. That 
member had the right to get out of the Liberal Party and sit as an 
independent member, but the Liberals will not allow prairie 
producers in western Canada the option to market on their own. If 
they do worse, that is their problem but they should at least have 
the same right as the hon. member for York South-Weston who 
got out of the Liberal caucus.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with considerable interest to my colleague and I am 
delighted to see almost all the members of the Standing Committee 
on Agriculture in this House. As you are indicating I have very 
little time left, I would like to ask a question of my colleague in the 
Reform Party in order to really grasp this afternoon's issue.
<P>
	Can a farmer, who has opted out for two years, return to the fold 
within the Canadian Wheat Board?
<P>
	In other words, suppose I regularly pay my life insurance 
premiums and I am bursting with good health. Suddenly I decide to 
take a chance for the next two years and not pay my life insurance 
premiums in order to save a little money and then, two or three 
years later, pick up my life insurance policy again without penalty.
<P>
	Could my Reform Party colleague enlighten me so I might really 
understand the issue? Can the wheat grower return to the Canadian 
Wheat Board after a two-year hiatus?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, the member for Frontenac 
makes an excellent and very valid point. I thank him for the 
question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4097"> 4097 </A></B>
<P>
	Simply put, the motion calls for a two-year opting out period, 
at which time we would review whether the member for Malpeque 
was right that dual marketing could not work or whether in fact 
the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster was right that dual 
marketing could work.
<P>
	Some people would suggest that once they are out they should be 
out for life. Others would say they should be able to hop back in 
and market through the board or out of the board at will. We think 
that probably something in between is the right option. We are 
suggesting a two-year opting out period after which we can 
evaluate the effectiveness of a dual market and allow those who 
were out back in if they wanted. Others could opt out if they wanted 
after the two-year period.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
</B><B>Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the 
debate today. It is one of those very rare occasions when the 
Reform Party has turned its attention in the House to an agricultural 
issue.
<P>
	Until very recently, day after day, week after week, month after 
month would go by when the Reform Party would hardly even 
mention anything having to do with agriculture. Suddenly in the 
last couple of weeks its members have asked a flurry of farm 
questions and have proposed this opposition day on the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	I suggest it is no coincidence that all this sudden attention 
follows a rather scathing article in the <I>Western Producer</I> newspaper 
on the prairies which tore a strip off Reformers for ignoring their 
agricultural constituencies.
<P>
	I welcome whatever woke them up. I am glad to have the 
opportunity to discuss a serious and complicated matter, the serious 
and complicated business of western Canadian grain marketing.
<P>
	This is a hugely complex and important topic. It involves a 
multi-billion dollar sector of the Canadian economy and the 
backbone of the prairies. It involves the livelihoods of 130,000 
farm families across western Canada. They are spread across four 
provinces on over 80 million acres of farmland, in a dozen different 
land quality zones, producing upward of 35 million tonnes of wheat 
and barley every year, the best quality in the world, and delivering 
that grain to over 900 individual country elevator points, to 
hundreds of exacting Canadian buyers, and by truck, rail and ocean 
freight through at least five different ports to loyal customers in 
over 70 countries around the world. All that is in the face of always 
tough and sometimes fiercely predatory global competition 
dominated by some of the biggest transnational corporations in the 
world and all too frequently distorted by the meddlesome subsidies 
of foreign treasuries.
<P>
	This business is no child's play. It is big business. It is deadly 
serious. It is a business in which despite all the  odds Canada has 
established an absolutely unmatched reputation for excellence, 
especially in the last 50 years since the second world war. It is no 
accident that period of global success coincides with the existence 
and the longevity of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The board is not a buyer of grain. The board is a seller of grain. It 
sells wheat and barley on behalf of all prairie producers. Through 
the board farmers maximize their marketing clout so they can 
compete effectively around the world from a position of combined 
strength backed by the world's best grain standards, the world's 
best quality control system, the world's best market intelligence 
network, the world's best weather surveillance system, the world's 
best market development techniques, and the world's best before 
market and after market customer services.
<P>
	These characteristics which are part of the Canadian Wheat 
Board system have generated remarkable customer loyalty and 
respect. They have helped to earn premiums from the marketplace. 
They have gained and retained market share for Canada.
<P>
	In total prairie farmers account for about 6 per cent or 7 per cent 
of the world's grain production, but they occupy about 20 per cent 
of the world's grain markets. The board has accomplished this 
within the confines of world trading rules and regulations.
<P>
	At the behest of the United States, the activities of the Canadian 
Wheat Board have been investigated not once, not twice, but at 
least three different times. Each time the board has been vindicated 
as a fair trading organization.
<P>
	Our global customers have strong words of support for the 
Canadian Wheat Board. I have met with them in person in places 
like Beijing, Tokyo, Singapore and Sao Paulo. They have told me 
how they value their longstanding relationship with the CWB built 
on quality, reliability, consistency, mutual trust and respect.
<P>
	They have told me that if Canada did not have the CWB but had 
a system like the one in the United States, for example, we would 
lose much of our distinctiveness. We would not have many of the 
qualities which set us apart and put us a cut above the rest. We 
would not have the key element of product differentiation which 
now helps us stand out in the marketplace. They might as well buy 
their supplies from Minneapolis, Kansas City or New Orleans.
<P>
	This same sentiment about the board was echoed not long ago in 
Canada by Mr. Ken Beswick. A couple of months ago Mr. Beswick 
resigned as a Canadian Wheat Board commissioner in a dispute 
with the board about barley pricing. He was forthright in his 
criticisms that are clearly on the public record, but he was also 
forthright in his praise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4098"> 4098 </A></B>
<P>
	Just to balance the record, let me quote from the May 9 edition 
of the Manitoba <I>Co-operator</I> newspaper:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Beswick says he is, and always has been, a staunch supporter of the Canadian 
Wheat Board as a single desk marketing agency for export wheat and barley. He 
also says the so-called continental market proposed by some is just another 
word for an open market. While the feed and barley trade would likely see little 
effect of an open border, Beswick said he has become convinced it would be bad 
news for the malting barley producer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The dynamics of the marketplace would probably cause Canadian prices to 
fall going into the U.S. market, Beswick said. We saw that, (during the brief time 
the border was open in 1993) and I think it would happen again.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was one of the people who said it wouldn't happen and I was wrong-In a 
candid interview last week, Beswick condemned the extreme views which have 
polarized the industry between those who want no change to the board and those 
who want it eliminated. I have no patience at all for the lunatic fringe, he said. I 
think they do not help and I really lament what has happened to the industry I 
have spent my entire life in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think there are people out there who are not talking about the right things, he 
said. There are people who are taking my resignation from the board as 
something it was not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am in no way saying the board is not an effective marketer, he said. I think 
that it is among the best in the world at marketing grain. It stands toe to toe with 
the heavy weights out there in the global environment and I think from my 
window at the board I would not advocate the elimination of single-desk status.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	The article concludes with the following quotation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The single-desk seller is a powerful way to be. It is a powerful, powerful 
marketing tool in the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A number of questions obviously occur in the course of the 
debate. Do farmers on the prairies readily acknowledge the 
strengths in the marketing system we now have in place? Do they 
maintain the collaborative will to combine their strength through 
single desk selling? Or, would they prefer to go it alone as 130,000 
individual sellers? What is precisely and commonly agreed upon as 
the definition of dual marketing? Is it physically possible to have 
the best of both worlds? Is it feasible to have two quite different 
marketing systems functioning effectively side by side without the 
one interfering with or undermining the other?
<P>
	What about those apparently attractive spot market prices that 
appear from time to time across the border in the United States? 
The Canadian Wheat Board system now captures those prices for 
distribution among all prairie producers, together with all returns 
received by the board from every other market worldwide. In this 
day and age is that pooling principle still valid in the minds of 
farmers? Or, should individuals be enabled to collect those spot 
prices by themselves and for themselves, leaving a somewhat 
diluted price pool for everyone else?
<P>
	In any given year the volume of wheat and barley we can move 
into the U.S. market is in the order of  approximately two million 
tonnes, but we produce over 30 million tonnes. Relatively 
speaking, then, how much should we be preoccupied with the 
American market that obviously has some access problems for us? 
How much should we change our system to seize U.S. 
opportunities when they present themselves if that in some way 
compromises our global capability?
<P>
	Are there distinctions to be drawn among wheat, durum, feed 
barley and malting barley in the way in which each of them is 
marketed? What about wheat board corporate governance, 
accountability, audit procedures, public information, flexible 
pricing, flexible pooling, value added processing or niche markets?
<P>
	These are among the many questions in the debate about western 
grain marketing which require a thorough and thoughtful airing. 
They do not require bombast and bluster, not rumour and innuendo, 
not abusive language from the Reform Party or from those who 
would wilfully ignore the law. The issues are too serious. The 
consequences are too profound to play fast and loose on questions 
about grain marketing.
<P>
	I know different groups of farmers hold widely differing views 
on these very serious issues. They hold their respective views with 
a great deal of conviction. The debate among farmers about these 
issues has been unfolding across western Canada for the better part 
of 25 years with varying degrees of intensity from time to time. 
The debate has become particularly acute in the past three or four 
years.
<P>
	I hear from each side in the debate virtually every day. I listen 
very carefully to farmers on all sides. Last summer it was clear the 
debate about western grain marketing was quite literally going 
around in circles.
<P>
	One day last year two opposing groups of farmers of equal size 
turned up at my constituency office in Regina to picket against each 
other. They formed a big circle and went around and around the 
office building, all of them picketing against each other together.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The debate lacked focus and structure. It lacked the most 
rudimentary foundation of a common base of factual information. 
It generated far more heat than light. It was all geared to lobby me 
and the government to a particular point of view when it should 
have been aimed toward farmers themselves, to persuade one 
another.
<P>
	In these circumstances in July of last year I established the 
western grain marketing panel to give the whole discussion some 
reasonable framework. The panel consists of nine very strong 
individuals. Bill Duke and Avery Sahl from Saskatchewan, Jack 
Gore, John Pearson and Wally Madill from Alberta, Owen 
McAulay and Jim Leibfried from Manitoba, John Neufeld to 
provide the national grain trade perspective, all under the able 
chairmanship of Mr. Tom Molloy from Saskatoon with Murray 
Cormach from Winnipeg as executive secretary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4099"> 4099 </A></B>
<P>
	Anyone with any familiarity with western grain would 
recognize and acknowledge the vast depth of knowledge and 
experience represented by this eminent group of Canadians and 
their broad diversity of personal opinions from one end of the 
spectrum to the other. They have worked diligently and 
constructively together, taking on what was admittedly a very 
tough assignment. They have conducted themselves throughout 
this assignment with the utmost of integrity.
<P>
	I asked the panel to do four things. First, to research, prepare and 
publish the necessary information to provide farmers and other 
stakeholders with all the facts about everything that is involved in 
the complicated business of grain marketing.
<P>
	Second, to conduct a prairie wide series of open townhall 
meetings to ensure that everyone has reasonable access to all the 
relevant facts and figures and a full and fair opportunity to ask 
questions and express their opinions.
<P>
	Third, to hold formal public hearings at which all of the various 
sides in the marketing debate can advance their arguments, present 
their supporting evidence and be examined and cross examined to 
draw out all the options, all the pros and cons, all the benefits, all 
the consequences of one marketing system versus another.
<P>
	Fourth, to submit a report indicating what the panel has heard 
from farmers, what areas of consensus exist and what might be 
done to deal with those issues on which there is no consensus.
<P>
	The first three of those tasks have been fully and successfully 
completed. The fourth and final task, the report, is in its final stages 
of preparation. It should be available within a couple of weeks.
<P>
	This brings me to the peculiarity of the Reform motion that is 
before the House today. To have this marketing discussion can be 
useful but the Reform motion does not make a lot of sense, calling 
as it does for an arbitrary, pre-emptive strike by way of a legislative 
amendment on the eve of the western grain marketing panel report 
in just a couple of weeks.
<P>
	We should not now pre-empt the process. We should not now 
cast aside the panel, ignore the input and the hard work of all of 
those who have participated, including several hundred farmers 
across western Canada. Even the Reform Party itself and the 
member who is sponsoring today's motion appeared before the 
panel and did not at that time make the proposal that he is 
advancing today.
<P>
	When I set up the panel it was a serious initiative. It was not 
smoke and mirrors. It was and is intended to produce sound results. 
I hope and expect it will do so when we see the report very soon. 
Should there be changes in the grain marketing system? The 
answer to that question is obviously yes. Many ideas have been put 
before the western grain marketing panel. The Canadian  Wheat 
Board has suggested several kinds of change. Strong board 
supporters in other political parties, like for example the premier of 
Saskatchewan, have also acknowledged the need for change and 
modernization. The important thing is to get it right. That is what 
the western grain marketing panel is all about: changes that make 
sense to the largest possible number of farmers in a fair, 
conscientious and thoughtful way.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	When all of the facts have been aired, when everyone has had an 
opportunity to have their say, when all the arguments have been 
weighed carefully and all the information is in and analysed, that is 
what the western grain marketing panel is supposed to do. Once it 
provides its report we will all be in a position to make the kinds of 
decisions that are needed for the future.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, may I conclude with one final thought? In 
making those decisions, let us be prudent and let us make sure that 
we do not end up throwing the baby out with the bath water.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is partially right, and I can 
therefore state that the Bloc Quebecois will support this opposition 
motion 80 per cent, if I may put it that way.
<P>
	The minister must, however, admit along with me that, over the 
years, the Canadian Wheat Board ought to have given some 
thought to modernizing itself a bit, to bringing in some 
improvements as the year 2000 approaches. For example, the 
political appointment of its membership ought to be re-examined. I 
have looked at the CVs of the president, the vice-president and the 
three members. Impressive as they are, there is something missing.
<P>
	Grain producers need to have some say over the operations of the 
board. Board membership ought to include people involved 
hands-on, the person who ploughs, the person who seeds, the 
person who harvests, the farm owner, who are best placed to offer 
suggestions and play an effective role on the board. You will, of 
course, reply that there is already an advisory committee made up 
of 11 farmers appointed by them, but it must be admitted that this 
committee is only advisory in nature, and often little heeded.
<P>
	There would also need to be an examination of the 
aggressiveness of the Canadian Wheat Board on the international 
market. It seems that a number of farmers, not the majority, but 35 
or 40 per cent of producers nevertheless, are questioning the 
board's aggressiveness in seeking new markets and therefore better 
prices, and that is a big enough number to raise some questions. If 
it were 1, 2 or 5 per cent, you could say: ``It is always the same 
malcontents 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4100"> 4100 </A></B>
<P>
complaining'', but if one-third, or more than one-third, of the 
membership is involved, it is time to start asking some questions.
<P>
	The same thing applies to shipping. Shipping could do with 
improvement, to raise user satisfaction.
<P>
	Finally, the Department of Justice-and this is my final 
point-shares some of the blame. It seems a few growers sell their 
grain overseas on their own. There have been a few court cases here 
and there, but the government has dragged its feet in enforcing its 
own legislation. The legislation needs to be adhered to by 
everyone.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, in closing, if it is his firm intention to make 
improvements to the Canadian Wheat Board, in order to make it 
modern, efficient, and as acceptable to users as possible, in other 
words to the 120,000 western grain producers.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I could not 
help overhearing certain comments about restricting the member 
from making some comments in the House. I would like to remind 
hon. members that the rule pertaining to this motion is 20 minutes 
for a statement and 10 minutes of comments and/or questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Madam Speaker, that verification is very timely 
and very helpful, thank you.
<P>
	The question asked by the hon. gentleman from Frontenac is 
very important. As I said during my remarks, I have placed a great 
deal of faith and confidence in the integrity and hard work of the 
western grain marketing panel. We are now, quite literally, within a 
few days of receiving the panel's report. I expect it to be a very 
useful document.
<P>
	Once I receive the report and we have all had a few days to digest 
it and come to understand it, it would be my intention to move as 
rapidly as possible to respond to what the report recommends. I 
believe that would be useful.
<P>
	On the various topics that were covered in the hon. gentleman's 
comments, he referred to the modernization of the board. Of course 
that issue is before the western grain marketing panel, as well as 
issues related to corporate governance, issues related to 
accountability, issues related to public information.
<P>
	It may well be that the panel would recommend some kind of 
method of electing a board of directors. That is a possibility. I do 
not know. That idea was recommended to the panel by some of the 
groups that appeared before it. Perhaps on reflection, the panel 
members will embrace that idea. They might not, but I am sure they 
are going to turn their minds to the general issues relating to 
corporate governance and accountability.
<P>
	I imagine the panel will also have some things to say about the 
information needs and requirements of farmers to ensure that they 
have all the facts, figures and ongoing information about what the 
board is, what it is not, what it does, what it does not do and so 
forth, which is obviously to make sure that the board's clientele is 
fully informed about what it does on their behalf.
<P>
	It is worth noting, as a final comment in response to this 
question, that four or five years ago, the Canadian Wheat Board 
commissioned a management study by the management consulting 
firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche. Deloitte &amp; Touche provided the board 
with a report on how the board, even within its current system of 
corporate governance, could improve a number of areas of 
management. The board has informed me that virtually every one 
of those recommendations from Deloitte &amp; Touche have been 
implemented in the intervening years, and the board's operations 
have improved as a consequence.
<P>
	While I may disagree with the hon. gentleman on the 
fundamentals of a few other issues, I appreciate the tone that was 
involved in his question on this particular topic. What I hope we are 
all seeking to do is to achieve the very best possible marketing 
system for farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I think some of the frustration of my colleagues 
was over the fact that they thought when an opposition party put 
forward a motion on a supply day they might have been given the 
courtesy to question the minister first.
<P>
	However, I agree with the minister's comments about going 
around in circles. Farmers have been going around in circles over 
these issues for a long time. The reason this is happening is simply 
because of the inaction on the part of governments to correct the 
problem, which is to reform our marketing system.
<P>
	The minister went to great lengths to laud the qualifications of 
the members on marketing panel, and I am not going to challenge 
or dispute those remarks.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	However, I question whether we will see much or any new 
material put on the table as a result of their deliberations. It would 
surprise me if they did not recommend a change in the structure of 
the board. If they do not do that, they have completely misread the 
industry. I suspect they would suggest some freedom in the 
domestic market if not broader.
<P>
	I wonder why the minister went to great lengths to quote one 
person, Mr. Beswick, but seemed to ignore the polling results and 
the surveys and plebiscites I mentioned in my presentation which 
are as high as 66 per cent in Alberta and 58 per cent in 
Saskatchewan in favour of changes to the board and dual 
marketing. Why did the minister not address the concerns of the 
tens of thousands rather than the praises of one?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4101"> 4101 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like an answer to the two fundamental questions I ask 
in my speech. First, does the minister believe dual marketing is 
impossible? He has talked about the philosophy of it and what he 
hears. I have said what I believe. I would like to hear what he 
believes.
<P>
	Second, does the minister believe that a farmer should not have 
the right to sell his or her wheat or barley either to a pooled return 
account through the board or individually on a cash sale inside or 
outside the board? I would like to know his personal stand on those 
two issues. It is very important to the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Madam Speaker, those are the types of questions 
the Western Grain Marketing Panel has been addressing in the 
course of its hearings and town hall meetings across western 
Canada and in all of its deliberations.
<P>
	I think it is import to first have a process by which everyone can 
participate in a full, open and transparent way and then allow the 
panel to do its work, conduct its analysis and provide the very best 
possible advice.
<P>
	On the issue of polling, it is my understanding that market 
research in western Canada has indicated that if the board is at 
stake, if it is not an issue of having your cake and eating it too, if it 
is clearly a case of one or the other, to pick or choose one marketing 
system or another, often the support for the Canadian Wheat Board 
rises to over 65 per cent or 70 per cent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am delighted to rise in the debate on the motion by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster in this opposition day.
<P>
	First, we should stress the importance the Reform caucus 
appears to be giving to the Canadian Wheat Board, since last week 
there was a full dress debate in this House, a very technical one, 
however, on the operation and the internal workings of this 
para-public organization.
<P>
	We are forced to acknowledge that the spirit of this motion 
transcends the confusion and incoherence reigning within the 
Reform Party, which is even hoping to form the government at the 
time of the next elections. It is rather distressing to see what the 
Reform members in their efforts to defend the interests of the 
people in the west. It is a bit like having a member for Quebec or 
Ontario demanding an end to supply management in the case of 
eggs, poultry or milk.
<P>
	The member for Lisgar-Marquette last week tabled a bill to 
change the internal audit system of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Overall this bill was in response to an obvious need for the CWB to 
be transparent and efficient to the thousands of farmers it 
represents and who depend primarily on its actions and marketing 
expertise.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	So here we have one of his fellow party members introducing a 
motion that nullifies the member's commendable efforts to directly 
help farm producers, who simply swallow the decisions made by 
the Canadian Wheat Board more often than not.
<P>
	We are well aware that this organization's basic aim is to 
promote Canadian wheat in the international marketplace and thus 
obtain the best possible prices. In these terms, the direct effect of 
today's motion would be to cause greater damage to producers 
wanting to make their own way in this jungle of grain speculation, 
more than it would be to really provide profitable wheat and barley 
marketing opportunities, as the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster would have us believe.
<P>
	The motion undoes, after many long and difficult years, the 
considerable efforts put out by the industry to maximize profits in 
the sale of Canadian wheat with the simple aim of maintaining 
production standards. The reforms proposed for the internal 
operation of the Canadian Wheat Board bear witness to the desire 
of all interested parties to find a better commercial niche for wheat 
producers.
<P>
	I have a question: would it really benefit producers to free up the 
market so that each of them could go as far as their ambitions 
would take them? Knowing the vulnerability of this industry 
personally, and particularly all the factors outside of simple grain 
production, I can only say that this measure would mean financial 
suicide for any individual wanting to go it alone.
<P>
	How can we consider making a special provision whereby 
producers could choose not to have their crops marketed by the 
CWB for a two-year period, when this marketing is the board's 
essential function? How will we explain the return to the collective 
of farmers who, having tested the market, recognize that the real 
profits to be made arise from the marketing efforts of the Canadian 
Wheat Board?
<P>
	This alternative defies understanding. It would allow producers 
to compete, to a certain extent, with their colleagues, until such 
time as they understand that the real financial advantage lies in 
agricultural and commercial union. Is this morally acceptable? I 
strongly doubt it.
<P>
	If we looked for a different image to express the same idea, the 
first one to come to mind would likely be the parable of the 
prodigal son, for this situation is rooted in the frustrations of a 
number of producers operating businesses along the Canada-US 
border. The temptation to sell their harvest directly to local mills is 
strong, given the attraction of on-the-spot payment in American 
dollars.
<P>

<P>
	This practice is completely acceptable in a period of prosperity 
and economic growth. But what would become of this mercenary 
attitude if, overnight, the price of wheat fell dramatically?
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	It is important to remember that this situation is entirely 
plausible and that one of the reasons the Canadian Wheat Board 
was created was to play a stabilizing role. The Canadian Wheat 
Board's monopoly on the sale of wheat creates a significant 
balance for producers, who can thus count on an income that is 
constant and independent of market fluctuations.
<P>
	During prosperous periods, it is legitimate to question the 
relevance and benefit of remaining within an organization 
governing all areas of production, which, to make matters worse, 
do not correspond to current modern practice. However, it is 
becoming essential to take a much more moderate, and often much 
less dramatic, approach to the issue. And, while we are on the 
topic, I would like to reiterate my scepticism regarding the 
rationality of such an initiative. The financial security of many 
grain producers is involved, without mentioning the impacts that 
will result from the coming passage of Bill C-38 on mediation in 
the case of farm debt. We will see a tightening of conditions of 
eligibility for government support in cases of debt. We should not 
mistakenly plunge farmers into a situation that could drive them to 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	For the benefit of farmers and members of the public in Quebec, 
I would like to give a brief overview of the Canadian Wheat Board, 
because it has authority over four provinces only, three in their 
entirety and one partially.
<P>
	Grain producers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and some 
parts of British Columbia are affected and governed by the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The board exports 23 per cent of all world exports. 23 per cent of 
world exports of wheat and barley are governed and exported by 
the Canadian Wheat Board and have passed through its hands. It is 
the granary of the world.
<P>
	The objectives of the Canadian Wheat Board are important and 
are comparable to those of the Canadian Dairy Commission, which 
is well known to everyone in Quebec. It is the Canadian Dairy 
Commission which is responsible for marketing and buying all the 
industrial milk produced in Quebec, which represents 47.4 per cent 
of Canada's total production.
<P>
	The primary purpose of the Canadian Wheat Board is therefore 
to maximize the revenues of 130,000 grain producers, whose 
harvest it sells.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board obviously needs certain powers, and 
is, for example, the sole marketing agency for wheat and barley 
destined for export or for human  consumption. Clearly, this means 
that each bushel of wheat Canada exports must go through the 
CWB. Bushels of wheat destined for human consumption in 
Canada must go through the CWB. Therefore, wheat and barley 
that will be fed to animals, for example, is not governed by the 
Board.
<P>
	Sales, to put this in context, vary between 3 and 6 billion dollars 
annually, so the Board is an important economic power.
<P>
	The Board's composition upsets me a bit, because of the 
notorious political appointments. You know how these go. 
Members of the board of referees of your local CEC, or members 
of the unemployment insurance office, now the employment 
insurance office, are political appointees. Usually they are good 
friends of the regime. The Board is composed of a chairman, a 
vice-chairman and three commissioners appointed by the 
government through an order in council.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I must 
apologize to the hon. member for Frontenac but, it being 5:30 p.m., 
I will allow him a few seconds to sum up. He will have eight 
minutes more when we resume debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, I bow to your 
directive. I shall resume and complete my address in a few minutes 
with the eight minutes left to me.
<P>
	In closing for now, I will say that the advisory committee can 
play a significant role, since it is made up of 11 members appointed 
by the producers. These are, generally, 11 grain producers and they 
know what grain production is all about. Unfortunately, their power 
is virtually nil. More on this later.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being 5:30

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill S-8, an act respecting Queen's University at Kingston, be 
read the second time and, by unanimous consent, referred to the 
committee of the whole.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I rise to give a very brief summary of 
the relevant provisions of this bill so that members may be aware of 
what is going on here.
<P>
	This is a private bill that was introduced in the Senate to amend 
the charter of Queen's University. Queen's University was 
established by royal charter in 1841. As the result of a complicated 
series of interpretations of the British North America Act and 
various other acts of Parliament and legislatures, it is an act that is 
amendable by the federal Parliament and not by the province of 
Ontario, in which province the university is situate.
<P>
	The charter has been amended from time to time by various acts 
of Parliament that have passed through this House. The current bill 
is the latest such amendment, and deals with various items. If 
members have questions about any of the items I would be pleased 
to review them during the committee of the whole if members wish 
to hear more about it.
<P>
	Basically, the purpose of the changes is to permit students, staff 
and faculty of the university to participate in the board of trustees 
which is the principal governing body of the university. The 
changes have been adopted in the Senate already where they were 
reviewed in committee. I do not believe there is any particular 
difficulty. There was no opposition expressed. The changes are all 
ones requested by the university to its charter.
<P>
	In my submission I think they are all ones that would commend 
themselves to all hon. members. I ask for the adoption of this bill 
today.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-270, an act to amend the Financial Administration Act 
(session of Parliament), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the purpose of this bill is fairly 
straightforward. It is to prevent the kind of abuse that the House 
suffered under the former government in 1989 when Governor 
General's special warrants were used and the regular supply 
proceedings available to the government were avoided.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	I believe this bill finds support in all parties. I am delighted that 
is the case. It is one which I introduced in the previous Parliament, 
following the unfortunate events that I am about to describe. I 
understand from one of my colleagues from Edmonton this 
circumstance also took place in the early sixties when another 
Conservative government was in office.
<P>
	This is an unusual bill. Perhaps I could explain it briefly.
<P>
	Governor General's special warrants are available to a 
government to use during election time. That part is fairly clear. It 
has always been the case. When Parliament is dissolved and is 
unable to be called together to vote supply to enable the 
government to defray expenses of the public service, it is normal to 
have a mechanism in place whereby a government may access 
public funds from the treasury for the purpose of paying the bills. 
The method by which this money is made available is by Governor 
General's special warrant. It has been commonplace to make those 
warrants available between sessions of Parliament.
<P>
	Members will recall there was an election on November 21, 
1988. Parliament was convened on December 12 of that year. The 
session lasted for about two weeks. Aside from the speech from the 
throne and a brief debate on it, which was never completed, no 
supply was voted during the two-week session. The free trade bill 
was introduced and passed in all stages with the multiple use of 
closure.
<P>
	The passage of that bill ended the session. The Commons 
adjourned for Christmas to a fixed date in February. Parliament 
was then prorogued immediately before the fixed date in February 
until a date in April. Since no supply had been voted, no final 
supplementary estimates had been approved and, indeed, no 
mid-term supplementary estimates had been approved, the  
government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4104"> 4104 </A></B>
<P>
chose to help itself to the funds in the treasury by way of Governor 
General's special warrants.
<P>
	Three special warrants were granted. The first was for $80 
million in January 1989. The second was for $500 million and 
change in February 1989. Then, on April 1, since Parliament was 
sitting on April 3 and interim supply was urgent and required, a 
third warrant was issued for $6.2 billion. When the House got 
together, supply was finally voted, although a special order was 
adopted in the House delaying the approval of main supply.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I raised a question of privilege on the legitimacy of special 
mandates on April 6, 1989. In ruling on May 2 of the same year, the 
Speaker's finding was that ``-the government has respected all the 
procedures required by the House''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The question is whether this practice should be allowed to 
continue.
<P>
	I drafted an amendment to the Financial Administration Act 
which defines the time when Parliament is deemed to be not in 
session. These are available when Parliament is not in session only. 
Therefore, the deeming section will say that Parliament is not in 
session from the date of dissolution until the day two weeks prior to 
the first day fixed by the proclamation summoning Parliament to 
meet for the dispatch of business.
<P>
	In other words, up to two weeks before a new Parliament begins 
warrants will be available. Once that two-week period starts 
running, warrants will no longer be available. The date will be 
fixed at the time of dissolution. Every dissolution proclamation 
includes not just the date of the dissolution, which is the date it is 
issued, it specifies the date for the summoning of a new Parliament. 
That date will be the one on which the government must attend for 
the purpose of helping itself to supply during the election period.
<P>
	Of course, a government would be free to vote supply for the full 
year before an election is called and obviate the necessity for 
further recourse to the House for additional assistance. However, 
the fear is that if we do not put in place such a procedure as this, we 
may find ourselves in a situation where a government could call 
Parliament together, have a speech from the throne and announce 
that it does not need any legislation from the House, adjourn the 
House of Commons and then one year later call the House back and 
spend the rest of the year thriving on Governor General's special 
warrants.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	It would have to prorogue the House before it could do that under 
the current law, but prorogation could occur whenever the 
government ran out of money. From  then on we could run on 
warrants until the House was called back into session.
<P>
	In my view this would be a flagrant abuse of the Constitution and 
quite improper. Under the current law which is so open ended that 
is exactly what a government could do. Frankly it is the exact 
procedure followed by the previous government in the period 
between February and April 3, 1989 when Parliament reconvened.
<P>
	In my view it was an abuse of the rules. It is something that we as 
defenders of parliamentary liberties ought to act on and bring to an 
end. The bill is designed to bring it to an end. It will prevent the 
situation that occurred in 1989 from recurring. It will also prevent a 
government from feeling that it has the right to step into a situation 
such as I have described and do without the House of Commons 
sitting for an extended period of time.
<P>
	It is not in the interest of Canadians. It is certainly not in the 
interest of representative democracy. It is not in the interest of any 
opposition and not in the long term interests of any government.
<P>
	I am pleased to propose the bill today. If the wording of bill 
causes any members concern, it is something that could be looked 
at, at committee stage of the bill where it can be studied thoroughly 
and the wording gone over with some care.
<P>
	Some members have raised the issue of using these special 
warrants for borrowing purposes. It could also be examined if the 
draft bill impinges on that area. I am unaware that it does but it 
may. If so, I would be happy to have a full discussion of the issue in 
committee.
<P>
	When the procedure was last used in 1989 there was some 
attempt by me and a few other members to raise the matter in 
committee and look at the way funds were used based on the 
reports tabled by the government following the use of the warrants. 
The questions were put before one of the standing committees of 
the House, but they were treated contemptuously by many 
members on the government side who regarded them as improper 
and as interfering in what they regarded as an unfettered right of 
the government to use this kind of discretion.
<P>
	It is time a limit was placed on this kind of discretion. The limit 
proposed in the bill is fair and reasonable to government and to 
opposition. I hope it commends itself to all hon. members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands for brilliantly 
defending his Bill C-270 before the Sub-committee on Private 
Members' Business so that it was declared a votable item.
<P>
	My analysis of the bill, which contains only one clause, was 
made easier by the member's kindness in sending me an article he 
published in the <I>Canadian Parliamentary Review</I> in the summer of 
1990 on supply bills and the  Governor General's special warrants. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4105"> 4105 </A></B>
<P>
The article is quite detailed and refers to the particular situation the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands described earlier.
<P>
	I will not linger over the 1988 and 1989 precedents, which I read. 
Rather, I will try to situate this debate in terms of the cardinal 
principles of the parliamentary system.
<P>
	The debate on the sole clause in Bill C-270 means basically 
going back over the whole of British parliamentary history. In my 
opinion, we have to go as far back as 1215 to discover the rules 
governing us today. The issue being raised today was raised in 
other terms in the baronial rebellion of 1215, which led to the 
signing of the Magna Carta.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	What were the barons after? The possibility of being judged by 
their peers and the power to control spending by the crown. The 
year was 1215. Nearly a thousand years later, we are faced with the 
same problem, the intensity is different and the context is different, 
but the same thread runs through it.
<P>
	King John, nicknamed John Lackland, was not without land for 
no reason: he had sold it for his war effort. The barons did not want 
to finance him any more; hence his name. Most of his French 
possessions had been sold and he found himself in a position where 
his name went into the history books.
<P>
	King John conceded the Magna Carta in 1215. It was the 
forerunner of our parliaments and gave the barons the right to 
control spending. It did not last very long. When the king's 
situation improved somewhat, he tried once again to impose his 
priorities. In 1256, new rebellions broke out, and the Provisions of 
Oxford essentially renewed the Magna Carta's control over 
spending by the crown and the individual freedoms of the 
nobility-to be sure. At the time, little if any attention was paid to 
the ordinary folk, who were in a state of considerable servitude. We 
have come a long way.
<P>
	Then what happened? Of course the crown gave the barons and 
then Parliament the right to control public spending, except no 
sessions of Parliament were planned. If it had no spending to 
approve, Parliament was not required to meet. This gave rise, over 
the centuries, to some strange situations where Parliament did not 
convene for 20 or 30 years at a stretch. Pressure was again brought 
to bear, and the people's elected representatives again demanded 
that Parliament be required to convene at least once a year. That 
was four or five hundred years ago.
<P>
	The Constitution Act, 1867 flows directly from these, I was 
almost going to say medieval, struggles to have Parliament's 
sittings enshrined in law. Today, section 20 of our Constitution 
states that Parliament must sit at least once a year, and, since 1982, 
this obligation has been extended to the provincial legislatures.
<P>
	Need I point out that another section of our Constitution, section 
53, which is based on what was happening in Great Britain at the 
time, also deals with these questions? When we say that any bill 
involving financial expenditure or allocation of public money must 
originate in this House, we are recognizing clearly the control and 
decision making power of elected representatives over the 
management of public finances.
<P>
	Naturally, the government sets its budgetary priorities. This is 
one of the primary responsibilities in its budgetary policy 
statement. But in our system of Parliamentary democracy, the 
government cannot remain in power without the support of 
members for its budgetary policy statement. One may or may not 
be in agreement with policies, but one rule that is a well established 
part of our constitutional conventions, although it is not written 
down in any text of law, requires that in financial matters, the 
government must always have the confidence of the House. Over 
the years, ministerial responsibility has become more relaxed, but 
certainly not to the extent of not applying when it comes to 
spending public money.
<P>
	Of course, as the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands has 
mentioned, the provisions which make it possible to govern by 
special warrant of the governor general are set down in law as 
being measures that must be applied in case of emergency, when 
there is a requirement to act rapidly and Parliament is unavailable. 
The best example of Parliament's unavailability, if I may put it that 
way, Madam Speaker, is when the House has been dissolved. The 
government cannot summon a Parliament that no longer exists 
once a writ of election has been issued. It must wait until 
Parliament has been reconvened, on the date set out in the writ of 
election.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Outside of these periods, are there any exceptional situations in 
which government use of Governor General's warrants would be 
applicable, knowing full well that the government can indeed recall 
Parliament, even during recess? This is what we shall see in 
committee, what we must examine in committee. At the second 
reading stage, we must stick to the principles themselves which 
underlie this bill, and these are extremely valid ones. When we 
have heard the witnesses, we will probably be able to re-examine 
whether the hon. member's bill is too restrictive or not.
<P>
	I will recall to mind a precedent in 1985-86, when using 
Governor General's warrants led to a rather odd situation, namely 
having to borrow money to use the funds authorized by the 
Governor General's warrant, but since the time allowed to function 
under Governor General's warrant is very limited, the lending rate 
reflected this and we had to pay a higher rate of interest. It would 
have been far simpler to recall the House and get the supply voted.
<P>
	My concern, which will be addressed in committee, is that 
adoption of this clause must put us into a situation  like the one that 
prevails in the U.S. There, virtually every year, or every year there 
is a legislative or presidential election, sometimes both, there is a 
road block between the White House and the Congress. This means 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4106"> 4106 </A></B>
<P>
that, overnight, government employees start to wonder if they will 
be paid, if social services can be provided and, in many areas, 
whether such essential services as the administration of justice, 
police services, airport services can be provided.
<P>
	These will be some of the questions we will need to address in 
committee, but in principle I am pleased to support Bill C-270.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on the very important topic of 
the power of Parliament to control public spending.
<P>
	The Constitution Act, 1867, stipulates that all financial 
legislation including government expenditures must originate in 
the House of Commons. Standing Order 80(1) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All aids and supplies granted to-the Parliament of Canada are the sole gift of 
the House of Commons, and all bills for granting such aids and supplies ought to 
begin in the House, as it is the undoubted right of the House to direct, limit, and 
appoint in all such bills,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This brings about an interesting question I should like to ask 
colleagues on both sides of the House. When was the last time as 
elected representatives of the people of Canada were they able to 
direct or limit spending in the country? It is an interesting question. 
Perhaps we could investigate it further.
<P>
	When was the last time a bureaucrat or a cabinet minister came 
to a member of the House and asked for help in figuring out what 
tax dollars could be spent on? When was the last time members of 
the House other than cabinet members were able to make a choice 
and say no to one project and yes to another? It is our right in the 
House under the Constitution.
<P>
	Let us look at the problems we have had with the estimates. The 
Prime Minister says that it is confidence: ``You have to vote for it. 
Hold your nose. No questions allowed. Otherwise the government 
will fail''. That type of arm wrestling should not be tolerated by 
members of the House elected to ensure that Parliament controls 
the public purse. This House, not the government, controls the 
spending and the raising of taxes in this country. You would hardly 
think so on many occasions.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, as I have indicated, seldom is the answer that we 
can influence or reduce public spending but never has this 
government trusted us enough to allow us to do our job, which is to 
represent the will of Canadians and to make the choices on how the 
government spends tax dollars. What I am trying to point  out is 
there is a clear, complete and absolute separation between this 
House and the government for this House approves and gives to the 
government money for it to spend.
<P>
	Over the last 100 years in Canada the power to control 
government spending has moved farther and farther away from 
Parliament. The executive power over the public purse has been 
expanded. Cabinet and senior civil servants have slowly but surely 
increased their ability to control what money is spent, where it is 
spent and why it is spent.
<P>
	This concentration of power over the tax dollars is wrong. It goes 
against everything that democracy stands for. Perhaps the ultimate 
manifestation of the Prime Minister and cabinet's control over our 
tax dollars lies in the use of Governor General special warrants 
which the member for Kingston and the Islands has introduced his 
private members' bill to curtail.
<P>
	When Parliament is not in session and there is an urgent need for 
funds, the Financial Administration Act allows for a special 
warrant in the name of the Governor General to be prepared. We 
are talking about an urgent need for funds, not a convenient need 
for funds without recalling the House. There must be a clear and 
separate difference between the two.
<P>
	It is not for government to end run Parliament if it finds it 
inconvenient and it would rather not bring us back here and request 
us to donate and give to it and it uses the special warrants to 
circumvent Parliament's authority. In theory the special warrants 
are to be issued when some unforeseen need arises and Parliament 
cannot be recalled to deal with the issue. Certainly in the case of 
war, famine or in an emergency situation the government must not 
be left without recourse to funding. I think we all agree with that.
<P>
	History tells us that special warrants are often used as a way to 
circumvent Parliament. In 1989, as my hon. colleague from 
Kingston and the Islands pointed out, the Conservative government 
issued four special warrants to obtain regular appropriations rather 
than use the supplementary estimates. At the time the House was 
adjourned and not prorogued.
<P>
	Special warrant, as we pointed out, is essentially decreed by the 
Prime Minister's office. It gives the government power to take 
money from the consolidated revenue fund and use it for whatever 
reason it so desires. After the special warrant has been issued, there 
is nothing Parliament can do to recapture the money. Nothing. No 
checks and balances apply to a special warrant. Clearly the 
restrictions on the use of the Governor General special warrants 
need to be tightened.
<P>
	The role of Parliament in spending tax dollars is crucial. Legally 
it is Parliament and only Parliament that can approve the spending 
by appropriating funds. Often this fact is overlooked or explained 
away by ministers and  their officials but it is paramount to a 
democratic system. Canadians go to the polls every four or five 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4107"> 4107 </A></B>
<P>
years because they want to influence the future of our nation, yet 
the people they elect to express their will have very little input into 
how decisions are made and even the approval of these decisions. 
Their input is silenced, avoided or limited.
<P>
	This bill would be a step in the right direction. It is a direction 
the Reform Party has been talking about for years. The Reform 
Party wants to reverse the centralization trend. Reformers want 
Parliament to exercise its power to control government spending 
right from the start. This bill reinforces the power of 
democratically elected representatives. It is an important bill 
because it enhances accountability in government. It is an 
important bill because it reinforces the Reform Party principle of 
accountable government.
<P>
	The issues addressed in this bill are issues the Reform Party has 
always been concerned about. Reformers believe that elected 
representatives should have the final say in government 
expenditures. We believe in the common sense of the common 
people and their right to be consulted when we spend their money. 
Our constituents have a right to directly influence spending. The 
Reform Party, when it forms a government, will enhance this right. 
I can see my colleague from Kingston and the Islands is already 
starting the process.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	Raising and spending tax dollars is the lifeblood of Parliament. It 
is the reason Parliament came about. Reform members take this 
responsibility seriously. When we spend money and approve 
expenditures of money in this House, we should all remember that 
tax dollars are funds held in trust by Parliament and are given to the 
government to provide services to Canadians.
<P>
	I support the bill. The Reform Party supports the bill. It will 
enhance the accountability of Parliament. It will help to remind the 
executive that the people of Canada still control government 
expenditures.
<P>
	There is also a subcommittee of the procedure and House affairs 
committee, of which I have the privilege to be a member, which 
deals with the whole business of supply and accountability. I hope 
we will see in this 35th Parliament a return of powers back to the 
House which have been allowed to slip away into the hands of the 
executive, into the hands of cabinet, into the hands of government. 
They have taken the liberty of expecting us to rubber stamp their 
initiatives and their requests for money. That has to stop.
<P>
	I am glad to see this issue being recognized by individual 
members on the government side through this private members' 
bill and through the creation of the subcommittee of the procedure 
and House affairs committee which was formed a year ago. The 
subcommittee has been doing valuable work. Let us not  forget that 
the subcommittee was formed at the instigation of the Reform 
Party. The only reason the subcommittee was formed a year ago 
was that we created enough noise about the approval of the 
estimates saying that we needed more input.
<P>
	Canadians and their elected officials need more input into how 
the House approves money. The House is not a rubber stamp. That 
message has to be put forth forcefully and clearly in order for this 
government, the next government and every government thereafter 
to realize the primacy of this House. We, as the elected 
representatives of Canadians, are the people who approve the 
expenditures of government. They are to be held accountable.
<P>
	Therefore, as I mentioned earlier, I heartily congratulate the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands for bringing forth this private 
members' bill which will curtail special warrants being issued by 
the government. Those special warrants circumvent the House. 
They prevent the House from expressing its democratic opinion on 
what the government intends to do. The bill will ensure that the 
House regains responsibility and its primacy over the spending of 
funds.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, since Private 
Members' Business is completed, I would ask for your consent to 
revert to orders of the day, the opposition motion, rather than 
suspending the Chamber until approximately 6.30 p.m. Is there 
agreement?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc member was not finished. 
Will he speak after me or does he intend to finish?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In consideration of the fact 
that we are proceeding somewhat ahead of schedule, I would hope 
that the House would permit at a later hour this evening if the 
member should return to the House and wish to complete his 
<P>

<P>
remarks, that I might have your co-operation in allowing him to 
complete those remarks. We are proceeding ahead of schedule 
somewhat, through unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak in favour of the motion 
brought forward by my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	Canadian farmers who are the most efficient and progressive and 
provide the highest quality food in the world are restricted from 
locating or accessing markets that are more lucrative than those 
provided by the Canadian Wheat Board. Farmers would have liked 
to have had the opportunity to at least elect the wheat board 
commissioner so they would have more input into the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	A few minutes ago the minister of agriculture more or less 
intimated he had a lot of support and that there were articles written 
in favour of the issue he was addressing. I will also quote from the 
<I>Western Producer</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wheat board supporters have not used the time Goodale has given them to 
mobilize their own show of support. He looks isolated, leading up that phantom 
army of alleged Board true believers who do not appear to care enough to join 
the political battle.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That does not sound like very solid support.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even inside his own government, Goodale likely has few enthusiastic allies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to go on record saying that the one strong ally Mr. 
Goodale has is the member for Malpeque.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Colleagues, only one 
of us can speak at a time here. Traditionally when the Speaker is 
standing you will find that your microphone will be turned off and 
respectfully, the Chair will have some preference.
<P>
	I rise to simply remind the House that we cannot do indirectly 
what we cannot do directly. In other words, even though we are 
quoting from a document, we cannot name the member or the 
minister as so stated in the article one might be quoting from.
<P>
	I know sometimes it is just a bit of a slip and this may be the 
case. But I do not want us to go down that road which could be 
somewhat treacherous by referring to each other by name and not 
in fact as the tradition the parliamentary debate wants us to 
maintain, by riding or portfolio.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the correction. I was 
reading from the article and I did not consider the minister's name 
was involved. I retract that and apologize for it.
<P>
	A recent Toronto <I>Globe and Mail</I> article accurately identified the 
government's paradoxical approach to  monopoly. On one hand the 
article states the government believes that a ``coven of oil 
companies are conspiring to defraud consumers through backroom 
deals creating a secret gasoline cartel''. The industry is now under 
investigation by the Bureau of Competition Policy. ``The message 
is monopolies are bad''. Or is the message that monopolies are 
good? Which way do we really want it?
<P>
	Then we have the government's desperate attempt to defend the 
statutory Canadian Wheat Board monopoly on the export of 
western grain. When farmer David Sawatzky was acquitted on 
charges of illegally exporting his crop to the United States, the 
federal government moved swiftly to close this loophole in the 
Customs Act.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	The minister of agriculture is working overtime to keep this 
monopoly intact. This time the message is monopolies are good. 
Which way do we really want it?
<P>
	I will read from the wheat board act. This is what both judges 
and both court rulings stated: ``In the case of a producer convicted 
of an offence relating to the delivery of grain-to a fine of an 
amount equal to one-third of his initial payment for the grain in 
relation to which the offence was committed, but the amount shall 
not be less than $50 or more than $350''.
<P>
	The minister and the people know very well that with that kind 
of penalty farmers will continue to cross the border with their grain 
because they make way more profits than $350 on each load.
<P>
	After my election to Parliament I was approached by farmers 
who provided compelling evidence of serious irregularities in the 
marketing practices of the wheat board or grain companies. Since 
then I have endeavoured to secure a response to those allegations.
<P>
	I embarked on the runaround of a lifetime. Every time I held a 
news conference and provided the documentations, I talked very 
honestly to the people. I told them I had sent the information to the 
ag minister, to the wheat board and to the grain companies telling 
them: ``Here are documents farmers have provided me with. Would 
you refute them or would you at least determine whether they are 
legal and whether they are practical documents that were issued in 
the exportation or the selling of grain''.
<P>
	Initially I raised this issue with the solicitor general and the 
RCMP. They lost the file. On my insistence they retrieved the file 
but took no investigative action. They arbitrarily decided there was 
insufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation. 
Interestingly this decision was made by the RCMP division that 
aggressively investigated Mr. Sawatzky.
<P>
	It has now come to light that an officer of this division was so 
anxious to prosecute that he falsified information to mislead a 
provincial court judge in establishing a basis for issuance of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4109"> 4109 </A></B>
<P>
search warrant to raid the Sawatzky home. Is this the way a justice 
system should work?
<P>
	The time limitations of this debate prevent me from fully 
disclosing the extent of resistance I have faced from the 
government and the wheat board since attempting to have these 
farmers' allegations investigated.
<P>
	Briefly, since contacting the RCMP I have requested assistance 
from the solicitor general, the minister of agriculture and the 
customs minister. Most recently I requested a judicial inquiry to be 
launched by the justice minister. This is due to the fact that the 
former assistant wheat board commissioner, Mr. Beswick, openly 
and quite fervently admitted and pointed out western barley 
producers lost at least $180 million last year because of the 
inefficiencies and inadequacies of the Canadian Wheat Board in its 
marketing policies.
<P>
	I am wondering if this should go on. Should farmers really have 
to carry these losses when it is openly admitted they are there? 
When one looks at $180 million of losses to farmers, it means it 
takes about a billion dollars out of western Canada's economy.
<P>
	During the three press conferences I sought information through 
the Access to Information Act. When I did not get any response 
from the ministers I tried the information act. What I did I get for 
my attempts to represent farmers? In the two and a half years since 
I have tried to secure some answers, I have been expelled from the 
House. My life has been threatened twice. The wheat board has 
tried to intimidate me through court actions, the intimidation of 
detractors being its modus operandi. It has threatened to sue me. It 
has threatened to do all kinds of other things, even to take legal 
action against the party and have me expelled.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	That sounds to me like something is being covered up. Why is it 
so determined to shut me down? All I have done is provided 
documents which farmers have given to me. They are legal 
documents of grain transactions and grain sales. If these people are 
not willing to verify they are false, why would they put the pressure 
on me to quit bringing more evidence before the wheat board and 
probably before the ministers?
<P>
	The minister always wants to say the western wheat marketing 
panel will solve the issues. The minister has tried to hide behind 
this bogus marketing panel. We have seen that the wheat board, 
together with the advisory board, has held secret in camera 
meetings half an hour before the marketing panel was to hold its 
hearings. It was trying to direct attention in some way to make it 
look like farmers were totally supportive of the panel and the 
CWB.
<P>
	<I>Hansard</I> records will verify the agriculture minister has 
answered every legitimate question posed by Reform members 
with deference to the western grain marketing panel. It is as if the 
minister has no idea what is going on  in the agricultural industry 
until the Western Grain Marketing Panel tells him. The minister 
needs a wake-up call. The problems with the CWB and our western 
grain marketing industry are evident to everyone but him.
<P>
	The marketing panel was asked by a presenter: ``Whose grain are 
we talking about? Is it the farmers' grain, is it the grain companies' 
grain or is it the government's grain? Who owns it? Who should 
have title to it?'' The panel's response was that is too political to 
answer. Why is it too political to answer who owns the produce 
farmers' grow?
<P>
	In my book when somebody manufacturers a product, pays the 
expenses, has the product inspected and gets it ready for 
distribution, it is his product. Nobody in this free country of ours 
would accept what is being done by the Western Grain Marketing 
Panel which will not even identify who are the legal owners of the 
product. To me it is almost like heresy.
<P>
	As an elected representative I have not only the right but the duty 
to put these irregularities before the government, before the wheat 
board and before law enforcement officers. When I am intimidated 
and when I get death threats I get very upset and I get very 
determined. I will make sure that sooner or later the people doing 
this will be brought to justice.
<P>
	I would like to pause for a minute and put this question to the 
House. In the case of Sawatzky I have heard people say he was a 
criminal, that he did something wrong and broke the law. He 
probably broke the wheat board act but he never broke the Customs 
Act. When I saw the way the appeal read in the paper it really 
distressed me. The appeal claims that Judge Conner made several 
errors in law, including reopening the trial by calling an interpreter 
to translate the French version of the law. It was the wheat board 
solicitors who demanded they prosecute Mr. Sawatzky under the 
French version of the Customs Act.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	In my experience in the House the law, whether it is in French or 
in English, is supposed to be the same. The interpretation is 
supposed to be the same. Now this wheat board solicitor is using 
that angle in an appeal. Bond says the appeal is necessary because 
order in council would not apply to anyone charged before the 
loophole was closed. There are a significant number of charges still 
out there, about 100 farmers.
<P>
	Is that the way to treat western farmers who are doing their 
utmost to produce the best grain for the least cost to feed the most 
people? Is that the type of treatment and publicity they deserve?
<P>
	The problems have become very serious and we have no 
leadership from the government. Farmers are being aggressively 
pursued and prosecuted by the government for attempting to freely 
market their own products. They have caused harm to nobody. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4110"> 4110 </A></B>
<P>
They have only brought  extra dollars into the economy, which 
helps create jobs, which does not deter jobs.
<P>
	These farmers have found an avenue to increase their revenue so 
they can hang on to their property and honestly make a living. If it 
is dishonest to sell grain for the best price available, I wish the 
government would come out openly and say so. There are a lot of 
other people in the country who are doing it and they have the right 
to do it. If the only ones who do not have the right are farmers, let 
us hear it from the government.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is the last bastion of monopolistic 
control in a free enterprise country which holds something sacred, 
which holds competition sacred. We are used to that in a 
democracy. Competition is sacred. In socialist countries every 
monopolistic country has gone down the drain. Now we are trying 
to enforce that system. Why are the attempts to chip away at this 
protective wall met with such heavy artillery by the feds? One has 
to wonder what the government and the wheat board are trying so 
desperately to hide.
<P>
	Yes, the time is long overdue for the Canadian Wheat Board to 
be opened up and held accountable to Canadian taxpayers. The 
agriculture minister must wake up and provide leadership.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board has long term debt of $6.8 billion 
and when we try to find out where that debt is, what the interest 
rates are or what is happening to it, who it is being written off to, 
we are stonewalled. Neither the auditor general nor the people from 
the estimates committee can fill us in on what is going on.
<P>
	If democracy does not succeed in this issue, what will be next 
under attack? When governments find vehicles to pamper their 
ledgers, pamper their own pocketbooks, it becomes very 
dangerous.
<P>
	If democracy loses, not only the Canadian farmers lose but the 
Canadian consumer loses and world customers lose, the world's 
people who are dependent on the supplies we as western grain 
producers produce. Producers have come to the point where they 
are becoming fewer and fewer because of government 
manipulation of practices of selling and marketing our grain and 
not bringing a true price to the farm community.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	If the threats and intimidation continue, I firmly believe that we 
still have a justice system and that these people will eventually be 
caught and brought to justice. I sincerely hope the inaction of the 
government has not aided the individuals in their actions. The 
intimidation and threats I have received are some of the worse 
signs just before a democracy loses its power and influence over a 
country.
<P>
	I appreciate these comments. I hope the government and the 
minister listen to farmers instead of to  bureaucrats and take the 
interests of farmers first, not those of wheat board commissioners 
or bureaucrats who try to run it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
respond to the member for Lisgar-Marquette.
<P>
	The debate today is about hundreds of thousands Canadian men 
and women who directly or indirectly depend upon the grain sector 
for their livelihood. Today's debate is not just about political 
politics and political party posturing. It is about a western 
organization that has built the country and has done a tremendous 
job in making the prairies a better place to live. It has built an 
economy that does not just stop in the prairies but goes on to grain 
shippers in Montreal and to bakers from Vancouver to Halifax. 
They all benefit from the system.
<P>
	When I hear some of the comments being made I question if 
some Reform members really understand the implications and 
strengths of the Canadian Wheat Board and what it has done for the 
nation.
<P>
	Experts make it very clear that the Canadian Wheat Board has 
been a vehicle by which we have become world renowned. We have 
become a very great nation, the bread basket of the world, as was 
quoted by the Reform Party earlier.
<P>
	I see hundreds of thousands of Canadians who rely upon a very 
good system. As a matter of fact it is among the excellent of the 
world. I am concerned that for some cheap political points there are 
shots and attacks on the wheat board.
<P>
	I do not believe for one minute that any of the claims made by 
the member a couple of moments ago have been substantiated. The 
RCMP looked at some of the questions he raised and has tried to 
investigate the claims that have been put forth. To my knowledge 
there has not been at any point during the investigation any 
concrete evidence of the claims that have been put forward.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is a very important institution. It has 
served a great purpose. As we start debate on the wheat board or 
whether dual marketing is the direction to go, I do not believe we 
should at any time pre-empt a process that is in place.
<P>
	The government has set a panel in place to listen the concerns of 
every group involved in the way the Canadian Wheat Board 
operates and in the way we market grains in the country, listening 
to all opposing and supporting points of view.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	There is absolutely no question the panel is to make certain it 
hears from all sectors of the economy, every interested group, and 
reports back to the government. It is critical if we spend this much 
time listening to the people publicly on what the panel is attempt-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4111"> 4111 </A></B>
<P>
ing to  achieve that we should allow the panel to report back to the 
minister and make certain all stakeholders are involved in the final 
decisions that are, made.
<P>
	The minister will receive those comments from the panel at the 
end of this month.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I ask the parliamentary 
secretary either to choose to put a question or questions to the hon. 
member during the question or comment period or bring his 
comment to a close so that I might give an opportunity to the 
member from Lisgar-Marquette to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate that and would 
like him to respond to my question. I will pose it directly.
<P>
	A panel was put in place that had 13 round table discussions 
across the country. Three hearings were formal and allowed all 
people in the industry to comment. Why do you come forward with 
a motion at this time just before that panel reports to the 
government? Why are you not waiting for the results of that panel 
to hear what the industry has to say?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I give the floor to the 
hon. member, I remind the House in terms of procedure-and I 
know we are winding down-that we are best to conduct our 
debates in a parliamentary fashion. As direct as questions may be, 
they still must be placed through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy listening to the hon. 
parliamentary secretary. He tries to be honest and objective.
<P>
	I will address a few of the issues he raised. I have raised the issue 
a number of times that I do not think the marketing panel is that 
credible any more because of the in camera meetings that were 
held. Only a few representatives were invited to attend: certain 
grain companies and certain farmers who supported the wheat 
board. That is one reason, whether or not the decision is good, the 
marketing panel will not be as credible as it should be.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary raised another issue about political 
gain. During the last Conservative government there was a debate 
on whether we should have a dual marketing system or single debt. 
People who are familiar with it will know what I am talking about.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the wheat board critic before the 
election promised western farmers that there would be a plebiscite 
on the dual marketing issue of barley and that farmers would be 
given that choice. Farmers have now been stymied for three years 
not having that choice. Now there is supposed to be credence and 
credibility on a marketing panel that has heard the issues time and 
time again.
<P>
	The marketing panel knows the issues. When it is not prepared to 
openly indicate whose grain is being  marketed, I am very uneasy 
about the results of the marketing panel. When a farmer pays the 
bills, owns the land and produces the crop, it is his grain. He should 
have some type of input into how it is marketed.
<P>
	I challenge the parliamentary secretary and the member for 
Malpeque to agree to have their operations run by people hired by 
somebody else, pay the bills, pay the pension plan and never 
squawk a minute about not having enough profit left over at the end 
of the year. I will put my farm up against theirs that they will not 
agree to that. It is an even bet.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	When I have an operation, pay the price, own the property and do 
not have any input into how it is marketed, it is bogus. It does not 
belong in a democracy. It belongs in a communist country. It has 
been tried time and time again and it has failed. People have 
overthrown those systems. Sooner or later western farmers will 
overthrow that system if they are not given some input into how 
their grain is marketed. They will not continue to raise it year after 
year and take for profit whatever somebody else decides to give 
them. They want some input into it.
<P>
	My bet is on against the Malpeque constituency and against the 
parliamentary secretary's assets that they will not agree to have 
their businesses run by somebody else and have no input into how 
stuff is marketed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Dear colleagues, earlier 
today, when we suspended the business of supply to go back to 
private members' business, the hon. member for Frontenac had 
about eight minutes left to speak. Therefore, we will resume at that 
point in the proceedings and then carry on as usual.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your good memory. Indeed, I had eight 
minutes left when we ended the debate at 5.30 p.m.
<P>
	Since I delivered the essential part of my speech on the motion 
of the Reform Party member, I will take the few minutes I have left 
to discuss the creation of the CWB.
<P>
	First, let us not forget that western Canada would be totally 
different had it not been for the Canadian Wheat Board. When the 
board was first set up in 1919, immediately after the first world 
war, agriculture in western Canada was going nowhere. All 
Canadians tightened their belts and the Canadian Wheat Board was 
established.
<P>
	The board lasted barely a year, but it helped improve somewhat 
the sales of wheat and barley produced in western Canada. The 
Canadian Wheat Board was abolished immediately after that. In 
1935, during the depression, again nothing was happening in 
western Canada. Wheat crops were burned in the fields.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4112"> 4112 </A></B>
<P>
	It became vital to have an agency that would look after the sale 
and supply of grains. The Canadian Wheat Board was 
re-established. However, between 1935 and 1943, membership 
was optional. Farmers were free to join or leave the CWB. When 
the second world war broke out, in 1939, there was a shortage of 
supply and membership became compulsory for all farmers. The 
situation has remained the same since.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I saw you react when, a moment ago, I talked about 
1919, 1935 and 1943. You are still a very young man and you were 
not even born in 1943, but it must be said that the Canadian Wheat 
Board provided enormous services to all western farmers. In other 
words, everyone benefited from it.
<P>
	However, for the benefit of our Quebec constituents, I would like 
to draw a comparison between supply management in the dairy, 
egg and poultry sectors, and the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Take, for example, supply management of milk. In Quebec, as in 
Ontario or any other province, wherever a farm is located, the 
farmer receives the same amount for his milk as if he were right 
next to the town or the processing plant. It is the same, in the West, 
for grain producers.
<P>
	In Quebec, we must respect our quota, just as my colleague from 
Prince Edward Island must respect his quota or pay the penalty. 
Obviously, a farmer who wants to be difficult could say that supply 
management is not good and that he would like 10 more cows, that 
he has a large farm, that he could buy out his neighbour and feed 10 
more dairy cows, and thus substantially increase his net revenue. 
But if he does that, he will interfere with supply management. 
Since we are living in a society, we must play by the rules of the 
game.
<P>
	If too much milk is produced, prices will drop and the market 
will be flooded-no pun intended. There must be self-discipline. A 
farmer could well say that it is more profitable to produce milk in 
the summer because the cows go to pasture and do not need as 
much feed as in the winter, and no supplement. It costs much less to 
produce milk in the summer, cows give the same in the summer as 
in the winter, so let us produce more milk in the summer and less in 
the winter and our net revenue will go up. But you drink milk in the 
winter as well as in the summer, so dairy producers must produce 
milk 12 months a year, 365 days a year.
<P>
	The West is using the same principle that led to the creation of 
milk pools. You have the quality of the wheat and barley, the 
percentage of nutritional fibre, and so on. So, the Government of 
Canada created the Canadian Wheat Board, which would appear to 
be the equivalent of the Canadian Dairy Commission.
<P>
	Supply management has the advantage of regularizing farmers' 
revenues, and the same is true for the Canadian  Wheat Board in the 
West. What is good for all Canadians, consumers, producers and 
also processors is that a quality product is produced year round at a 
very competitive, very reasonable price.
<P>
	What is offensive in all this is that today's debate focusses 
essentially on western grain producers. I would like to draw your 
attention to this, Mr. Speaker, and to call on your objectivity. 
Quebec has 24 per cent of the population and represents 17 per cent 
of Canada's agricultural scene, which grows by 25 per cent if we 
take into account the value added in the processing of such things 
as milk into yogurt, butter and cheese. However, Quebecers paid 
and continue to pay the cost of the Western Grain Transportation 
Act, which varied between $560 million and $1 billion depending 
on the year. Quebec paid its share of 24 per cent.
<P>
	When the WGTA was repealed in the west the government 
released $2.9 billion in compensation and adjustment allowances 
of all sorts. Quebec is paying 24 per cent of this generous subsidy. 
The department of agriculture, the Minister of Finance, are 
preparing to cut subsidies to milk producers in this country over 
five years. Quebec is home to 47.5 per cent of Canada's industrial 
milk producers. No compensation is being provided.
<P>
	Do you realize that Quebec receives barely 8 per cent of the 
budget of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, if we take 
away the $107 million in subsidies to industrial milk producers? 
The budget of the department of agriculture for Quebec-8 per 
cent. We produce 17 per cent, so it is less than 50 per cent, and if 
you include the value added, we top 24 per cent. So, we receive 
barely a third of what we should be getting.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	This then is another example of the double standard that may be 
found very often in this country. I am taking this opportunity to 
criticize it before you, Mr. Speaker, knowing that this is the right 
time in this opposition day when we can talk about all agricultural 
matters.
<P>
	In closing, as regards the Canadian Wheat Board, the subject 
today, the fact of people opting out temporarily for two years, is, in 
my humble opinion, twisted, even sick. Imagine a milk producer 
who wants to opt our for two years, test the waters, check things out 
elsewhere, and who realizes that it is not worth the effort and 
comes back to the pool with his colleagues. No.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are in good health. There is a group drug 
insurance plan that costs you $1,000. You say that in any given year 
you pay $50 for medications, because you are never sick. You are 
not in the group plan. After a year or two, you become terribly sick. 
You go and ask whether they will let you in so it will only cost you 
$1,000. It does not make sense.
<P>
	I think this motion is not votable. If it were, the Bloc Quebecois 
would not support it because it lacks thought.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
pleased earlier to hear the member for Frontenac talk about the 
objective of the Canadian Wheat Board which is to maximize the 
sale of Canadian wheat and the return to producers. It is good to 
hear one of the opposition parties talk in a positive way about a 
couple of the great institutions we have in this country: the 
Canadian What Board and the Canadian Dairy Commission and 
hear him put a proposal to build on those institutions rather than 
destroy them.
<P>
	Earlier I raised a question with the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster who would in essence destroy the 
wheat board with this motion and I could not seem to get through to 
him that the lowest seller sets the price.
<P>
	I will put the question of the member for Frontenac. When one is 
selling products and people are competing against one another to 
bring down the price structure-the member for Frontenac is well 
aware of the beef industry and how sometimes prices are brought 
down in that industry by the fact that one producer wants to 
undermine another-and I wonder if he could tell us if the same 
thing might happen to wheat growers.
<P>
	The ultimate impact of this motion would be that we could in 
essence have greater than 100,000 producers competing against 
each other and trying to undercut the price structure. The hon. 
member claims that would not happen. A producer might be in 
some financial difficulty-and I know the Reform Party does not 
seem to be concerned about that-who when the option is there for 
that producer to say to his banker that there will be a final payment 
in which returns are maximized under the Canadian Wheat Board, 
but now under this motion he would be forced to sell now and 
undermine the price structure.
<P>
	I wonder if the member for Frontenac has any concerns that the 
negative competition being promoted by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster might undermine the price structure 
and force farmers into greater financial difficulty?
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac): </B>Mr. Speaker, my distinguished 
colleague from Prince Edward Island, the hon. member for 
Malpèque, is right. All things considered, I must admit he is right. 
But I would like to remind him that the Canadian Wheat Board, 
like the Canadian Dairy Commission, is not without fault.
<P>
	I would also like to remind my distinguished colleague that, 
because he plays a major role on the agriculture committee, he 
could suggest to his minister, to his government, improvements to 
the Canadian Wheat Board, because you cannot be unaware that the 
Canadian  Wheat Board is criticized, reviled and hated by almost a 
third of western farmers.
<P>
	So it must be admitted that there is a malaise, the initial malaise. 
Farmers have no role at all on the advisory board, the one that was 
created and on which 11 members sit. They are listened to out of 
politeness, when in fact they are the most directly concerned.
<P>
	You know, when I see the chairman, even if his curriculum vitae 
is 12 pages long, if he has never driven a tractor, if he does not 
know what one is, even if he has gone to school for years and has 
two or three doctorates, he does not know anything about 
agriculture or growing grain, and he is going to fall on his face.
<P>
	Those best qualified to manage are farmers. Why do co-ops 
work so well in Quebec? Because the president is a farmer in the 
co-op. In fish co-ops, the president is usually a fisherman. He is not 
the village doctor, he is a fisherman.
<P>
	So, whether it is under the present government or the one before 
it, it does not matter. When I look at the appointments made in my 
riding to the joint committee to examine complaints regarding 
unemployment insurance, now known as employment insurance, I 
think political patronage is involved. When you look at the list of 
these appointments, I think it would be good if one of them had 
seen an unemployed person or had had to fill out a time sheet at 
least once in his life.
<P>
	Take the issue of improving transportation. The hon. member for 
Malpèque feels that a little improvement in transportation is 
required. You know, Mr. Speaker, Canadian wheat and barley 
account for 23 per cent of all exports sold throughout the world. We 
are therefore important, because close to one quarter of the world's 
exports come from our country. We have a major role and we 
should be a little more aggressive on foreign markets and go after 
other parts of the market and eventually, as the member for 
Malpèque said so eloquently a few minutes ago, increase, 
maximize prices, with the result that farmers would get better 
prices.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that the government could improve the 
operating method of the Canadian Wheat Board, and thus satisfy, I 
am sure, a large number of the 120,000 western grain producers. 
Obviously, not everyone can be satisfied, but when close to a third 
of grain producers are unhappy and would like to opt out for two 
years, something is wrong.
<P>
	Once again, in closing-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If you would not mind, I am 
trying to encourage debate during the period for questions and 
comments. As more than one member rose when I asked whether 
there were any questions or comments, I am going to give a 
member of another political party a chance to ask a question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4114"> 4114 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the hon. member for 
Frontenac. I know he is not extremely familiar with the Canadian 
Wheat Board since its jurisdiction is the west and the prairies, but 
he is very familiar with the dairy industry.
<P>
	If the dairy industry were run the way the Canadian Wheat Board 
is run and affects western Canada, would he support having to 
market through a milk selling agency if the producers had no voice 
on how that milk marketing agency functioned, had no producer 
voice, no democratic process to choose the directors on that milk 
marketing board? Would he support that board if there was no 
public accounting for how it marketed what the profit was, how 
much it cost it to market the milk on the producers' behalf?
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	That is what western farmers have to cope with because of the 
secrecy and the unaccountability of the Canadian Wheat Board. I 
do not believe that is in the dairy industry. Perhaps his attitude 
would change a little bit if the dairy industry was burdened with 
this undemocratic and secretive marketing agency.
<P>
	The second question is an inspiration by the member for 
Malpeque who seems to think that the lowest bidder always gets 
the commodity. I would love to go to the member's auction sale if 
he ever has one because the lowest bidder is going to buy the items 
at his farm sale.
<P>
	Do farmers in Quebec accept the lowest bid for their goods or do 
they accept the highest bid for their goods, the milk, the wheat or 
whatever they want to sell? What do they accept, the highest bid or 
the lowest bid?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would need about ten 
minutes to answer this question from my distinguished colleague, 
who is, moreover, the sponsor of today's motion.
<P>
	The milk producers have disciplined themselves. I remember, 
for example, that ten years ago you would see four different milk 
tanker trucks on one concession road, picking up milk from the 
various farms, because there was competition between dairies at 
that time.
<P>
	The dairy farmers got together and today there is one truck, just 
one. A bigger truck, of course, and it comes more often, so the milk 
is of better quality and this is the truck that will deliver the milk to 
the processors, according to their needs. If one needs three quarters 
of the tank, that is what will be delivered there. If another needs a 
quarter tank, that is what it gets, and so on. This has lowered 
production costs, therefore, and dairy producers have increased 
their incomes without increasing milk prices.
<P>
	What I would like to say to my distinguished colleagues is that, 
in my region, when there is a sectorial meeting, 68, 72, or 75 of the 
90 members will turn out. Dairy producers look after their own 
affairs, and if something is not working, they tell their sector 
president, and he passes the word higher up, and so on, until it 
reaches the top.
<P>
	Are the western grain producers united? The 120,000 producers 
should form a basic union, because if they wanted to unite, these 
120,000 or 125,000 farmers, they would have immense political 
and economic clout. That is worth nothing if they are not united.
<P>
	I think that if they start to break apart-someone stays out for 
two years, another six months later, stays out for two years as well, 
so comes back six months after the first-fragmented like this, as 
my distinguished colleague from Malpèque has said so 
aptly-there would be competition between the producers 
themselves and no good would come of it for stabilizing prices and 
ensuring income stability for the producer. There would be no 
impact whatsoever.
<P>
	Take the price of beef, for instance. I remember on the farm I 
sold feeder calves at the same price after ten years as I did when I 
started out farming. Beef prices have gone down. For the past 24 
months, for example, they are practically giving beef away. The 
farmers listening to me today know very well that we get nothing at 
all for our cull cows and practically nothing for our butcher cattle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Reform cows.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac): </B>My colleagues are making a pun 
about Reform cows, because the word in French for cull cow is 
<I>vache de réforme</I>, which means, as you know, Mr. Speaker, dairy 
cows who are no longer good producers.
<P>
	The price of beef at this time is rock bottom, but if there were an 
organization similar to the Canadian Wheat Board, possibly the 
beef producers would have regular and stable prices.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to express my support for the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	Contrary to what some critics contend, the Canadian Wheat 
Board is not a monolithic dinosaur out of touch with Canadian 
producers. It is a viable, state of the art company that does an 
excellent job in marketing western Canadian wheat and barley for 
its customers, the men and women who work in the Canadian grain 
sector.
<P>
	The board was set up in 1935 under pressure from farmers. It has 
become in the words of Dan Morgan in his study on trade, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4115"> 4115 </A></B>
<P>
``Merchants of Grain'', the most  powerful and prestigious 
marketing board in the world. The board has earned respect 
throughout the world for providing a quality product on time and as 
contracts specify. Its credibility in the world markets has been built 
over the years and it has delivered tremendous customer service.
<P>
	The board is an example of an orderly marketing structure that 
best serves both Canadian farmers and Canadian grain customers. 
It markets all western Canadian wheat and barley products for 
export and domestically for human consumption. It costs the wheat 
board only 4.5 cents per bushel to market farmers' grain. All 
profits from the sales go to farmers. Because all western Canadian 
grain goes through a single desk, the Canadian Wheat Board can 
offer specific, consistent quality and supply to customers. As a 
result it can get the best price for western grain farmers.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board, like all organizations, is changing 
with the times. In an effort to maintain its competitive edge the 
Canadian Wheat Board commissioned the consulting firm of 
Deloitte and Touche Management Consultants in 1992 to take an 
outside independent critical look at the Canadian Wheat Board and 
how it operates. The fact that the Canadian Wheat Board took the 
initiative to do an in depth independent study proves the 
importance it places on proper management and accountability and 
its desire to strive to serve all customers' needs and to continue to 
be more efficient.
<P>
	The study noted a number of areas for potential improvement. I 
am pleased to say that the board has implemented all the major 
recommendations handed down to it in the study. For example, the 
consulting firm noticed that the board needed to improve its long 
term planning. The board responded by developing a corporate 
vision, mission and a set of goals and strategic objectives. It has 
also streamlined and made improvements to its budgeting, 
management, planning and reporting system and has introduced a 
new performance evaluation system.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board's efforts have not stopped there. It is 
continually striving to make improvements in planning, 
management and operational aspects of its business. To ensure it 
operates efficiently, the Canadian Wheat Board also conducts an 
ongoing department by department audit of expenditures.
<P>
	The level of service provided by the Canadian Wheat Board has 
greatly improved over the years. The Canadian Wheat Board has 
responded to demands for more market information beyond the 
annual report by providing a number of services and initiatives to 
keep its client producers well informed.
<P>
	The board now issues regular pool return outlooks which give 
producers a good indication of where markets are heading. It also 
holds annual grain days meetings across the prairies where its staff 
meet producers to bring them new ideas and information and to 
listen their concerns.
<P>
	The board is also using the tools of technology to become even 
more accessible to farmers. It has a 1-800 number and an electronic 
bulletin board. These initiatives show that the board has become 
proactive in its efforts to respond to customers' needs.
<P>
	The board has also established price forecasting, undertaken new 
market development initiatives and developed enhanced risk 
management tools.
<P>
	To help farmers tap into one of the most promising foreign 
markets, the board has opened a new office in Beijing. It also has a 
branch office in Tokyo and an excellent information network 
worldwide. This information network goes well beyond the scope 
of information available to individual grain producers or individual 
grain companies.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	For all these reasons, the wheat board has proven that it is 
adapting to changing times and that it is providing a valuable 
service to farmers. This is not to suggest that everything is perfect. 
Everyone agrees that some changes are needed to continue to 
improve the grain marketing system.
<P>
	That is why the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food set up the 
Western Grain Marketing Panel last summer. This panel will report 
very soon. The minister hopes to have legislation in place by the 
fall.
<P>
	The panel worked hard for many months to provide a vast 
amount of very useful public information. It held 15 public town 
hall meetings across the prairies to provide information and to 
receive input and feedback from farmers and farm organizations.
<P>
	The panel conducted three sets of formal hearings in Winnipeg, 
Edmonton and Regina. These hearings provided a formal 
opportunity for all those holding differing points of view to come 
forward with their best arguments, their best evidence to put the 
case for one system or another to be subject to examination and 
cross-examination to get all the facts on the table and a thorough 
analysis of all the pros and cons, all the benefits and all the 
consequences. The panel had that full, open, transparent hearing 
process so that everything could be examined in a calm, rational 
and intelligent way.
<P>
	The panel is now in the final stages of finishing its report. We 
expect to have it at the beginning of July. Once we have that report 
from the panel, which consists of nine very well respected 
individuals that represent every shade of opinion on the subject, we 
will be in a much better position to make whatever decisions are 
necessary with respect to grain marketing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4116"> 4116 </A></B>
<P>
	I would encourage all members of this House to lend their 
support to that board. It is Canada's best marketing tool to help 
farmers compete in global markets and get the best prices for their 
products.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I could ask the 
parliamentary secretary for some guidance here. Am I to 
understand that the parliamentary secretary is sharing his time with 
a colleague?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the 
member for Souris-Moose Mountain.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Then there will be five 
minutes of questions or comments for the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly listened to the parliamentary secretary's comments 
regarding the wheat board. He spoke so eloquently of this board 
and all the things that were accomplished through it that I wonder if 
we are even talking about the same board that our supply motion 
refers to.
<P>
	I would like to list some facts. The member stated clearly that 
the board could guarantee large scale delivery to all its customers. 
Then the member also pointed out that farmers would get the best 
possible prices through the board.
<P>
	If the member recalls correctly, and he should since he is 
parliamentary secretary to the agriculture minister, he would look 
at the first point here, the wheat board's ability to guarantee large 
scale delivery. I do not believe that is quite true.
<P>
	Last fall the board had to apologize to Japan for its inability to 
deliver contracted barley. In April the wheat board then reneged on 
half of the future barley purchases promised to farmers. Without 
that sale to Japan, the grain was no longer needed. There was a slap 
in the face to the farmers as well as an inability to deliver to Japan.
<P>
	Another inaccuracy from the parliamentary secretary is to 
deliver the best prices to farmers. Barley prices in the United States 
are American $4.85. The same barley through the board in Canada 
is $2.35. For durum the Canadian price offered stateside is $8.50 
and the board is offering between $4 and $4.50.
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to address those 
discrepancies as he points out that the board is delivering when in 
fact it is not.
<P>
<B>(1915 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Wheat Board is 
structured so that it takes all of the product from all of our industry 
here in Canada.
<P>
	We should look closely at the size of that industry and where 
these products are sold. The industry sells some 30 million tonnes 
of wheat around the world to markets in Japan, Asia and throughout 
the United States.
<P>
	Sales to the United States are in the area of about $2 million. 
What I am hearing from some spot pricing at very specific times is 
in fact that little market in the United States, which represents only 
7 per cent of the sales of Canadian grain into the United States, may 
blip up from time to time.
<P>
	When the price in the United States goes up the Canadian Wheat 
Board gets that price. There is absolutely no question that the board 
picks up that spot price in the United States. It also picks up all the 
prices throughout the rest of the world. Not only will that two 
million tonnes be sold in the United States for a higher price when 
the spot price is high, but also the other 28 million tonnes that is 
sold in other regions of the world. As a result every farmer that 
sells wheat to the wheat pool gets the benefit of that high price and 
the average of all the other prices put together. That is how a pool 
works.
<P>
	When we are talking about how that pooling system operates, we 
are talking about selling in. Each person does not get one price 
from the United States, a different price from Japan, but an average 
or pooling price. As a result, they get the best price because the 
wheat board keeps no profit. All of the profits go back to the 
growers, the producers. Some grain is sold at higher prices and 
other grains are sold at lower prices. The average is what the 
Canadian Wheat Board pays.
<P>
	When we talk about the delivery system and because we have a 
huge inventory of product, we have large growers co-operating 
with the wheat board, we know very clearly that their reputation 
throughout the world has been fabulous. It has the best reputation 
of any grain selling operation anywhere in the world.
<P>
	As a result the board has a reputation for being able to supply. 
There may be niche markets where at one point it could not supply 
product, but in general it is recognized around the world that the 
wheat board has enough product to supply the markets to which it 
is selling. It has done a very good job and has a super reputation 
with the product it is selling. The Canadian product is above all 
others.
<P>
	When we look at that operation it is very clear that producers do 
get the best average price and they do sell at a pretty secure market 
throughout the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a brief comment and a short question.
<P>
	The comment is with regard to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report to 
which the parliamentary secretary referred. He said that all the 
recommendations have been fulfilled. In fact that is incorrect. One 
of the recommendations dealt with the structure of the board and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4117"> 4117 </A></B>
<P>
the fact that it had five equal commissioners. Deloitte &amp; Touche 
called it a 1930s structure that does not work in the 1990s. That is 
still in place and cannot be touched until the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act is amended.
<P>
	My question is for the hon. member from Ontario. We have not 
had one prairie farmer from the Liberal side speak yet. I think they 
only have one farmer.
<P>
	Ontario corn producers can sell their product to whomever they 
choose. They can sell it across the line. They can load their trucks, 
go across the border into the states and sell their corn, or sell it 
domestically or export it around the world. But barley growers who 
are producing an equivalent product in western Canada do not have 
that same privilege.
<P>
	Does the hon. member think it is fair that corn producers can 
market to whomever they wish but prairie barley producers are not 
allowed to do that because of the Canadian Wheat Board Act?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party continually brings 
up this idea of the ability to sell and you can always get the highest 
price. That seems to be the question that they are really coming 
down on. How do you get the highest price?
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	I believe without question that there is a terrible difference 
between this idea of buying and selling. If one is a buyer and there 
is only one person selling a product and there are many buyers, 
then yes, the buyers will bid against each other. That is not the 
situation that we are talking about. It is just the opposite.
<P>
	We are sellers and if we have many sellers they are going to be 
bidding against each other. What my hon. colleague suggested is 
that bidding process, one against another, will lower the price. 
Obviously everyone knows if we have 10 people selling and one 
person buying, the person who is buying is going to get the best 
deal. That is the difference between buy and sell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion put forward today by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster appears reasonable on the face of it. 
Indeed, it sounds reasonable that for a two-year period the 
Canadian Wheat Board could allow farmers, if they choose to do 
so, to sell their wheat and barley outside the jurisdiction of the 
board, if they thought it was a good idea at that particular time.
<P>
	Let me point out that this motion represents a piecemeal and a 
cavalier approach to the serious business of marketing Canadian 
grains around the world, and the serious business of one of the top 
four or five sectors in the Canadian economy, agriculture and food.
<P>
	There is a lot of good news in agriculture and food these days. 
First, prices for wheat and barley are higher than they have been for 
some time. After years of low prices, competing with the treasuries 
of the United States  and the European Union which used massive 
amounts of export subsidies to keep the price of wheat down, 
prairie grain farmers are reaping the long overdue rewards of good 
prices.
<P>
	Prairie grain farmers are reaping these rewards and that is good 
news for all Canadians. The world stocks of wheat are low, lower 
than they have been for a long time. Compounding this situation is 
a less than average winter wheat crop in the United States. That 
means low inventories and strong prices.
<P>
	For the coming crop year which begins August 1, 1966, we are 
forecasting the price of a tonne of spring wheat at more than $260. 
That compares with just $134 a tonne in 1991-92 and $157 a tonne 
in the 1992-93 crop year.
<P>
	Barley prices too are near record highs. The average price of 
feed barley for the three years between 1991 and 1994 was about 
$100 a tonne. For this coming crop year we are predicting the price 
to range from $135 to $155. Those good prices are benefiting all 
grain farmers, not just those who live along the 49th parallel. 
Perhaps it is the bonanza atmosphere after so many years in the 
doldrums that is fueling some of this short term, quick response 
from the other side.
<P>
	Second, there have been many important and dramatic changes 
in agriculture over the last few years: a new world trading 
agreement and major policies changes within Canada, such as the 
end of the western grain transportation benefit. High grain prices, 
coupled with these changes and others are creating a real sense of 
optimism for grain farmers.
<P>
	In fact, there is a groundswell of optimism throughout the 
agriculture and food sector as a whole. Between 600 and 700 who 
live, work and influence the agriculture sector will be gathering in 
Winnipeg next week to celebrate the excellence of Canadian 
agri-food and to collectively work on a business plan that focuses 
on maximizing the opportunities that abound for Canadian 
producers and companies at home and abroad. Good prices and 
good times do not necessarily last very long and now is a fortuitous 
time to work on those long term plans.
<P>
<B>(1925 )</B>
<P>
	Turning specifically to grain marketing, any changes in the 
Canadian grain marketing system should be thoughtful and 
carefully reasoned with an eye on the long term prosperity of grain 
farmers, the prairie economy and to the overall benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
has taken a thoughtful approach in pursuing through the 
establishment of the western grain marketing panel an exclusive 
process 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4118"> 4118 </A></B>
<P>
that has given all farmers a chance to put forward their views on the 
marketing of grains. It will be a thoughtful approach that will 
consider the benefits for that economy across the prairies, not just  
for those in a particular backyard when it comes to making changes 
in the marketing system that has served prairie farmers very well 
for more than half a century.
<P>
	We are not squandering good times by making rash choices 
about the future. We are carefully exploring all points of view, all 
of the relevant facts, before proposing changes to the marketing of 
Canadian wheat and barley. No change will be made in an isolated, 
vague way which responds to the issues of the moment or the issues 
of one set of lobbyists.
<P>
	It is a curious time for the opposition to bring this matter to the 
floor of the House of Commons when the western grain marketing 
panel is so close to completing its task.
<P>
	The minister expects the panel to deliver its report in the next 
couple of weeks. He is eagerly awaiting the panel's report and will 
respond in his usual judicious and thoughtful manner. I urge 
members to defeat this motion.
<P>
	As I travel throughout my riding, a rural agricultural riding in 
Saskatchewan, I do not get the response that some of the members 
from the third party suggest, that the Canadian Wheat Board should 
be destroyed. That is absolute nonsense.
<P>
	A gentleman from Minnesota talked about one concern which he 
wrote about in a letter to the <I>Western Producer</I>. He said: ``I sure 
would keep the Canadian Wheat Board if I were a Canadian. I have 
been on the Minnesota Wheat Growers Board for the last three 
years. Not one board member was in favour of working for a fair 
price for wheat in Washington. Your farmers in Canada should 
work together to protect your own interests. By the way I don't like 
those Canadian farmers hauling their wheat across the border in 
violation of your laws''.
<P>
	It seems passing strange that our American counterparts who 
have tremendous opposition to the Canadian Wheat Board are now 
finding solace in our friends in the third party. If it were such a poor 
system, do you think they would be complaining? In objecting to 
our Canadian Wheat Board, I doubt it very much.
<P>
	I know the leader of the third party was in the United States. He 
suggested they should remove the irritant, the Canadian Wheat 
Board. However, when he returned home he suggested that a party 
based in the prairie provinces would not side with U.S. grain 
growers. I wonder how our friends in the third party are going to set 
the record straight. Either they are in favour of the American 
system and Canada abandoning our excellent wheat board or they 
are suggesting that we wait until the minister comes through with 
the report and he will take the appropriate action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with rapt attention to the hon. member's 
comments even though they are absolute nonsense.
<P>
	This member is saying that the third party, the Reform Party, is 
out to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board which is absolute 
nonsense. We are getting sick and tired of trying to initiate a 
sensible, realistic debate on this subject only to be subjected to that 
kind of nonsense. I do not know whether the hon. member has ever 
farmed in his life but I have farmed most of my life. I am not as 
young as I once was but I can remember very low barley prices.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	To hear the hon. member talk of an average price of $100 a tonne 
for barley and suggest as he did that it is a bonanza price, I would 
like him to tell farmers that. The bit of profit on $100 per tonne 
barley does not go very far toward paying for a $200,000 tractor or 
combine. The hon. member should know that when he represents 
an agricultural riding.
<P>
	The hon. member is saying that the average pooling price should 
be good enough. Studies have been done. Al Dooley of the Alberta 
Grain Commission, analysis branch, has done a 15-year study of 
the barley price f.o.b. Vancouver, shipped from Great Falls, 
Montana, as compared to Lethbridge, Alberta. It was a fair 
comparison. He found over the 15-year period that the American 
price was $23 to $30 per tonne more.
<P>
	How can the member stand in his place and say that Canadian 
farmers are getting a good deal from the Canadian Wheat Board 
when that is the reality of a 15-year study?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is likely that he wanted to report on 
Tom Dooley rather than Al Dooley. The hon. member made a 
reference to studies. We told him that three independent people 
took at look at the Canadian Wheat Board. One was from his 
province of Alberta, one from Manitoba and one from 
Saskatchewan. They said the Canadian Wheat Board was doing an 
excellent job and gave the facts. They do not want to listen. Talk 
about nonsense. He certainly captured that event very well.
<P>
	If he does not know Al Dooley he should check with Tom Dooley 
because they are likely in the same boat. I am suggesting the 
Canadian Wheat Board is a very capable and honourable approach 
to marketing.
<P>
	When the committee comes forward with its report we will make 
changes to move into the 21st century. The minister said he would. 
If we are patient and listen to the proposals, we will see some 
positive, constructive changes to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the debate since it began today. Four 
glaring questions remain unanswered by the government which I 
would like to pose at this time. I  would prefer to do them one at a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4119"> 4119 </A></B>
<P>
time but I will probably have only one chance to rise. I hope the 
hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain has a pencil handy.
<P>
	Is it fair that corn producers can sell their corn in Ontario 
wherever they wish? Is it fair that Quebec farmers can sell their 
wheat for $9.50 a bushel to the mills in Ontario but a Saskatchewan 
farmer cannot access that? Saskatchewan cannot sell their wheat in 
Ontario but other people can. Does the hon. member think that is 
fair?
<P>
	Is it fair that farmers cannot have a direct say in what happens to 
their product? The Liberal government promised a plebiscite in the 
last election on barley marketing and never carried through with it. 
Farmers have had no direct say in this question. Is it fair that they 
are not allowed a direct say in this question?
<P>
	I have a third question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of respect, 
I have time restrictions. I ask the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville to hold questions three and four in reserve. I 
will go to the hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain on the 
first two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me say something about the 
marketing system. They can sell into Ontario but they will go 
through the Canadian Wheat Board. They can go through the 
Canadian Wheat Board. That is the system set in place.
<P>
	If the members wants to set up a new system as he is suggesting, 
it will not happen while we are around. We support the Canadian 
Wheat Board. If the hon. member does not like it, it is too bad.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	I likely travel more than most of them. That is not unique. I go 
about my riding. I can assure the House that the vast majority of 
farmers, and my son-in-law is a large scale farmer, support the 
Canadian Wheat Board and single desk selling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak to the motion presented by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	Actually it is not what I feel at all. It is not pleasure that I feel to 
be speaking and to be in the House today. As I listened to the 
agriculture minister give his presentation I felt frustration. He 
really has not learned a thing over the past many years.
<P>
	He was involved as parliamentary secretary to the wheat board 
minister in the early eighties when a plebiscite was held on whether 
canola should go under wheat board jurisdiction. He lost that 
plebiscite. Farmers did not want that to happen. I thank God that it 
did not happen. The canola industry has been a saviour in my part 
of the country without a doubt.
<P>
	I felt frustration as I listened to the agriculture minister 
demonstrate that he really has not learned anything in that regard 
over the years. I felt sadness when I came to realize that as long as 
the government is in place the wheat board will not be changed in 
any meaningful way. The member for Souris-Moose Mountain 
has confirmed it. For that I feel sadness.
<P>
	For me it has been many years of struggling. In my own farming 
career of 20 years, my father's before me and my grandfather's 
before him, we struggled to change the system to give farmers 
control over marketing. It is sad to see that it will not happen under 
the government. However it sure as heck will under Reform when 
we get into power.
<P>
	I will speak today about what the motion is about and what it is 
not about. Then I will speak about what the wheat board is. I will 
not get technical. I will just explain what it is. Then I will give a bit 
of selective history because I do not have the time to go into the full 
history of the wheat board. The history will start in 1935 and go up 
to the present. Then I will speak briefly about what is likely to 
happen in the future.
<P>
	My colleague reminded me that I only have 20 minutes. 
Probably I will not get through half of what I want to speak about 
but I will give it a good try.
<P>
	The motion is about giving farmers the choice in marketing their 
grain. It seems sad that we need to have debate on giving farmers 
the choice to market their own product. What other business 
persons in the country allow government to market their products 
for them? Why has this archaic idea hung around so long? I do not 
know the answer but the motion is about giving farmers a choice 
over marketing their grain.
<P>
	The motion is not about destroying the wheat board. It has 
nothing to do with that. It is not about making a list over here of 
what is good about the board and a list over there about what is not 
so good about the board. That is not what it is about. We do not 
want to get into that debate.
<P>
	Farmers can debate those issues in the debate leading up to the 
plebiscite on the wheat board. That is the time for that debate. It has 
certainly taken place over the last many years and should continue, 
but that is not what this debate is about.
<P>
	I will read the motion so there is no doubt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to amend the Canadian What Board Act 
to include a special 2 year opting out provision permitting those prairie 
producers who believe they are missing market opportunities the flexibility and 
choice to market their wheat and barley outside the jurisdiction of the Board.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what the debate is about. It is an honest debate. Every 
Reformer debating the issue is doing it in all seriousness from the 
heart and from an immense pool of knowledge on the issue. Many 
of us have lived under this system of marketing grain for a long 
time.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4120"> 4120 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	It is certainly not about pinning labels on people, as the member 
for Souris-Moose Mountain is doing to deflect the debate. It is 
about giving farmers a choice and that is what it should be about.
<P>
	Earlier the Minister of Agriculture read very selectively about a 
commissioner in an article from the <I>Western Producer</I>. I will 
respond by reading from a more recent article in the <I>Western 
Producer</I> written by Barry Wilson. When referring to the Minister 
of Agriculture he wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-strategy of defending the Canadian Wheat Board from its critics by stalling 
for time has one underlying, and perhaps fatal, flaw.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again referring to the minister he continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wheat board supporters have not used the time-given them to mobilize their 
own show of support.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He looks isolated, leading a phantom army of alleged Board true-believers 
who do appear to care enough to join the political battle.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Barry Wilson covers agricultural issues in the House and in 
committees continually. He is saying that perhaps the following is 
not there. Later on in my presentation I will demonstrate that is 
absolutely the case.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about the wheat board. I have heard some 
discussion about the subject. The wheat board is not a selling 
monopoly. There have been arguments that because the wheat 
board has monopoly power as a seller it will get a better price for 
farmers. That is not what it is. It sells into the world market. 
Literally dozens and dozens of major sellers sell competitive 
commodities into the market. It is not a monopoly seller; it does 
not have monopoly powers on the sell side.
<P>
	Let us make no mistake that the wheat board has monopoly 
power on the buy side. I want the same people who talk about the 
benefit of monopoly power to answer why on earth they would 
want our farmers kept under the monopoly on the buy side. There is 
only one buyer to whom we can sell our wheat and barley for 
export and our wheat for domestic use. That is where the monopoly 
is on the buy side. That is to the disadvantage of farmers and there 
is no doubt about that.
<P>
	The wheat board is also an organization which has proven to be 
unaccountable to farmers who pay the bills. The wheat board is 
totally funded by farmers from proceeds from the sale of their 
grain. Why on earth can farmers not see what goes on inside the 
organization? Why did it take a leaked document to show there was 
a severance package for commissioners of $290,000? It is 
nonsense. It is a closed organization and that has to end. It has to 
become accountable.
<P>
	I will give a bit of history. I am not going back to 1917 when it 
was first put in place or to 1920 when it was put in place again. I 
will go back to 1935. My grandfather had been farming in 
Lloydminister for 15 years when it was reinstated in 1935. At that 
time a dual marketing system was in place. Farmers had a choice. 
They could either sell through the board, on their own or through a 
grain company. That is the way the board was set up in 1935. My 
grandfather said the wheat board was a saviour for him at that time. 
He was right.
<P>
	I will talk a bit about the situation at that time. When my 
grandfather hauled his grain on a wagon, maybe 50 or 60 bushels at 
a time, to an elevator it was a haul of seven miles. At times he had 
longer hauls. He never knew what the elevator agent would do. He 
never had good market information. He lived a long way from a 
community where he could find out what the market was doing. 
Even then the information was very localized. There was not good 
market information. There was a cumbersome transportation 
system.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	The wheat board was a saviour for my grandfather, but he lived 
and he farmed long enough to curse the wheat board because of its 
monopoly powers. There is no argument. It was an excellent 
organization. It had great value to farmers when it was put in place. 
It probably still does. However, that is not what this debate is 
about.
<P>
	Then we go to 1943. During the war the Canadian government 
was concerned that wheat prices were going up dramatically and it 
wanted to get the grain cheaper for the war effort in Canada and in 
Britain. The government put the monopoly power in place through 
an order in council. That is something we would expect from this 
government. It was never debated and put through the House. It 
was established by order in council during the war in order to get 
cheap grain. As soon as it was put in place the prices dropped 
dramatically.
<P>
	I have some prices for comparison between Canadian towns in 
the prairies and U.S. towns across the border. The comparison 
shows consistently that wheat was 70 cents a bushel higher in the 
United States than it was in Canada under the wheat board 
monopoly. That is $1.80 compared with $1.10. We are looking at a 
price difference of more than 40 per cent.
<P>
	The government told Canadian farmers to accept it because it 
was for the war effort. Farmers are and always have been loyal 
citizens. They were willing to help the war effort. They were 
promised the difference would be paid back later, but they never 
saw a penny.
<P>
	That is when the wheat board got its monopoly. The monopoly 
ended later and then returned in 1948 or 1949. We have to ask why. 
The only reason a government would want a monopoly in an 
organization such as this is so it can buy grain cheap because it has 
the monopoly on the buy side.
<P>
	Then we get to 1980-81. The wheat is still being sold under the 
monopoly of the wheat board. The current minister of agriculture 
tried to have canola put under the board and he failed in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4121"> 4121 </A></B>
<P>
plebiscite. I believe that is why the minister is so shy about holding 
a plebiscite now. He knows he will lose it this time as well.
<P>
	I move now to the last four years. In 1993 Charlie Mayer, the 
minister responsible for the wheat board at the time, decided barley 
should be sold on the continental market. That meant farmers 
would have a choice to either sell through the board or directly, 
through a grain company or by themselves, to the United States. I 
would like to read a few things members of the Liberal Party said at 
that time.
<P>
	I will read from an agriculture committee transcript of April 
1993. A motion was put before the committee: ``In view of the 
concerns that have been expressed by barley producers across the 
prairies with the government's plan to establish a continental 
barley market, the Standing Committee on Agriculture calls on the 
Minister of Agriculture to have a plebiscite of producers before the 
government takes any actions to establish a continental barley 
market and remove the exclusive marketing of barley exports from 
the Canadian Wheat Board''. The hon. member for Winnipeg St. 
James, who sits in this government, argued there should have been 
a plebiscite on giving farmers the choice in marketing power.
<P>
	The Conservative government, which was no more democratic 
than this government, refused to have a plebiscite. It wanted to ram 
the change through. That was not right. There should have been a 
plebiscite at that time.
<P>
	A little later in that year, leading up to an election campaign, the 
Prime Minister promised a plebiscite on giving farmers a choice. 
The agriculture minister promised a plebiscite on giving farmers a 
choice. Many Liberal members promised a plebiscite on giving 
farmers a choice in marketing their own grain.
<P>
<B>(1950 )</B>
<P>
	It is interesting how the Liberal position has changed from the 
time they were in opposition and how democratic they were then to 
now and how undemocratic they are now.
<P>
	I want to get even a little closer to the present. I want to talk 
about what the farmers and the Government of Alberta have done 
about this Liberal broken promise to hold a plebiscite on the dual 
marketing of barley, the exact motion we are talking about, except 
we are saying we should try it for a two year period.
<P>
	In the fall of 1995 the Alberta government held a plebiscite on 
dual marketing, on giving farmers the choice to market their grain 
in any way they saw fit, either through the wheat board or on their 
own. The result of that plebiscite was that 66 per cent were in 
favour of giving farmers a choice in barley marketing and 62 per 
cent in wheat. The results were clear.
<P>
	I have heard the minister of agriculture and others saying it was 
not a fair plebiscite. To heck it was not a fair plebiscite. I voted in 
that plebiscite. I took part in the debate on that plebiscite. The only 
thing that was not fair about it was that my money, the money I 
paid to keep the wheat board operating with every bushel of grain I 
sell, although I sell very little through the board anymore because I 
do not find it profitable, and all the money spent by farmers on the 
board, what did the wheat board do? It sent all of its best sales 
people out to the meetings to tell farmers that change was not good 
for them, that mama government should control marketing their 
grain. It sent its best sales people, and they were good, top notch 
sales people. I was at some of those meetings. However, they 
failed. Farmers clearly want the right to sell their grain.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, the issue has been decided in Alberta. 
The farmers have spoken and the Alberta government has spoken. 
The issue is over and done. We still have to decide in Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba as to whether farmers should be given the choice and 
freedom to market their grain as they see fit.
<P>
	That is what this motion would do. It would give farmers right 
across the country the freedom to market their own grain, the 
product they put their money and sweat into. This motion will give 
them that choice.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Like the Prime Minister promised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Like the Prime Minister promised and like the 
agriculture minister promised.
<P>
	That is where we are today. Alberta has decided the issue, case 
closed. What will come out of this committee? Nothing. I could 
have told members that. As soon as the minister said he was to hold 
this committee on grain marketing, I wrote down what the results 
were to be. I will be right and there will not be substantial changes. 
It will be just enough, they hope, to placate farmers. It is tinkering 
and it is typical Liberal law making.
<P>
	He is the minister of procrastination, as he is called in my part of 
the country. I do not call him that, although maybe from time to 
time, but other farmers call him the minister of procrastination, and 
that is earned. He has not done a thing on this issue which is so 
important to Canadian farmers.
<P>
	Where to from here? The government, and this has been backed 
up by the member for Souris-Moose Mountain, goes nowhere on 
this issue. Nothing substantial is to happen. We keep this anomaly 
of farmers' not being given control over marketing their own 
products. No other businessman would accept that, but that is what 
it will be under the Liberals.
<P>
	However, I can absolutely guarantee the change will happen. The 
farmers will be given the choice. It will only happen under this 
government if it has a change of heart. I would not put the 
probability very high on that. However, after the next election it 
will change when the  Reform Party forms the government, as I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4122"> 4122 </A></B>
<P>
believe we will. It will change and it will change fast. It will be 
done in a short time and that is a pledge I make to farmers right 
across western Canada. The farmers will have a say.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	A plebiscite will be held and I am very confident the results of 
the plebiscite will be that farmers will choose to have the freedom 
to market the grain as they see fit and finally be given equality with 
the rest of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is always a pleasure to follow the member for Vegreville. In some 
respects he seems to be an expert on plebiscites. He seems to be an 
expert on systems. I would like him to answer a couple of direct 
questions. What is the system he is proposing? I would like him to 
define how that system would actually work, if he is actually 
saving the wheat board while bringing forward his new system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a good question and I am very 
pleased to see the member takes this debate seriously.
<P>
	Farmers will decide what question is asked. Farmers will decide 
what they want to choose from in a plebiscite. Then farmers will 
vote and that is the system they will operate under. That is a 
straight answer and I thank him for the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member for Vegreville's comments 
concerning the Canadian Wheat Board. In my former life I also 
farmed, admittedly in Ontario. I also grew wheat and I also shipped 
it and was quite happy to ship it to the Ontario wheat marketing 
board.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the member talking about the 
need for flexibility. I live in an agricultural community. Most of my 
farmers are involved with the marketing board. They are all happy. 
They fought long and hard to establish those boards. There was one 
basic reason. Generally speaking in agriculture there are many 
producers and there are very few buyers.
<P>
	The member talked endlessly about the international market and 
so forth. The reality is that with 125,000 producers there will not be 
that many buyers. Invariably what happens when that situation 
occurs is buyers start to conglomerate and pick off these producers. 
That has actually been the history of prairie grain farmers and 
farmers throughout the country. That is why so many farmers, 
whether out west or in Ontario or Quebec or whatever, have formed 
producer organized marketing systems.
<P>
	It seems the member wants to go back in history and create a free 
market economy where there really is none. There is none because 
we do not have the same number of buyers as we have producers. 
All the profits from the Canadian Wheat Board go back to the 
farmers. It is obvious to me and I do not know why it is not obvious 
to the member. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot have a 
pool marketing system on the one hand and also have a whole 
bunch of other farmers outside of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. On his statement that there are so many sellers, 125,000 
farmers, and so few buyers, under the system we are operating right 
now in the Canadian Wheat Board area and in Ontario there is only 
one buyer. That is true under the system we are under.
<P>
	However, if we give farmers a choice there are many buyers. 
There are buyers around the world. The problem in the past and the 
reason we have had a build-up of wheat in the past is that the 
market signals are not getting through this Canadian Wheat Board 
bureaucracy and its secretive behaviour and operations to the 
farmers.
<P>
	Farmers were not getting the signals as to how much grain they 
should be growing. For years they grew too much wheat for the 
market. As a result anywhere between two thirds and a third of the 
wheat they grew was being dumped on the world market, dumped 
below the cost of production and dumped at a price lower than the 
selling price in Canada. That is what happened because of the lack 
of market signals due to the secrecy of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
That is part of what we are asking to change. Open it up, give 
farmers the signals and let farmers find their own markets because 
they will have the signals then. They will know what they should be 
producing.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	Farmers are very flexible now. They can go from wheat to other 
grains. They have shown that. They have done it. In our area they 
grow specialty crops, canola, lentils, peas, hemp, and I am not 
talking about cannabis; I am talking about the legal stuff. They will 
grow whatever they can that is legal to make a living. That is part 
of the answer.
<P>
	In Ontario they are still unfortunately affected by the Canadian 
Wheat Board. The Ontario Wheat Board however has elected 
people running the board. Elected directors run the board. That is 
one of the things I think farmers would ask for with the Canadian 
Wheat Board. Let us fix the Canadian Wheat Board by giving 
farmers control over their own organization as they have in 
Ontario.
<P>
	I have been down to southern Ontario quite a few times over the 
past couple of years. I have found a revolt in southern Ontario 
against the monopoly of the Ontario Wheat Board. It is just as 
strong there as it is in the west. The problem is their democratic 
system is not working very well but they are going to make it work. 
They are replacing one by one the old directors with some new 
directors who really want to open up the market which is exactly 
what we are asking for in this motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4123"> 4123 </A></B>
<P>
	I think farmers in Ontario want exactly what farmers in the west 
want. I think we are speaking for farmers in Ontario as well 
farmers in the west.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to have such a knowledgeable audience in the House 
this evening. I will attempt to meet their expectations and then 
some.
<P>
	Let me comment first on the material I was able to obtain on the 
Canadian Wheat Board. There are three basic pillars of the wheat 
board marketing system: single desk selling, there is a power in 
marketing in this particular approach which I have not heard 
discussed in comparison to a dual marketing process; price 
pooling; and a farmer-government relationship which, as the 
previous speaker mentioned, has served since back in the teens but 
became much more supported by western farmers from the 1930s 
on.
<P>
	Also we need to mention the fact that there is a feeling by 
members opposite that the committee that has been put in place is 
lacking in credibility, is lacking in honesty in terms of how it has 
conducted its hearings and its processes. I wish to comment on that 
point.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette mentioned that he took 
exception to the fact that there were closed sessions and that this 
therefore jeopardized the entire process. I do not feel that way 
whatsoever. One of the strengths of the wheat board has been that it 
will be coming forward with a report. The report will include 
information from those sessions which some of the presenters 
wished to present in private.
<P>
	I will focus to some extent on the committee itself and will 
discuss very quickly, briefly and succinctly the fact that this panel 
is blue chip. It comes to the problem of marketing with impressive 
credentials. I support this assembly of people.
<P>
<B>(2005 )</B>
<P>
	The panel is comprised of a chairman and eight individuals who 
represent virtually every perspective on grain marketing from one 
end of the spectrum to the other. Two of the panellists were drawn 
from the ranks of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers 
Association. I know members opposite and some on our side have 
read some of the articles which have been put forward from 
associations which they represent. Four of the panellists are active 
farmers and one works in the milling industry. Three are from 
Saskatchewan, three from Alberta, two from Manitoba and one 
from Quebec.
<P>
	The minister took great care in appointing this panel to ensure 
that the members represented a broad cross-section of 
backgrounds. If I may, I would like to review their qualifications 
for the House. I am sure members will agree they are well qualified 
for the job.
<P>
	The chief panellist, Mr. Thomas Malloy of Saskatoon, 
distinguished himself prior to this appointment as chief  negotiator 
for the Government of Canada in land claim negotiations with the 
Inuit of northern Quebec and for the First Nations of British 
Columbia. He was also legal counsel for western Canada to the 
Royal Commission on the Marketing of Beef in Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Bill Duke is a former president of the Western Canadian 
Wheat Growers Association. He farms 2,000 acres near Redvers, 
Saskatchewan, just across the line from where I live, an area which 
is well represented by the member for Souris-Moose Mountain. 
He has served on the Sectoral Advisory Group on International 
Trade and has participated on the Producer Payment Panel and the 
1990 Canadian Wheat Board review panel.
<P>
	Mr. Jack Gorr of Three Hills, Alberta is vice-president of the 
WCWGA, a former member of the Alberta Grain Commission and 
a former member of the Alberta Wheat pool. He participated on the 
Gilson Task Force on Transportation some years ago.
<P>
	Mr. James Leibfried of Winnipeg is a former commissioner of 
the Canadian Wheat Board and has extensive experience in the 
grains and oilseeds industry. He negotiated numerous long term 
agreements and sales contracts in his career.
<P>
	Mr. Wally Madill of Calgary is a former CEO of the Alberta 
Wheat Pool. In addition to his distinguished career with the pool, 
he has served with numerous companies and associations in the 
agriculture and energy industries. He has served as chairperson for 
several agriculture committees, including the Senior Grain 
Transportation Committee and the Western Grain Elevator 
Association.
<P>
	Mr. John Neufeld of Dollard des Ormeaux, Quebec is director of 
Canadian operations for Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Milling 
Company and has extensive experience in the agri-processing 
industry, including flour milling, wheat starch manufacturing, 
canola crushing and brewing. He is vice-chairman of the Canadian 
National Millers Association and a member of the Minneapolis 
Grain Exchange.
<P>
	Mr. John Pearson of Calgary is first vice-president of the Alberta 
Wheat Pool as well as vice-chairman of Prairie Pools Inc. and 
Western Co-operative Fertilizers. He is also a director of Prairie 
Sun Grains and Pool Insurance. He operates a 1,700 acre grain farm 
at Donalda, Alberta.
<P>
	Mr. Avery Sahl of Mossbank, Saskatchewan has been active in 
the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and represents numerous 
organizations including the Grain Standards Committee, XCAN 
Grain and Prairie Pools. Mr. Sahl also served on the Canadian 
Wheat Board Advisory Committee for 15 years as its chairman.
<P>
	Mr. Owen McAuley of McAuley, Manitoba, served on the 
executive of the Keystone Agricultural Producers and is a member 
of the Grains and Oilseeds Safety Net  Committee which worked to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4124"> 4124 </A></B>
<P>
develop the gross revenue insurance plan and the net income 
stabilization account.
<P>
	These nine panellists have handled the entire process and have 
done so with integrity. I sat in on one of their hearings in Brandon. I 
thought it was conducted in an open and honest fashion.
<P>
	Since January the panel has conducted a number of hearings 
across the country. The hearings took place in Winnipeg, 
Edmonton and Regina. There were 80 submissions from a wide 
variety of farm groups. Submissions from these groups will show 
that there is a common consensus, a willingness to come forward 
with, hopefully, a unanimous report. If it is not, it will have some 
integrity on why there are some dissenting comments.
<P>
<B>(2010 )</B>
<P>
	I hope that the report with its observations and conclusions will 
be based on the views of the producers. The grain companies and 
other stakeholders of course will have an important voice as well. 
We look forward to constructive suggestions on how to move 
forward.
<P>
	The wheat board has served us well. As any man-made 
organization, it is not beyond or above approach. I am sensing that 
the minister will take the recommendations and put them in place 
as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always enjoy listening to my comrade from 
Brandon-Souris. I know he has his heart in the right place and he 
likes to look at things objectively.
<P>
	I have read a lot of the presentations made to the Western Grain 
Marketing Panel. I still have not heard one of those presentations 
state that it wanted to have the wheat board stay status quo. I 
wonder if the hon. member could identify one of those 
presentations which stated it wanted to keep the wheat board the 
way it is. I have not found one yet.
<P>
	There is another question I want to ask the hon. member. I agree 
pooling is a nice way of doing things and getting good and equal 
prices. However, what would he do with farmers who are in a 
position of having land which is overtaxed and overpriced and who 
have to pay five times as much for their property tax as some of 
their neighbours? Should the cost not also be pooled so these 
farmers can continue to operate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I did not and I tried not to 
leave the impression that any of the organizations that were making 
presentations wanted the status quo to necessarily remain. As I said 
earlier, they are not totally above reproach. A lot of the 
organizations will be coming forward with some administrative or 
operational suggestions.
<P>
	In all sincerity to my hon. colleague, if one is paying higher 
taxes in a building on Main Street, then one goes to another area 
where the taxes are lower. Farmers are  doing that. I know a farmer 
from my area who decided that his taxes or operating costs were 
too high and he was keeping cattle so he went to another area where 
he could carry on his operations.
<P>
	I do not think we can answer this question in terms of apples and 
oranges, because that is the comparison the member is alleging.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am anticipating questions 
three and four from the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, finally I get to ask three and four. They will be from a 
different member, but if you do not get answers, I guess it does not 
matter who does not give you the answers.
<P>
	Whose wheat is it? Does the wheat belong to the government, to 
the Canadian Wheat Board or to the farmer? The reason I ask that is 
why not let farmers control their own affairs? Why do we need to 
have the government intervene in their affairs and have this 
heavy-handed way of controlling absolutely everything that is 
happening in the wheat marketing situations?
<P>
	In my third question, I would first like to know whose grain is it?
<P>
	The last question I am going to ask comes because of the glaring 
contradiction in what the members are saying about the grain 
marketing panel and what they are saying about the Canadian 
Wheat Board. They are vehemently defending the Canadian Wheat 
Board and then say they have this open and accountable grain 
marketing panel that is going to deal with this situation. That is 
obviously a contradiction.
<P>
	They cannot extol the virtues and say that everything has to be 
kept the way it is and only tinker a little bit and then say that it is a 
completely open and accountable process in the grain marketing 
panel. They cannot be impartial if they have already entrenched our 
position and appointed the people with no input from Reform as to 
who is going to sit on that panel and have input into that. Those are 
the two questions I would like to see answered.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure the hon. member 
for Yorkton-Melville will be working on questions five and six 
for later.
<P>
<B>(2015 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased to be doing 
three and four for my hon. colleague.
<P>
	Whose wheat is it? At the present time, as I understand the 
process, the farmer takes it from the combine, to the truck, to an 
agency which sells it or markets it. At that point he then loses 
control. It is his grain until such time as he markets it. Then it 
becomes the property of the person to whom he has sold it. It may 
be a feeder, it may be an elevator company.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4125"> 4125 </A></B>
<P>
	In terms of the second issue on-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take 
part in this debate and speak to the pivotal role of the Canadian 
Wheat Board and the role it plays in prairie agriculture.
<P>
	It is important to remind members opposite that the Canadian 
Wheat Board came into being through a grassroots movement by 
Canadian farmers. They lobbied the federal government to put in 
place a marketing agency to help them access export markets. The 
Canadian Wheat Board exists because prairie farmers demanded it.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board continues to exist because by far the 
majority of farmers support it. This is very important for members 
to keep in mind. Farmers are in essence the board's shareholders. 
The mandate of the board is to get the best possible returns for 
Canadian prairie farmers.
<P>
	As the farmer's marketing agency, the Canadian Wheat Board 
returns all sales revenues after the costs of marketing to the wheat 
and barley farmers of western Canada. Farmers do not have to split 
sales revenues with other shareholders. It is all divided among 
them based on deliveries and grades.
<P>
	It is no secret that I have long been a strong supporter of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. As a farmer I know what the board means 
for the bottom line of our farms. The board provides me and 
farmers like me with consistently higher prices than we could get 
by marketing on our own. This was proven in an external 
performance appraisal conducted by three well known and well 
respected agricultural economists from the prairies.
<P>
	The evaluation clearly stated that if single desk selling were 
ended prairie farmers would lose $13.35 per tonne, which would 
amount to a total loss to prairie farmers of $365 million per year. Is 
this what Reformers want? Do they want to take $365 million out 
of farmers pockets every year? Farmers will not stand for it and 
neither will I. These are the facts. I do not know one farmer who 
would be willing to give up over $13 per tonne.
<P>
	The board's mandate is to make money for Canadian farmers, 
period. That is what the board has been doing very well for the past 
60 years.
<P>
	It is interesting that when we ask supporters of dual marketing 
for their facts, all they can provide are vague references to one time 
only limited niche markets, and the rhetoric goes on and on. They 
have never provided one shred of evidence that farmers would be 
better off financially in the long term with dual marketing.
<P>
	The board is able to provide prairie farmers with high returns 
because it operates from a position of strength. It uses its 
considerable resources, its information on markets, crop and 
weather surveillance, and combines  that with excellent customer 
service to create stable, long term markets for quality wheat and 
barley for farmers in my riding of Dauphin-Swan River and for 
farmers right across the prairies.
<P>
	Members might not realize the Canadian Wheat Board is one of 
Canada's largest exporters, with annual sales revenues approaching 
$5 billion. The board is constantly looking for new markets for new 
products farmers can grow to satisfy export market demands. AC 
Karma is an excellent example of this. The board is working hard 
to expand markets in countries throughout the world, including the 
Pacific rim.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	There are plenty of reasons the wheat board is one of the most 
well respected grain marketers in the world and why the same 
customers come back year after year. The board's reputation for 
products of excellent and reliable quality is commonly recognized 
as Canada's trump card on international grain markets. Buyers 
from around the world ignore cheap grain to buy Canadian.
<P>
	Why would they do this? They know it is consistent from year to 
year, load to load. Our export partners know they get the best 
quality wheat and barley in the world from the Canadian Wheat 
Board, and they come back year after year.
<P>
	It is also important for members to know the Canadian Wheat 
Board is being responsive to farmers' needs and that it is being 
flexible. For example, improvements have been made to the 
delivery system, with extensive input from farmers and elevator 
companies, to address the delivery needs of farmers.
<P>
	The board is also recommending a number of legislative changes 
which will put money into farmers' hands faster by changing 
payment structures. It will provide increased information to 
farmers to help them with their management decisions.
<P>
	The Liberal government recognizes the importance of the 
Canadian Wheat Board to western Canadian farmers and it wants 
the board to be the best it can be. For that reason I commend the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for establishing the grain 
marketing panel. He has pulled together panel members who 
represent a cross-section of the industry to look at our grain 
marketing system. One of the focuses has been the operation of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Through the grain marketing panel we are consulting with 
farmers. Farmers are telling us how the system can be improved to 
serve them better. The minister has indicated that changes may be 
made. These changes will be to the benefit of prairie farmers.
<P>
	I attended meetings of the grain marketing panel in Brandon and 
in my home town of Grandview. The clear message farmers from 
my riding of Dauphin-Swan River and from across Manitoba 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4126"> 4126 </A></B>
<P>
were sending was they wanted the Canadian Wheat Board to 
remain the single desk seller for Canadian wheat and barley.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is an important and highly effective 
marketing agency, and the majority of western Canadian farmers 
are anxious to strengthen the board, rather than weaken it. Every 
day my office receives calls from farmers in support of the board 
and single desk selling. They tell me the board and single desk 
selling are crucial to their survival.
<P>
	The results of the election to the Canadian Wheat Board's 
advisory committee, in which 10 of 11 farmer representatives 
chosen were strong wheat board supporters, are proof that grain 
farmers from across the prairies firmly support the board. The 
evidence is clear. Farmers want the Canadian Wheat Board. They 
want single desk selling.
<P>
	This motion is yet another example of shortsighted, ill conceived 
policy by the Reform Party that will hurt farmers. If the Reform 
Party is so interested in agriculture, I wonder why agriculture 
policy was not even on the agenda at its recent conference. That 
speaks volumes about where agriculture is on the Reform Party's 
priority list. It is nowhere on the list.
<P>
	I can tell the House, for the record, that a strong Canadian Wheat 
Board is on the top of my priority list for the following reasons.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board, with its single desk selling, works 
with other players in order to achieve major objectives which 
would be difficult to accomplish in any other way. One, it 
maximizes returns to producers. Two, it ensures unparalleled 
quality control. Three, it provides ongoing customer service in the 
international marketplace.
<P>
	The farmers of Dauphin-Swan River and many of the 
grassroots farmers from across western Canada want a strong 
Canadian Wheat Board and I support them wholeheartedly.
<P>
<B>(2025)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this debate is becoming so lively that a whole raft of my 
colleagues would like to have the opportunity to ask the hon. 
member a question.
<P>
	Finally we have a western farmer making a presentation from the 
other side of the House. I congratulate the member for making her 
presentation this evening despite the late hour. I listened 
attentively.
<P>
	When my hon. colleague for Yorkton-Melville asked the 
member from across the House who the wheat belongs to, the hon. 
member for Halifax stuck her head in the Chamber and heckled and 
said the wheat belongs to God. Perhaps as their leader would say it 
will take an act of God before we ever see any changes to the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	What is the answer they are proposing? We are proposing to give 
farmers some freedom, to give farmers the choice. We are not 
proposing to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. Far from it. We 
are saying give farmers the choice. Their answer is to defend 
section 745 of the Criminal Code, let first degree murderers out on 
early parole, at the same time as they throw farmers in jail. It is 
absolutely ludicrous.
<P>
	What is their answer to the present dilemma facing grain farmers 
in western Canada where we see farmers being arrested, their 
equipment, their combines, their trucks being impounded at the 
border and the farmers being hauled before the courts? Is that their 
idea of settling this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not like what I am about to do 
but in order to answer the hon. member's question I will have to 
crawl to the depths of the Reform Party, to its rhetoric.
<P>
	The rhetoric in the House in the last three or four hours is 
appalling. We have asked Reform Party members on several 
occasions what they mean about dual marketing. The Liberal 
government has provided them with the facts of what the Canadian 
Wheat Board is about, that we are listening to farmers. It is about 
time we heard some facts about where they would like the 
government to go with respect to dual marketing and Canadian 
farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the member who seems to 
know a bit about Reform policy. She should know if she listened to 
my speech that I did give a definition of what dual marketing was 
and I gave examples of how dual marketing had worked, but 
obviously she did not listen.
<P>
	In resolutions passed at our recent assembly in Vancouver, 91 per 
cent of our voting delegates voted in favour of marketing choice, in 
others words dual marketing.
<P>
	As well, there was overwhelming support for a resolution calling 
for final offer arbitration in settling these labour disputes that effect 
the movement of grain to port. The member is not paying a whole 
lot of attention and is not coming with the facts into this debate.
<P>
	She said Canadians demanded that the Canadian Wheat Board be 
established and thought that was wonderful, but she neglected to 
note that Alberta producers democratically demanded the right to 
market outside of the board and she ignored the wishes of those 
farmers.
<P>
	She referred to the Kraft report as being some wonderful and 
reliable document when in fact it was funded by the Canadian 
Wheat Board and based on a private, secret information provided to 
that study group by the board. It does not have a whole lot of 
credibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4127"> 4127 </A></B>
<P>
	She said her constituents are supportive of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. I wonder what kind of response she received from her 
constituents regarding the commissioner's high salary, which was 
recently released, and the immoral severance package, well over 
$250,000 over two years should they resign or retire from the 
board. Do her constituents support that? Does she think that if 
farmers want to market outside an agency that provides those 
kinds of exorbitant severance package to their commissioners, 
those benefits, they should have the right?
<P>
<B>(2030 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an incredible difference 
between this Liberal government and the third party in this House 
of Commons.
<P>
	The government is listening and consulting with the grassroots 
movement of the country. We are awaiting the results of a panel. A 
good majority of those grassroots people will in fact be coming 
from the third party of this House of Commons.
<P>
	It is very easy to sit on the opposite side of the House and pull 
apart and dismantle a marketing system that works incredibly well 
for farmers. It is my understanding that the third party is on a 
crusade to destroy the most effective marketing system we have in 
this country, the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is question No. 5. Surveys have been taken in my 
riding and over 80 per cent of the people want the Canadian Wheat 
Board. They like the Canadian Wheat Board but they see the 
Liberal government destroying the board by its inaction.
<P>
	That same 80 per cent of the people want some very key and 
important changes made. Reform has been listening and addressing 
those changes. There is a great suspicion that some of the decisions 
that are made by the Canadian Wheat Board favour eastern 
interests and because the wheat board is not open and accountable 
we have no way of knowing. It is not controlled by farmers.
<P>
	I will give you one example. Farmers suspect that a lot of the 
grain is shipped through Thunder Bay and the Lakehead and goes 
out through the east because it benefits eastern interests and is 
controlled by politicians and bureaucrats in Ottawa. We have no 
way of knowing whether that is true. Farmers would like to see the 
port of Churchill utilized a lot more because it has great 
advantages. This Liberal government has talked the talk but does 
not walk the walk in investigating and using the port of Churchill.
<P>
	The buck stops right with this agriculture minister who refuses to 
address this issue and open up the wheat board, make it 
accountable and controlled by farmers. I do not see how they can 
argue against it. There is a glaring contradiction in the fact that they 
vehemently defend the status quo of the Canadian Wheat Board 
and  at the same time say we have an open marketing panel that is 
going to address the issue. You cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is a group of 
people in this country that have had more change in the last 60 
years than Canadian farmers. Canadian farmers are open to change 
and Canadian farmers who are shareholders of the Canadian Wheat 
Board are open to change.
<P>
	With respect to the question about the confidentiality of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the Canadian Wheat Board books are open 
every single year. What the Canadian Wheat Board cannot do is 
take it directly to the Reform Party and put it in front of their eyes. 
It is up to Reform members to make that kind of a decision. It is up 
to the third party to at least make some pretence to find out the 
quality of the best marketing system in the world which is in fact 
the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, 
I have the honour of representing the riding of Lotbinière. This 
evening my riding association is gathered in my riding office, and I 
want to congratulate it on the good work done and the support I 
have been given. So, I say a big thanks to the whole team.
<P>
	The riding of Lotbinière is one of the largest agricultural ridings 
in Quebec. Accordingly, agricultural matters are of particular 
interest to me because I want to be up on what my constituents are 
facing. Furthermore, I sit on the House Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	That said, although the farmers in my riding are not those most 
affected, the motion brought forward today by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster has a much greater impact on farmers 
in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and certain parts of British 
Columbia. Because of professionalism and my membership on the 
agriculture and agri-food committee, I consider it important to take 
part in this debate. When I refer to the prairie provinces, this is the 
territory served by the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
<B>(2035)</B>
<P>
	I certainly am not feeling a need to defend the Canadian Wheat 
Board at all cost, but it seems important to look at what it is all 
about. It may be considered a crown corporation, because it is 
responsible to Parliament. In legal terms, it comes under the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act, but in practical terms, it is responsible 
to the farmers, because it is funded by some 130,000 wheat and 
barley farmers in the provinces I named earlier.
<P>
	Let us have a look, if you will, at the board's history. There are in 
fact two Canadian Wheat Boards. Let me explain. The first, the 
CWB, was established in 1917 to counter the major economic 
upheavals caused by World  War I. Then, with the economic crisis 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4128"> 4128 </A></B>
<P>
of 1929, Parliament had to bring it back definitely. This is what I 
call the second board.
<P>
	Since then, there have been numerous changes, some of which I 
would like to point out, in order to illustrate the board's flexibility 
and ability to adapt.
<P>
	First of all, in 1949 the board was given responsibility for 
marketing oats and barley. These two markets were added to the 
responsibility it already had for wheat.
<P>
	It was not until August 1, 1989 that oats were removed from the 
board's mandate. Furthermore, four years later, on August 1, 1993, 
barley destined for the continental market was removed from its 
mandate by order in council. In this particular case, there was 
opposition, and the matter was referred to the courts.
<P>
	Following a decision, and subsequent appeal, in which the 
government's decision was declared ultra vires, the board was left 
with responsibility for barley. The problem lay in the fact that 
barley had been removed from the board's mandate by order in 
council. And the Federal Court had to rule that the Canadian Wheat 
Board's mandate could only be modified by Parliament and not by 
mere order in council.
<P>
	In conclusion, barley is therefore still under the jurisdiction of 
the Canadian Wheat Board. The board relies primarily on the 
system of pooling. This system allows all producers to receive an 
initial identical payment year round. The final payment 
supplements the initial payment in order to reflect the value set by 
the market during a crop year.
<P>
	In other words, the pooling system is used to level out price 
fluctuations. The pool price is representative of the price 
variations. The way the pool price is calculated results in each 
category of grains within a pool gaining neither advantage nor 
disadvantage from various factors.
<P>
	It must be kept in mind that, although a pool system may 
attenuate the fluctuations that are inherent in any commercial 
transaction, the asking price remains subject to outside 
competition. Remember the strong downward fluctuations in grain 
prices in the second half of 1980. Some pools recorded marked 
deficits and these were absorbed by the federal government.
<P>
	In normal circumstances, the Wheat Board balances its various 
pools, and this was a definite advantage during that time in the 
Eighties. It seems to me that memories are short on the Reform side 
about the advantages the Canadian Wheat Board has conferred in 
the past. It seems that the wind has changed, in that the present 
market offers advantageous prices, and that is what has prompted a 
group of barley and wheat producers to want to take advantage of 
greater flexibility in marketing their grains. Some will accuse the 
CWB of being timid in its actions and in its offers to develop new 
outlets, new markets. They focus on this in demanding changes, 
forgetting the advantages of the system. In fact, for them,  it seems 
more advantageous to pull out of a rigid system that is focussed on 
long term stability.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-LLoydminster and his 
Reform colleagues are trying to make political hay with this 
motion. They too are feeling the gusts of electoral winds, which 
may well get stronger this fall.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	The Reformers, lacking popularity and visibility, want to amend 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act to include a special 2 year opting 
out provision affording prairie producers the flexibility and choice 
to market their products outside the jurisdiction of the board.
<P>
	When we look at the motives of the Reformers, we see they are 
working for themselves and not to really come to the aid of barley 
and wheat producers in the west. This motion raises a lot of 
questions in addition to those about the real motives and intentions 
of the Reformers.
<P>
	I can understand, obviously, that certain barley and wheat 
producers want to get out of the CWB, but do they all? Should we 
give up a system that works relatively well for all wheat and barley 
producers for a small group?
<P>
	They want to make money. The current economic situation is in 
their favour. I understand they want a special clause to opt out for 
two years. After that, will they have to return to the ranks of the 
Canadian Wheat Board? Who will keep track of things? The 
system proposed by the Reform Party is impractical. The new 
system will make the job of the Canadian Wheat Board difficult, I 
should say perilous.
<P>
	In fact, this House should debate the whole existential issue of 
marketing boards such as the Canadian Wheat Board. Which is 
better, to stabilize the prices received by barley and wheat 
producers on a median basis, or to ride out market cycles? In 
general, everyone is seeking security and stability, both financially 
and materially, as well as emotionally.
<P>
	Few people would like to see their salary drop, and yet three 
highly respected economists from western Canada took a look at 
what it would mean for western producers if the Canadian Wheat 
Board were to disappear. According to them, the loss of the pooling 
system would be accompanied by a loss in revenues for western 
farmers.
<P>
	Try to imagine the scene. Things are fine, for the Canadian 
Wheat Board is no longer wanted. I spoke to you earlier about the 
present situation. Do you know that there was a decrease in world 
stocks of wheat in 1993-94, that there was a drop in production in 
the former Soviet Union countries, that there was a drought in 
Australia in 1994? These are all factors that influence price.
<P>
	We are headed toward the global village foretold by Marshall 
McLuhan, a native Albertan. McLuhan thought that people had to 
be constantly clear-headed and aware  of what was happening to 
them. Today, no one can deny what is happening on the other side 
of the planet, even from the point of view of climate, because we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4129"> 4129 </A></B>
<P>
feel the effects in our own environment. When money is not 
involved, it is another story. I am thinking here of the volcanic 
eruptions of Mount St. Helen.
<P>
	The proposal by the Reform member is designed, in the medium 
and long term, to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. The Reform 
tell us today that they want only to allow farmers not to lose any 
business opportunities by offering them flexibility and marketing 
choices for wheat and barley.
<P>
	Taking note of their arguments, and faced with the imminent 
possibility of the PM calling a general election before long, one 
wonders if the Reform members are not making political hay with 
this. Yes, political hay. No one need fear calling things by their 
right name.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois position is clear. We are opposed to the 
motion the Reform is proposing today, for it is our opinion that the 
Canadian Wheat Board must, if it is to remain efficient, stay as the 
only body empowered to market barley and wheat overseas and in 
the United States.
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that the CWB exported wheat to 69 countries in 
its last crop year. Nothing to be sneezed at. You know, in a trade 
negotiation situation, the Canadian Wheat Board with its monopoly 
is the only possible contact for anyone wanting to purchase 
Canadian wheat. We cannot play ostrich, with our heads in the 
sand, thinking that this means it can demand higher prices than 
would be asked if there were several suppliers. The CWB, if it had 
no monopoly, would find itself in direct competition with the other 
sellers of Canadian grains, and the market price would be in danger 
of plummeting rapidly.
<P>
	Finally, let us not forget that the CWB can, at any time, set 
different prices according to the markets, without eating into 
revenues from preferred markets.
<P>
	The Reform motion would also undermine the level of price 
pooling and risk reduction. In a sense, what is being said is: ``The 
heck with the security and stability that the current Canadian 
Wheat Board provides''. The Reformers, with their inappropriate 
motion, are simply trying to set up a parallel system wheat and 
barley marketing system. This new system would only limit the 
actions of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	There is another not insignificant aspect. As you know, the 
Canadian government supports the funding of the Canadian Wheat 
Board when it borrows on international markets. Can you imagine 
the rate of interest the CWB would be able to negotiate allowing 
producers to withdraw for two years? Would it be able to negotiate 
rates as advantageous as those it gets now?
<P>
	In all loyalty, we owe it to ourselves to challenge a motion like 
the one by the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster. Even Prairie 
Pools, the strongest pressure group or lobby among western grain 
producers supports the continued existence of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	As you know, there is no such thing as a perfect system or a 
perfect member of Parliament. Nevertheless, I am convinced that 
the board is by far and away the best marketing tool and an 
excellent partner for barley and wheat producers.
<P>
	In another area, are you aware that the milk producers in my 
riding of Lotbinière, in Quebec and in Canada still prefer to live 
with the inflexibility of a system that provides for a stable income 
rather than challenge it.
<P>
	I have a really hard time understanding the Reformers. They 
either head upstream in an effort to make political mileage or they 
divert attention from more important events that we as 
Parliamentarians should be paying attention to.
<P>
	This is not the first time that Reformers have struck at the 
Canadian Wheat Board. They already called for a plebiscite to elect 
producers to the board of directors of the CWB. You know, 
allowing producers to choose whether or not to take part in 
decisions will always be an option when barley and wheat prices 
are high, but it is a much less attractive option when markets are 
saturated and prices fall because of production costs. Remember 
the second half of 1980 I was telling you about earlier.
<P>
	Right now, there is an advisory board of producers elected by 
their peers that makes known its ideas, although it has no actual 
power.
<P>
	The marketing of barley and wheat is an huge undertaking. 
Canadian Wheat Board sales are approximately four billion dollars. 
Operating costs alone are $41 million, approximately one per cent 
of total sales. Over 500 full-time and temporary employees and 
some 16 regional representatives work daily on behalf of barley 
and wheat producers.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
	People may say that the Canadian Wheat Board is not perfect, 
but to scuttle it in this underhanded manner through the motion the 
Reformers are presenting today borders on Reform mania. After 
Liberal mania, we know what the new one is.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is the institutional embodiment of a 
marketing system developed to truly help producers.
<P>
	It rests on three fundamental pillars. The first is its exclusive 
authority in foreign sales of wheat and barley. In the case of the 
United States, it is for wheat only.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4130"> 4130 </A></B>
<P>
	The second pillar is the pooling of resources with respect to 
prices. When we pool resources, we can do interesting things. 
Here, I am thinking of the Mouvement Desjardins.
<P>
	The third pillar of the Canadian Wheat Board is the partnership 
between producers and the government. Grain producers 
individually have little leverage to sell their products and a lot less 
weight to penetrate foreign markets, where market forces are more 
or less fair.
<P>
	In short, this is the essence of my opposition to the motion of the 
Reform Party member.
<P>
	Do you know how the <I>Petit Robert</I> defines a reformer? It talks of 
a tendency to reform. Under the definition of the adjective, it 
provides ``advocate of political reform, individual wanting to 
improve capitalist society through reform''. Parenthetically, it 
provides that such people are the opposite of revolutionaries.
<P>
	What they are after is in fact a step by step revolution. The first 
step is to destabilize the Canadian Wheat Board. The next is to 
claim the difficulties it faces as the result are a sign of its illness 
and to use this to demand nothing less than its abolition. Why not 
go directly to Go? Well, no, they will not, because basically they 
know the board plays a very important role.
<P>
	Once again they are only after political mileage. I think it is 
shameful to go after it on the back of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Western producers need protection, and for years it has been 
provided. I have to say it must not be abolished. I said earlier that 
they want to abolish it for two years. But how, at the end of the two 
years, will they pick up again? I see the Prime Minister indicating 
his agreement with me. It is not easy. For sure nothing is perfect. 
But to go from there to knocking everything down and not 
providing an alternate structure or some other means is going too 
far in the opposite direction.
<P>
	What I can say is that my party supports the Canadian Wheat 
Board and we will work hard to keep it and to have it continue to 
help western producers.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the 
House that I have had numerous letters from a number of farmers 
in my riding requesting that we enhance the powers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board by adding other commodities to the board.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is this. Does he believe that the 
theory behind the motion of the third party in the House of 
Commons is to destroy, undermine and undercut the credibility of 
the Canadian Wheat Board as well as undercut the grassroots 
movement of this country which is Canadian farmers?
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond, because this 
is a very important question. It raises two points. The first, I feel 
that there must be solidarity among western producers.
<P>
	As I was saying just now in my speech, not everything is perfect, 
but there is a difference between wanting to make improvements 
and throwing the baby out with the bath water. I feel the Canadian 
Wheat Board has a place among the producers in western Canada.
<P>
	I would have been pleased to see the Reform members come up 
with a motion indicating that they had something better to propose. 
Having worked in the labour movement, I must admit that I see this 
as a kind of western association. They want to pull out, but they 
want to be able to come back. Let us ask this: after they have been 
out for two years, how will they get back into the Canadian Wheat 
Board?
<P>
	I feel that, with the Canadian Wheat Board, things can be added, 
we can try to modify and to improve, and if that is done, all of the 
western producers-it is not Quebec that is the big wheat producer, 
but the west-if we sit down around the same table to try and find 
solutions, let me tell you, everyone will be happy and peace will 
have been restored.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask our colleague why does the American government so strongly 
argue against the Canadian Wheat Board? Does the hon. member 
think the Americans are trying to protect Canadian grain producers 
or would it be possible they are trying to protect their own?
<P>
	Does the hon. member also think that it is possible that if the 
Canadian Wheat Board was dismantled they would throw their 
borders open and allow grain to flow across that border without a 
problem or a challenge?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond. I went to 
Washington when the Farm Bill was being studied, and let me tell 
you, I had some interesting experiences. We are not the most 
protectionist, the Americans are.
<P>
	They protect their markets, and when they can improve things, 
they do. Let me tell you, the Americans will gain the upper hand if 
we do not get our act together. What we in Canada have to do in 
connection with the Canadian Wheat Board is not to destroy 
everything, but to build it up where necessary.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments made by the 
members of the third party this evening.
<P>
	It is somewhat ironic that it takes a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois to explain to the third or fourth party the destructiveness 
of what it is Reform members are advocating this evening.
<P>
	The member from the Bloc mentioned, and I quote from some of 
his comments, that the Reform Party was out of touch. That is 
abundantly clear when we have many western producers who 
favour not the dismantling of the wheat board but having a close 
examination of it to see how it could be improved in a sensible, 
logical, carefully thought out way. It is anathema to the Reform 
Party. Carefully thought out is not in the Reform Party handbook.
<P>
	My hon. friend also mentioned that what the Reform Party is up 
to is political mileage. The other side of that is short term thinking. 
I guess if one is the fourth party, short term thinking is about all one 
can afford to do because one will not be around that long anyway.
<P>
	The other term that was used by my colleague was Reform 
mania. I know we are here speaking about wheat and not mad cows, 
but it occurred to me as I listened that their solution to this is 
because there some problems with the wheat board and they cannot 
think their way out of this, so just dump it. That is the Reform 
Party's simplistic, short term, Homer Simpson-like solution.
<P>
	Of course the wheat board is not perfect-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> I know, it is the other side of the story. It is not 
perfect and that is why the minister has put together a panel chaired 
by a very competent individual and people representing all the 
stakeholders involved on all sides of the issue. We can put a 
thoughtful view on this, as opposed to whatever it is that comes out 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	I wonder if my colleague could explain to Reformers one more 
time why there is strength in numbers, why 130,000 farmers acting 
together with an improved board to sell their grain would be more 
useful than every man for himself. I do mean every man for himself 
when I talk about the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that the Reformers are a 
new party. They have just arrived in this House, and they too are 
learning. We know that we learn from our mistakes.
<P>
	I remember the Reformers when I arrived here, in the House of 
Commons. They did not talk about wheat and barley, but I will not 
mention that. The first thing I heard  them talking about was the 
price of club sandwiches and the shoe shine service. They wanted 
to see these benefits disappear.
<P>
	I will tell you that there are more serious matters than club 
sandwiches and shoe shine services that need to be discussed in this 
House. I would like to warn western producers. The Reformers had 
better watch out because they are going to see a fast one pulled, let 
me tell you.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite a lively crowd at nine o'clock. It 
sounds like the French party is having a French festival on the other 
side.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to join the debate today on an issue which 
is of vital importance to tens of thousands of Canadian men and 
women, the Canadian grain marketing system. This is not a debate 
to be entered lightly or frivolously. This country's grain industry is 
a vital, prosperous and growing sector, a sector where farm receipts 
alone totalled more than $8.5 billion last year. It is the economic 
backbone of Canada's prairie region.
<P>
	Though based in the prairies, the influence of the grain sector is 
felt across the country, from the flour mills of Montreal to the ports 
of Vancouver, to the fertilizer and farm equipment dealers in my 
native Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I believe it would be fair to say literally hundreds of thousands of 
Canadian men and women depend on the grain sector, either 
indirectly or directly, for their livelihood and well-being.
<P>
	Today's debate is not just about party politics or about an 
opposition party's attempting to score political points at the 
expense of the government. It is about institutions that helped to 
build the prairies. It is about the thousands of western Canadian 
grain producers and their families who have a very real and basic 
stake in what we are discussing today.
<P>
	The motion we are debating in the House today calls on the 
government to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act to include a 
special two year opting out provision permitting those prairie 
producers who believe they are missing market opportunities the 
flexibility and choice to market their wheat and barley outside the 
jurisdiction of the board.
<P>
	I find it quite interesting that members of the party opposite have 
waited so long to introduce a motion on an issue about which they 
claim to care so deeply. Anyone who has followed the ongoing 
debate on western Canadian grain marketing would know that 
within a matter of weeks there will be a report from the 
prairie-wide consultation process the minister initiated.
<P>
	The nine members of the Western Grain Marketing Panel 
consulted with producers, industry, the provinces  and other 
concerned stakeholders about the future of the western grain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4132"> 4132 </A></B>
<P>
marketing system. Their findings and conclusions will be on the 
minister's desk within a matter of weeks. Yet members opposite 
would have the federal government disregard this process, discount 
the hard work of the panel and the contributions made by thousands 
of individuals and companies, and unilaterally introduce a major 
change in the manner in which wheat and barley are exported in 
Canada. I find this reasoning quite dumbfounding.
<P>
	What I find even more surprising is that not only did the Reform 
Party make a submission to the panel, a submission which if the 
government were to adopt this motion would simply be tossed 
aside, but the submission was made by the sponsor of this motion. 
As Alice noted in <I>Through the Looking Glass</I>, it is curiouser and 
curiouser.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	I cannot and would not want to speak for the Reform Party but I 
am prepared and committed to wait and see what western Canadian 
grain producers have to say about contemplating any changes.
<P>
	This motion speaks of giving farmers a choice. It promotes the 
so-called dual marketing system, a system which in theory gives 
farmers the option of marketing grain on their own or continuing to 
have the Canadian Wheat Board market their produce on their 
behalf. Dual market proponents say they want the alternative to use 
the current system or not to use it as their choice. Fundamental in 
their line of argument is that the wheat board should remain. That is 
the fundamental issue and one that bears largely on this motion. 
Can you have your cake and eat it too?
<P>
	Can the Canadian Wheat Board continue to operate successfully 
side by side with a free and open market? I do not know the answer 
to that question. I am not inclined to jump to any conclusions but 
my instinct would be that it is pretty tough to have both systems 
equally successful. Let us reserve judgment until we see what the 
panel has to say on the issue.
<P>
	The issue of grain marketing in western Canada is one that has 
stirred emotion and debate for quite some time. There are farmers 
on both sides of the issue, some of whom are very strongly 
supportive of the Canadian Wheat Board system and others who 
hold different points of view.
<P>
	In order to bring some logic, focus and coherence to the debate 
rather than having people shout at each other through bull horns 
from the back of pickup trucks, last year the minister established 
the Western Grain Marketing Panel to investigate on behalf of all 
grain producers in western Canada the issue related to the broad 
subject of grain marketing, one of which is obviously the 
marketing system of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The panel has been hard at work for many months. It held 15 
public town hall meetings across the prairies to provide 
information and to receive input and feedback from farmers and 
farm organizations. It conducted three sets of formal hearings in 
Winnipeg, Edmonton and Regina to provide a formal opportunity 
for all of those with differing views to come forward with their best 
arguments, their best evidence for one system or another, to be 
subject to examination and cross-examination, and to weigh the 
benefits and the consequences.
<P>
	The panel is now in the final stages of preparing its report. The 
minister expects to have that document the first week of July and 
he will make it public soon after. Once we have the report we will 
be in a much better position to make whatever future decisions are 
necessary with respect to grain marketing.
<P>
	The Western Grain Marketing Panel review has been a process of 
the utmost integrity and it is a process we are committed to seeing 
through until the end. We wanted input from grain producers. We 
will not dishonour that commitment by agreeing to such a 
monumental change before considering their views.
<P>
	I know that some individuals within the sector, possibly some 
within this Chamber, have criticized the panel process as being too 
long and too time consuming. They applaud the efforts of a small 
fringe group which calls itself Farmers for Justice. I prefer the 
name which was bestowed on that group by a letter written by one 
of western Canada's larger farm newspapers, Farmers for Just Us.
<P>
	This group has for many months staged protests in which 
convoys of Canadian wheat and barley cross the border into the 
United States without having the required Canadian Wheat Board 
export licenses. These individuals may see themselves as freedom 
fighters or some kind of latter day Robin Hoods, stealing from the 
big Canadian Wheat Board, but in reality the situation is far 
different.
<P>
	By illegally exporting grain on their own, by circumventing the 
Canadian Wheat Board and its pooling system, these individuals 
are not pooling or sharing their profits from these sales with other 
producers from across the prairies. What is wrong with that, some 
might ask.
<P>
	Through the use of pooling the board ensures all western 
Canadian producers, whether they farm in the Red Deer Valley of 
Manitoba or the Peace River region of British Columbia, share and 
share alike in the revenues generated by their sweat and toil. This is 
the co-operative spirit that helped to build the prairies and it is a 
tradition of which all prairie residents should be justifiably proud.
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	A recent ruling in Manitoba has created a certain degree of 
confusion within the industry and has given rise to false claims and 
charges by some, including those  on the opposite benches, that the 
court ruled against the Canadian Wheat Board. If I may be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4133"> 4133 </A></B>
<P>
permitted to quote from the judge's formal written decision it will 
become quite clear that nothing could be further from the truth:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is not a case about the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly over 
interprovincial and international trade in grain. This is not a case about the 
powers of the Canadian Wheat Board to control the export and sale of grain and 
to grant licences therefore. This is not a case about free enterprise in a 
democratic society nor is it about the benefits of marketing boards versus the 
benefits of free enterprise. This is not a case to resolve the apparent debate 
between farmer and farmer or between farmers and the government as to which 
is the best method to market grain. This is not a case about David versus Goliath. 
This is a case about a man who is alleged to have exported grain to the United 
States of America and, at the time he crossed the border with the grain, did not 
show a licence to export the grain to the appropriate customs official.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Some have criticized the government for the action it took to 
respond to this court ruling, action taken to restore certainty in the 
wake of the decision. The situation the federal government and the 
entire western grains industry found itself in following the 
judgment was intolerable and could not be left alone.
<P>
	There were two apparently conflicting rulings from courts in 
Manitoba with respect to export procedures on wheat and barley. 
Producers, exporters and industry needed a degree of certainty. In 
order to restore that certainty, in order to make crystal clear the 
requirements to export wheat and barley, the federal government 
clarified the relevant Canadian Wheat Board regulations. Industry 
needed to know clearly what the rules were and that is what the 
federal government achieved by clarifying the regulations.
<P>
	In responding to the calls from the opposite side of the House for 
drastic and immediate change to the wheat board, I simply ask 
them to urge caution. We do not change an entire grain marketing 
system on a whim. That is not what good government is all about. 
Good government is about listening to the people, listening to all 
sides of a debate, weighing the pros and cons, then taking action 
based on the best long term interests of the vast majority.
<P>
	Given the current international trade agreements Canada has 
signed and the new rules under which we now operate, once we 
change the board we are stuck with the new version. We cannot 
change our minds if we decide after a couple of years that we do not 
like the new system and revert to the old way of doing things.
<P>
	Any decision the government makes will be a profound and 
serious one requiring a thorough and serious approach and 
evaluation. This is a multi-billion dollar industry and its future is 
not to be taken lightly in the way the third party is doing. Farmers 
and their families who depend on the marketing of grain are 
depending on us.
<P>
	None of what I have said should be taken to mean that the status 
quo is good enough. Everyone agrees there is need for some type of 
change and there may be change. First I simply appeal to everyone 
with an interest in western grain marketing to hold their arguments 
and their fire until the grain marketing panel is released. Unilateral 
action by one group or province at this stage could have far 
reaching consequences and a final magnitude which nobody could 
now possibly estimate.
<P>
	Change may be coming. Make no mistake, it may be coming. 
But it will be considered and thoughtful change by a government 
that has consulted with the people who will be most affected by that 
change. It will not be the sort of change driven by editorial 
headlines and dictated by a small vocal fringe group concerned 
only with its own self-interest.
<P>
<B>(2115 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as usual I listened with great interest to the member from 
Saskatoon-Dundurn. Why? I am not too sure. Perhaps it is the 
lateness of the hour and I do not have anything better to do this 
evening so I listened.
<P>
	I noticed he said the Reform wants to change this on a whim. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. This motion is well 
thought out. I do not know whether he has taken the time to read the 
motion.
<P>
	The member wants to cling to the past. This is quite unusual 
because normally that is what the Liberals accuse the Reform Party 
of doing, but in this case they want to cling to the past. He said he 
did not know whether the two systems, free marketing and the 
Canadian Wheat Board, can operate jointly. Well neither do we. 
That is the whole point of the motion.
<P>
	We heard tonight about the unfairness that Ontario corn 
producers can market their product wherever and whenever they 
want yet western wheat growers cannot. We heard that Quebec 
wheat growers can market their product into Ontario yet western 
wheat growers cannot.
<P>
	I would like to take a couple of minutes to recount my personal 
experience with this. My brother and I were farming up until the 
time I got elected to the House of Commons. We were farming 
3,000 acres, producing wheat, barley, canola and grass seed in the 
Peace River country of British Columbia, not Alberta as a 
colleague said earlier.
<P>
	We got into an effort to market some of our barley directly into 
the Caribou, to truck it ourselves through the Rocky Mountains and 
market it in the Caribou region. It was feed barley. When we did 
that we learned of a situation in the remainder of the province of 
British Columbia involving the wheat growers in the Creston 
valley and other areas of B.C. Bear in mind that the vast majority of 
the arable land in British Columbia is in the Peace River country on 
the east side of the Rocky mountains. Although that was small 
acreage, they could  market their wheat directly to Rogers Flour 
Mill in Armstrong in the Okanagan interior but I could not. The 
same province, the same country. We were in tough times then. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4134"> 4134 </A></B>
<P>
Most farmers were just barely getting by. Grain prices were in the 
basement. Is that fair? That is what I want the member to answer.
<P>
	Is it fair that some farmers in this country depending upon where 
they live can take advantage of opportunities and market their 
wheat directly to a flour mill? It is still going on today. Farmers in 
another area, because it is under the umbrella of the Canadian 
Wheat Board, are prevented from taking advantage of that 
opportunity. That is what we are talking about tonight. We are 
talking about freedom, choice and fairness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, when we speak of fairness I simply 
ask the member to look at a few facts. One of them is just plain 
ordinary common sense.
<P>
	If Reformers only looked at the Americans who want to destroy 
the Canadian Wheat Board, they are not doing it for the benefit of 
Canadians. Then there is the leader of the third party who in March 
1995 talked to the Americans about this being an irritant to the 
Americans. He talked of getting rid of our Canadian Wheat Board. 
Their own leader talks against the Canadian farmer. Their own 
leader does not care about the western Canadian farmer. He is more 
concerned about removing an irritant for the Americans. He is 
running on the wrong side of the border. That is what they want to 
do.
<P>
	That is the party that has thought everything out so well 
including this particular motion, as he is indicating. He wonders 
whether I read the motion. I read it in my speech. It is obvious he 
was not listening as closely as he indicated. He indicated that it was 
so well thought out. If it was so well thought out, why was it not in 
the brief presented by the member opposite who sponsored the 
motion? It was not in the brief. This was really well thought out.
<P>
<B>(2120)</B>
<P>
	Why is this motion brought at the eleventh hour just before the 
panel is to release its report? They would not wait until the panel 
report came down because they are not looking for fairness. They 
are simply looking for air time so they can present further 
arguments in trying to show how unfair the system is, a 
multibillion dollar system.
<P>
	They talk of a dual marketing system and they have not 
presented any numbers or any evaluation of their proposal by any 
professionals to show that their system is beneficial to the farmers. 
They have done nothing of the sort in a multibillion dollar system. 
Perhaps they could get a few numbers from H&amp;R Block. They 
should not be that busy, tax time is over. They have not even done 
that. They are simply acting on a whim.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the questions the member raises is why  we are 
discussing it at this time. He knows very well that the report from 
the grain marketing panel has not yet been tabled and Parliament 
will not be sitting all summer. When else do we debate it? We 
debate it whenever we have the opportunity. That is quite obvious. 
We pressed for this debate and we finally got it.
<P>
	Why do we raise this issue? Because farmers do not trust a 
government which says it is going to support farmers and then as 
soon as it is elected it removes the Crow subsidy with no inkling at 
all that this is going to happen. That was one of the problems.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shut up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> The member also said he 
was listening to the people. I want to tell the member the results of 
a survey which was done in my riding.
<P>
	Of the people in the riding of Yorkton-Melville, 80.5 per cent 
think the government should hold a plebiscite of all Saskatchewan 
farmers and producers regarding the future of the Canadian Wheat 
Board; 66.1 per cent do not think the Canadian Wheat Board should 
continue to have a monopoly on wheat and barley sales in western 
Canada; 73.9 per cent think producers have the right to sell their 
grain, including wheat and barley, anywhere they want; 96.3 per 
cent think the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board should be 
open and accountable to the farmers it serves. That is the people 
speaking and this government refuses to listen.
<P>
	Last of all, 51.9 per cent of the people think the government 
should exempt the wheat and barley shipped through the port of 
Churchill from the authority of the Canadian Wheat Board because 
they do not trust the wheat board to handle it properly. They feel it 
is controlled by eastern interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it rather disgusting in a debate 
such as this when there are comments being made and the hon. 
member for Calgary West utters comments to the minister of 
agriculture to shut up. That is completely unparliamentary. That is 
the new way that the Reform Party does business in the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> There they go again. They refuse to allow anyone 
to speak because they believe the new way of being in Parliament is 
to be the loudest, to monopolize time and to call people down all 
the time.
<P>
	The hon. member made comments that the reason this matter 
was raised now is that the report will be filed in the summer. They 
have had 16 opportunities since last year to have this matter 
brought up. They never did it until the eleventh hour. This is 
nothing but gamesmanship on the part of the third party and this 
will be remembered by the people in the west.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4135"> 4135 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member talks about etiquette and decorum in this House. He did 
not even attempt to answer my question.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The minister of agriculture is heckling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Yes, exactly, the 
minister of agriculture is heckling our speaker and someone tries to 
tell him to please be quiet. No, we are not supposed to do that. 
However, the member did not even try to address my question.
<P>
<B>(2125 )</B>
<P>
	I will ask the member again: Does he think that this system is 
fair after hearing me recount my personal experience? Would he 
please address that question and tell Canadian farmers that this 
system is fair? That is what happened to me personally and my 
family farm and it has happened to countless others in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the argument made 
by the hon. member is one on which he should be sitting on this 
side arguing in favour of pooling. It would have been beneficial to 
him. In effect he has destroyed his party's whole argument on its 
motion but that is not unusual. I am sure if Reformers read the 
blues for today they will determine that they have these 
contradictions in their own arguments.
<P>
	It is interesting to hear the derogatory comments. As soon as 
Reformers are caught with something, they try to degrade an 
individual. Now they are referring to my legal background. 
Unfortunately they have not done their research to determine that I 
come from a farming background. I grew up on a farm and farmed 
with my father for a while before proceeding to law school. Maybe 
it would not hurt them either to get a post-secondary education.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is the place of vigorous 
debate. We might be able to pursue our business until 9.42 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see I 
am going to have to cut this a little short because of the time 
limitation. I am glad for the opportunity to speak on the Reform 
motion dealing with the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	My family, my son and I, actively farm 1,400 acres in the Peace 
River country. There are 12 or 13 members in the Reform caucus 
who have farms or who are operating farms in some capacity. I 
think we have a little bit more credibility in this matter than these 
do-gooder Liberals across the way who have to have the minister of 
agriculture prompting them with bits of information here and there.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the only Liberal member that has spoken 
today who has any credibility on this issue is the member for 
Dauphin-Swan River who has a farm  herself. She raised the 
question as to why should we get rid of the Canadian Wheat Board, 
that she wanted to use the Canadian Wheat Board. She entirely 
missed the whole essence of the motion.
<P>
	We are not getting rid of the Canadian Wheat Board. We are 
calling for a trial period to see which agency farmers will choose: a 
free marketing system or the state controlled monopoly of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. If they choose to vote state controlled for 
their produce that is what we will continue with. If they choose to 
vote for a free market, that is what they should have.
<P>
	Who was the member for Saskatoon-Humboldt asking to make 
expert testimony on this issue? A member from the Bloc 
Quebecois. What possible relevance could that member have to 
this debate? If the Canadian Wheat Board is so good, why do we 
not extend it to Ontario and Quebec?
<P>
	Maybe the member for Saskatoon-Humboldt knows something 
about appointments of commissioners to the Canadian Wheat 
Board because it is my understanding that she did not have to face 
any election for her nomination, it was an appointment. I guess she 
is probably an expert on that.
<P>
	I have spoken to a number of farmers in my riding. Without a 
doubt the majority want freedom of choice to market their grain. 
While some think the Canadian Wheat Board makes sense, 
different farmers have different needs and that is not being 
recognized here today.
<P>
	Some are happy to take the initial price offered them by the 
board. They can afford to wait for a year for the final payment but 
others are paying high interest rates and they need the immediate 
cashflow. They have big payments to make in the fall and they 
cannot afford to wait. Then there are still others who grow specialty 
crops while the board is simply not able to handle those specialty 
crops.
<P>
	A plebiscite was promised by both the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food and the Prime Minister very conveniently in the 
1993 election. Where is that plebiscite? It is not to be had. It is 
another broken promise by this Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(2130 )</B>
<P>
	Alberta went ahead with that plebiscite and what happened? An 
overwhelming number of farmers voted for that choice. Freedom 
of choice is what farmers want. I have farmed for 28 years. We 
want freedom of choice, as any other industry enjoys. The real 
issue here is freedom of choice.
<P>
	We can have a dual system if we want. The Canadian Wheat 
Board can offer that side by side. In fact that took place from 1935 
to 1943. It has happened before. It worked effectively. The war 
came along and there were special circumstances. Canada put in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4136"> 4136 </A></B>
<P>
system whereby supply could be guaranteed to Europe. I can 
understand that. This is a different time entirely.
<P>
	Democracy, what is this about? The government is willing to 
allow for an elected advisory committee to the Canadian Wheat 
Board. That makes some sense. If it makes sense, would it not also 
follow that the commissioner should be elected? Is that not 
democracy? Or does the government want political control of 
commissioners so that it can dominate their decisions?
<P>
	Is it common sense to have grain running through the Canadian 
seaway at a time when it is costing a lot more money than through 
the west coast or across the border into the United States? I do not 
think it is. With control of commissioners that is the type of thing 
that can happen.
<P>
	I would like to go back to the farmers that find the Canadian 
Wheat Board a hindrance to their operations. These are examples 
of farmers who are trying to diversify but have been frustrated by 
the rigid structure of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	First there is the story of Bob Numweiller. Mr. Numweiller is a 
Saskatchewan miller who lives close to the U.S. border. He farms 
there. He wants to mill his own wheat into flour and sell it on his 
farm. Of course he cannot do that under this rigid structure. The 
board says he cannot do it. First he has to sell his wheat to the 
Canadian Wheat Board, and although it does not do any of the 
marketing, then he can buy it back. This is really good stuff. He 
also must pay the board's price and administration fee, although it 
does not do anything for him. Then he waits for a year and maybe 
he will find out he might get a final payment and maybe not.
<P>
	There is an absurd twist to the story. Now that the Canadian 
Wheat Board, as a result of the World Trade Organization, can no 
longer control imports, Mr. Numweiller has discovered that he can 
cross the U.S. border, buy the wheat, bring the wheat back and mill 
it on his farm. However, he cannot mill his own wheat. Does that 
make any sense?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's Liberal policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Then there is the story of Dexter Schmidt, a 
constituent of my riding of Peace River. This government has been 
telling farmers they should diversify. He has taken their advice. He 
has diversified into organic grain, but the wheat board does not sell 
organic grain because as soon as it is pooled with all the other 
wheat it loses its distinctiveness. He wanted the ability to sell it 
himself.
<P>
	Of course the board cannot get these niche markets. They sell in 
boat loads and there is not enough production at this time in the 
organic grain market to make 20,000 tonnes. What has to happen to 
Mr. Schmidt? It is too much hassle for the board to administer the 
container loads. Is Mr. Schmidt allowed to  do his own marketing? 
Only if he goes to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Here are the steps he must go through. First, he has to go to the 
elevator to sell his grain on contract. The elevator writes out the 
sales ticket. Mr. Schmidt writes out a buy back cheque for $36.94 a 
tonne. He also pays the elevator $5 a tonne administration fee. Now 
he owns his own grain. That is a major step. Now he can sell it as he 
pleases but he still has to wait a year to get back his original $36.94 
a tonne and he may not see any of it at all, depending on how the 
board does on its marketing.
<P>
	If he tries to bypass the board he commits a criminal offence and 
has to pay a penalty of $12,000 plus spend two years in jail. Does 
this make any sense?
<P>
	Canada and Russia passed in the night about three years ago. 
Russia is going to a market system and where are we going? We are 
continuing with a very regressive system. This is an example of the 
type of thing we would hear from communist Russia 20 years ago.
<P>
<B>(2135 )</B>
<P>
	These are just two examples of why I think the Canadian Wheat 
Board needs to be overhauled. I would start by ensuring that the 
commissioners are democratically elected by producers. After that, 
I think the board would change in the ways it needs to meet the 21st 
century.
<P>
	Today's generation of commercial farmers want to substitute 
their management skills for the collective approaches that have 
dominated the past few decades. They see new opportunities in hot 
new markets like organic grains. Using their own skills and their 
own comparative advantages, they want to be free to grow crops 
and market them as they please, just the same as any other industry.
<P>
	I want to take a moment to talk about the reports that were done 
for the Canadian Wheat Board and for the grain marketing panel. 
The Kraft report was referred to earlier. The Kraft report was done 
with selective information from the Canadian Wheat Board. It fed 
the panel certain information. That is a strange thing. Nobody else 
can get any information out of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	This group was paid a certain amount of money to do a very 
selective report for the Canadian Wheat Board and was spoon fed 
the information. What did the report say? It was very 
complimentary to the board. It said that the board gets about $13 a 
tonne more for the grain when it sells all around the world than any 
other country or any other market would get. Does that make 
sense? If a company in Brazil was buying grain from us, why 
would it pay $13 a tonne more to the board than it would pay to 
anybody else? Maybe there is a quality issue here. That could be. 
But that same quality would exist whether the board marketed the 
grain or not. I think this Kraft report has to be discounted 
completely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4137"> 4137 </A></B>
<P>
	There was another report done by Colin Carter and Al Loyns. 
Their report states that they found just exactly the opposite. They 
said that the grain marketed by the board is costing farmers about 
$20 a tonne. The report was compiled without any benefit of 
Canadian Wheat Board information. In fact, they were stymied 
every step of the way trying to get information from the board.
<P>
	This Canadian Wheat Board is acting very much like the 
department of defence these days. It has a bunker mentality and is 
hunkered down behind the barricades.
<P>
	Then we have the famous Deloitte &amp; Touche report. These are 
the people who are the Canadian Wheat Board's auditors. This firm 
was asked in 1992 to look at the board's management operations. 
What did it find? First, I have to say that the report was kept secret 
from 1992 until it was finally leaked and saw the light of day this 
winter. The report said that the Canadian Wheat Board has no 
corporate strategic plan, no formal marketing strategic plan, no 
clear plan for budgeting and managing information. Furthermore, 
the report reveals that the board is currently not conducting any 
value for money type reviews.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture has told us all those things are being 
corrected. Who would know? The board does not report to anybody 
but the minister of agriculture and sometimes I wonder if it even 
reports to him.
<P>
	My colleague has moved a motion that the auditor general 
should be able to review the Canadian Wheat Board books. This is 
a crown corporation. However, the Liberal Party voted against the 
motion on accountability to government. The Canadian Wheat 
Board is a crown corporation of government that cannot be audited 
by the auditor general. Shame.
<P>
	This leaked information is especially disturbing because Deloitte 
&amp; Touche is the Canadian Wheat Boards' own auditor. If it found 
that kind of incompetence, it would have to be fairly guarded in 
what it said. Imagine what it must have really looked like.
<P>
	I do not have much time but I want to talk for a moment about 
the grain marketing panel that has been referred to here today. This 
is a whitewash. Mr. Molloy is heading up the grain marketing 
panel. He is a buddy of the minister of agriculture. What did this 
grain marketing panel do? The panel came to my riding. It had a 
facilitator go around and say: ``Give us the information and we will 
tabulate it''. Then there was a consensus at the end.
<P>
	When a group of farmers in my area said they wanted to make a 
direct presentation to the panel, the facilitator said: ``Okay, you can 
do that, but you have to come to Winnipeg''. Imagine, they would 
have to travel all the way to Winnipeg from Grande Prairie, 
Alberta.
<P>
	Then we called for the panel to hold hearings in the capitals of 
the three provinces, to at least make it easier for those people to 
present information. We had a major fight to get that to happen. 
This is supposed to be an open process. It was a major fight.
<P>
	What did we find when we got to the grain marketing panel? A 
bunch of political hacks, in most cases. One member is a former 
member of the Manitoba pool. His sole contribution to the debate 
was: ``Things cannot be too bad under the Canadian Wheat Board. I 
was out in the country the other day and I saw some farmers driving 
new pick-ups''.
<P>
	The Liberal government in this very House, less than a month 
ago, talked about a monopoly. It talked about a monopoly in the gas 
and oil industry. It said that gas prices are being controlled by a 
monopoly. It pales by comparison with the monopoly that the 
Canadian Wheat Board holds over farmers. It is a monopoly on the 
buy side only. There is only one buyer for wheat and barley that 
goes to export and that is the Canadian Wheat Board. Any other 
industry could not be controlled this way. Nobody would want it to 
be so.
<P>
	I ask the question again: If the Canadian Wheat Board is so good 
why do we not have it in Ontario, Quebec and the maritimes so that 
the potato farmers can experience the joys of having the Canadian 
Wheat Board?
<P>
	To whom does the Canadian Wheat Board answer? I had a 
discussion with a Canadian Wheat Board field representative in my 
riding recently. I held a series of meetings in my riding and people 
were concerned that they were not getting very good shipping of 
wheat out of the Peace River area. I phoned the Canadian Wheat 
Board and asked what the shipping schedule was for the next two or 
three weeks.
<P>
	The next time I met this man he was quite offended that I had not 
talked to him. He asked me what was my interest in this. I answered 
that as the member of Parliament, the government representative, I 
represented these constituents who are concerned that they are not 
able to move their product. He then asked me what it had to do with 
me as it was not a government matter. When I mentioned that the 
Canadian Wheat Board is a crown corporation, he said: 
``Technically that might be so, but we do not answer to the 
politicians''. I said: ``Who do you answer to? Do you answer to the 
farmers?'' He said: ``No, we do not answer to them either''. There 
is the answer. They are completely unaccountable.
<P>
	Let us try this system and let the farmers choose what they want. 
If they want the Canadian Wheat Board working alongside with a 
dual marketing agency, that is fine. If they choose the Canadian 
Wheat Board alone for their product, that is fine. If they choose the 
private sector completely, that is fine too. The choice should be 
made by the farmers, not by the Liberal lawyers on the other side 
who have no experience whatsoever in this area.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of the vigorous debate 
we have had over this issue I wonder if there might be unanimous

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[English] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIES">FISHERIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last couple of months I have raised two issues of 
particular concern to all British Columbians, namely, the failure of 
the Canada-U.S. salmon treaty and the disastrous DFO fleet 
reduction policy of the minister. In both of these areas federal 
Liberal policies are having a devastating impact on B.C. fisheries, 
particularly on coastal communities and on small owner operators.
<P>
	Of course, the six B.C. Liberal MPs and 24 Reform MPs have 
been totally ineffective in standing up for B.C. interests.
<P>
	It is appalling that while Liberals are taking drastic action on 
fleet reduction they are pathetically weak in standing up to the 
United States, especially Alaska, which has shown such contempt 
for the Canada-U.S. salmon treaty.
<P>
	I would note that over the course of the last decade Canada's 
interception of salmon bound for U.S. spawning beds has fallen by 
25 per cent, while U.S. interception of Canadian salmon has 
jumped by 50 per cent. The Government of Canada has totally 
failed to stand up to the United States and, in particular, to Alaska 
overfishing.
<P>
	B.C. Premier Glen Clark has made it very clear that this will be 
at the top of his agenda for the first ministers' conference which 
will start tomorrow. I urge the Liberal government to accept the 
recommendations of the B.C. government for a fisheries renewal 
plan. Its primary goals would be the conservation of fish and the 
maximization of jobs in British Columbia from each fish caught. 
That is the kind of leadership we need in the B.C. fishery which 
Premier Clark is giving.
<P>
<B>(2145)</B>
<P>
	The recently announced fleet reduction policy is a disaster for 
the B.C. fishery. It ignores key recommendations of the federal 
round table and especially the recommendations of the 1991 
Cruikshank commission which held extensive hearings in coastal 
communities.
<P>
	The plan purports to strengthen conservation but there is nothing 
at all for habitat protection, for enhancement or for restoration. 
There is nothing for enforcement whatsoever and the plan has been 
condemned by all key environmental and conservation groups.
<P>
	The stackable area licensing will have a devastating impact on 
small owner/operators in coastal communities like Sointula, Alert 
Bay, Ucluelet and Port Hardy. We have already seen the disastrous 
effect on the black cod and herring fishery. Dennis Brown of the 
United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union has said that while 
small operators, especially gill netters, will be particularly hard hit, 
it will be the fish packing companies and well financed 
entrepreneurs who will scoop up the licences and take over the 
industry.
<P>
	It will also hurt the suppliers, suppliers of small shipyards, 
marine suppliers, machine and repair shops, tackle and gear 
manufacturers and others. With as many as 5,000 jobs being lost 
there is absolutely no compensation whatsoever, no retraining, no 
adjustment program whatsoever. When we compare that with what 
has happened on the east coast it is a disgrace.
<P>
	The buyback is totally inadequate. Fishers have already paid in 
some $65 million to the $80 million that was on the table. It should 
be well in excess of $200 million and the buybacks are a failure. 
Only half the target has been met and there are absolutely no 
criteria for bidding in this process. Approximately 90 per cent of 
coastal fishers voted for a fair voluntary buyback.
<P>
	An unprecedented coalition has come together to oppose the 
government's plan, the DFO plan. That coalition has offered a very 
clear alternative. It wants a transparent inclusive process that 
would be implemented to devise a new plan to ensure a healthy 
fishery, a healthy industry and healthy communities.
<P>
	I urge the government to adopt this plan, this coalition plan 
which has been supported by the United Fishermen and Allied 
Workers Union, the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, the Canadian 
Labour Congress, Coastal Communities Network, Greenpeace, the 
David Suzuki Foundation, the Native Brotherhood of British 
Columbia, the Georgia Strait Alliance, the Pacific Trollers 
Association, IWA-Canada, the T. Buck Suzuki Environmental 
Foundation, the West Coast Sustainability Association and many 
others.

	Yesterday Premier Clark was in the village of Sointula with a 
population of 900. That village will be absolutely devastated by 
the impact of the government's plan according to the Glen 
Robertson, the New Democrat MLA for that area. He said it is 
an arbitrary and capricious plan.
<P>
	Other speakers said the same thing. The Mifflin plan will not 
save the salmon. It will simply take the catch away from coastal 
communities and give it to companies that can afford to stay in the 
industry.
<P>
	I appeal to the government to finally listen to the people of 
British Columbia, listen to coastal communities, listen to 
owner/operators, stand up for the B.C. fishery, stand up for the 
proposal that has been made by Premier Glen Clark. Shelve the 
disastrous Mifflin plan and get tough in negotiating the 
Canada-U.S. salmon treaty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question, although he will pardon me as a student 
of oratory in suggesting it was less of a question than a philippic. 
Nevertheless we can bring some light into the darkness.
<P>
	The Pacific salmon revitalization strategy was announced on 
March 29. It is clear that some fundamental structural problems in 
the B.C. salmon fishery must be resolved if we are to meet two 
objectives, ensuring conservation of the resource and promoting 
the viability of the commercial fishery in the future.
<P>
	Problems of excess capacity and declining returns in the 
commercial fishery are not new. Over the past 15 years there has 
been a commission of inquiry on the state of the B.C. fishery and 
several task forces which recommended fundamental change. But 
the will to take the necessary steps simply was not there.
<P>
	The Pacific revitalization strategy is a six point plan including 
conservation as a priority intersectoral allocation device, new 
licensing measures, a licence buyback program, transition 
measures and new institutional mechanisms.
<P>
<B>(2150 )</B>
<P>
	There has been criticism of the strategy, particularly from 
coastal community representatives. The Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans listened to these representatives, travelled to B.C. and met 
with fishing industry groups and announced modifications to the 
strategy on May 9, 1996. These minor adjustments were based on 
consultations and included the announcement of a salmon licence 
fee holiday for those who choose not to fish in 1996.
<P>
	The minister announced on June 14, 1996 the preliminary results 
of the implementation of the strategy. New licensing measures, 
including single gear and area licensing, have been successfully 
applied to 97 per cent of the salmon fleet. Indications are that more 
than 250 licence holders intend to take advantage of the new  
licence stacking provision that permits one vessel to fish in two 
areas.
<P>
	The licence buyback program has achieved half of its targets in 
the first round with the retirement of 411 salmon licences, 10 per 
cent of the fleet, at a cost of $42 million. On the recommendation 
of the independent fleet reduction committee, the minister has 
announced a second round of the buyback program in an effort to 
realize the fleet reduction target of 20 per cent set out initially.
<P>
	This program is about choice, and the results indicate the fleet 
has been prepared to make the difficult decisions required to 
contribute to the long term protection of the salmon resource. 
These changes are also necessary to make the industry more viable.
<P>
	This strategy addresses immediate concerns before the 1996 
season, and the minister has invited the input of the round table 
steering committee on longer term issues as implementation 
proceeds.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on May 17, 1996, I questioned the Minister of the 
Environment regarding the Taro dump in Hamilton.
<P>
	The proposed dump is slated to be located within 800 meters of 
the Niagara escarpment, a fractured rock bed which is a United 
Nations declared biosphere.
<P>
	Constituents in this area are concerned that the leachate has the 
possibility of going into Lake Ontario, water protected under the 
Great Lakes eco-basin agreement signed in 1974.
<P>
	Surface runoff from the site is now piped into the lake. People 
are seriously concerned the local water table and land will be 
negatively affected.
<P>
	My question to the minister was direct and succinct: ``Can the 
minister tell us whether a federal environmental assessment panel 
review will be conducted?'' His answer had everything to do with 
the election in Hamilton East and little to do with environmental 
assessments.
<P>
	In my supplementary question I asked: ``Will the minister use 
his power and commit to launching a full environmental 
assessment of the Taro dump so all sides will be allowed real 
influence?'' Again the minister answered with the same political 
bluster.
<P>
	I remind that this is the jurisdiction of the federal environment 
minister to initiate full panel reviews. The former minister never 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4140"> 4140 </A></B>
<P>
conducted these, even when the problem was very close to her own 
constituency office. Taro dump is an example of a larger problem 
of environmental assessments.
<P>
	Section 28 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act gives 
the minister the power to launch a full panel review of a project:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where at any time the minister is of the opinion that</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a project for which an environmental assessment may be required under 
section 5, taking into account the implementation of any appropriate 
mitigation measures, may cause significant adverse environmental effects, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) public concerns warrant a reference to a mediator or review panel. The 
minister may-refer the project to a mediator or a review panel in accordance 
with section 29.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Will the project cause adverse environmental effects? If leachate 
from the dump goes into Lake Ontario, which is under federal 
jurisdiction, then yes, the project will cause serious environmental 
effects.
<P>
	Is there public concern? The minister could easily review the 
Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> newspaper and he will discover the anger of 
the locals, especially those who have been threatened with lawsuits 
to keep them quiet about this project.
<P>
	The issue at stake is whether the Minister of the Environment is 
willing to do his duty. If a minister does not make use of his powers 
then Canadians must ask what special interest has a hold on him.
<P>
	Last month I was Sydney, Nova Scotia to see the extremely 
hazardous tar ponds site. The people of Sydney for years have 
desperately looked for help. The provincial government wants the 
most economical solution, while the federal government seems to 
be hiding. I challenge the minister to spend a day of inspection at 
Sydney like I did.
<P>
	This was the scope of my question from May 17: when will the 
minister do what is needed to put Canada on the right track of 
environmental sustainability?
<P>
<B>(2155)</B>
<P>
	The minister knows full well that my two previous questions 
were not answered properly. I ask now three pointed questions on 
which I expect a clear answer.
<P>
	First, does the Minister of the Environment envision ever using 
the power to conduct environmental assessments? Second, if 
leachate seeps into Lake Ontario, does the province of Ontario 
suddenly become responsible for the Great Lakes or does it remain 
the responsibility of the federal government? Third, the 
parliamentary secretary stated that before the end of the term the 
government will do something with the Sydney tar ponds. Can she 
explain exactly what the government plans to do with this poisoned 
black tidal inlet?
<P>
	Sadly the answers so far appear to be process rather than action, 
paper making instead of field operations. My questions relate to 
needed action by the minister. The time for excuses is over.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. May I compliment him on his patience 
and durability in sitting through an exhausting and some would say 
interestingly combative debate. If it was not the eleventh hour as 
some of our predecessors in the debate eloquently suggested, it is at 
least the witching hour and it is quite clear that all honest people 
and all MPs should be home in bed at this hour. It is a tribute to our 
staying power in the service of the state.
<P>
	The proposal by Taro Aggregates Limited for the east quarry 
landfill in Stoney Creek is presently being reviewed by the Ontario 
Ministry of the Environment and Energy under that province's 
environmental assessment process. The proposed site would be 
used for non-hazardous waste.
<P>
	We understand that under Ontario's process a decision on the 
project or a decision to submit the project to a full Ontario public 
hearing will be made by the Ontario Minister of the Environment 
and Energy, the Hon. Brenda Elliott.
<P>
	With respect to a federal environmental assessment panel, the 
project is not subject to the federal environmental assessment 
process as described under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. A federal review process will therefore not be 
established.
<P>
	The federal process is only triggered when a federal agency is a 
proponent, provides funds or loan guarantees, administers the 
project lands, or issues permits or licences which enable the project 
to take place. None of these conditions are in effect for the Taro 
landfill proposal.
<P>
	We gather that a number of groups, including the Hamilton 
Regional Conservation Authority, have reviewed the project's 
plans and have asked the Ontario Minister of the Environment and 
Energy to hold a provincial public hearing for the proposal under 
the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	We have been advised by Ontario region that in past years a 
private company owned the landfill site known as the west quarry 
adjacent to Stoney Creek. The site received residential and 
industrial garbage but was not an ``engineered'' site with a liner. It 
reportedly was the source of some local groundwater 
contamination by chlorides.
<P>
	This west quarry site was taken over by Taro-Philip 
Environmental and remedial measures were taken at the site to stop 
further groundwater discharges. The west quarry site is not 
presently in use, but the site has not been formally closed.
<P>
	The Hamilton-Stoney Creek area needs a disposal site for 
industrial non-hazardous waste to replace the Glanbrook landfill 
which is nearing capacity. Taro-Philip Environmental has proposed
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4141"> 4141 </A></B>
<P>
the use of an engineered landfill with a proper liner at the east 
quarry, next to the inactive west quarry facility.
<P>
	It is this proposal which is currently under review by the Ontario 
government. If the hon. member has any further concerns about the 
project, we would advise him to make submissions to the Ontario 
Minister of the Environment and Energy.
<P>
