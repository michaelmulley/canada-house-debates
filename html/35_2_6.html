	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while this petition has already been processed through the normal 
channels, I want to bring it before the public today.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that over 25 million Canadians have 
access to supplemental dental and health coverage. They point out 
that any taxation on this type of coverage would have an adverse 
effect on the overall health of Canadians.
<P>
	They point out that the focus right now is on the prevention of 
disease and family affordability. They want us to keep what we 
have because they think it is really quite good. They believe that we 
have the best oral health in the world.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to table a petition signed by constituents of 
Lambton-Middlesex and outlying areas. It is duly certified by the 
clerk of petitions pursuant to Standing Order 36.
<P>
	In view of the fact that Canadians are paying approximately 52 
per cent of the cost of a litre of gasoline in the form of government 
taxes, that the tax increase by 1.5 cents per litre in the last budget 
and that over the past 10 years the excise tax on gasoline has risen 
by 556 per cent, the petitioners request that Parliament not increase 
the federal excise tax on gasoline in the next federal budget.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions today pursuant to Standing Order 36. I wish to present 
a petition which has been circulating across Canada. This petition 
comes from Delta, B.C.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition also has been circulating across Canada. This one 
comes from St. Catharines, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House 
that consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems or impair one's ability and, specifically, that fetal alcohol 
syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to  caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risk associated with alcoholic consumption.

<P>
	``Whereas a considerable portion of the population to be served 
by the Canada Human Resources Centre is located at a distance of 
over 50 kilometres from the planned point of service;

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
today presenting a petition on behalf of the people of my riding, 
who are requesting that Parliament not increase the federal excise 
tax on gasoline in the next federal budget, because we are paying 
approximately 52 per cent of the cost of a litre of gasoline in the 
form of government taxes, because the excise tax was raised 1.5

<B><A NAME="277"> 277 </A></B>
<P>
petition duly certified by the  clerk of petitions on behalf of 673 
constituents of Saanich-Gulf Islands and surrounding area.
<P>
	The petitioners' prayers call on Parliament to enact legislation to 
reform the justice system and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act addressing the following principles:
<P>
	A just and safe society. That the safety and protection of the 
public precedes over the protection and identity and statutory 
release of dangerous criminals and pedophiles of any age. The 
rights and protection of the victims precedes over the rights of the 
criminals. To simplify and speed up legal procedures to eliminate 
stall tactics in the defence of criminals. Eliminate the drunk or drug 
defence. The incarceration and prosecution of dangerous criminals 
to precede over victimless offenders.
<P>
	When a young offender commits an indictable crime of violence, 
a serious crime, he or she be tried automatically in regular court 
without lengthy hearings and appeals which take years in juvenile 
court.
<P>
	Finally, that justice reform can be achieved with no erosion of 
civil liberty of law-abiding citizens. A person's freedom and rights 
stop where another's start.

I would like to present on behalf of 62 constituents of

<P>

revenues to rehabilitate Canada's crumbling national highways.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
present today a petition signed by a group of constituents in my 
riding of La Prairie and the city of Laval. They are opposed to an 
increase in the federal excise tax on gasoline, for the following 
reasons:
<P>
	``In view of the fact that the availability of sources of affordable 
fuel is a natural advantage to Canadians in reducing the high cost of 
shipping between source and market;
<P>
	In view of the fact that Canadians are paying approximately 52 
per cent of the cost of a litre of gasoline in the form of government 
taxes;
<P>
	In view of the fact that there was a tax increase of 1.5 litres in the 
last budget;
<P>
	In view of the fact that a parliamentary committee has 
recommended an additional excise tax increase in the next federal 
budget; and
<P>
	In view of the fact that over the past 10 years the excise tax on 
gasoline has rise by 556 per cent'' as the member for Saint-Hubert 
has pointed out;

federal excise tax on gasoline in the next federal budget.

approved by the clerk of petitions. It is signed by 77 of my

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
present two petitions today.
<P>
	The first petition requests that the Government of Canada not 
amend the human rights act to include the phrase sexual 
orientation. The petitioners fear that such an inclusion would 
indicate societal approval of homosexual behaviour. The 
petitioners believe that the government should not legitimize this 
behaviour against the clear wishes of the majority.

riding of Fraser Valley East, a few from Vancouver and even one 
from Goose Bay, Happy Valley in Newfoundland.

	The House resumed from February 29, 1996 consideration of the 
motion that an address be presented to His Excellency the 
Governor General in response to his Speech he addressed at the 
opening of the session, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the speech from the throne reaffirms the 
government's commitment to expand trade to ensure our 
prosperity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe you 
will find if you check with the table officers that when we ended 
debate on this subject matter, my colleague for Okanagan Centre 
had the floor and he was halfway through his speech. I thought that 
when we resumed this debate it would pick up where he left off. He 
still had five minutes left in his speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of respect 
to my colleague for Calgary Centre, in fact the hon. member for 
Okanagan Centre did have the floor. If we also recall, the vote took 
place immediately following his last intervention which in fact cut 
off that debate and brought it to a conclusion.
<P>
	We are now debating the amendment to the speech from the 
throne. The debate on the subamendment was  what the hon. 
member for Okanagan Centre was participating in and that debate 
has now concluded. That matter is now behind us and we will 
resume debate on the amendment to the throne speech with the hon. 
Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Learn the rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, to whomever yelled that out, I am trying 
to apply the rules.
<P>
	What I am trying to say is when the member had the floor it was 
also a 20-minute time period and we were splitting our time. He 
was only five minutes into his 20-minute period. How could the 
debate have ended then?
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I think you would find that 
in fact what we were debating at that time was the Reform Party's 
subamendment to the throne speech. We voted on the 
subamendment which in fact closed that debate. Now we refer to 
the debate on the amendment to the throne speech and I would like 
to begin that debate with the hon. Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am indeed rising to speak on the 
speech from the throne specifically with regard to the area of which 
I have jurisdiction as minister, the area of international trade.
<P>
	Expanding trade is not a matter of choice for Canadians. With a 
relatively small population we simply must find markets beyond 
our own. This is a challenge which Canadians are taking on with 
tenacity and success. Exports have been growing at an 
unprecedented rate and now represent nearly 37 per cent of our 
gross domestic product compared to 24 per cent in 1991. One in 
three jobs in Canada now depends on exports. That is one in three.
<P>
	The final figures have just come in on our merchandise trade and 
I am delighted to announce today that it now stands at a record 
surplus of $28 billion. This record surplus smashes the previous 
record of $20 billion that was set back in 1984.
<P>
	Significantly much of this export growth is taking place in value 
added sectors which means that we are no longer simply exporting 
raw materials for others to refine and then sell back to us at 
increased prices. This is good news for the long term economic 
prospects of Canadians.
<P>
	It is also encouraging to note that while the United States 
remains by far our largest trading partner, there has also been a 
significant increase in our exports to other major markets around 
the world. Our trade is growing. Our exports are diversifying and 
our markets are expanding.
<P>
	What accounts for this phenomenal success? There are three 
main reasons. First, of course the lower Canadian dollar has made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="279"> 279 </A></B>
<P>
it easier for Canadians to sell their goods  and services in 
international markets. But that is not the full story.
<P>
	Second, we must also recognize the role played by our success in 
liberalizing trade, in opening up these markets around the world 
through the World Trade Organization and through the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. By levelling the playing field for 
Canadian firms our trade policy successes have allowed many 
seasoned exporters to take on new markets. It has also meant that 
many Canadian businesses have begun to export for the very first 
time.
<P>
	Third, our exports have soared because of the initiative and the 
imagination of individual Canadians and individual Canadian 
companies which have found ways to compete and to compete 
profitably in the global marketplace. They are the authors of their 
own success and their achievements are benefiting all of us in 
Canada.
<P>
	The successes of the past impose upon us the responsibility to 
maintain and exceed that performance in the future. If we are to 
continue to offer quality jobs to Canadians, we must continue to set 
our sights higher and we are doing just that.
<P>
	Last October my predecessor as Minister for International Trade 
challenged Canadians to double the number of active exporters by 
the year 2000. This is indeed an ambitious goal, but consider the 
potential of it.
<P>
	Relatively few Canadian companies are currently exporting. In 
fact 50 firms alone account for half of the exports of this country. 
There is lots of margin for improvement. To expand exports we 
need to dramatically increase the number of companies exporting 
and encourage current exporters to expand into new markets.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	There is also the other side of the coin. Just as Canada must 
increase its exports to others, so too must we attract quality, 
technology rich, foreign, direct investment to this country because 
more than one job in ten and more than half of Canada's exports are 
directly due to international investment in Canada. Companies 
which invest in this country end up carrying much of the exports 
into other countries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Foreign investment brings us the latest technology and helps our 
subsidiaries compete in world markets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All regions of Canada benefit from such investments. For 
example, Stora of Sweden recently announced the construction of a 
new $650 million pulp and paper facility in Nova Scotia, creating 
300 new jobs. The Montreal subsidiary of Ericsson 
Communications also of Sweden is providing 700 jobs for 
Canadian engineers and technicians. The recently announced 
expansions of Toyota and Honda in Ontario mean 2,200 new jobs 
for Canadians. The recent decisions by Merck-Frosst mean  200 
new jobs for research scientists in British Columbia and Quebec.
<P>
	These are large numbers but behind each one is an individual 
Canadian who is granted the dignity of holding a job, of paying his 
or her own way and who can begin to dream that their tomorrows 
will be brighter than their yesterdays. This is what foreign 
investment really means.
<P>
	We know that the competition for such foreign investment is 
keen so we must be both aggressive and strategic in our efforts to 
attract and retain it in Canada. We have the best country in the 
world in which to invest and we need to continue to get that 
message out.
<P>
	It is absolutely essential to offer foreign investors an investment 
climate that is second to none. That is why the government remains 
committed to deficit reduction. That is why we are working to 
eliminate regulatory burdens, barriers to interprovincial trade and 
to end disputes and regulations which restrict the flow of business 
and business people.
<P>
	If, as it has been often said, trade is the lifeblood of our 
economic prosperity, then access is its arteries. The free circulation 
of goods is essential to our economic health. Our government will 
continue to open new markets and create new opportunities for 
Canadian companies.
<P>
	To ensure the continued development of our trade, this 
government has identified three key priorities. The first is to 
effectively manage our most important trading relationship, that 
with the United States. The second is to liberalize trade around the 
world based on clear rules and level playing fields. To this end we 
are working through the World Trade Organization and the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. The third is to ensure that 
Canadian companies realize the benefits presented by the global 
marketplace. This means championing Canadian companies 
abroad, helping companies find new markets, assisting with 
financing where appropriate and attracting new investment to 
Canada.
<P>
	These priorities were not pulled out of thin air. They are the 
result of extensive consultations with Canadian industry and with 
our provincial partners. We will continue in this collaborative 
manner as we proceed to implement these priorities.
<P>
	It should come as no surprise that our trading relationship with 
the United States should be our first priority. After all, 82 per cent 
of our exports go to that country. In fact, two-way trade between 
Canada and the United States is a billion dollars every single day 
going both ways. It is the biggest trading relationship for both of 
our countries. It is the biggest trading relationship that exists in the 
world and one on which tens of thousands of jobs depend. It is also 
one in which, in spite of the headlines that show the controversies 
and issues in a number of areas, more than 95 per cent of that trade 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="280"> 280 </A></B>
<P>
with the United States goes across the borders  harassment free, 
without any difficulties whatsoever. The relationship is a strong 
one.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The relatively stable and predictable trade environment that has 
been created by NAFTA and the WTO has certainly improved 
conditions a lot. It has encouraged an enormous expansion of this 
trade and trade in other parts of the world. Our exports have risen 
by 90 per cent over the last nine years under NAFTA and its earlier 
FTA.
<P>
	Over time we have been able to bring more and more of the 
bilateral trade relationship with the U.S. within the scope of agreed 
on trade rules. It is not perfect yet and we have still a way to go, but 
we are getting more of it based on rules.
<P>
	For example, we will continue to be making the case that 
anti-dump and countervail laws have no place in a free trade area. 
While we have not yet convinced the United States of this, we will 
keep working toward it. We will keep working toward a bilateral 
trading relationship free of such trade remedy laws. This will be a 
key objective as we work to expand and tighten the rules in 
NAFTA.
<P>
	These principles of rule based trade and freedom from 
countervail also animate our approach in other multilateral and 
regional fora such as the WTO and the Asia Pacific. With our 
partners in the WTO we aim to avoid the hub and spoke approach to 
trade policies, ensure the development of fair rules and obligations, 
and demonstrate the benefits of participating in the WTO.
<P>
	We are also engaged in regional liberalization discussions where 
these are deemed important to Canadian interests. They include the 
negotiation by the year 2005 of a free trade area of the Americas. 
They also include participation in Asia and through APEC in 
efforts to pursue a Canada-European action plan and do some of the 
discussions jointly with the United States in a trilateral 
consultation.
<P>
	Bilaterally we are close to concluding a free trade agreement 
with Israel. We are now negotiating a free trade agreement with 
Chile which will act as a bridge toward the eventual accession of 
that country into the North American free trade agreement.
<P>
	With all of these efforts and initiatives we have tried to establish 
the access to foreign markets which Canadian companies need. 
Access is only half the battle. Canadian companies must be made 
aware of the opportunities available to them. They must be 
supported in their efforts to create beach heads in these new 
markets. The benefits of investing in Canada must be 
communicated to foreign investors.
<P>
	In all of these areas the government is taking action. Canadians 
are well aware of the Prime Minister's highly successful Team 
Canada missions abroad. The latest  mission to Southeast Asia 
underlined the merits of the united approach, leading to some $9 
billion in new contracts for Canadian firms. This is on top of the 
$13 billion generated by two previous Team Canada missions.
<P>
	The government has no intention of stopping there and, as 
indicated in the speech from the throne, the Prime Minister will 
lead more such missions in the future. When we look at the fact that 
for every billion dollars in new trade and exports we create 11,000 
jobs for Canadians, that $20 billion has produced tens of thousands 
of jobs in our economy.
<P>
	These missions show how much Canadians can achieve when we 
work together as a Team Canada. Now we must borrow the same 
approach at home in order to increase the number of companies 
trading abroad. To this end we have built a domestic Team Canada 
in partnership with relevant federal departments and agencies, the 
provinces and the private sector. Its mission is to help existing 
exporters find new markets, and to ensure that all Canadian 
exporters have access to the best possible market intelligence about 
these world markets.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	Over the next three months all of the partners at the federal level 
in the provinces and the private sector will be determining what 
sectors and what markets we should be keying in on. Where do we 
focus? Where do we set our priorities?
<P>
	Team Canada's task will be to identify, prepare and assist 
companies with export potential, develop their interest in foreign 
markets, help them gain access to all export assistance programs, 
and facilitate their export involvement. We are becoming much 
more proactive than ever before.
<P>
	It is more important than ever that we commit our resources 
where they will have the greatest impact. Certainly in our economy 
exports have had an enormous impact in creating jobs and growth. 
That is why our direct funding assistance for international business 
development is now limited and will be focusing on small or 
medium size companies in which a lot of the growth and jobs can 
take place.
<P>
	We also recognize the vital role played by our trade 
commissioners in all this. In 107 trade posts throughout the world 
these commissioners provide Canadian entrepreneurs with 
business leads, introductions to buyers and partners in foreign 
markets as well as with timely, strategic advice on markets and 
how best to tap into them.
<P>
	We must support and strengthen our trade commissioners by 
enhancing their client focus and by providing means of monitoring 
client satisfaction.
<P>
	The final ingredient of export success is access to competitive 
export financing. This often determines whether a firm can export 
or not. In times of diminishing  resources, when governments can 
no longer afford to provide all the funding they would like to or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="281"> 281 </A></B>
<P>
which companies may feel they need, we need to become more 
creative and imaginative in our approach.
<P>
	The old ways of the old days when export orders were purchased 
with highly subsidized export financing must give way to new 
forms of risk sharing with the private sector.
<P>
	We understand these new realities and we will work through the 
Export Development Corporation, the EDC, to expand the export 
finance system by leveraging public and private sector resources in 
new and innovative ways.
<P>
	We will also look at ways to encourage Canadian financial 
institutions to become more involved in export financing. Some of 
the banks have already begun to develop strong relationships with 
EDC. We want to see these relationships grow with true risk 
sharing partnerships.
<P>
	As we approach the 21st century our reputation as a trading 
power is well established and will continue to grow because 
Canadians have demonstrated their ability to take on the world and 
win. As a government our role is to solidify the gains we have 
made, to open new markets to Canadian enterprises, to encourage 
more Canadian companies to sell abroad, to be more proactive in 
how we help them and to continue to market Canada as a wonderful 
place to invest.
<P>
	Our prosperity as a nation is always dependent on trade. In 
earlier days in other ways we met the challenges that faced us. I am 
confident we will again rise to the occasion. Our recent trade 
performance, as I have talked about it here this morning, has 
indicated that we can achieve when Canadians work together, when 
Canadian work in unison, when Canadians work as a team.
<P>
	I am convinced these successes will pale with the achievements 
that are still to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the minister on his speech. Unfortunately, I cannot 
completely subscribe to his claim.
<P>
	Yesterday saw the minister in the United States talking about 
trade relations with that country, our main trading partner. The U.S. 
is indeed one of Canada's very important partners, but at a 
significant cost.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	It is not under just any old conditions that we are friends with the 
United States and it is not under just any old conditions that we 
export to the United States. To do so, we have to snub our 
longstanding trading partners, Cuba, for example. Yesterday the 
minister was reminded fairly vigorously that courting Cuba was not 
in the best interest of trade relations between our two countries. I 
would like him to explain to us what he intends to do about this. He 
has brushed it under the carpet.
<P>
	Fifty companies in Canada export more than 50 per cent of all 
Canadian exports, and the minister is telling us we have to increase 
the number of exporters. Is this an example of the new Liberalism 
where as many friends as possible get involved at once? Would it 
not be a better idea to try to have more products and, by inventing 
new ones, open markets with our own products, produced and 
created right here? When I say ``created right here'', we should 
think about research and development, an area the revenue minister 
cut and then went back to after the fact. He clawed back the 
investments of Quebecers and Canadians who had put their money 
into research and development.
<P>
	With one small example, I would just like to show the minister 
the importance of research and development in Canada. When the 
first white people, the French, arrived in Canada, an ear of corn was 
about the size of a cigarette. Then, with the opening of the prairies, 
research was done and this area was studied in depth. Now an ear of 
corn almost looks like a bologna sausage. The desire and the 
research produced success.
<P>
	What have we done in forestry? We have emptied our land of its 
vast forests. We know that, before it can be cut down, a spruce tree 
must grow for 50 years in some areas and 40 years in others. We, 
however, have not gone any further to find a harvesting method that 
could meet global demand, if we are talking about new exports, 
new products.
<P>
	We are still able to export wood because of our huge territory, 
but we have not made any discoveries in this area. We could engage 
in research and development, but the minister was not too insistent 
on this point.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister whether he plans to speak to his 
colleague, the Minister of National Revenue, to make him stop 
blundering as he did by acting like the highwaymen of the last 
century, who went after all those who had managed to save a little 
money and squeezed them dry by collecting their money 
retroactively.
<P>
	As the minister would probably admit, the rooster is an early 
riser so whoever wakes him up must rise even earlier. That is what 
the minister should do. If he wants to accomplish something, if he 
wants to get something done, he should rise before the rooster and 
propose something that makes sense. I am 50 years old and the 
minister is not saying anything I have not heard before. I never 
heard an industry or international trade minister admit to us: ``I 
have no ideas. I am no good. I do not think my proposal will 
work''. No minister ever told me that. I am 50 years old, and I am 
still waiting.
<P>
	They have all discovered the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
We, however, can see that the debt has grown to $600 billion, that 
nothing is working, that the economy in Montreal and other cities 
is in a free fall, that poverty is rising in direct proportion, while the 
minister is shouting ``Eureka'' like the guy in his bathtub.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="282"> 282 </A></B>
<P>
	What we need is R and D, new markets, new products, nothing 
less. Instead of taking a piece of pie and letting as many people 
as possible nibble at it, we must put another pie on the table. The 
minister, however, shows no such political will.
<P>
	I therefore ask him what he intends to do in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague said a number of 
things. What struck me the most is when he said we must think 
Canadian. I am glad to hear that from a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	What we need to do is think Canadian. That is what was the great 
success was behind Team Canada, notwithstanding that the premier 
of Quebec never went. Other premiers went, the private sector 
went. They produced some $20 billion in contracts that produced 
tens of thousands of jobs throughout Canada, including Quebec.
<P>
	The Quebec government needs to get on to Team Canada. I am 
delighted to hear the member say that we need to think Canadian. 
He said a number of things. I got the impression he was dismissing 
our relationship with the United States. This is over 80 per cent of 
our trade. We cannot dismiss that relationship out of hand.
<P>
	I pointed our earlier that we have a $28 billion surplus, much of 
that with the United States. Our trading relationship with that 
country is quite successful and it is bread and butter on the table for 
Canadians. We need to continue to nourish it.
<P>
	I went to Washington yesterday to talk with the U.S. trade 
representative, Mr. Kantor, and the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. 
Brown, about the relationship. It was a meeting that had been 
planned some time before the Helms-Burton legislation became 
quite the controversy that it is today. It was designed as a get 
acquainted session and an opportunity to explore a number of 
bilateral issues.
<P>
	To put this in some context, more than 95 per cent of the trade 
that exists between Canada and the United States is not a problem 
at all. These discussions are relevant to no more than 5 per cent of 
trade. We must continue to advance that relationship. We must 
make sure that we have more rules on which to base our 
discussions and settle our disputes.
<P>
	As was quite evident in the recent settlement of the softwood 
lumber dispute, in NAFTA there is no subsidies code. There are no 
rules about subsidies so that the United States can come in and 
countervail.
<P>
	Fortunately, with the support of the provincial governments, the 
Government of Quebec, the industry of Quebec, the Government of 
British Columbia, the industry of British Columbia being the two 
biggest representing 85 per cent of the softwood lumber exports  to 
the United States, we were able to work out an agreement with the 
United States that provides for five-year secure access for our 
lumber market, an $8 billion export market. By doing that, it will 
prevent countervail from occurring in this area and save thousands 
of Canadian jobs.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that we did not have rules on subsidies, we 
were able to get that agreement. We need to keep working on the 
rules to make sure that we are protected. We are dealing with a big 
country. We have to protect ourself with a rules based system. 
More liberalized trade, yes; also, more rules based trade.
<P>
	With respect to Cuba and the Helms-Burton bill, I made it clear 
to Mr. Kantor and Mr. Brown of the United States government that 
Canada protested the bill. We certainly join with them in deploring 
the shooting down of those planes by the Cubans. We want to work 
with them and to try to advance democracy and human rights in 
Cuba.
<P>
	To take this kind of measure against third countries, including 
Canada, to say in effect that if you trade with Cuba, you cannot 
trade with us, as somebody in the States said, is wrong. It is a 
dangerous precedent. I made that quite clear.
<P>
	My hon. colleague asked me this morning about what we will do. 
I met with ambassadors from many countries and heard many 
similar kinds of concerns expressed by them. I will also be 
consulting with Canadian businesses. We are looking at our options 
as we read the final text of the bill. We have not seen the final 
wording yet. It is going to pass the Senate and the House of 
Representatives. It will be signed by the President.
<P>
	The President of the United States will have some discretion. It 
is limited, but he has some. We will be urging him to use that 
discretion to not take this out on their long time friend and number 
one trading partner, Canada, or third world countries. We have not 
heard the last of this issue.
<P>
	The throne speech talked about the need for further investments 
in the area of science and technology. This certainly is where a lot 
of research is going to be needed. We recognize that innovation is 
going to help lead to more productivity. It will help lead to the kind 
of competitive position we have to have in world markets to be able 
to increase our exports. We well recognize that. We also recognize 
that more firms need to export. That is why we set a goal of saying 
we would double the number of exporters by the year 2000. That is 
why we are going to take a more proactive means of achieving 
increased export volumes and increased investment.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague knows full well from those remarks and from 
the statistics which have been coming out lately which clearly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="283"> 283 </A></B>
<P>
indicate our ever increasing export  opportunities that the 
government is giving this the kind of priority that it needs to have.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am going to seek the 
co-operation of the House and in particular the minister. The 
member for Yorkton-Melville rose to his feet at the same time as 
the member for Chambly on questions or comments. While the 
minister took some time in his response to elaborate on an issue 
which is very time sensitive, and I am referring to the 
Canada-U.S.-Cuba situation, I wonder if he would take a question 
from the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will make one observation and then I will get to my 
question as quickly as possible.
<P>
	I am really surprised at the blatant hypocrisy of the Liberals. I 
will ask the minister this question. Why has he suddenly changed 
his mind in regard to free trade, NAFTA and all of these things? 
During the election the Liberals clearly stated that they were going 
to abrogate certain parts of the NAFTA treaty. In fact, during an 
earlier election they vigorously opposed NAFTA.
<P>
	I do not understand the hypocrisy in suddenly turning around and 
singing the praises of NAFTA. It is like they are telling us they are 
glad the Conservatives won the election on that issue.
<P>
	Why is the government not working much more vigorously 
within Canada to reduce the trade barriers that exist within this 
nation? It is working in areas around the world, and we do not have 
a problem with that. We realize that Canada depends a lot on 
international trade so why is the government not using its power to 
break down the barriers within Canada that are costing us billions 
and billions of dollars?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two parts to that question. 
I will take them in reverse order.
<P>
	The government does give priority to the breaking down of 
internal trade barriers. Some people have said there are more 
barriers to trade within Canada than there are between Canada and 
other countries. That is true in many respects.
<P>
	The government is cognizant of that. It wants to remove those 
trade barriers. That is why it entered into an accord with the 
provinces last year. It will continue to work to break down those 
barriers, to bring about the free flow of goods and people and 
investment within our country. That remains a very high priority of 
the government and my colleague, the Minister of Industry, will be 
able to provide more information on what specifically is being 
done by him and by the government to meet that priority.
<P>
	With respect to the free trade agreement and the position that the 
government took when it came into office, we had witnessed for a 
number of years the start-up of the free trade agreement prior to the 
NAFTA  agreement. The initial impact of that agreement was quite 
negative in many respects for many companies, particularly branch 
plant companies. There were a lot of closings and a lot of people 
losing jobs. The previous government had indicated that it would 
have an adjustment program that never materialized. Many people 
suffered under that situation.
<P>
	Having gone through that restructuring, Canadians are beginning 
to see the benefits of the free trade agreement, the benefits of 
NAFTA. More benefits can be gained if we can increase the 
number of rules, including dispute settlement mechanisms. That 
has always been the government's message and my party's 
message.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	It is what we said we wanted to do with the trading remedy 
groups in NAFTA. We want increase the rules to decrease the times 
and the opportunities for a member country to take countervail or 
anti-dumping duty action. Those two actions have no place in the 
free trade agreement. We want them out. We want a rules based 
system and we will continue to get through NAFTA and through the 
World Trade Organization a priority of working toward more 
liberalized trade in the world, but also based on some very clear 
rules.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the minister and the 
House for their indulgence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to inform you that, starting now, Bloc members will be 
splitting the 20 minutes allocated. As far as I am concerned, I will 
have the pleasure of sharing my speaking time with my good 
friend, the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to mention two major political 
developments that have occurred since last session, before 
Christmas, and have resulted in major changes both in the Quebec 
National Assembly and in the House of Commons.
<P>
	On the one hand, Mr. Lucien Bouchard was elected leader of the 
Parti Quebecois, becoming the premier of Quebec, and on the other 
hand, the hon. member for Roberval was elected leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois. These two events have added a new dimension to the 
Quebec national political scene, not as regards the ultimate goal, 
which is sovereignty, of course, but as regards Quebec's structures.
<P>
	Mr. Bouchard's reputation is firmly established and, as far as the 
hon. member for Roberval is concerned, I am convinced that he 
will ensure that the Bloc Quebecois gets the second wind it needs to 
carry out its mission, which is to look after Quebec's interests in 
Ottawa.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="284"> 284 </A></B>
<P>
	This being said, I have spent several weeks in my riding since 
the holidays. This was an opportunity for me to examine further a 
number of issues and travel  throughout my riding without any 
electoral concerns. I spoke with people, but mostly I listened.
<P>
	People are worried, not about the rise of the sovereignist 
movement in Quebec, contrary to what federalists contend all the 
time, but about the repressive attitude of this federal government.
<P>
	They are also worried about the government's famous <I>B</I> plan, the 
plan to create fear: the fear of partitioning, to the point that there 
was a demonstration just across the river. There were just a few 
demonstrators, and the incident turned out badly for our good 
Prime Minister. Minutes later, the Deputy Prime Minister-this is 
not just any backbencher-was saying: ``It is those separatists 
again. It is all their fault''.
<P>
	As for the drop in air traffic at Mirabel and Dorval airports, the 
Minister of Finance had this explanation: ``If there are fewer planes 
in the sky and at Mirabel, it is because of the separatists''. When a 
snowstorm hits Quebec or some other region in the country, it is the 
separatists' fault. And when spring finally arrives and the tulips 
start to grow, it will of course be thanks to the federalists. When 
things go well it is thanks to the federalists, but when they go bad 
the separatists are to blame.
<P>
	I was really surprised to see that when Kevin Barry Snow, a 
Newfoundlander, climbed over the fence at our Prime Minister's 
residence, nobody stated: ``Another separatist''. That person 
happens to come from Newfoundland, so the issue of separatism 
was not raised.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	On another note, the cuts to social programs, particularly the UI 
program, have major repercussions for workers. The unemployed 
are helpless, and feel that they are perceived as being at fault. 
Indeed, this government does not target unemployment but the 
unemployed. It punishes them by shortening the benefit period, by 
reducing the amount of these benefits, and by forcing people to 
work longer to be eligible for these benefits. This is not what 
Quebecers need. They need jobs.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, some people all dressed up in 
red and carrying a red book kept saying: ``Jobs, jobs, jobs. We will 
create jobs''. The official unemployment rate may not be up, Mr. 
Speaker, but look at the offloading onto the provinces going on. It 
has led to a dramatic increase in the number of welfare recipients.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to meet women and men from my riding, 
and it is very clear to these people that the Liberal government is 
overwhelmed and cannot cope with the major issues that concern 
all Canadians. Not only do they think that this government is out of 
touch with reality, they also feel that it has lost the confidence of 
Canadians and that all it can do is create a feeling of insecurity.
<P>
	One of my constituents in the municipality of Coleraine made 
the following apt comment to me on the weakness of this 
government: ``You know, Mr. Chrétien, this government does not 
know what tax fairness means. They did not have the nerve to tax 
family trusts or to abolish tax shelters for the rich, but instead they 
dump on ordinary folks, the elderly, the unemployed, 
self-employed workers, particularly in the fishing and forest 
industries''.
<P>
	During the last referendum campaign, I saw Laurent Beaudoin 
being interviewed on RDI. The host asked him ``How much tax did 
you pay last year?'' His answer was: ``We paid no taxes last year''. 
``How much in the way of taxes did Bombardier, the biggest 
company in Canada, pay two years ago?'' Mr. Beaudoin replied: 
``None''. He was then asked ``What about three years ago?'' The 
answer: ``We did not pay any taxes''. When asked ``What was the 
last year for which you paid any taxes, Mr. Beaudoin?'' he replied 
candidly ``I do not remember.'' So much for tax fairness, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	This government has created an atmosphere of uncertainty. We 
hear rumours that the minimum age for old age pension eligibility 
will be raised to 67. You can imagine how worried the people in my 
riding who are 63 or 64 years old are. The government is toying 
with taxpayers, and this must stop, and stop immediately. The 
people of Frontenac are vigorously voicing their opposition to this 
government; there have been public demonstrations, with no holds 
barred in their criticism of this government.
<P>
	In October 1995, the Liberals raised considerable hopes with 
their ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. Are you aware, Mr. Speaker, that in the 
month of November 1995 alone there were 40,000 jobs lost in 
Canada?
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals will reply: ``But we created 50,000 jobs.'' Yes, they 
created 50,000, but 90,000 businesses or individuals closed down 
or lost their jobs. What is of interest to us is how many jobs were 
really created. I have a document here prepared by the Liberal 
Party on job creation and economic renewal during their first year. 
``Implementation of the national infrastructure program, which 
will create 90,000 direct jobs in two years.'' Not true. These are 
only figures with which they want to impress their supporters, but 
when the calculations are made, we realize that there is nothing to 
them.
<P>
	I have a report from <I>Le Soleil</I> here which says that the Prime 
Minister will need to work twice as hard, keep major promises at 
the mid-point of his mandate. Among the promises that have not 
been kept-one to which the minister has just referred-there is the 
replacement of the goods and services tax, the GST. The Deputy 
Prime Minister and member for Hamilton East said: ``Give us a 
year in power and the GST will be scrapped''. Now two years and 
four months have passed and all that we have  managed to get from 
the Minister of Finance is that the GST will undergo a name change 
and that they will hide it away, like hypocrites. People will keep on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="285"> 285 </A></B>

paying taxes like before, but without noticing them. That is what 
the Liberal Government is in the process of imposing upon us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the member for Richmond-Wolfe, I am pleased to rise today in 
the context of the reply to the speech from the throne, and, more 
specifically, in the context of my new responsibilities as heritage 
and cultural industries critic.
<P>
	The speech from the throne stated that, with culture at the heart 
of Canada's identity, the government wants to promote a vibrant 
cultural industry. It therefore reiterates its desire to ensure the 
viability of the CBC, the National Film Board and Telefilm 
Canada.
<P>
	However, I must remind it that its red book states in black and 
white, and I quote: ``Funding cuts to the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, the Canada Council, the National Film Board, 
Telefilm Canada, and other institutions illustrate the Tories' failure 
to appreciate the importance of cultural and industrial 
development''. The Liberals, who are now in power, were 
criticizing the Conservatives for their lack of understanding of 
cultural vitality and development in Canada. What a farce. This 
government is a big fat joke.
<P>
	It is an eye opener to look at the facts and realize that this Liberal 
government is not meeting even one of its commitments and that 
the speech from the throne is nothing more than window dressing 
in the area of cultural policy. We should take note that, in the area 
of cultural and heritage development, funding for programs 
supporting publishing, museums, sound recording, video 
production, TV5 and broadcasting in the North has shrunk by $36 
million in the past fiscal year.
<P>
	The French network of the CBC is underfunded compared with 
the English network. It gets $280 million less, for the same sized 
audience. In his letter of September 20, 1995 entitled: ``Structural 
Review: the next steps'', the President of the CBC, Perrin Beatty, 
announced that the corporation had to expect significant cuts in 
government funding, and I quote: ``We are working toward the 
likelihood that, by March 31, 1997, we may have to reduce our 
budget by some $350 million from the 1994-95 levels''. He also 
indicated that cuts totalling $227 million over an 18-month period 
starting in September of 1995 were contemplated, which means 
that nearly $127 million in cuts should be announced in the budget 
tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	After the Juneau report was tabled, it was suggested that a new 
CBC tax be levied through a 7.5 per cent increase in cable fees to 
support cultural undertakings. Note that a recent survey shows that 
more than 43 per  cent of Canadians oppose the proposed new tax. 
Tell me, Mr. Speaker, is this the way to go about supporting our 
cultural industries? I would like this House to tell me what is 
prompting the Liberal government of Canada to put its leading 
cultural industries on the line, thereby jeopardizing the vitality of 
our cultures in Canada and Quebec?
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois is objecting to this Liberal 
government changing the mandates of major cultural institutions 
such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the National Film 
Board, Telefilm Canada and the CRTC, as recently announced by 
the Deputy Prime Minister. All this to use these institutions as 
propaganda tools to promote Canadian unity.
<P>
	We will recall that already in the early 1960s, culture and 
communications became key issues, both for Quebec's cultural 
sovereignty and for Canadian unity. As mentioned on page 5 of the 
white paper on culture tabled in July 1966, the commitment to 
developing and maintaining a radio and television broadcasting 
system in Canada essentially came within the scope of the pursuit 
of a Canadian identity and of Canadian unity. The kind of Canadian 
nationalism practised by Pierre Elliott Trudeau's Liberals was 
intended as a counterbalancing force, a weapon against Quebec's 
nationalism and against the recognition of the Quebec people.
<P>
	Through its statements and challenges, this government 
continues to deny there is such a thing as a Quebec culture. The 
term ``ethnicism''-a term to remember-used by the members of 
the heritage committee, a committee with a very large Liberal 
majority, in reference to Quebec's culture, is a case in point. As 
evidenced by history, taking such a view to Canada causes a major 
clash between Ottawa and Quebec.
<P>
	With respect to culture, the 17 years of the Trudeau era were 
characterized by an emphasis on culture as a Canadian identity and 
unity tool and by the development of a national policy in Canada. 
This denial of Quebec's cultural identity goes to show how much 
federal Liberals use double talk.
<P>
	In these times of communication, new technologies and 
information, Quebec's culture is claiming its rightful place. At no 
time will the Bloc Quebecois ever tolerate that Quebec be dealt 
with by this government like in the days of the British colonial 
empire. We will keep forcing the federal government to recognize 
the existence of the people of Quebec. We intend to pester the 
government until such time as budgets are allocated fairly and 
equitably amongst cultural institutions.
<P>
	At present, the average budget for one hour of broadcast 
production at the CBC is twice what at Radio-Canada. Such 
unfairness is unacceptable and all the more unjustified that, in 1976 
and 1977, the average cost of one hour of broadcasting was shared 
equally between the French and English networks. But the  present 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="286"> 286 </A></B>
<P>
situation is the result of 20 years of the Liberal federal cultural 
development policy.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	In the whole issue of the relationship between Canada and 
Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois believes that the only way to deal with 
this colonial attitude is to become sovereign. We will continue to 
strive to ensure that the federal government will never again 
trivialize Quebec culture by reducing it to a mere Canadian 
sub-culture. Quebec culture is the culture of a people.
<P>
	In closing, in my capacity as the official opposition's critic for 
heritage and cultural industries, I would like to state in this House 
that Quebec culture is the culture of a people, one of the founding 
peoples of this country, which was excluded by the unilateral 
patriation of the Constitution in 1982. Sovereignty is absolutely 
essential to the cultural future of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member's comments. The closing urges 
me to come forward and ask the member for a response to a 
hypothesis.
<P>
	The member says that Canada rejected the Quebec culture in 
1982. In my view, Canadians, regardless of the province they live 
in, have a vested interest and own a piece of every part of Canada: 
Peggy's Cove in Nova Scotia; Goose Bay in Labrador; Quebec City 
in Quebec; Toronto and Muskoka in Ontario; the wonderful 
prairies; the magnificent Rockies; and Victoria. Each and every one 
of us owns a piece, no matter how small, of all of that, including the 
culture and physical characteristics.
<P>
	Would the member not agree that he also owns a part of all of 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. As it clearly shows, the hon. member 
recognizes not only that Quebec is a founding nation but 
also-although he did not dare say so-that it has played a very 
active role in and made a major contribution to this country's 
development.
<P>
	History demonstrates this strong reluctance to recognize 
Quebec-and its francophone community-essentially as a people. 
This was confirmed by recent federal-provincial negotiations that 
led to the rejection of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. 
When the Constitution was patriated in 1982 and the issue came to 
the forefront, where were the groups travelling to Quebec by bus 
and by plane to tell us that they loved us?
<P>
	Do not forget that the Quebec National Assembly, composed of 
both nationalists and federalists, had rejected this unilateral 
patriation of the Constitution. Where were you when Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau was leading this kind of action against Quebec and 
denying that  Quebecers were a people? This is the ultimate result 
of the action taken by your government and your party.
<P>
	Whoever their new members may be, Liberals must remember 
that this matter is of the utmost importance for Quebec at a time 
when Canada is rejecting the concept of Quebec as a people and, 
according to Canada's cultural policy, relegating it to the status of 
one of the largest cultural communities. I am sorry but the hon. 
member must know that we are not a large cultural community. We 
in Quebec are a French speaking people.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member of 
Parliament for Dauphin-Swan River, I am pleased to respond to 
the speech from throne.
<P>
	The throne speech outlines the broad initiatives the government 
will take over the next two years, initiatives that will continue the 
work we began two years ago. They are initiatives that we 
promised in the red book, initiatives that we are delivering on as a 
government and initiatives that promote economic growth and job 
creation, that promote unity and promote security for individual 
Canadians and their families.
<P>
	Our vision is clear. We are working toward a strong and united 
Canada with a vibrant economy that allows us to continue to 
provide the social programs that are so important to Canadians. It is 
a vision that includes all Canadians, urban and rural.
<P>
	Our Prime Minister continues to keep our greatest resource, the 
Canadian people, at the forefront of his agenda. That is what this 
country is all about. That is what the throne speech is all about. It is 
about delivering honesty, integrity and hope to the people of this 
great country Canada.
<P>
	Canada is the best country in the world in which to live. This 
Liberal government is committed to ensuring that Canada includes 
all 10 provinces and two territories. The Liberal government 
recognizes that all Canadians have a stake in the future of our 
country and that all Canadians care about Canada. That is why we 
are committed to ensuring that all Canadians have a say in the 
future of Canada.
<P>
	Since Confederation, Canada has successfully adapted to a 
rapidly changing world. The one constant in Canadian history has 
been our ability to adapt to new circumstances and new realities 
without sacrificing our principles and values.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="287"> 287 </A></B>
<P>
	Part of ensuring that Canada remains strong is ensuring that we 
have our fiscal house in order. As the member for Dauphin-Swan 
River, I was pleased with the priority given to improving the 
economic health of rural Canada.
<P>
	One of the first areas addressed in the throne speech was rural 
Canada. This demonstrates the importance this Liberal government 
places on the future of rural Canadians. The economic challenges 
rural Canada faces are much different from those of urban areas.
<P>
	We will ensure that all Canadians benefit from economic 
prosperity. That is important to the people of Dauphin-Swan 
River and I applaud it. We already have a proven track record in 
putting programs and policies in place to benefit rural communities 
in the long term.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is an excellent example. We helped 
local communities complete important projects, created jobs and 
boosted local economies. We invested over $2 million in the future 
of my riding of Dauphin-Swan River.
<P>
	As a government we have also brought information technology 
to rural communities through the community access program and 
SchoolNet. These tools will help communities diversify their 
economies and will open up endless possibilities for businesses and 
employment. We are proposing new and innovative ways of job 
creation and rural Manitoba will benefit from our jobs and growth 
strategy.
<P>
	In particular, I am very excited about our focus on jobs for young 
people. We are investing in our young people. As a mother and as a 
grandmother, I know how important our young people are to the 
future of this country. One of the challenges our young people face 
is that to get a job, they need experience but they cannot get that 
experience if they cannot get a job. They are caught in a vicious 
circle.
<P>
	We are, as the Liberal government, taking decisive action to 
address this problem. We are doubling the number of summer jobs 
for students to give them the experience they need to get jobs once 
they are done school. We are investing in their future and the future 
of Canada.
<P>
	In rural Manitoba and in Dauphin-Swan River we know that 
people accomplish the most when they work together. That is 
exactly what we are doing as a federal government. We are putting 
out a challenge to the provincial governments and private industry 
to match our commitment to young people and the future of our 
country. Our future is their future.
<P>
	This government's commitment to sound agricultural policy will 
be an important component in revitalizing rural Canada and rural 
Manitoba. Farmers are already seeing the positive impacts of this 
government's agricultural policy. They are seeing it in their 
pocketbooks where they need it most.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Grain prices remain high, exports are expanding and there is a 
higher demand for the quality products that we produce. This is a 
direct result of trade missions, the  Team Canada approach and our 
commitment to expanding markets, our commitment to ensuring 
that our performers can continue to do what they do best, produce 
the highest quality foods in the world. Agriculture is one of the 
three or four most significant players in the Canadian economy 
generating more wealth, more innovation, more trade and more 
jobs for Canada's future.
<P>
	We are also following through on other commitments to get our 
fiscal House in order. We are on target with deficit reduction. We 
are keeping interest rates low so farmers can buy equipment and 
land to take advantage of the opportunities we are creating in 
agriculture and so families can invest in their future. We are 
spurring the economy. We are negotiating with the provinces to 
harmonize the GST and the PST. And we will make good on our red 
book promise to replace the GST.
<P>
	While our economy is vitally important, as a government we 
have struck the important balance between the economy and social 
programs. The whole world looks to Canada as a model of 
co-operation. As the Prime Minister stated, we have affirmed our 
own special definition of greatness. We have achieved the greatest 
balance between economic success and social justice of any nation. 
Our social programs are part of what makes us Canadian. They 
speak of compassion, caring and selflessness. The Liberal 
government will continue on with its unwavering commitment to 
social programs.
<P>
	We are committed to medicare and will continue to uphold the 
five principles of the Canada Health Act. Over the last two weeks I 
have held five health forums in communities across my riding in 
conjunction with the National Forum on Health. The message from 
the people of Dauphin-Swan River was loud and clear. They want 
medicare maintained and they want to ensure that health care 
dollars are wisely spent.
<P>
	Where the previous Conservative government was phasing out 
its financial support of our social programs, this Liberal 
government is putting our money where our promises are. We are 
placing a floor under the Canada health and social transfer. We are 
ensuring that Canadians will continue to benefit over the long term 
from our social programs. This is our commitment to Canadians. 
We will preserve the social programs that protect Canadians and 
that have become part of our values as a country. We will ensure 
that Canadians can continue to count on medicare, the Canada 
pension plan and quality education.
<P>
	I have spoken with people of all ages in my riding of 
Dauphin-Swan River and they know the importance of the 
Canada pension plan. They have told me how important it is that as 
a government we ensure that their children and grandchildren will 
benefit from a public pension system. This Liberal government is 
committed to a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="288"> 288 </A></B>
<P>
public pension system that provides future generations  with 
financial security. We will ensure that the people of 
Dauphin-Swan River have this security.
<P>
	I am pleased that we are continuing our commitment to the First 
Nations people of Canada. In two short years much has been 
accomplished to forge a new relationship with Canada's aboriginal 
peoples, a relationship based on communication and mutual 
respect. The Liberal government is establishing new partnerships 
with First Nations through the dismantling process in Manitoba, 
the announcement of inherent right to self-government policy and 
our commitment efforts to work co-operatively to address the 
unique challenges First Nations and Metis people face.
<P>
	The throne speech clearly demonstrates the leadership this 
Liberal government is providing. We are committed to keeping our 
greatest resource, the Canadian people, at the forefront of our 
agenda. We are committed to leading this country with honesty, 
integrity and hope.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to commend my hon. colleague from Manitoba for 
an excellent presentation. It is certainly a pleasure to hear all the 
excellent things that are coming forward. As you move through 
your presentation, I wonder if you would take a moment for those 
of us who come from rural areas-
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind colleagues not to 
get into a one to one conversation and leave your Speaker aside. I 
ask you to direct your interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I wonder if the 
parliamentary secretary would highlight for us some of the items 
that will affect rural Canadians. It was mentioned in the throne 
speech and it is something we all are looking for.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Souris-Moose Mountain for the question.
<P>
	As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources, I believe one of our greatest resources is our people. In 
the throne speech the Prime Minister outlined the importance of the 
people in rural Canada. The resource base of rural Canada can grow 
and prosper through natural resources, part of which is the 
production of food, agriculture.
<P>
	There are many opportunities out there such as the whole 
component of value added and diversification. I know it because it 
is happening in my riding of Dauphin-Swan River. We are adding 
a value to a product we produce. There are great opportunities and 
as a government we are addressing those and will continue to 
address those for the greatest resource of our country, the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister of Natural 
Resources if she feels the government should reconfigure how to 
calculate the royalties on the oil and gas sector to try to extract an 
extra $100 million out of the industry.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	At this time I would like to take the question under advisement 
to my minister. I am sure the Minister of Natural Resources will 
respond very quickly, as she does.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
and honoured to speak on the throne speech.
<P>
	I believe in my heart in these issues. I refer to our aboriginal 
people, our way of thinking, our philosophy in the country. I also 
want to talk about the national unity debate.
<P>
	This is very important to aboriginal people, as we are referred to 
in this country and in the Canadian Constitution, those being the 
Metis people, the non-status people who live off-reserve and also 
include the Inuit who live in the high Arctic and the First Nations, 
the first inhabitants of this land we call Canada.
<P>
	What is happening in this country causes me great concern not 
just with the economic situation we are facing today but the 
divisions happening across the land. It has always been our belief 
that we should live together in harmony and in peace and to have 
honour and respect for each other. Those certainly were 
incorporated in the treaties that were established when the 
newcomers came to this land, the Europeans who arrived here 500 
years ago.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	People in this country have to realize the history goes beyond the 
past 500 years or more, that there is a history to this country. That 
part of history has been ignored and not understood by many 
Canadians. The focus of the national unity debate is to bring people 
together. To go about that we must have open minds.
<P>
	Our people certainly opened their arms to the people who came 
to this land to share the land and resources, inherent in the treaties 
established with the governments. I am particularly saddened when 
I hear comments by members opposite that the country will fall 
apart. I believe it is in the interests of everybody, all Canadians, all 
aboriginal people, to maintain the unity of Canada. It is our desire 
that the country remain united.
<P>
	I have challenged our aboriginal leaders, our aboriginal people 
to maintain the unity of the country. In December of last year I 
called for a sacred assembly to bring people of this country from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="289"> 289 </A></B>
<P>
different walks of life, with different spiritual and religious 
denominations together. This included the Mennonite central 
committee, the Catholic church, the Anglican church, the United 
church, the Presbyterian church, the Reform church, and so on. All 
churches were included plus the non-Christian  people, the Hindu, 
the Jewish people and our traditional people.
<P>
	The aim was that we begin to understand each other through that 
process, to develop an open mind with tolerance and an 
understanding of each other. Many people came to this sacred 
assembly. I was very disturbed by a member of the official 
opposition party, the member for Saint-Jean, a Bloc Quebecois 
member, when he stated that although the themes of the sacred 
assembly were supposed to be reconciliation and spirituality, 
instead the assembly ``reeked of politics''.
<P>
	That statement derides and insults the people who were there, 
including the head of the Anglican church, the primate, the head of 
the United church, the moderator, and other religious leaders who 
were there. They cannot defend themselves in the House. It insults 
the people who were there who were concerned about the country.
<P>
	I stated at the sacred assembly that as aboriginal people we have 
a greater responsibility than any other group of people in this 
country to maintain the unity of the land we call Canada. It is our 
home and we have nowhere else to go.
<P>
	On December 12, 1995 in the House the Bloc member also stated 
he disagreed with me on that: ``The notion of spirituality 
transcends politics and the great creator has no use for national 
boundaries. The next step would have been to come straight out and 
say that the creator is Liberal''. Those are statements made by the 
official opposition member.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	It was not intended to be that way. What I wanted to tell him is 
God is aboriginal and that he loves him and does not want him to 
separate. God wants him to remain in this part of the country, in 
this part of the world. We have so much to share in this country. We 
have rich resources and this land. We have so much to share among 
all Canadians.
<P>
	Some of these comments disturbed me. What is the purpose of 
this institution? Parliament is the highest institution in terms of law 
making decisions in the country. It is a national institution. Where 
else do we go to correct these things and make laws for our people? 
This is where decisions are made.
<P>
	The throne speech identified many areas, which I would like to 
address for my constituents. In the red book commitments were 
made to deal with some of the aboriginal issues such as the inherent 
right to self-government and the land claims process. Those things 
are happening today. The government is proceeding with that.
<P>
	Recently we saw a land claims settlement in British Columbia, a 
part in which treaties were never entered into. Finally after 
hundreds of years they are getting a land claim settlement. I am 
glad to see that.
<P>
	I am disturbed, though, by the politics involved. It seems this is 
being used as a political football. It is not based on history. It is not 
based on equality. It is not based on justice. Rather, it is based on 
trying to retain control and power in that province. It saddens me 
that these things are happening in that part of the country rather 
than being based on equality and trying to obtain justice country for 
our people. We have waited for a long time to resolve these issues.
<P>
	The throne speech also focused on northern Manitoba, job 
growth, social security and many other issues.
<P>
	I am very honoured to be here, able to speak on behalf of my 
constituents in northern Manitoba. Their concerns are unique 
because we are isolated. We are in northern Manitoba and are 
easily affected by the economy. The cost of goods is very high. We 
do not have the same amenities as southern Manitoba. Travel is 
very difficult because of the isolated communities. We have to fly 
in the goods and groceries and provide the basic essential services 
for many of the communities I represent.
<P>
	I know we are trying to address many of these things in 
government. As I participate in the discussions I want to bring 
more of these things forward to the government, to the ministers so 
they can provide the answers and move in the right direction for our 
people.
<P>
	Certainly I am honoured to be here as an aboriginal person in the 
Chamber, able to bring forth the concerns of not only my aboriginal 
constituents but many other aboriginal people who have come 
forward to me expressing their concerns, especially about national 
unity.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	We want to be involved. We want to be part of the process. We 
play an important role in maintaining the unity of this country. We 
play a key role in this whole process and we do not want to be left 
out because we are the original people of this land.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to commend and thank the hon. member for 
Churchill for his presentation.
<P>
	I would like him to comment on the unfortunate statements 
recently made by the minister of Indian affairs, who dabbled as a 
futurist by speculating on the future of a sovereign Quebec and its 
relations with the native communities.
<P>
	You may recall the inflammatory, aggressive and irresponsible 
comments made by this minister, which caused quite an uproar in 
Quebec. Fortunately, the great native leader Ovide Mercredi acted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="290"> 290 </A></B>
<P>
more responsibly and rebuffed the minister of Indian affairs by 
telling him-if  I remember correctly-that this was not the time, 
that he had no right to manipulate native communities in their 
relations with the government of a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	Given the role played by the hon. member for Churchill in the 
history of Canada and Quebec-remember Meech Lake-I would 
like to know what he thinks of these statements and this debate and 
where he stands on all this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, those were the minister's 
statements. I am not responsible for what he says. I am sure he can 
defend his comments.
<P>
	I will say that it requires tolerance and understanding, 
particularly in the province of Quebec, between the government 
and the aboriginal people. We have comments as reported in the 
Toronto Star on January 20 by the premier of the province of 
Quebec who was saying there are two peoples, two nations, two 
territories and this one is theirs and it will never be partitioned. 
Later on in another news article it is stated that sovereignty is 
inevitable.
<P>
	It has to be taken into account that we are the First Nations 
people. We have always taken the position that Quebec is part of 
our territory. Agreements were made between the First Nations 
people, the federal government and the province of Quebec. I have 
always held that the federal government should play a key role in 
this process to uphold the constitutional responsibility and also the 
treaty responsibility it has to the aboriginal people to protect the 
interests of the aboriginal people in that province. Whether it be the 
Mohawk people, the Innu people, the Montagnais, the Cree in that 
province, the government has that responsibility to uphold that and 
to ensure that their rights are protected, including the lands of the 
aboriginal people in that province.
<P>
	We have to keep an open mind that this will happen peacefully, 
that there will not be any incidents that will cause harm to this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the member for 
Churchill. I would like to make some of my own comments. I do 
not have a specific question but perhaps he could reply as to what 
he feels about what I am going to say.
<P>
	I have had some experience overseas with conflicts that are very 
similar to the difficult situation we have with the aboriginal people 
and the rest of Canada. I spent some time in the South Pacific and 
observed what was happening there. The approach used by the 
member with his sacred assembly was used very successfully in the 
South Pacific. I took a great deal of interest in what he was doing. I 
compliment him on the steps he has taken. He is heading down the 
right path and I urge him to continue because it worked in the South 
Pacific.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Some of the problems experienced in Australia and in some of 
the South Pacific islands when I was there were that there was a lot 
of conflict between these people. The solution finally came when 
the grassroots told the elites in their society: ``We do not appreciate 
what you are doing. We need to reconcile. We need to get 
together''. I understand that is what is happening. I urge the 
member to continue that and I support him in that. Unfortunately 
because of previous commitments I was not able to attend his 
assembly.
<P>
	I agree very much that we need an open mind and we need 
tolerance in dealing with some of these things. It appears there are 
elites in society whose approach to this problem only fosters more 
division. It appears to be to their benefit that these certain 
elements, who seem to have a vested interest, continue to foster 
this process of confrontation. We have to get away from that by 
talking to each other.
<P>
	Another observation is that the view of looking back in history 
alone is not always sufficient in reconciling some of our 
differences. That view also has to be balanced by looking ahead to 
where we want to go as a nation. What do we want to achieve? 
What kind of a country do we all want to live in? In talking to many 
of the native people in northern Manitoba and on the reserves in my 
riding in Saskatchewan, this is what they are saying as well. The 
people around my constituency are also saying that. We have to 
bring this together.
<P>
	In conclusion, if there is any injustice that is taking place, we 
have to resolve the issues so that everyone in society will perceive 
that justice is being served and that all concerned are being 
consulted in this regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was certainly very 
pleased with the result of the sacred assembly. It was done in a very 
short period of time. They told me it takes about two to three years 
to organize such an event. I think we had the creator in our hands 
because it was such a success.
<P>
	There were statements made at the sacred assembly, principles 
and priorities that were recommended to the participants. A 
proclamation of reconciliation was also put forward that the people 
can take forth as a role for individuals, churches and spiritual 
leaders and also as a role for governments on a reconciliation 
journey and understanding in this country. It would not be just 
among aboriginal people themselves but would include every other 
nation in this country, whether it be people from Pakistan, Asia or 
other parts of the world who come to this country to live. That is 
something we have to address.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="291"> 291 </A></B>
<P>
	We saw how fragile this country is just between two groups, 
east and west, the French and English. There needs to be an 
understanding and a healing. Reconciliation work has to be done 
in that area, not just among aboriginal people. We know there are 
a lot of  problems in our communities but I keep telling our people 
that we have to do it ourselves, nobody else can do it for us. 
However, we do need some help and understanding in that area 
to begin to address some of those issues which have been 
outstanding for many years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with great sympathy for the spirit that has been engendered 
with the comments made by my colleague from Lloydminster and 
also my colleague across the way from Churchill. This kind of 
conciliatory attitude ought to prevail in a whole variety of areas.
<P>
	In rising to address some of the aspects of the speech from the 
throne, I wish to refer to the particular area where the speech from 
the throne is particularly unspecific. It has to do with updating 
legislation governing financial institutions to ensure that the 
legislation continues to be relevant to the emerging needs of 
businesses and consumers.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	It is absolutely correct that we need to do this. The difficulty 
with the provision in the speech from the throne is that there is no 
particular direction as to what should happen. Will that legislation 
deal with all financial institutions, that is, insurance companies, 
banks, trust companies, securities dealers, credit unions? Does it 
contemplate the establishment of a new schedule of banks so that 
there will indeed be some competition in this area, or at least a 
change in competition? Will there be changes regarding the privacy 
and confidentiality of personal information?
<P>
	It is perfectly clear in the provisions of some of the banks at the 
moment that if you make application to become a client in one 
section, then personal information such as name, address, assets, 
liabilities, indebtedness to one part of the bank is automatically 
transferred to another. If you decide not to allow that to happen, 
then the financial institution, in this particular case the bank, has 
the right to terminate your business relationship with the bank upon 
30 days notice.
<P>
	Will it deal with the levels of access of capital by small 
business? I was rather impressed by the minister of foreign trade 
who suggested that perhaps we ought to have more export and that 
the banks should lend more money to small business. Is he 
suggesting that there be some kind of legislation that will force the 
banks into lending to a certain level to certain kinds of businesses 
in certain parts of the country doing certain kinds of business?
<P>
	Will the legislation deal with how we shall evaluate various 
kinds of business, particularly the knowledge based industries 
where the technology and knowledge is the issue and there are no 
hard assets that there are in certain other sections? Is that what the 
legislation will address?
<P>
	The speech addresses none of these kinds of things and therefore 
we do not know where it is going. The fundamental issue in terms 
of that legislative change or examination should address the 
question: What should be the appropriate balance of influence and 
power among the financial institutions in Canada? It is a relative 
position. Who should dominate? Which institution or group of 
institutions? There is no direction in the speech that indicates there 
ought to be that kind of balance and where the balance should lie.
<P>
	That is an absolutely crucial question which needs to be 
addressed and it is not. That is a very serious shortcoming.
<P>
	I also would like to very briefly touch on the significance of 
science in our economy and address the comments that were made 
by the auditor general in 1994 when he said: ``In today's world, 
economic progress is measured by the ability to provide at 
competitive prices the variety of common and new products and 
services that global markets demand. This requires the ability to 
adapt and commercialize the results of science and technology''. 
This is a very insightful remark and one that we ought to take very 
seriously.
<P>
	What ought to happen here is that the government should create 
in whatever way it can and in every way possible a new awareness 
of the role of science in our educational institutions. It should not 
do the kinds of things that were done last year when it terminated 
the recognition of science teachers and the granting of scholarships 
for students of science.
<P>
	We need competition among institutions to provide the most cost 
efficient and relevant programs. We need a new system of 
introducing a consumer model in post-secondary education so that 
student choice can have an economic dimension to it. There could 
perhaps be such things as vouchers so that the educational 
institution is not granted funding simply on the basis that the 
institution exists, but rather on the basis of competence, 
competition and strength of the programs it provides for students.
<P>
	One part of the throne speech is very specific and it is this 
particular specificity I want to address. On page 12 of the speech 
from the throne is found the following paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Action has already been taken to recognize Quebec as a distinct society 
within Canada and to guarantee that no constitutional change affecting any 
major region of the country will take place without the consent of that region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Now comes a humdinger of a statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government supports the entrenchment of these provisions in the 
Constitution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="292"> 292 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	We have just heard about the need for reconciliation. It is 
important for us to recognize one another as citizens of one nation. 
We need to be tolerant with one another.  We should not create 
exclusiveness between one group and another.
<P>
	I suggest that the time has come for us to accept one another as 
Canadians. If distinction is to suggest that I am distinct from my 
colleague from northern British Columbia, from any one of my 
other colleagues of the Reform Party, from any one of my 
colleagues across the way or in the Bloc, yes, I am distinct. 
However, that does not create any special status for any one of 
those people or any special status for me as an individual.
<P>
	It is very clear that the issue that needs to be addressed today is 
one of building a relationship, not finding ways in which we can 
draw distinctiveness between us, which separates one another and 
creates some kind of special position relative to one another based 
on where we live, what we speak and what we believe.
<P>
	We need to build. The word that we ought to talk about is 
building, not separating. We need to build, to work together, not to 
become exclusive or distinct in some way. These thinks should be 
looked at.
<P>
	I would suggest not a perfect document but a document that 
comes to grips with what ought to be the characteristics of a 
Confederation in which all Canadians are treated as equals. I 
suggest that the government look at the 20 proposals for 
Confederation that were presented by the Reform Party. Look at the 
implications and the consequences of the matters that need to be 
addressed in the event that separation ought to be contemplated in a 
serious way. It is not a perfect document. It was put out for 
discussion and examination. It should be treated very seriously.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister truly wants to unite this country, then I 
suggest that he listen to the people. They are sending a message to 
us and to him. It says yes, we are distinct in the sense that each one 
of us is distinct from the other. But do not ever divide us into 
categories based on geography, on race, on language or on religion. 
We are Canadians, no more and no less. Dare not divide us into 
groups based on where we live, what we believe or what language 
we speak.
<P>
	This speech is at the same time so unspecific as to be 
non-directional and dangerous in that it threatens to divide people 
who want to be together and be united. It is within this context that 
I would like to propose an amendment to the amendment we are 
debating at this point.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding after the words ``Quebec 
society'' the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and in particular, recognition that it is the separatist movement in Quebec that 
threatens the economy of Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Much was made a moment ago about how the economy is 
dropping in Montreal. The reason it is dropping is because of the 
threat of separation of Quebec  from Canada. That is the reason for 
this amendment. I urge the House accept the amendment to the 
amendment and support it.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The 
amendment is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
current throne speech presented in the other House and written by 
the Prime Minister is a desperate statement of promises by a 
desperate government in a desperate situation.
<P>
	To get elected the Liberal government promised to get rid of the 
GST but so far it has not kept its word. Here are some comments 
and quotes throughout the past few years.
<P>
	On October 16, 1993 the Deputy Prime Minister said: ``If the 
GST is not abolished under the Liberal government I will resign''. 
On March 2, 1996 she changed this to: ``If the GST is not replaced 
under a Liberal government I will resign''.
<P>
	On September 27, 1990 the Prime Minister said: ``I want the tax 
dead''. On May 2, 1994 he said: ``We hate it. We will kill it''.
<P>
	The current Minister of Human Resources Development said: 
``The goods and services tax is a regressive tax. It has to be 
scrapped and we will scrap it''.
<P>
	The new revenue minister on March 24, 1994 said: ``As Liberals 
we were elected to change the tax, abolish the tax, scrap it''.
<P>
	On April 4, 1990 the finance minister declared: ``I would abolish 
the GST. The manufacturers' sales tax is a bad tax, but there is no 
excuse to repeal one bad thing by bringing in another one. Let me 
figure this out. Does he not think by merging the GST with the PST 
and bringing in a national sales tax he is doing the same thing? Is 
that not just replacing an old bad tax with a new bad tax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre)</B> They do not think so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye</B> On February 6, 1996 the Liberal member for 
Broadview-Greenwood said: ``We are going to defend the status 
quo. You can tell by the way we are treating the GST. I am dead in 
the water with this government. It is one word, trust. I am doing my 
best to fight for tax reform, but my best is not good enough''.
<P>
	``Get rid of the GST'' has become harmonized. ``Kill the GST'' 
has become harmonized. ``Abolish the GST'' has become 
harmonized.
<P>
	As the Liberal member for York South-Weston, a former 
Liberal leadership candidate stated: ``I hope we do not try to 
hoodwink people into thinking our commitment was contingent on 
the provinces agreeing to harmonize their taxes with the GST''. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="293"> 293 </A></B>
<P>
This potential Liberal leader further stated: ``The integrity and 
credibility of the Prime Minister are at at issue. He made  promises. 
We all made promises. We went door to door to scrap the GST and 
if we do not keep that promise it will be very difficult for Liberal 
MPs to go into an election knocking on the same doors, asking 
support once again from people they lied to in the first election 
campaign''.
<P>
	In the red book the Liberals promised to replace the GST. They 
cannot even do that.
<P>
	In a desperate act the Liberal government proposes to transfer 
the problem of getting rid of the GST to the provinces by 
promoting a national sales tax, by promoting harmonization which 
will be nothing more than a change in name to the son of the GST.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A tax is a tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> If provinces do not co-operate, guess what? It will be 
the fault of the provinces, not the Liberal's fault. The Prime 
Minister is not going to eliminate the GST. He is just going to 
rename it.
<P>
	To get elected the Liberal government promised to create jobs 
with its infamous infrastructure program of $6 billion. Now that it 
has failed it challenges businesses to create the jobs that it could 
not and in a desperate move will try to blame the private sector for 
high unemployment. The problem is not government overspending, 
it is not high taxes, it is not oversized government, it is not 
duplicity in government services, it is the private sector that is at 
fault. The government will not accept any responsibility. Blame 
business, blame the provinces, blame the opposition, blame the 
backbenchers, blame the markets, but for heaven's sake do not ever 
blame the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The government promised to preserve and protect social 
programs. What does it do? In a desperate move it lumps all 
funding into one Canada health and social transfer, reducing the 
funding for education, health and welfare by $6.6 billion. Talk 
about slash and burn. It is another desperate but clever move to 
shift responsibility to provincial governments. Let them take the 
flak for the cuts on programs that they have to administer after the 
federal government reduces the amount of money they receive.
<P>
	By the way, the Reform Party cuts to education, health care and 
welfare would have only been $3.3 billion, not the $6.6 billion that 
the Liberals propose. That is one-half of the Liberal cuts. We 
recognize that education is the key to future jobs.
<P>
	The government promised no return to constitutional wrangling. 
In the new throne speech, in a desperate move because it almost 
blew it during the referendum with poor advice to Canadians it 
wants to quickly entrench distinct society and a new amending 
formula in the Constitution.
<P>
	I get a laugh when the Liberal members always harass Reformers 
and say: ``Where were you during the unity debate? What did you 
do during the unity debate?'' We listened to the Prime Minister. He 
told us to stay away and keep our mouths shut for fear we make the 
separatists in Quebec angry enough to vote for separation. That is 
what he told us to do. That was the Prime Minister. That was the 
leader of this country telling us: ``Don't worry, be happy, it is all 
looked after''.
<P>
	Can you picture a replay of the Meech Lake, Charlottetown type 
of shenanigans across the country again? In desperation because 
the Liberals have no plan, have no people, they want to go behind 
closed doors with a first premiers conference to discuss jobs, 
devolution and the Constitution, hoping the premiers have 
solutions.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister campaigned he said he had a plan, as 
he waved his red book. Now after two years he has revised many of 
his plans, replaced 70 per cent of his people and brought two 
outsiders into his cabinet. This is a desperate move to strengthen 
the cabinet, which just shows his lack of confidence in his own 
people.
<P>
	Abraham Lincoln said: ``You cannot strengthen the weak by 
weakening the strong''. This desperate government is now 
attacking profits of banks and businesses, trying to shift the burden 
of responsibility. Are profits a sin? Do not profitable companies 
retain employees and do not bankrupt companies lose employees? 
Why not attack the government overhead instead?
<P>
	For instance there are 5,000 people in the Department of Health 
working in Ottawa. They are not doctors, they are not nurses, they 
are not receptionists, they do not have anything to do with the 
internal functioning of the hospitals and delivering health services. 
Ottawa just transfers the money. Why do they need 5,000 people to 
write 10 cheques to 10 provinces?
<P>
	Lincoln said: ``You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down 
the wage payer''. This desperate government plans to increase 
payroll taxes despite the fact that the wage payer pays 1.4 times the 
wage earner for the benefits of the wage earner.
<P>
	Lincoln also said: ``You cannot keep out of trouble by spending 
more than you earn''. This desperate government clings to the 
belief, in fact brags about deficit spending. The deficit last year 
was only $39 billion, it will only be $30 billion this year, next year 
it will be $25 billion and it is going to get to $17 billion. Wow, 
aren't we doing great? The Liberals see nothing wrong with deficit 
spending.
<P>
	Lower the deficit, the economy will grow. We cannot continue to 
add to the deficit. That is the problem. We are adding to the 
problem. We must have a surplus budget creating hope, growth and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="294"> 294 </A></B>
<P>
opportunities. A simplified tax system would complement the 
spending  cuts of the government and would provide the vehicle we 
could all ride to greater prosperity.
<P>
	My last Lincolnism: ``You cannot build character and courage by 
taking away man's initiative and independence''. I have a 
suggestion for this desperate government. The way to create 
initiative and independence is to reward it with lower taxes, not 
higher taxes. The way to expand the economy is to lower 
government spending so that we can have lower taxes, so 
individuals and businesses have more disposable income, which in 
turn would expand the economy.
<P>
	The way to create jobs is through a simplified tax system, a form 
of a flat tax which is pro-growth, pro-family and represents 
progress toward solving economic problems besides just spending 
cuts.
<P>
	The government is so desperate it is even firing its own people 
from jobs well done. What a shame. What a desperate display to 
cover up the lack of leadership.
<P>
	I submit the best solution, notwithstanding the many good ones 
already made, is that the government plan a fall election this year 
and allow the people of Canada to vote for the party that has plans 
to solve our debt crisis, our debt problem before it is all too late.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is appropriate to congratulate you on your new appointment. I 
know you will do a very good job on behalf of the House.
<P>
	In the few moments I have I could not possibly respond to all the 
points the member has raised. This is the member who proposed to 
the House that MPs' salaries be increased from $64,400 a year to 
$125,000 a year to make it fair. That says a lot about the quality of 
the contribution the member has made to the House.
<P>
	The member referred to the Canada health and social transfer. I 
will deal with that since he was quite critical of the concept. As the 
member knows, the federal government transfers on behalf of 
post-secondary education, health and under the Canada assistance 
plan for health and welfare. That consists of tax points and cash.
<P>
	There were circumstances under which the cash component was 
being reduced to the point it would shortly be eliminated in a 
couple of provinces. In response the government combined the 
transfers into block funding so there would be a cash component 
available for some time until other arrangements and permanent 
cash positions could be established.
<P>
	As a very simple example, here is an instance in which the 
member has been critical of the government for making a move 
which allows the federal government to have an opportunity to 
enforce national standards, particularly on important issues such as 
the health care of all Canadians.
<P>
	Here is a member who has been a proponent of a flat tax. He has 
no specific proposals but knows very well that according to his 
proposals a flat tax may be more simple but the only aspect of 
simplicity is that it simply transfers the tax burden from high 
income earners like him to low income Canadians. That is what the 
member is after. He is after a shift of the burden to low and middle 
income Canadians. I believe the member has shown very well to 
the House exactly what he stands for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I find it interesting that the member 
opposite questions the quality of the contribution I have made to 
the House. I will talk about the quality of the contribution I have 
made.
<P>
	I have talked about integrity and I have talked about honesty 
while that member has sat opposite and laughed. I did not say 
$125,000, I said $150,000. I said it because I believe the 
government was paying itself those gold plated, fat cat, huge 
pensions with millions and millions of dollars to be paid to its 
members when they are finished serving in the House. Is that what 
we are here for? That is not what we are here for.
<P>
	We are not here for the $64,000, but to serve the country. 
However, the way we compensate members of Parliament is 
something that has to be addressed. That is what I said. I received a 
lot of compliments from members of his own party about my 
having the courage to talk about the compensation issue. I should 
have stuck to the pension. I now have a conflict of interest by 
saying how much because I am an MP.
<P>
	I should not have stated an amount, but the member well knows 
that when it came to the pension debate, the quality of that debate 
was deteriorating because from the Prime Minister on down 
everybody in the House who opted in wanted to take care of their 
future pensions on the cry that we do not make enough money in 
salary. All members agree we do not have a high enough salary but 
they do not talk about the high pensions.
<P>
	I walked from the pension. I am such a smart businessman that I 
walked from this pension. If I get re-elected I will not qualify for a 
pension and neither will any of the Reformers in the House because 
we have integrity. We attacked it and criticized it with the 
exception of one Reform member. Fifty-one out of fifty-two 
walked from this and that is the quality we have provided. That is 
the quality of debate I am providing to the House.
<P>
	If the member wants to talk about an issue, let us talk about the 
entire issue. Where is this member on the pension? Did this 
member walk from the pension? Does this member believe that 
after he leaves he deserves millions and millions of dollars for the 
work he did during years he was here?
<P>
	I get upset when somebody questions the quality of what I 
contribute to the House. I am in the House and I am supposed to 
debate issues, putting forth my ideas and  suggestions. Nobody has 
to agree with them, but who in the House has the God given right to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="295"> 295 </A></B>
<P>
check and verify quality? I think the member should take a look at 
his own quality in terms of his criticisms.
<P>
	I also want to talk about the simplified tax system. A simple tax 
is a very complicated tax. It is a complicated tax that takes a lot of 
discussion and a lot of debate. The advantage of simplifying the tax 
system is to restore the purpose of the income tax back to its 
original purpose, which is to generate revenue.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	If we do that, all of the programs we want to give Canadians we 
can deliver through grants and subsidies and not by the 
complicated income tax system in which bureaucrats and 
politicians can distort and play games in society both economically 
and socially. We should make it more visible, transparent and 
taxable. These are the issues I stand for. I want to have things fair 
and above board, not in back rooms behind closed doors.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
welcome to your post. We look forward to a very pleasant and 
interesting House with your guidance and leadership.
<P>
	I am very proud to rise in the House today to speak behalf of my 
constituents, the people of Mount Royal riding.
<P>
	In the past weeks I have received remarkable outpourings of 
support from Côte-St-Luc, Hamsptead, Snowdon, Côte-des-Neiges 
and the town of Mount Royal. My constituents have really renewed 
and re-energized my commitment to them. I thank them from the 
bottom of my heart.
<P>
	What is a throne speech? It is words. What are words? Words are 
the key to communication. They can comfort and confront. Words 
can build harmony and social cohesion or they can lead to violence 
and death.
<P>
	The Heinous and vile acts which took place through the Hamas 
terrorists and which destroyed the peace and lives of men, women 
and children are unacceptable, beyond belief and beyond 
description. My sympathy and the sympathies of the House 
expressed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and particularly by the 
Prime Minister go out to all those families where words led to 
sharp differences and where there has not been a way to lead to 
peace, social cohesion and to the ability to live together in a way 
reflective of respect for differences.
<P>
	That is what our throne speech is all about. It expresses our 
shared values as Canadians and the values of the Liberal 
government. It is about our aboriginal people and the two broad 
national groups and their communities, the broad language groups, 
central to our national vision.
<P>
	By reinforcing our economic and social union we are building 
solid foundations for a strong and united home, a home for all 
Canadians from all parts of Canada  regardless of gender, origin, 
race, language or creed. We are determined to renovate our home as 
we have done over the last 125 years, to make room in it for all of 
us with respect and dignity.
<P>
	These are not words. These are found within the Constitution of 
our country, within the laws of this land and within the concepts 
behind this throne speech. It is a blueprint to a remodelled Canada, 
a prosperous Canada, a united Canada.
<P>
	It speaks to my constituents in Mount Royal in a very special and 
direct way. My riding is a microcosm of the macrocosm that is 
Canada. It is as diverse as our country. It is the mosaic of many 
ethnic minorities where French and English are heard, mixed with 
many other languages, where young and old, men and women, rich 
and poor, of all hues, races, languages and religions live together in 
harmony.
<P>
	However, it is a riding that is deeply nervous, very concerned 
and very upset about the future, living daily on the fault line of the 
national unity issue.
<P>
	My constituents should take heart. I believe firmly that stability 
with economic growth and social cohesions will prevail. That is the 
message of this throne speech. It reaffirms our commitment to the 
people of Mount Royal and to all Canadians to build a strong social 
and economic union that will keep the country together.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	We all know the United Nations has called Canada the best 
country in the world. We know that in our gut. We never get around 
to expressing it. We get around to expressing it only if we are 
taking our luggage and going out of the country. We put a Canadian 
flag on, a Canadian button on, and all of a sudden we are very 
proud to be distinct with our wonderful maple leaf.
<P>
	We get around to saying it only when we are in trouble, which we 
were on October 27. That was the discussion around the 
referendum. That is why Canadians came together, to express the 
desire as a country to live together and to stay together. I suggest 
we start saying that more often, thinking that out loud and being 
proud of all the things we do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, the referendum results clearly showed that Quebecers 
want some changes to the federation. Their wish is no different 
than that of people in the other provinces of the country. People 
everywhere in Canada want change. As I already said, we have to 
reorganize our house. Indeed, what is the House of Commons? 
What is the National Assembly and what are all the other bodies of 
elected representatives? This is a big house and we have to run it 
and be aware of what goes on inside. We have to take care of our 
elderly and of our children; we have to ensure that people have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="296"> 296 </A></B>
<P>
decent life with their  spouse and that they have a job. This is, in 
essence, what the speech from the throne is all about.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have a federation that has been in evolution for the last 25 
years. There are many more things that unite us than divide us. It is 
about time we started to look at all those things for which we can 
count our blessings, particularly as we look around the world.
<P>
	We are working with the provinces and individual Canadians to 
ensure the federation is modernized to act and operate effectively 
and efficiently within clearly defined jurisdictions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, the federal government pledged not to use its 
spending power to create new programs in areas that come 
exclusively under provincial jurisdiction, except with the consent 
of a majority of provinces.
<P>
	There are also other areas in which the federal government does 
not have to get involved. More specifically, we are prepared to 
withdraw from the manpower training, forest, mines and recreation 
sectors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will work to continue the process of reducing barriers to 
internal trade and labour mobility. We will end costly duplication 
because we propose to work with the provinces toward the 
development of the Canadian securities commission, a single food 
inspection service and a national revenue collection agency.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will meet with the first ministers. I am 
pleased to note that Quebec will focus on the economy, the people 
and their needs. I think if we get together to look at what we are 
responsible for and remove that duplication we will be a much 
more efficient and effective country. The problem is most people 
do not know what is federal jurisdiction versus provincial 
jurisdiction versus municipal jurisdiction. We need clarification.
<P>
	This speech today on the throne speech is a generic speech. It 
addresses what I consider to be the global words that affect the 
atmosphere in which we live. We all live in a major envelope. We 
live where the environment has to be in balance with work, the 
economy, security, children, addressing questions of poverty, the 
social and economic problems that beset us.
<P>
	I hope that with more time and the ability to examine and put 
into focus the economic forward movement we find in this speech 
as it addressed the particular issues I have just alluded to, so the 
scales of justice will be in balance, older people will not have to 
worry that they will not benefit from their pensions because their 
pensions will not be touched. My goodness, if we do not touch the 
Canada pension plan our children and grandchildren will not be 
protected because they will have to pay too much and they will not 
be able to support it. That is just one  example for the elderly. There 
are other examples for child support and for children.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	It is time for my colleague to add to what I have said and to give 
his own perspective from his part of the world. In the meantime, I 
hope the constituents of Mount Royal will appreciate the beauty of 
the words encapsulated in the throne speech and the forward look 
with care and devotion which is behind the thoughts and the values 
of the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I want to congratulate you on your election as the 
House's acting Speaker. I am sure that your constituents from 
Madawaska-Victoria are proud to be represented by you in this 
assembly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
My congratulations on your election. We are very proud of you.
<P>
	I have spent time both in the provincial house in Newfoundland 
and in here and I have had occasion to participate in other throne 
speech debates along the way. This one gives me particular 
pleasure because it does strike three things I can wholeheartedly 
support: job creation; preserving the social security net; and 
addressing the national unity issue. These are issues all members of 
the House can identify with. I understand the Bloc has a particular 
perspective on the third issue of national unity, but with that 
qualification, I am sure members of the House generally can 
concur with the need to promote those three objectives.
<P>
	Let me address something my friend from Calgary Centre was 
on to a few minutes ago. By way of illustration, let me tell him and 
others in the House that the former Premier of Newfoundland, Joey 
Smallwood, was known and berated by the Tory opposition in 
Newfoundland for 40 years. He was berated for having said to 
Newfoundlanders: ``Burn your boats''.
<P>
	The context was that we had come into a new industrial age and 
we would not have to fish any more because there would be lots of 
jobs on the land. According to the critics of the day, Mr. Smallwood 
had said: ``Burn your boats. We won't need to go fishing any more. 
There are going to be thousands of jobs on the land''. The phrase, 
burn your boats and the attribution of it to Smallwood went on for 
30 or 40 years.
<P>
	Most Newfoundlanders today are absolutely sure that 
Smallwood made that admonition, gave that advice to 
Newfoundlanders, particularly the fishermen. The fact is that he 
never uttered the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="297"> 297 </A></B>
<P>
words but that did not matter. It was said often enough by the Tory 
opposition that it became the accepted truth in Newfoundland that 
he had said it. If you are from Newfoundland it is a classic  
example of how something that never was gets into the record.
<P>
	I come to what the gentleman for Calgary Centre and members 
of his party are doing today. They set up the old strawman and then 
knock him down. ``You guys said you were going to do way with 
the GST''. No, we did not. They are waving the red book here every 
day. Well, let them read the red book on this one because the red 
book is very clear. On page 22 of the red book it says very clearly 
that the Liberal government would replace the GST with a system 
that ``generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to 
small business, minimizes disruption to small business and 
promotes federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and 
harmonization''.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	The member for Calgary Centre says that we suddenly slipped in 
the word harmonization. We did not just slip it in. It was on page 22 
of the book they have been quoting from for the last two and a half 
years. It has been there all the time but they did not read it. It is the 
old strawman approach: Quote them as having said something and 
then show how they did not come true to their quote, even though 
the quote was false in the first place.
<P>
	I never stood on any platform during the 1993 election saying 
that we would do away with the GST as such. What we said was 
that there had to be a fairer tax, that it had to bring in the same 
amount of revenue and that we would undertake to replace the GST 
with something fairer. Let there be no mistake about it. We need the 
kind of revenue that is generated by the GST. Nobody in his right 
mind suggested that the revenue which was generated from the 
GST would be done away with. That was never ever said.
<P>
	Let us go back to the themes in the throne speech. The one I am 
particularly pleased about has to do with job creation, the whole 
issue of jobs and growth. So far the government's record is not that 
bad.
<P>
	In the first couple of years since November 1993 more than half 
a million jobs have been created. The unemployment rate has come 
down two full percentage points. It is now under 10 per cent for the 
first time in five years. Canada enjoys the highest growth rate of 
the G-7 countries, the big industrial countries, the United States, 
Japan, Germany, France, Italy and so on. The government under the 
leadership of the Prime Minister must be doing something right to 
have these results to show after only 28 months in office.
<P>
	I want to focus for a moment on youth unemployment, 
particularly as it relates to Newfoundland. Going back to 1990, the 
youth unemployment rate in Newfoundland was 25 per cent. That 
is the 15 to 24 age bracket. In 1990, 25 per cent of them were 
unemployed. By 1991 it was 28.1 per cent unemployed in 
Newfoundland. By 1992 it  was 30.2 per cent. In 1993, the last year 
of the Tory administration, it went over 31 per cent. It went from 25 
to 31.1 per cent in the last three years under the Mulroney and 
Campbell administrations.
<P>
	Beginning in 1994 we began to see a turnaround. It was still 
terribly high but it came down. It began to drop from 31 to 30 per 
cent, then to 28 per cent. It has come down in the couple of years 
this government has been in power but 28 per cent of one's young 
people in Newfoundland, ages 15 to 24, without work is still 
nothing to be proud of. It is lower than it was but it is nothing to be 
gleefully shouting about.
<P>
	More needs to be done and the government has recognized that. 
It said so in the throne speech last week. It is going to take steps to 
double the number of summer student jobs. Summer student jobs 
are very important for young people. For most of them it is their 
first crack at a job. It is their first opportunity to prove themselves 
in the workplace. It comes as very welcome news that the 
government is going to do that.
<P>
	I was also pleased with the emphasis in the throne speech on the 
knowledge based industries. There again, that is the wave of the 
future. That is the way to go. In Newfoundland we are getting in on 
that action too. A number of communities in my own riding are 
benefiting from the government's initiative in this area.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It is trade of course that is at the heart of the reason the 
government has been doing so well in fostering economic growth 
and creating jobs in the last couple of years. In that context I want 
to salute the Prime Minister's trade missions. They have been 
marvellous successes.
<P>
	Unfortunately my time is up. Otherwise I would talk about some 
of the success stories that have flown from the Prime Minister's 
trade missions right into Burin-St. George's, right into the 
province and riding I represent, creating and stabilizing jobs there.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague for Burin-St. George's with a great deal 
of interest as he addressed the questions of youth, youth training 
and the amount of attention we are paying to youth unemployment.
<P>
	It is a very serious question in my riding as well. We do not want 
youth taking to the 401 because of the referendum that is hanging 
over our heads in Quebec. I bring to the attention of my 
constituents that as long as that referendum question hangs in the 
air, we have an obligation in this government. We have a 
responsibility to ensure that the debate is conducted with all the 
facts on the table, that there are clear rules of procedure, that the 
process is fair, that the consequences are clear and that all 
Canadians have a say in that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="298"> 298 </A></B>
<P>
	I am very pleased that my colleague clarified the question on 
the goods and services tax. We never said we would get rid of 
the goods and services tax. We said we would harmonize it and 
we would raise equivalent revenues in the process of trying to deal 
with a new method to ensure that it is fair, understood by all and 
that small business will not be crushed by the mechanisms that 
have been put into place.
<P>
	Does my colleague not get a sense of comfort because 
Newfoundland has developed such outstanding and creative artists 
in the field of song and dance? For example the CBC program 
``This Hour Has 22 Minutes'' is so uniquely from Newfoundland. 
Was he not encouraged to see that we are focusing on cultural 
industries recognizing their worth and are supportive of the CBC?
<P>
	We look forward to the budget speech tomorrow and seeing how 
well we are going to do with respect to our interests in cultural 
industries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague for Mount 
Royal has given me the opportunity to say something on the 
cultural issue.
<P>
	I am proud of the leadership the government is giving to this 
particular initiative. Yes it is tough times but the government has 
avoided the temptation to treat cultural industries as something that 
are dispensable. It has paid more than lip service to them and that is 
to its credit.
<P>
	The hon. member has also given me an opportunity to beat my 
chest as a proud Newfoundlander. I never miss the show ``This 
Hour Has 22 Minutes'' and I hope she does not either. It is a 
marvellous show and I know all four of the characters. In the good 
Newfoundland sense of the term they are characters, all of them. It 
is a great tribute to Mary Walsh for having dreamed up the idea and 
having provided the leadership, following it through and now being 
part of the cast.
<P>
	The danger of course for all you up along Canadians in fostering 
the cultural enterprise of this country is that you are going to allow 
very many talented Newfoundlanders to rise to the surface. I could 
mention Rex Murphy and his Sunday call-in show. We are going to 
take over this country altogether.
<P>
	As you know from John Crosbie, Brian Tobin and Don Jamieson 
and others who have come here, acting is what we do well in 
Newfoundland. If you encourage us at all, you could be in a lot of 
trouble up here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to 
the answer given by the member for Burin-St. George's to his 
colleague concerning a cultural affairs program. This is all very 
nice, but the issue here is youth unemployment. The member is 
pleased that the unemployment rate is a mere 25 per cent, that it has 
gone down somewhat. I find that rate to  be very high. It is at least 8 
per cent higher than in the rest of the country.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I have a question for the member, since he provided some 
figures. Last year, when I sat on the human resources committee, 
we went to Newfoundland. People told us, of course, that the 
number of UI claimants had gone down, that the number of welfare 
recipients had gone up, and that young Newfoundlanders were 
leaving the province in droves because they could not find work 
there.
<P>
	Since the hon. member surely knows by heart the exact figures 
for Newfoundland, I would appreciate it if he would provide them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Lévis 
for his question and comment.
<P>
	Without blaming the translators, something obviously got lost in 
the translation. I said in essence what he implied at the end, that 
while the youth unemployment figure is down to 28 per cent I 
immediately followed up by saying that is nothing to be 
particularly proud of. That is what he is saying. It is still very high. 
I said in my speech, in fairness, that it has dropped down a little and 
we can take some encouragement from that. However, I believe my 
next sentence was that it was nothing to be particularly proud of. 
That is not good enough. I agree with him that it is a little better, 
but just a little.
<P>
	That is why I took comfort from the fact that we have a federal 
summer student job creation program which will double the 
number of jobs this year.
<P>
	I agree with my friend from Lévis that we need to do more, 
particularly in the area of youth unemployment. So much needs to 
be done and he and I are on the same wave length.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not wish 
to ruin the day for those who are watching us on television, but I 
have bad news for this House, as well as for the people of Quebec 
and of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to divide my reply to the throne speech into three 
phases.
<P>
	The first thing that struck me was how the Prime Minister seems 
to be haunted by the last referendum. I think that he has not yet 
grasped that federalism won, that the message being sent was that 
real changes were needed, but that, for now, people expected that 
we would deal with the economy while trying to let old wounds 
heal, wounds that were still raw when we came back here in 
November. The expectation was that the House would renew its 
efforts on the economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="299"> 299 </A></B>
<P>
	But no, the Prime Minister seems to have made Canadian unity 
his priority, while it was not one, not a  problem, at the beginning of 
the government's mandate. I wonder. How could public confidence 
be gained? I do not think the throne speech has succeeded in 
making people feel more secure, even if there are references at 
various places to safety and security, whether environmental, 
individual, or international. I do not think the government is 
managing to make people feel any more secure, because it is not 
saying what the people want to hear.
<P>
	But since it seems intent on talking about it, I am not in the least 
ashamed to show my colours in the matter. What about those three 
little points they passed before the holidays: the distinct society, a 
form of decentralization-for when, I do not know-and veto 
rights? We know where all that got them. No one wants to hear any 
more about it. Reference is made to a distinct society, but the 
attitude we had adopted, and which we maintain, is that this was 
not enough and, even, that the proposal made to us was hollow.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I tell myself that I am perhaps still naive, that I perhaps do not 
understand everything, that there is perhaps something hidden 
there I will have to understand at some point. But reading the 
papers yesterday, we could see that the new Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Dion, is thinking exactly the 
same thing we are: the distinct society is meaningless.
<P>
	He said as much in black and white using the new terminology 
borrowed now by the government-security-with the aim of 
reassuring people from Vancouver attending the conference. I 
cannot wait to see Mr. Dion come and repeat that to the people of 
Quebec, who were expecting real change. He is saying in black and 
white that this is not important, that it means nothing and that we 
should not be concerned with it.
<P>
	He was talking to a strongly federalist audience-they are 
allowed-but he was telling them what they wanted to hear, and it 
is not what Quebec wants. It provides no security for the people of 
Quebec to hear a discordant speech like that, something that is 
supposed to bring back unification, but that is meaningless.
<P>
	The other minor point I would like to make in the debate on the 
throne speech, still on the subject of the referendum and the fear of 
the sovereignty movement, is the possibility of the federal 
government holding a referendum. I would like to advise my 
colleagues in the House right off and advise the government that 
never will Quebecers, at least the people in my riding, allow the 
Government of Canada to tell them what to do or to impose its will.
<P>
	What they expected after losing the referendum was real change. 
We have accepted defeat. People have come to me and said: ``Yvan, 
we were not with you, but we hope there will be change. If there is 
no real change, however, have no fear, we will be behind you''.
<P>
	So, this is a signal and I hope the government will understand. It 
could be said they are working to help us, when we are really trying 
at the moment to find a period of calm. We are really trying to build 
what could be a partnership between two peoples living together in 
this huge space. I have no problem with the name Canada. What I 
want is for us to be able to do what we want in our own territory, to 
be sovereign in our territory.
<P>
	I am going to speed up, because I would like to talk a bit about 
the economy. What do we find in this speech regarding the 
economy? Try as I may, I cannot find much to reassure us. On the 
contrary, I see disturbing things. With regard to an effective social 
safety net, the people in my riding were wondering about the status 
of UI reform since Parliament had been prorogued. I told them that 
they could continue to demonstrate in an organized manner, 
without disrupting their neighbours' lives while still showing their 
dissatisfaction.
<P>
	I told them the government would set out its agenda in the throne 
speech and that the Minister of Finance would put figures on the 
government proposals a week later-as we will hear in tomorrow's 
budget speech. It is clearly written here that the government will 
ensure the UI bill will reflect conditions in the labour market while 
respecting the fiscal parameters of proposed reforms.
<P>
	In other words, the status quo. We expect the new Minister of 
Human Resources Development to fully review this bill, as the 
Minister of Finance has indicated that fiscal parameters would 
represent cuts of at least 10 per cent. The die has been cast. All that 
can happen this winter are cosmetic changes. Is this what I am to 
understand?
<P>
	In this case, the people in my riding have a right to be concerned 
and to continue to demonstrate. We had already suggested that the 
government should go after family trusts and urge all Canadians to 
pay their fair share of taxes.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Allow me to quote a few lines from the speech made by our 
leader, the hon. member for Roberval: ``Total profits for the five 
major banks reached $4.9 billion, but 2,800 jobs were cut''. This is 
shocking. If the government is looking for a new source of tax 
revenue, it should start there.
<P>
	``GM Canada reported record profits of $1.4 billion, while at the 
same time laying off 2,500 employees-Bell Canada recorded 
profits of $502 million, but also eliminated 3,200 jobs''. There is 
nothing reassuring about this if large corporations like these are 
really interested in short term profits.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are indicating to me that my time is almost 
up, but I am sure some members will want to ask me questions so 
that I can elaborate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="300"> 300 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not by threatening to retaliate against companies that do 
not comply-I think that, in the budget speech, the government 
should show its true colours right away and raise new taxes to 
ensure that the burden is distributed equally.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is nothing new in the throne speech, except 
that the government has made Canadian unity a priority, when 
everyone is asking it to tackle our economic problems. What I find 
most outrageous is that they prorogued Parliament, but for what? 
They are already talking about reinstating the old bills. The 
government should really do its homework, listen to the people and 
work on the economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member discussed several issues, but what really caught my 
attention is the fact that the government wants to reinstate, without 
amendments, the Unemployment Insurance Act. I sense that the 
hon. member did not have enough time to say everything he wanted 
to, regarding this issue. He told me about it on other occasions. I 
want to ask him what has been going on in eastern Quebec over the 
last few months, since Bill C-111 was first introduced, and to tell us 
about how satisfied people are regarding this measure.
<P>
	I am sure his answer will be of interest to you, Madam Speaker, 
since, as we all know, you come from Edmundston, in New 
Brunswick, where the issues are the same. So, I ask the hon. 
member to tell us more about the unemployment situation in his 
area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, this is an excellent 
question and also an excellent opportunity provided to me by the 
hon. member for Lévis.
<P>
	I jotted down some notes. In the Gaspé Peninsula, the working 
population currently stands at about 43 per cent. This means that 
only four persons in ten are working or actively looking for work. 
This is a very serious situation. It means that out of 10 people who 
are of labour force age only 4.3 actually work.
<P>
	This gives you an idea of why there is so much discontent right 
now. What can these people turn to? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
Moreover, let me repeat that, given the financial implications of the 
speech from the throne, we can anticipate a 10 per cent cut.
<P>
	Since the Gaspé area, including the Magdalen Islands, gets 
something like $170 million under the unemployment insurance 
program, a 10 per cent cut means $17 million less in the region's 
economy. This is in addition to the reform made to the costs of 
fishing permits, which was implemented by the former minister 
and which the new minister intends to maintain. The minister 
hopes to get some $50 million from the fishermen's pockets with 
that.
<P>
	The Gaspé Peninsula accounts for about 10 per cent of Canada's 
fish harvesting. Ten per cent of $50 million is another five million. 
In other words, we are in deep s-,  up to our necks, and this is the 
moment the government chooses to take $22 million out of our 
region.
<P>
	You can see why people in the Gaspé Peninsula and on the 
Magdalen Islands are upset. Seals are not the only ones looking for 
food; people are hungry too. They want to work, but they get no 
offers.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	So, what do they do? They show their discontent. Wherever we 
meet them, they tell us: ``We want to work''. But what is there for 
them? Nothing. It must be understood that these people have been 
told to wait and wait, that they are alone to face the big federal 
machine. At present, they have forum to get their message across to 
the government.
<P>
	It is easy to say that the minister will organize public hearings, 
but the closest one that was proposed, and that was a video 
conference, was in Rimouski. It takes half a day to drive from the 
Gaspé Peninsula to Rimouski. This is a lack of respect toward 
people who are supposed to live off UI benefits, who are being bled 
dry, and who will lose another 10 per cent which, as I said earlier, 
amounts to $22 million.
<P>
	Time is running out and so are people's hopes. Those who live in 
the Gaspé Peninsula are proud people, like those who live in your 
region, but the government must understand that the fate of these 
regions is in its hands. If the minister really wants to go forward 
with that reform, he should at least be man enough to say: ``I am 
putting a stop to that. I am imposing a moratorium''. Until the 
unemployment rate goes down, the minister should shelve his 
reform. This is the message that people from the Gaspé region 
asked me to convey to the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> First a word, Madam Speaker, 
to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker. I 
would like to wish you the best of luck and, for our part, we can 
assure you that you can count on our full co-operation.
<P>
	My speech will have two parts. I will start off speaking as the 
official opposition's critic on training and youth and then simply as 
the member for Lévis, to share with you what my constituents think 
of the speech from the throne.
<P>
	First, with respect to youth, let me just say that, in a nutshell, last 
Tuesday's speech from the throne is a tacit admission of the fact 
that the Liberal government's youth strategy is a failure. Much 
pomp was displayed in introducing this strategy on April 15, 1994, 
and the then Minister of Human Resources Development promised 
it would resolve the unemployment problem, especially for young 
people. What is the youth unemployment picture today?
<P>
	I heard my hon. colleague from Newfoundland mention earlier 
that, in his province, the rate of unemployment among young 
people under the age of 24  was 28 per cent, as compared to a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="301"> 301 </A></B>
<P>
national rate of 17.2 per cent, as of January 1996, or about two 
tenths of one per cent less than when the Liberals came to power. 
We might as well say there was no change. At first glance, statistics 
do not appear to be any worse, but that is only at first glance 
because, when you take a closer look, you realize that, in many 
provinces, in almost all-three out of four-maritime provinces 
and especially in Quebec, the number of young people between the 
ages of 15 and 24 who are on welfare has increased.
<P>
	Statistics vary from province to province, but according to 
Statistics Canada, there are currently 143,000 young Quebecers 
under 30 on UI rolls, that is to say, who are receiving UI benefits. 
But what Statistics Canada data do not say is that, in the same age 
group, there are 52,000 Quebecers on welfare. And these figures do 
not include young people who are still living with their parents, 
perhaps because their parents' level of income is moderately high. 
But they are nonetheless jobless, out of school and living in their 
parents' basement-this is more and more common-while 
looking for work. Yet, because of their parents' income or their 
own previous income, they do not qualify for UI benefits or 
welfare. They are not included in the statistics because they are not 
on the labour market. Statistics are very dangerous things.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	What did the government say in its throne speech to remedy this 
situation? It too saw that its Youth Strategy had failed, so it told us 
``Now, we will ask business, big business in particular, to do its part 
and to try to do something especially for youth in future.'' As we 
know, big businesses are more likely to be unionized. The hiring 
standards in those big businesses would have to be changed if 
young people were to have any chance of being hired without 
seniority.
<P>
	And what is the situation in our big businesses? On March 4 
Michel Vastel reported that the five biggest banks in the country 
managed to make record profits of $4.9 billion in 1995 with 2,800 
layoffs. GM Canada recorded a $1.4 billion profit while 
terminating 2,500 employees. Bell Canada made $502 million 
while doing away with 3,200 positions. Is this making employment 
opportunities available for young people? Even if all of these are 
unionized employers and if jobs were created up to the previous 
level, not one more young person would be hired. Far from it, the 
ones hired would be the people on the union call-back lists, so this 
does nothing to solve the problem of our young people.
<P>
	Small businesses do what they can, but they too cannot create 
jobs when times are very hard for them as well.
<P>
	Following along somewhat with what the hon. member for 
Gaspé has said, I say that the government will not help our youth by 
reducing access to unemployment insurance. They will not be 
helped by what is proposed in bill C-111, which triples the 
minimum number of hours  worked, from 300 to 900, for new 
unemployment insurance recipients. That is not how our young 
people will be helped. Nor by deducting from them as soon as they 
start working, whereas in the past they had to work 15 hours before 
deductions were taken. Of course, they can get the overpayment 
back when they file their income tax, but they will in a way be 
lending money to the government for a year.
<P>
	Neither will they be helped by cutting back on transfer payments 
to the provinces for post secondary education.
<P>
	In this second portion of my speech, I will restrict myself to 
discussing a situation more specific to my riding. Even if the 
federal riding of Lévis is below provincial unemployment levels, 
less than 10 per cent last year, the two manpower offices in my area 
paid out $122,138,000 to UI claimants. With the planned cuts, 
which will be on the order of 12 per cent, as we all know, 
$14,656,000 will be lost to the economy. As regards the former 
workers at MIL Davie alone, it has been estimated that for the 435 
UI claimants who return periodically, after the reform takes effect, 
the cut would be $1,400,000. Is this how we help the economy? I do 
not think so.
<P>
	Some might think there were no federal officials in the Quebec 
City region. In my riding of Lévis alone, 600 people work for the 
federal public service. What did we do last year in the Quebec City 
region? The federal government cut 950 jobs. Did it help the 
economy in the Quebec City region or in the riding of Lévis? No.
<P>
	Worse than that, to add insult to injury, they announced recently 
the closure of the Department of Human Resources' information 
centre, which served people receiving old age pensions and 
unemployment insurance in Quebec City. Where was it 
transferred? Not where it could be amalgamated with another, but, 
rather, to the riding of the Prime Minister, in the city of 
Shawinigan. This, on top of the closing of the regional manpower 
centre in Trois-Rivières last year. Where was it transferred with its 
108 employees or maybe slightly fewer, because some positions 
were cut along the way? To the Prime Minister's riding.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	People always say it pays to have a Prime Minister in your 
riding, but when they take things that belong to a riding and move 
them to the Prime Minister's riding, this is not creating jobs for 
some, it is deleting jobs for others. This is not normal.
<P>
	The famous speech from the throne and the red book talked of 
funds for defence industry conversion, but none of it went to MIL 
Davie. There was talk of a ferry, but we still have no ferry. The 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who had 
promised one to his constituents, does not dare return to the 
Magdalen 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="302"> 302 </A></B>
<P>
Islands, because his constituents wrote in the  papers: ``Do not 
come back until the ferry has been replaced''.
<P>
	The situation is worse for the marine industry around Quebec 
City. There was talk of cuts, but people objected so much they 
decided to wait. They talked of increasing coast guard fees and 
reducing services: four icebreakers instead of five. That would 
have cut another 50 jobs. But they also wanted to increase fees. It 
would have had an impact if implemented, and yet, they are still 
threatening to implement it, 80 cents a tonne more, which would 
mean that the ship owners will change routes. They will use the 
port of Halifax and especially American ports.
<P>
	Is this sea traffic policy? Is this merchant marine policy? No it is 
quite the opposite. The aim is to get ships out of the St. Lawrence 
and send them to the United States. This is a long way from what 
the Liberals promised in their red book.
<P>
	They talked about the CN. They privatized it, but did nothing to 
help the SLRs. The bill is still on the table and there is nothing in it 
for the SLRs. The former Minister of Canadian Heritage 
announced two days before his demotion-I will close on this 
because it is very symbolic-finally acknowledged that the old 
Quebec City bridge was a national heritage construction. It has to 
be more than a symbol; there has to be money involved, because 
the Quebec City bridge is coming to symbolize the decrepitude of 
Canadian federalism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of 
all, I must commend my hon. colleague for the profile he has 
presented of his region and his riding.
<P>
	I must say that the picture he has painted is exactly the same 
wherever you go in Quebec. Our regions are emptying, our ridings 
are plagued by unemployment. In Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, we 
have remained unbeaten for years in terms of unemployment in 
Canada. Our people do not deserve this. Absolutely not. This 
government-and my hon. colleague alluded to this-is kissing an 
entire generation of young people goodbye. It is sacrificing that 
whole generation. They are without jobs.
<P>
	However much the government boasts about its infrastructure 
program-government programs are useless anyway-the fact 
remains that no real job creation has taken place, only very 
temporary work was created. No progress has been made in 
bringing the unemployment rate down in even one region of 
Quebec. One thing is clear to us in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean: we 
may not get support from the federal government-and we are not 
talking about billions of dollars here-but we know how to 
innovate.
<P>
	Consider the following example. The local ALCAN employees 
union brought the plants in Jonquière, Laterrière and Alma together 
through a work sharing arrangement. With no big grants or major 
outlay of money on the part of our governments, it succeeded in  
creating 120 direct jobs- you can imagine what this will mean in 
terms of indirect benefits down the road. It merely cost $10,000 per 
job created. That is what I call a job well done. That is what 
innovating is all about.
<P>
	Compared to the millions of dollars sunk here and there 
sometimes just to maintain a few jobs, not even creating 
any-millions, if not billions, are spent here without much 
success-these workers who assumed responsibility for 
themselves managed to create jobs for just $10,000 per job. Why 
could the government not be as innovative as them?
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I think that innovation involves job training, and that is what my 
question to my hon. colleague is about. He did not get a chance to 
elaborate on the subject of job training, and I am convinced that he 
was all set to do so, but ran out of time.
<P>
	I would like him to share his thoughts about job training in 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, our traditional position, Quebec's 
traditional position on job training, the one that was taken by all 
parties and all members in the Quebec National Assembly, is that 
the funds now allocated to job training by the federal government 
should be transferred to Quebec so that it can take on full 
responsibility.
<P>
	Among the topics I have not covered, there is one area I would 
like to address in the minute I have left. Some people may feel it is 
only in the Gaspé region and the maritimes that the UI bill will 
have a noticeable impact. I would like to point out that, according 
to the figures of the Department of Human Resources 
Development, agriculture will be cut by 12 per cent as a result of 
the reform. Forestry will be cut by 14 per cent, manufacturing and 
construction by 9 per cent, transport by 8 per cent, the hospitality 
industry by 8 per cent, government and other services by 7 per cent, 
trade and real estate by 6 per cent, education by 4 per cent, and 
health care by 3 per cent.
<P>
	This is in addition to the cutbacks that the provincial 
governments will have to impose, again as a result of the even 
deeper cuts that the Minister of Finance will probably announce 
tomorrow.
<P>
	Everybody loses in this reform. What is the government waiting 
for to set this bill aside and start over with a new, real one?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would first 
like to say that I am sharing my time with the member for Durham. 
I also would like to congratulate you on attaining your new position 
in the chair. I look forward to working with you over the next 
couple of years. Congratulations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="303"> 303 </A></B>
<P>
	The throne speech to open the second session of the 35th 
Parliament is a basic statement of Canadian values, along with a 
blueprint that recognizes how we must form partnerships and 
organize for the future.
<P>
	We know that government cannot isolate itself from the people it 
serves. We cannot as a government work in a vacuum. However, 
what we can and must do is establish a framework from which 
partnerships can develop and prosper. Partnerships with Canadians 
and the numerous groups and organizations representative of all 
walks of life are very important to recognize those divergent values 
and ideals.
<P>
	In part, the throne speech indicated the government's 
commitment to the economic renewal of rural Canada in a way that 
is tailored to the needs of rural Canada. In particular, my area of 
Essex-Kent is very happy about that.
<P>
	For those who reside in my constituency and for all Canadians 
living in small urban and rural communities that dot our map the 
government is continuing its efforts in recognizing the needs of 
rural Canada. This type of commitment will help ensure that rural 
Canadians are able to participate fully in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	This statement for the future builds on initiatives commenced 
over the last two years, initiatives such as the rural secretariat 
within the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food. This 
secretariat, first established in 1994, is developing partnerships 
within government agencies such as Industry Canada and the Farm 
Credit Corporation to help access government services and 
programs.
<P>
	The Canadian rural information service, a secretariat and 
Agriculture Canada partnership, has become a clearing house for 
rural information and responds to rural Canadians' requests for 
services they need. The initiatives reach out to all of us.
<P>
	The throne speech spoke of expanding access to the School Net 
and community access programs to increase technology use in rural 
Canada. It provides opportunities for our most valuable resource, 
our country's youth, for youth development, youth opportunities, 
youth jobs, regardless of where young people live. There are some 
examples of the partnerships in which we will engage to ensure 
future prosperity of all regions. In rural Canada we have already 
seen the benefits of the partnerships between the government and 
its citizens. We look forward to increasing such initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The last federal budget announced an adaptation and rural 
development fund, called ARDF. The estimated $60 million annual 
budget in ARDF will assist farmers in their desire to diversify their 
operations, become more profitable and develop new markets.
<P>
	In Ontario, ARDF is being viewed as an opportunity to help the 
agriculture sector adapt itself to a rapidly changing environment.
<P>
	The commitment of the government as outlined in the throne 
speech to rural Canadians is not merely lip service but a very 
reasonable approach to building our nation. Building on current 
initiatives, it is anticipated that the rural secretariat will play a lead 
role in developing partnerships with federal agencies, with 
provinces and with rural stakeholders.
<P>
	This commitment is also a recognition that rural development is 
not limited to the agriculture and the agri-food sector. Today's 
technology applications, and its unknown limits of tomorrow, 
require us to ensure access to new information infrastructures so 
that rural Canadians have the tools to create jobs and generate 
growth opportunities.
<P>
	The government also remains committed to rationalizing federal 
services. The throne speech referenced our interest in developing a 
national food inspection service that would combine various food 
inspection branches both as a cost savings and a service 
improvement. Federally, food inspection is undertaken by the 
ministries of agriculture, health and fisheries and oceans.
<P>
	Food inspection is a shared responsibility. Therefore we are 
anxious to explore ways in which partnerships can be arranged with 
the provinces so that we can move forward and create a truly 
national food inspection service. Inspection at the primary and 
processed food protection levels will serve two purposes. It ensures 
Canadian consumers purchase quality products that are without 
doubt among the best products in the world. It will also provide 
uniform standards for all of us.
<P>
	Recently the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food met with his 
provincial counterparts where all expressed a keen interest to move 
forward in these initiatives. Last year the minister consulted with 
Canadians, producers and the industry on these initiatives. It is in 
partnership with all stakeholders that we will be able to redesign 
our system, streamline the inspection process, improve efficiencies 
and become cost efficient. Our real competitive edge for the future 
will result in these types of partnerships.
<P>
	The government, from the beginning of its mandate, has 
recognized that governments do not create jobs, rather employers 
create private sector jobs with the vast majority of new jobs being 
created by small and medium size business. For our part the 
government must create an economic climate necessary for 
businesses to flourish.
<P>
	A cornerstone of our economic program is the reduction of the 
deficit. It is not the slash and burn deficit reduction technique that 
many people have witnessed in this country. It is a process that 
makes the transition safe and reasonable for all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="304"> 304 </A></B>
<P>
	Our approach, and the Minister of Finance has stood fast in his 
commitment to this, has been to set reasonable short term targets, 
establish goals that while they challenge our initiative, do not 
break the economic backs of public and private sector partners, 
and deliver a balanced and reasonable approach to the divergent 
needs of economic development and fiscal restraint.
<P>
	We remain committed to reducing the deficit to 2 per cent of 
Canada's gross domestic product by 1997-98. When we achieve 
this goal we will have reduced the deficit as a portion of our 
economy by two-thirds, the most successful deficit reduction in the 
history of Canada. This achievement will be good for all 
Canadians. It will mean we have brought our spending out of that 
spiral of continual upward movement into a reasonable form that 
Canadians can handle.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In terms of business investment, the private sector will respond 
positively to the deficit reduction program. By continuing to bring 
our country's financial house in order, we will create the economic 
stability that will encourage consumer and investor confidence to 
increase.
<P>
	At the same time, it is necessary for the government to foster a 
relationship both with the private sector and our provincial 
counterparts so we can collectively invest in economic growth and 
job creation. The throne speech reflects that partnership, giving 
young people an opportunity to put education and enthusiasm to 
work and gain valuable job experience. Co-sponsoring with 
business and labour, new initiatives put young people to work.
<P>
	Every effort has been made for the government to reach out to 
every sector of the community and identify partnerships that will 
be positive for our nation. As I indicated in my opening comments 
and reiterate now with my last few words, the throne speech has set 
the stage for Canadian governance in co-operation with all of us.
<P>
	We can see, as certain initiatives have developed, how it is 
possible for partnerships to be successful. From history we have 
learned that governments cannot and must not proceed on their own 
without the co-operation of all Canadians.
<P>
	In the coming months and years, as more partnership initiatives 
are introduced and implemented, I am sure we will as a nation reap 
the benefits of the positive course of action set by the throne 
speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague across the way did not interpret the throne speech the 
way I did.
<P>
	I see this as a repetition of promises that have not been kept. 
There is nothing in his speech on how to make taxes more 
equitable, help the defence industry convert  to civilian 
applications, for example, and especially there is nothing on how to 
reduce overlap.
<P>
	What I remember most clearly from his speech is his statement 
that the federal government should develop partnerships with the 
provinces in order to create jobs. Yet, in the throne speech, his 
government continues to interfere in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction by recycling large portions of a watered down 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	The throne speech shows the government's tendency to bypass 
the provinces and yet the hon. member is asking us to develop 
partnerships with the provinces. How can the provinces do so when 
the federal government has demonstrated its intention to go over 
their heads in developing partnerships with municipalities and with 
various organizations either in mining or in forestry? I do not 
understand that kind of language.
<P>
	Sometimes they want to establish a relationship with the 
provinces but not at other times. What is my colleague's reaction in 
this matter? Does he think that the federal government should first 
develop partnerships with the provinces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Madam Speaker, I would suggest that all 
initiatives of the government have been to create positive 
co-operation between the provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	I do not question the initiatives that have been taken to create a 
positive relationship not just with the provinces but with all the 
stakeholders in the country. To illustrate this I might use this point. 
In the last two weeks the minister of agriculture has gone across the 
country to bring national leaders together in a forum. He had the 
national leaders put forward their concerns with agriculture. He 
had them look at the opportunities that could come from those 
difficulties and develop a creative plan under which we could put 
forward recommendations to overcome them.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	As he did this exercise two weeks ago, he did a similar exercise 
in six regions across the country, bringing in all the provincial 
leaders at the same time in the agriculture, agri-food and finance 
industries. He has gone out of his way in order to bring in all of 
those concerns and put them together so he can set federal direction 
in order to answer the problems we have in the agriculture and 
agri-food sector today; develop new markets, develop new 
opportunities, everyone moving in a direction on-side and 
supportive of each other.
<P>
	This type of action certainly is not mentioned by the opposition. 
It does not recognize the value of bringing all of these groups 
together, having one strong voice to make certain the agriculture 
and agri-food industries speak as a group in order to develop 
opportunities and a  business plan for the future. That business 
plan, which the minister is working on right now, shall be prepared 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="305"> 305 </A></B>
<P>
and ready hopefully by June but through the summer at the latest. 
We will then see how we can move together.
<P>
	The incorporation of industry, provincial governments and the 
federal government's viewpoint is critical. Again, it is not easy to 
have 13 areas of government all agree. It is a process that must be 
done very carefully and reasonably in time to make certain that all 
voices are heard and considered on a fair basis.
<P>
	My response is yes, there is a tremendous amount going on. We 
all should be very excited about those opportunities of bringing 
everyone together, getting rid of the overlap and trying to iron out 
the system. It cannot be done in one year. It has to be done carefully 
over a longer period of time, and that is the direction the 
government is taking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member from Essex-Kent very aptly leads into my dissertation 
about the speech from the throne. Basically my speech also deals 
with the prospect of the evolution of our federation.
<P>
	We talk a lot in the Chamber about devolution. I think that is an 
inaccurate word. Basically what we want to do with our federation 
is evolve it. We have been around for 127 years and it seems 
reasonable that we should enter into some changes within the 
federation to make it more economically viable.
<P>
	Canadians have historically refused to invest in themselves for a 
variety of reasons. The Canadian economy has been typified by 
foreign investment. Canadians have been reticent to invest in their 
own enterprises. As a consequence we have suffered as a country.
<P>
	Why have we been shy about this investment procedure? I do not 
really know. The bottom line is the speech from the throne did 
attempt to address that in some very real and meaningful ways. I 
refer to a specific aspect which talks about the formation of a 
national securities exchange. Securities legislation is basically the 
jurisdiction and purview of the provinces.
<P>
	Canada is the only industrialized country in the world that does 
not have a national securities exchange. What has this done? It has 
fractionalized our capital markets. It has prevented people from 
properly visualizing and assuming masses of capital for the 
investment of our own enterprises.
<P>
	The concept of a national securities commission would not 
override the jurisdictions of the provinces but would envelope 
them. Basically the concept is to provide a basic national securities 
exchange commission which would have a national regulatory 
environment. Basically what it talks about is harmonizing all the 
provincial regulatory procedures so that it is one. What is the 
problem today?
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	A mutual fund registered in Canada has to register with each 
individual securities commission throughout the country. It is a 
very expensive process and basically many people do not do that. A 
lot of these offerings are not available throughout the country. They 
are available only in certain jurisdictions.
<P>
	Another aspect occurring in Toronto, what is called the dealer's 
network, which is an over the counters market, is the strange 
evolution that we are having listings on that market which are 
basically extraterritorial. In other words, they are British Columbia 
listings, possibly Quebec listings, registering with the Toronto over 
the counters market.
<P>
	We have the strange situation in which Ontario's securities 
legislation is basically being applied to British Columbian 
companies. One can see this is creating a great deal of confusion 
and overlap.
<P>
	We often compare ourselves with the United States. I would like 
to make a quick comparison with Japan. In 1951 Canada and Japan 
had the same gross domestic product. That is a very interesting 
statement, especially because the Japanese economy by the year 
2000 will surpass the gross domestic product of the United States.
<P>
	That country has half the population of the United States and 
almost none of the natural resources. We must ask ourselves in 
Canada what we are doing and why we are falling behind the world. 
It is because of interprovincial bickering that prevents us from 
properly pooling some of our capital resources.
<P>
	If Bill Gates were a Canadian he would never get his company 
started here. Why? We do not have a pooling system and a risk 
taking orientation within our financial institutions. Because many 
of our start-up companies are looking for equity capital they are 
forced to go to the United States.
<P>
	They end up being taken over by Americans and we are back to 
where we started. We are on a treadmill of not being able to 
properly invest in our own companies mainly because of our own 
institutions.
<P>
	Because of the great fractionalization of our equity markets, 
many of our companies go wanting even where they get a listing on 
the over the counters exchange markets. There is a whole area there 
that causes a great amount of fees being charged. The legal 
bureaucracy and regulatory environment almost prevents small and 
medium size companies from accessing this.
<P>
	The history of many of these companies is they lost control when 
they tried to go through this process. The whole idea of a capital 
based system is to make it easy for small and medium size 
companies to access these markets.
<P>
	I was pleased to serve on the industry committee when we talked 
with some of our biggest banking institutions  about access to 
capital for small and medium size business. Again and again these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="306"> 306 </A></B>
<P>
bankers told us the problem with small business was not its access 
to debt capital but its access to equity capital. This was rather 
strange for a bunch of institutions that only recently took over most 
of those brokerage firms themselves.
<P>
	It is an interesting observation that the only bank which now 
loans to junior securities investment firms is the Toronto-Dominion 
Bank. Remarkably the Toronto-Dominion Bank is the only bank 
that does not have a securities arm. We can see there has been 
consolidation and economic concentration in the whole area of 
securities.
<P>
	What I am saying is those banks are also federally regulated. It 
seems a logical conclusion that our securities industry should also 
have a federal focus, a national focus. I doubt that many of our 
provinces are on side on this. The maritimes basically are very 
interested in pursuing this. Ontario is also very supportive of 
moving forward with the dealer's network.
<P>
	To give an idea of the over the counters market, which is part of 
that market in Toronto, it has zeroed in on small and medium size 
business. In 1993 it had tradings of over $10 billion. By 1994 it was 
up to $15 billion. By 1995 it was $17.5 billion worth of trading in 
small and medium size company stocks. This represents a 70 per 
cent increase in only three years. We can see there is a tremendous 
demand for this vehicle.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The over the counters market is still somewhat unsophisticated 
because of the capital markets we have. We are fractionalized. We 
are a very small market in the first place in Canada. We made it 
even smaller by dividing it many times over.
<P>
	We need a three tier system of access to these over the counters 
markets, a junior market in which everybody will know the risk 
involved and then basically tiered into the larger markets like the 
TSE. It will provide a cheap access to allow start-up companies to 
find capital in Canada rather than forcing them to go south of the 
border.
<P>
	I look forward to the initiatives of the government in this area 
and look forward to working once again with the provinces in 
creating a national securities commission in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Durham for his very 
excellent address.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to elaborate further on the three 
tier system. The access to capital for the nurturing and 
development of small business in Canada is extremely important. 
We need to know how to get those patents into technology, 
technology into  commercial development and production and into 
the marketplace.
<P>
	It is a complex process, a costly process. How can we accelerate 
the access to our financial institutions which are reluctant to 
participate in this process of development and get the 
encouragement from day one when research at our universities 
becomes part of a patented process and development progress into 
a product that is viable and marketable in society?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for her 
question.
<P>
	Basically one of the issues for small and medium size business is 
pooling. As we expand in the area of over the counters and junior 
markets in Canada it allows pension funds, banks and other 
financial institutions to pool relative securities. The whole object 
of the exercise is risk aversion.
<P>
	Many of our institutions do not want to see a high concentration 
possibly in a few companies but they are willing to look at a wider 
base of possible technology stocks that transcends a global 
environment in Canada and therefore would inject funds for that 
purpose.
<P>
	Once again, the object of the exercise of a more sophisticated 
securities market in Canada is to provide that area where 
businesses could pool similar stocks and then sell them to these 
financial institutions which could then more effectively participate 
in growing the Canadian economy and creating those new 
technologies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member.
<P>
	In talking about small and medium size business, it seems the 
whole focus from the government's eyes, the banks' eyes and form 
those who provide capital is very narrow to the extent that they 
seem to be most concerned with small and medium size business in 
technology, research and the development of new the technology 
sector of business.
<P>
	However, one of the big problems is what we would call the 
bread and butter basic business, retail business, wholesale 
business, people buying things and reselling them. There are 
hundreds of thousands of these businesses across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	It is truly that sector, those types of business that have the most 
problems securing capital to either start up, expand or improve 
their businesses. They are generally looked at by the banks as 
second and third class citizens when they come to the banks for a 
loan. They generally need to have $3 in their pocket for every $1 
they want to borrow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="307"> 307 </A></B>
<P>
	What does the government have in mind to tell the banking 
institutions that would encourage them to start paying attention 
to these more basic types of business of which there are hundreds 
of thousands in this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be dividing my 
time with the member for Regina-Lumsden.
<P>
	It has been just over a week since we all trooped off to the other 
place to be subjected to 20 minutes of vacuity, the exercise so aptly 
described by Ottawa <I>Sun</I> columnist Joe O'Donnell as the drone 
from the throne.
<P>
	I envied the handful of napping Liberal senators who took the 
opportunity to catch up on a little sleep. On my feet and pressed 
against that brass rail I did not have that option.
<P>
	The government came out swinging in this throne speech with a 
promise to double the number of federal summer jobs for students. 
There will not be a dandelion left standing on a single federal lawn 
from sea to sea to sea. If only this government would cease to suck 
the life out of our national economy, young people would be able to 
find real jobs instead of relying on this son of the Company of 
Young Canadians or whatever it is the government has in mind.
<P>
	The government then proposed to introduce another business 
subsidy boondoggle, this time for environmental technologies, 
biotechnology and the aerospace industry. Will this be a 
continuation of the de Havilland-Boeing-Bombardier saga? The 
word on the street is that there is $300 million in pork which will be 
available to those with the appropriate Liberal and Quebec 
connections.
<P>
	Within the throne speech there is one little paragraph on criminal 
justice. There is a reference to ``innovative alternatives to 
incarceration of low risk offenders''. I wonder if this means more 
experimental facilities like the Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge in my 
riding.
<P>
	The women currently living there have all committed very 
serious crimes. The most common sentence among them is life-10. 
The concept of gentle handling as a means of rehabilitating them 
may have some merit. I do not question that. However, do they 
have to be accommodated in facilities that are much finer than 
anything available to many of the law-abiding, hard working, tax 
paying farmers and ranchers in the surrounding area? Social 
injustice cuts both ways. In case anyone has forgotten, this country 
is broke.
<P>
	The capital cost of this penal Taj Mahal was $9 million, 
$300,000 per inmate at full capacity. The annual operating cost will 
be $86,000 per inmate if the place operates within its budget, which 
my sources tell me is highly unlikely. This year the cost per inmate 
will be astronomical because to date Correctional Services Canada 
has been able to find only 14 serious offenders  whom it believes 
can safely be kept in this open facility with 26 staff members on 
duty.
<P>
	Few people will mourn the closure of the old women's prison in 
Kingston, but surely there has to be a common sense middle ground 
where people can be treated humanely without ripping off the long 
suffering taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	On the day following the throne speech we heard the expanded 
version. We were treated to an hour by the Prime Minister who 
delivered the same message with a few rhetorical embellishments. 
He said that the government had broken the back of the deficit, 
which brings to mind a certain Mr. Trudeau's famous remark: ``We 
have wrestled inflation to the ground''. Remember that one?
<P>
	If cutting the deficit by a third is breaking its back, I am in 
desperate need of language lessons. If the Prime Minister had said 
the country is going down the drain more slowly than when the 
Tories were in power, that would have been an honest statement 
and I would have applauded wildly.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made one sensible comment in his speech 
when he said: ``Government does not create jobs. It creates the 
climate for the private sector to create jobs''. It is the epiphany, the 
Prime Minister's conversion on the road to the next election. Does 
this really mean that we can all look forward to an end to pork 
barrel politics, bloated regional development agencies and $6 
billion infrastructure programs that provide neither useful 
infrastructure nor long term jobs? If I could use another biblical 
reference, that would be equivalent to the second coming or 
perhaps the congelation of the inferno.
<P>
	The Prime Minister then went on to state that his government is 
prepared to withdraw from certain areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
He has obviously been doing some serious reading of the Reform 
policies. Out with the red book, in with the 20/20 program. My cup 
runneth over.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister would like a Reform Party membership, I 
would be more than happy to forward his $10 to our Calgary office. 
However, I am afraid his application would be refused since he still 
does not believe in nor even understands the concept of fiscal 
responsibility. He is apparently unconcerned that our national debt 
of $578,288,000,000 is growing by $1,036.26 each second of this 
day and that our per capita national debt at 7.46 a.m. was 
$19,439.56. That is unconscionable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, to the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, that was quite a speech.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="308"> 308 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to know what he thinks about entrepreneurship and 
if he has ever in his life looked at the history of the Bombardier 
company. Perhaps 40 years ago a French Canadian family from 
rural Quebec started a company in its garage from nothing. It 
repaired snowmobiles. It was building and looking to the future, 
employing young Quebecers, young Canadians.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not see Bombardier today as an 
international company which sells high speed rapid transit vehicles 
throughout the world? It is a success story not only for Quebec but 
for Canada. Does the hon. member not appreciate that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
intervention. Yes, Bombardier in its infancy as a company was an 
icon of Quebec and the rest of Canada and I was a great admirer of 
it. I will go along with her on that.
<P>
	However, it has since become a bottomless sinkhole, taking in 
hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants. There is no 
company on the face of the earth that could not survive, be 
profitable and prosper under circumstances like that. It is a national 
and international scandal.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia 
for allowing me to share his time and the House leader of the 
Reform Party who helped to make that arrangement.
<P>
	We have seen the speech from the throne. Most people in the 
House have indicated that the speech from the throne from this 
government is not worth the paper it has been written on. It talks 
about promises the Liberals have made in the past. It talks about 
the promises very clearly and about the Liberals breaking those 
very same promises. The promises from their 1993 red book were 
so good that they have offered them up one more time in the speech 
from the throne. They did not carry out the promises in the first 
place.
<P>
	The Liberals promised jobs, jobs, jobs and they delivered talk, 
talk, talk. There was no action with respect to the jobs they said 
they would create. They promised to build up Canada. They 
promised to strengthen our country. Instead, they have ripped apart 
this country from sea to sea with respect to the national unity issue.
<P>
	We have also seen a total abandonment of the government's 
responsibility to clearly hold as a priority the rights and interests of 
the citizens of this country in terms of their right to employment 
and other matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> You will be judged according to your friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> We hear the member for St. Boniface chirping 
from his seat. He is anxious to get into the debate. He wants to get 
in here and talk about this issue, and I hope he will.
<P>
	The Liberals promised they would create jobs. They promised 
they would reform social programs and unite Canada. Of course 
they have failed. There is talk about job creation and social reform 
in the speech but that is not what Canadians are getting.
<P>
	The federal government is actually doing less about jobs now 
than it was a year ago. Instead of a hand up for Canadians there is a 
handout which is shrinking on a daily basis. There is deficit 
reduction but it is neither balanced nor fair. National programs and 
national standards, which have been the glue that has held Canada 
together, are being wiped out rather than being improved.
<P>
	The Liberal members sit in their seats and say that what I have 
just said is nonsense. Let us talk about some of the things they have 
encouraged in terms of a situation-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This would seem a good time to interrupt. I do not 
want to stop you in full flight later on. You will have the floor when 
debate resumes.

	Once again enemies of peace in the Middle East have surfaced

vessel was immediately boarded by DFO officers and I was 
charged. Now six months later I have been quietly informed by the 
government that it will not be proceeding with the charges against 
me. They cannot make them stick. In allowing for a racially 
exclusive fishery, the minister has exceeded his authority and 
defied the B.C. Court of Appeal.
<P>
	However, the government will still have to defend its actions in 
court. Last fall I filed a statement of claim in the Supreme Court of 
British Columbia asking the court to declare that the minister acted 
improperly in excluding commercial fishermen from the native 
only fisheries. The government will not be able to avoid the issue; 
it will have to answer to the judge.

Robert Williams passed away following a brief illness at the age of

<P>
	Sir Robert Williams compiled an impressive list of community 
achievements over the past three decades. In addition to 
spearheading the Foundation of St. Leonard's House, which was 
the first home in North America devoted to prisoner rehabilitation, 
he was a founding member and later the chair of the Peel District 
Health Council. He was an active member of the Brampton Rotary 
Club, a director of Peel Community Services and chair of the 
United Way. In recognition of his outstanding achievements he was 
named Brampton's Citizen of the Year in 1981 and was the 
recipient of the Order of Canada.

French writer of international stature. Through her talent, 
Marguerite Duras helped French literature and culture remain one 
of the main foundations of contemporary humanism.
<P>
	She spent her life writing; she lived through and for writing. As 
the author of many books, she made a name for herself in several 
literary genres, such as stories, novels, plays and screen plays,

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on the issue of child support. Any reform to 
the child support or taxation system must be more than a half 
measure by ministers to placate special interests or to fudge broken 
government promises.
<P>
	The child support issue is not simply a woman's issue; it is a 
family issue. Child support must be family support. It must address 
the interests and concerns of children and both parents.
<P>
	How the tax is calculated or how child support payments are 
enforced will only make sense with a fair and just support 
settlement.
<P>
	Change is needed to remove the necessity of adversarial lawyers 
in a family court. Change is needed to bring federal and provincial 
jurisdictions together and change is needed to create fair guidelines 
and formulas.
<P>
	The policies of governments have contributed in a very real way 
to the breakdown of family units in Canada. In child support as in 
all government decisions, Reform believes that the well-being of 
families should be the priority.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a general agreement that Canada needs a public 
broadcasting system so that Canadians are able to see and hear each 
other. Twenty-five million Canadians tune into the CBC at least 
once a week.
<P>
	I also believe Canadians support the CBC's need for stable, 
multiyear funding. However the special tax proposed by the Juneau 
report is not the answer. Canadians are in no mood for any tax 
increases. A new tax for the CBC would unleash a storm of anger 
directed at the public broadcaster which is the last thing the CBC 
needs.
<P>
	Providing stable long term funding for the CBC should not be 
achieved by new taxes or manipulating the tax system. The solution 
is quite simple. The government should guarantee funding for 
five-year periods.
<P>
	This government promised in its red book: ``A Liberal 
government will be committed to stable multiyear financing for 
national cultural institutions such as the Canada Council and the 
CBC''. All it has to do is to live up to the political commitment it 
made to the Canadian people.

this International Women's Week we celebrate the contributions of 
women and renew our commitment to their equality.
<P>
	Today women make up 45 per cent of all workers but they also 
continue to do two-thirds of the unpaid work in Canada. In 1992 
Statistics Canada estimated the total value of all unpaid work at 
between $210 billion and $318 billion. In order to make sound 
public policy, we need to take this productive activity into account 
and we will begin to do this in May.
<P>
	For the first time ever, the national census will ask questions on 
unpaid work related to housework, child care and care of the 
elderly. In doing so, we are recognizing the tremendous 
contribution of women's unpaid work to Canadian society and the 
Canadian economy.

<P>
	Our Bloc colleagues, however, have devoted all their energy 
since their election to criticizing our strategy, without proposing 
any serious alternative. Now he is the premier of Quebec, the 
former leader of our official opposition surely has a better 
understanding of the dilemma of preserving social programs while 
putting one's financial house in order.

<P>
	Canadians know that the Prime Minister promised to eliminate 
the GST. He did not promise to fudge the GST, to hide it or to 
sugarcoat it; he promised to eliminate it. What part of the word 
eliminate do the Liberals not understand?
<P>
	Canadians and especially the voters of Etobicoke North will not 
be tricked by the same old Mulroney tax under a new name and a 
new cover. This issue may make the hon. minister and his Grit gang 
afraid of the voters, but we are not. Etobicoke North, say no to the 
supertax: vote Reform.

	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> The Academy of Canadian 
Cinema and Television recently celebrated its finest achievements 
in creating programs in the English language for broadcast during 
the past year. For the past 10 years the Gemini awards have 
honoured all aspects of television production in Canada 
recognizing over 55 categories of achievement annually. The 
Geminis offer a fitting tribute to the vitality, energy and creativity 
of Canada's cultural community.
<P>
	I would like to offer congratulations to the nominees and winners 
of this year's Geminis. Compelling, humorous, or informative 
programs, such as ``Due South'', ``Million Dollar Babies'', ``The 
Fifth Estate'' and ``This Hour Has 22 Minutes'' captured our 
imaginations and well deserved the recognition they received. The 
standards they set are an example of the exceptional work 
Canadians produce.
<P>
	Canadian programming is now seen in every part of the world, a 
result of the hard work and talent of our own creators and 
craftspeople. It is also due in part to support from the people of 
Canada through the various programs and policies which exist to 
keep our cultural life vibrant and meaningful to all Canadians.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Huntington's disease invades the body of one in every 
1,000 Canadians in the prime of their life. Over its 10 to 25-year 
course, Huntington's leads to incapacitation and eventual death. 
There is no known cure and no effective treatment to date.
<P>
	In 1993 scientists found the gene that causes Huntington's 
disease. Every child who has a parent with Huntington's has a 50 
per cent chance of developing the disease.
<P>
	Many know that May is Huntington's awareness month. In order 
to help local chapters in my riding spread their message, I am 
declaring May 19 to 26 Huntington's Awareness Week in 
Cumberland-Colchester. It is my hope that this initiative will help 
to heighten the local awareness and generate greater local support 
for research programs and education. With increased support for 
this dreadful disease, we can find a cure.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in response to questioning yesterday on the government's 
intentions in the area of securities, the secretary of state for 
international financial institutions said that, in his opinion, the 
federal government would look after securities more effectively 
than the provinces.
<P>
	In his letter to the President of the Privy Council of February 16, 
1994, the former premier of Quebec, Daniel Johnson, said that 
federal regulation would be inappropriate and would lead to 
duplication of monitoring rules and inevitably to heavier 
administrative loads for issuers, investors and intermediaries.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance or the secretary of 
state. On what basis can the government seriously state that it 
would be more effective in the area of securities than the provinces 
have been up to now, when this area of jurisdiction is solely theirs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
should realize that there are a large number of securities regulators 
in this country. Let us say there are 10 and let us say that two of 
them got together and asked the federal government to handle the 
securities. That would leave eight. In my arithmetic, eight is less 
than ten.  I do not know whether the hon. member is using some 
form of octal calculating but eight is less than ten, six is less than 
ten and anything is less than ten if the federal government gets 
involved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, arrogance never got anyone very far.
<P>
	The throne speech indicated that the federal government would 
not intervene in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction without 
the consent of the majority of the provinces. Is there anyone in the 
government who can tell me whether it might finally admit that its 
proposed approach, particularly in the area of financial institutions 
and in other areas, as indicated in the throne speech, will inevitably 
lead to Quebec's isolation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. The 
only question that comes up is that the proposal was there to 
improve the efficiency of Canadian capital markets to make it 
easier for business to issue securities and to make it easier for 
Canadian companies to be competitive.
<P>
	If the hon. member is not interested in those matters, fine, but 
maybe the rest of the Canadian provinces are interested. We are 
putting the proposal up. If they want to opt out, they can opt out. 
There is no compulsory matter here whatsoever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the government admit that the establishment of a 
federal securities commission will amount to putting the Quebec 
securities sector in a sort of trusteeship, despite the opposition of 
all interested parties in Quebec, including federalist Quebecers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this particular 
instance the Canadian business community and the commission 
chair in Ontario for example have said that this is a positive 
proposal. This is a proposal that would create jobs in Canada, that 
would help Canadian business become competitive, that would 
help Canadian business raise capital.
<P>
	It seems that the opposition party is not interested in creating 
jobs in Quebec. It is not interested in making Quebec's businesses 
more competitive. If that is the case, fine, but we are interested. 
This government is interested in allowing the provinces to come 
together with us to make a Canadian securities commission.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in his February 16, 1994 letter to the then President of the 
Privy Council, former Quebec premier Daniel Johnson wrote, and I 
quote: ``The Government of Quebec has never been in favour of a 
greater federal role in the securities industry, which is an area of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. On the contrary, it has regularly 
expressed its opposition to federal initiatives in this area''.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance, since the secretary of 
state is not taking this seriously. Can the minister, who knows 
Quebec well, deny that the establishment of a federal securities 
commission would go against Quebec's position and marginalize 
the Quebec institutions working in this area, while reducing their 
ability to intervene?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should know that, on the one hand, the federal 
government is in the process of responding to the requests made by 
several provinces and, on the other hand, to the business 
community across Canada, including Quebec, which is calling for 
rationalization.
<P>
	Why should a Quebec company have to send prospectuses to 10 
provinces, when it could limit its mailings to two entities if there 
were a federal agency and its Quebec counterpart?
<P>
	We want to put Quebec companies in a position to seek capital as 
efficiently as possible. A federal commission would help, as the 
Quebec business community knows full well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see that even the Minister of Finance does not know 
what he is talking about. He should ask the current Minister of 
Immigration who, when the letter was sent to the President of the 
Privy Council, was in Mr. Johnson's cabinet. She shared Mr. 
Johnson's opinion that the federal government should not interfere 
in the securities industry, an area that comes under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Quebec government.
<P>
	Again, I ask the Minister of Finance, who normally gives me 
serious answers, a question that is as serious as the first one, in the 
hope that he will give me a straight answer this time around.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that this new intervention in an area of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction could have a negative impact on 
securities operations in Quebec by fostering a gradual transfer of 
these operations, including those of the Montreal Stock Exchange, 
from Montreal to Toronto?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
once again, the Bloc Quebecois has been  overtaken by events. 
They should know, as the Montreal Stock Exchange members and 
the business community in Montreal and throughout Quebec know 
full well, that competition now comes not only from Toronto, 
Calgary and Vancouver but also from Chicago, London, New York 
and Philadelphia.
<P>
	If we want the Canadian business community, in Quebec and the 
other provinces, to be able to compete with the Americans, the 
British, the Europeans and the Japanese, we must strengthen our 
position. This is what we are doing. Creating a federal securities 
commission in co-operation with the Montreal Stock Exchange and 
the Quebec people will make us stronger.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There has never been a better example of the extent to which the 
Bloc Quebecois exists in the 1950s, perhaps the 1960s if it is lucky. 
The world has changed. Quebecers are no longer in competition 
with Ontarians. They are in competition with the Americans, the 
Brits and the Japanese.
<P>
	What we want to do is give this country the best foundation 
possible, and that is what is happening here.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the House prepares to receive the federal budget, I want 
to examine the Prime Minister's assertion that the federal 
government has broken the back of the deficit.
<P>
	If such a statement came from a government that had balanced 
its budget it might be credible. However, when it comes from the 
head of an enterprise that has run 25 consecutive deficits, has not 
had a budget surplus in a quarter of a century and is currently 
spending $30 billion more per year than it takes in, such a 
statement is unbelievable and exposes the government and the 
House to ridicule.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	The only back the government has broken is the back of the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	To the finance minister, if the government has broken the back of 
the deficit, how soon we can expect a reward for that 
accomplishment, namely tax relief for overtaxed Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we took office the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 6 per 
cent. Last year we brought it down to 5 per cent. This year we will 
be announcing 4 per cent or better. Next year we will hit our target 
of 3 per cent, and we have already set a target of 2 per cent. Six, 
five, four, three, two-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="314"> 314 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, we would very 
much on this side of the House like to reduce taxes but we have 
to deal with the hand we were dealt.
<P>
	We will eliminate the deficit. At the same time, we will protect 
the basic social programs of the country. We would like to reduce 
taxes but we will preserve the social programs because that is the 
higher priority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the treasury could have a dollar for every excuse like the 
one given for not balancing the budget, the deficit could be 
eliminated.
<P>
	Eight out of eleven senior governments in the country are 
committed to eliminating their deficits, not just reducing them, and 
are much further down that road than the federal government. As 
the provinces get closer to balancing their budgets, they fear that a 
fiscally irresponsible federal government will move into the tax 
room they have vacated.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister today assure the provinces the federal 
government will not undermine the positive effects of provincial 
tax decreases by federal tax increases?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
time after time the leader of the Reform Party sets up straw people 
he likes to knock down.
<P>
	We met with the finance ministers of the provinces. At that 
meeting we agreed we had a common objective. We agreed as well 
that as we work to that common objective it made no sense for any 
government to fill in room left by any other government.
<P>
	Around the table of the federal government and the provincial 
finance ministers there is an extraordinary amount of co-operation 
toward that ultimate goal. It does not make any sense for the leader 
of the Reform Party to try to get in the way, stir up the waters and 
cause problems where none exist. Why does he not try to help the 
country work together? That is what we are doing with the 
provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this month in the province of Alberta the government and 
the public are beginning a very positive and constructive budget 
debate.
<P>
	It is a debate that cuts across party lines. It offers something to 
consumers, to business people, to the users of social services, to 
taxpayers. It is a debate on whether to apply a government surplus, 
something this House has not heard much about, to debt reduction, 
to social service investment or to tax relief.
<P>
	When can Canadians expect the House of Commons to debate a 
budget surplus? Does the government foresee such a debate being 
possible in this millennium, the next millennium or the one after 
that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
takes two to debate. The government has nailed its colours to the 
mast.
<P>
	Before Christmas there was a debate in the House on what the 
members of the opposition and the rest of the members felt should 
be in the forthcoming budget.
<P>
	The Reform Party was notable for its absence, its lack of 
thought, its lack of ideas and for its lack of understanding the 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	We are prepared to debate the issue. The question is where was 
the Reform Party when we had the debate before Christmas? 
Where is the budget the Reform Party promised it would bring 
down before our budget?

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, whom I 
congratulate on her appointment.
<P>
	According to former deputy minister Roger Tassé, who was in 
charge of investigating the deportation services at Citizenship and 
Immigration, certain Canadian officials were reported as having 
offered bribes to foreign authorities for letting their own nationals 
back in.
<P>
	In light of the fact that former deputy minister Tassé was clearly 
referring to accommodation fees, commonly called bribes, and that 
these fees were even reimbursed by her department, how can the 
minister seriously say that she does not have sufficient cause to 
open an inquiry? What more does she need?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing is for sure: every 
Citizenship and Immigration employee is expected to abide by 
existing legislation, including our own Immigration Act, and to 
follow a code of conduct.
<P>
	When irregularities occurred in the past, the deputy minister 
asked Mr. Tassé to determine whether any illicit act had been 
committed by department employees and report back; hence the 
Tassé report.
<P>
	Mr. Tassé himself concluded that there was no evidence of 
illegality. And I should point out that nowhere in his report does 
Mr. Tassé talk about immigration staff giving bribes. This minister 
would not stand for that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
president of the Canada Employment and Immigration Union 
himself confirmed that bribes were offered.

<P>
	Could the minister tell us if she intends to call an inquiry into 
this and could she give us the assurance that, henceforth, her 
department will not spend another penny on bribes offered by 
government officials?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the hon. 
member for Bourassa read the Tassé report before reading certain 
press reports.
<P>
	I did so myself; I read the report. And this report clearly states 
that participants were informed that they were welcome to come 
forward with any evidence of illicit acts contravening our 
legislation and that it would be brought to the attention of the 
authorities concerned. Not one came forward with any such 
evidence.
<P>
	Before making accusations against Citizenship and Immigration 
officials, the hon. member for Bourassa should check the facts.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Americans 
are flexing their muscles not only with respect to Cuba but also on 
Canada's west coast. As a consequence of Brian Tobin's ill advised 
and unsuccessful 1994 fish war with the U.S., the American 
Congress has found B.C.'s inside passage to be an international 
waterway.
<P>
	Why has the government failed to protect Canada's sovereignty 
on this internal Canadian waterway?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is not new. This has happened before. To bring the 
House up to speed, the U.S. has complained that we have applied 
the transit fees of two years ago inappropriately and not in 
accordance with international law.
<P>
	In January we sent a note to the United States indicating that it is 
reasonable to use these terms and options in inland waters. The 
waters under question include the inland waters of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	The fees are quite appropriately charged in inland waters. The 
right of innocent passage, which really is at issue here, applies only 
to the territorial sea.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue 
warrants more than a diplomatic note. In its fisheries act of 1995 
the U.S. Congress mandated that ``the president should ensure that 
the U.S. coast guard has available adequate resources to provide for 
the enforcement of United States law and to keep peace among 
vessels operating in disputed waters''.
<P>

said in this House yesterday, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

``We particularly wanted to assure that the mother of the deceased 
was comfortable in knowing that the armed forces had dealt with 
the matter in the most appropriate of ways''.

	But, far from being convinced that it was a suicide, the mother 
said to the media yesterday: ``With all those things going on in the 
Armed Forces, my son knew to much and they prevented him from 
talking''.
<P>
	Since the mother of Jonathan Brunet has bluntly refuted what the 
Minister said in this House yesterday, does the Minister intend to 
clarify the matter once and for all. Yes or No?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

conclusion that the unfortunate death of this soldier was suicide, as 
did the coroner's office in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	He may not accept what goes on in the armed forces but he is 
actually criticizing not only the armed forces but the coroner's

abolish the GST.
<P>
	Let me quote the fisheries minister in the House of Commons on 
February 11, 1993: ``Our alternative to the GST is that we are not 
going to have one. We are not going to have a tax that burns the 
individuals and the small businesses which then go broke because 
they cannot afford the people and computers to do it''.
<P>
	My question to the finance minister is when will he uphold the 
promise of his fisheries minister, his caucus and his own promise 
when he said he would abolish the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party is running out of questions; this is about the third 
time in the last four days.
<P>
	In case the hon. member has difficulty finding it on page 22: ``A 
Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that 
generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small 
business, minimizes disruption to small business and promotes 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization''. That is 
what we will do.

the minister not think that such comments by the Prime Minister 
remove all credibility from Canada's efforts at negotiation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> I think not, Mr. Speaker. The American senate, the American 
house are determined to pass this bill. The president has decided he 
is going to sign it. It is largely out of the unfortunate incident that 
occurred of the planes being shot down by the Cuban authorities. 
We condemned this incident and were one of the first countries to 
do so.
<P>
	However, some discretion is being left with the president. This 
morning I consulted with ambassadors from a number of countries. 
Further I will be consulting  with the business community. We 
<P>

intend to follow this through. The president has some discretion 
with respect to this matter.
<P>
	We think this bill is a dangerous precedent. We hope he will use 
that discretion to make sure that Canada and other third parties in 
this dispute are not affected by the United States' desire to get at 
Cuba.

	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we on 
this side of the House are very concerned about the deficit.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Minister of Finance if he will meet his 
deficit target for this year and how far into his contingency fund 
will he have to go to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we will hit our target. There is no doubt about that.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	We may do better than our targets. However it is the 
government's policy that if there is bad news to say it right away, if 
there is good news to wait until it is in the bank.
<P>
	Therefore we will not be releasing a projection apart from the 
fact that we will probably do better than the $32.7 billion. We will 
not be releasing a projection or going any further in the budget 
tomorrow.
<P>
	As far as the contingency reserve is concerned I think we should 
be very clear on this. It is exactly what is said. It is a contingency 
reserve for the unexpected. If it is not required it will not be spent. 
It will go directly to the bottom line and reduce the deficit.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister and the agriculture minister say they favour 
allowing farmers their freedom to market their wheat and barley 
outside the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Recently a wheat board commissioned study was released 
claiming it cost less than five cents per bushel to run the board. 
Today in Edmonton the Carter study was released showing board 
operation costs are much higher, up to 10 times higher.
<P>
	A plebiscite in Alberta and a survey in Saskatchewan show that a 
majority of farmers favour freedom to sell their wheat and barley 
abroad. With this new evidence, will the minister stay true to his 
promise and allow western grain farmers a direct voice through a 
plebiscite?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have noted 
that the Alberta government set up a  committee to examine the 
marketing structure in the west. They produced the report today at 
noon. It was not a written report. It was a news conference where 
the committee did not give the federal government any information 
about what it had looked at and what it had studied.
<P>
	We presently do not have written information. We only have a 
news conference. It is very difficult to respond at this time when we 
do not have the information that has been put forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
certainly the parliamentary secretary should place as much 
credence in the Alberta study as in the wheat board study.
<P>
	Farmers know their business, making decisions involving 
thousands, indeed millions of dollars, projecting years into the 
future. Will the minister call the promised plebiscite and allow 
farmers to make their own grain marketing decisions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for the question.
<P>
	The minister has looked at this very carefully. At this time he is 
having round table discussions with people right across the 
country. He is trying to look at that problem with industry, 
government and all people in the area combined to come up with a 
reasonable suggestion. The minister is looking at this and will 
report back to the House when he has plans in place.

<P>
	In the finance committee report on pre-budget consultations, 
published in January, the liberal majority recommends that the tax 
on gasoline be raised. For weeks now, millions of taxpayers have 
been writing to let us know that they are opposed to any increase in 
that tax.
<P>

to pull $5.2 billion out of the pockets of road users?

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	In the 1960s the province of Newfoundland was refused the right 
to build power lines through Quebec to transfer power to New 
England. Newfoundland is now forced to sell its power to Quebec 
at 1969 prices, costing Newfoundland $800 million a year. This 
amounts to an interprovincial trade barrier, something the Liberal 
red book claims the government will eliminate.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry believe that the people of Labrador 
should be able to enjoy the benefits of the free flow of trade?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. Perhaps the 
hon. member is not aware that chapter 9 is being worked on dealing 
with energy in relation to the internal trade issue. Discussions are 
continuing relating to electrical power between the provinces of 
Newfoundland and Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
mess at Churchill Falls was created in part by the federal 
government. It could be fixed by the federal government because it 
has the constitutional authority to challenge interprovincial trade 
barriers.
<P>
	The Reform Party is willing to support the federal government in 
a court challenge to ensure free trade. Will the minister tell the 
House and the people of Labrador whether or not she is willing to 
stand up for their rights and move now to fix the mess that is 
happening at Churchill Falls?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his support and the 
support of his party.
<P>
	Let me reassure the hon. member. As I said before we are 
working in partnership with the provinces of Quebec and 
Newfoundland. We will continue to do so.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. Over 94,000 Quebecers signed a 
petition asking the federal government to grant a broadcasting 
licence to Quebec Telephone, which would enable the company to 
remain competitive in the communications field. Although 
foreign-owned, Quebec Telephone, the corporate culture of which 
is francophone, is crucial to Quebec's economic development.
<P>
	Does the heritage minister intend to take the necessary steps to 
make sure that Quebec Telephone is granted a broadcasting 
licence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member opposite for taking the initiative of calling a meeting. 
Obviously, Quebec Telephone's wishes are similar to BC Tel's; 
these two companies have been competing in Canada for a long 
time; in 1987, they were recognized as having a certain Canadian 
content when they were ``grandfathered'' under the new telephone 
regulations.
<P>
	We have offered the company to negotiate the acceptance of a 
strong presence in Canada, in Quebec, and among others, in 
Rimouski.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="319"> 319 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In British Columbia, B.C. Tel is a very important Canadian 
player. We would like to work with both parties to make sure that 
they are permitted to continue to work effectively in the Canadian 
market and at the same time we do not set the stage for the 
American takeover of Canadian radio diffusion.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in view of the fact that under this grandfather clause 
Quebec Telephone is already involved in Internet broadcasting, 
could the government recognize that granting a broadcasting 
licence to this company would only be updating its vested right, 
due to recent technological developments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I told Gilles 
Laroche-Bloc members already discussed the issue and might be 
in agreement-that what is at issue is not just the expansion of two 
companies. Both Quebec Telephone and BC Tel are working to find 
a solution.
<P>
	This being said, when it was decided to grant Quebec Telephone 
a licence, in 1987, it was to provide telephone services. Of course, 
when it comes to Canadian culture, television is not the same thing 
as telephone. The telephone is a communication tool which has no 
Canadian content.
<P>
	As far as broadcasting is concerned, we have to make sure, not 
only that the Canadian content rule is respected, but also that the 
requirements for managing broadcasting companies are met. Last 
week, I met with the Union des artistes du Québec which is 
demanding that our broadcasting policy promote Canadian culture. 
I am trying to find a way to respect both Quebec Telephone 
presence and the Canadian content rule.

afterthought.
<P>
	The Nisga'a deal is another example of the taxpayer being left 
out of the equation. The primary accountability for spending in this 
deal is only to the Nisga'a people.

supposed to be accountable to, the Canadian taxpayer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

there are in ridings held by the Reform Party I would have thought 
the member would stand up and celebrate the Nisga'a deal.
<P>
	The reflection of accountability comes from the discussion, the 
political spin and the editorial comment coming out of an area. 
This deal has been hailed by most of the B.C. media, by most of the 
Alberta media and most of the Ontario media.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> What about the B.C. 
Liberals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> They find it fiscally responsible and publicly 
acceptable. Why will the Reform not admit that they were wrong 
when they attacked a group which has been negotiating with the 
white people for 30 years without success, through 12 ministers. 
After 30 years they finally have what they have been sitting at the 
table for. It is just and fair and we are proud of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not a balanced deal. There is much controversy 
among the media. We are not attacking any group. We are trying to 
place responsibility where it belongs.
<P>
	The minister can dance around the issue all he wants but his 
primary function is to spend taxpayers' money wisely and be 
accountable to the taxpayers when doing so. He has failed in the 
past. He has failed with this deal. The auditor general has 
confirmed this fact over time. We deserve better.
<P>
	Will the minister commit today to giving the auditor general the 
mandate to exercise full oversight of the spending of federal dollars 
in the Nisga'a deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, balance is in the eye of the 
beholder. Not long ago the Reform Party said the Criminal Code 
had to apply to the Nisga'a. They agreed.
<P>
	The Reform Party said that the charter of rights has to apply to 
the Nisga'a. They agreed.
<P>
	The Reform Party said that you cannot constitutionalize the 
commercial aspect of the fishery. They agreed.

	The Reform Party said they must pay taxes. They agreed.

jobs. On Friday Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc. took ownership of 
the Regina <I>Leader-Post</I>, the Saskatoon <I>Star-Phoenix</I> and the 
Yorkton <I>Enterprise</I>. The next day 25 per cent of the employees of 
these newspapers, 182 jobs in all, were terminated because Conrad 
Black said: ``These newspapers made profits but not enough 
profits''.
<P>
	In view of this latest corporate job massacre which is clearly a 
slap in the face to the Prime Minister's challenge, how long will the 
government tolerate this lack of corporate responsibility before 
taking any action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister laid out a challenge to all Canadians, to the 
business community, to labour unions, to educators and to 
governments that we must all come together to deal with what is a 
very deep problem, the changing nature of work.
<P>
	There is nobody on this side or that side of the House who 
approves of the kind of corporate downsizing that is going on 
without regard to the long term effects on communities in terms of 
the people. This is not behaviour that is supported by the business 
community itself. Loyalty from employees is very important if a 
company is going to do well. One person's employees are another 
person's customers.
<P>
	This is a problem on which all Canadians have to come together 
to solve. It is a problem that we will all solve together and this 
government is going to lead it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have seen in Saskatchewan and across the country a number of 
jobs that have been terminated by large corporations receiving 
corporate tax breaks from the national government.
<P>
	Will the government give its assurance today that these 
corporate tax breaks are not provided to corporations that lay off 
employees, even though they are profitable? Will the government 
launch an investigation into the question of concentration of 
ownership and the lack of competition in the media?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
over the past couple of years we have eliminated the great majority 
of what the member would call corporate tax breaks.

	The major incentives in place now are one that will encourage 
research and development which is very important and the lower 
tax rate for small and medium size business. As the member

the jobs in this country. That is one break that is worth keeping in

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the speech from the throne indicates the Liberals have not delivered 
on one promise they made in the last election campaign so they are 
making these promises one more time.
<P>
	The Liberals have talked about creating jobs. Let us go over the 
list of jobs they have created. Bell Canada made profits of $502 
million last year and laid off 3,100 employees. Petro-Canada made 
a profit of $196 million and laid off 564 employees. The Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce made over $1 billion in net profits and 
laid off 1,289 employees. General Motors made a profit of $1.39 
billion yet laid off 2,500 employees.
<P>
	Shell Oil made profits of $523 million, an increase of 63 per cent 
over last year, and laid off 471 employees. Imperial Oil made $514 
million, which was an increase of 43 per cent over the previous 
year, and laid off 452 employees. The Bank of Montreal made a 
$986 million profit, an increase of 20 per cent over 1994, yet laid 
off 1,428 employees. This is the job creation program of the federal 
government.
<P>
	We have seen the government in every field give contributions in 
terms of tax breaks to these corporations which have a corporate 
responsibility, a community responsibility to use the profits they 
make to reinvest in Canada either through capital, through job 
sustenance or through job creation. This has not been done by the 
corporations because the Liberal government has allowed it to go 
unattended. As a matter of fact, the government is encouraging it.
<P>
	How is the government encouraging it? The corporations I have 
mentioned have made substantial financial contributions to the 
Liberal Party. They are large political contributors and what do we 
get in return? We get the Liberal government turning a blind eye to 
these very policies which are not job creation policies but job 
elimination policies.
<P>
	The speech from the throne, which somebody has more 
appropriately referred to as the speech from the toilet, is exactly 
that. It does not seem to address the real problems of Canadians.
<P>
	On Saturday we saw another disaster with respect to this 
government policy. On Thursday the Prime Minister in the speech 
from the throne challenged business to  create jobs in Canada. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="321"> 321 </A></B>
<P>
pleaded by saying to the business community: ``I challenge you to 
create jobs''.
<P>
	On Friday Conrad Black, a multibillionaire in Canada whose 
company Hollinger Inc. took possession of the Regina 
<I>Leader-Post</I>, the Saskatoon <I>Star-Phoenix</I> and the Yorkton 
<I>Enterprise</I> in Saskatchewan. The next day 25 per cent of the 
employees of all three newspapers were laid off. According to Mr. 
Black as quoted from the newspaper, the reason was: ``These 
newspapers made a profit but they didn't make enough profit''.
<P>
	I am challenging the government, I am challenging the Prime 
Minister today to define for Canadians how much profit is enough 
before corporations have to stop laying people off when they are 
making profits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> What is enough?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> My colleague from Manitoba across the floor 
asks how much is enough.
<P>
	There is an attitude in the corporate world and it is supported and 
nurtured by the Liberal government which says: ``You can have as 
much profit as you want. We do not care as long as you keep giving 
us money and political contributions''.
<P>
	I want to mention a couple of things about Mr. Conrad Black. 
Toronto's establishment Upper Canada College expelled him for 
stealing and selling examination papers. This comes from a 1992 
<I>Maclean's</I> article. I quote from the article: ``Black has frequently 
expressed a distaste for reporters, calling them a very degenerative 
group with a terrible incidence of alcoholism and drug abuse, who 
are often ignorant, lazy, opinionated, intellectually dishonest and 
inadequately supervised''.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	This is Conrad Black who is now given tax breaks by the Liberal 
government to take over all of the daily newspapers in 
Saskatchewan and then lay off 25 per cent of their employees. We 
are going to give him a tax break because his company is going to 
buy a printing press in Saskatoon and who is going to subsidize 
this? The Liberal government policies. This is absolutely 
outrageous. I think Canadians are sick and tired of this, particularly 
those in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I also quote Thomas d'Aquino of the Business Council on 
National Issues: ``The Prime Minister left the impression that we 
were not creating jobs but frankly we are a bit disturbed by that 
because over the last three years the private sector has created 
about 600,000 new jobs''. The private sector may have done that 
but while the small and medium size businesses in the private 
sector have done that, the large corporations are taking all of the tax 
subsidies allowed by this government. They are laying off people 
and the smaller businesses are starting up and creating their own 
jobs, many of them very low paying.
<P>
	Mr. d'Aquino said as well: ``We have not been asleep at the 
switch. We have not been creating as many new jobs as we would 
like, but to suggest or leave the impression with Canadians that 
chief executives are out there just downsizing and throwing people 
out on the streets without any sense that you know in fact it is going 
the other way, it was a mistake''.
<P>
	The evidence we have seen in this country in the last six months 
is exactly contrary to what Thomas D'Aquino of the Business 
Council on National Issues is saying. It is entirely the opposite to 
what the speech from the throne is saying in terms of creating jobs. 
I believe many of the Liberal backbenchers are ashamed of the 
throne speech because of the things that are happening with respect 
to the lack of commitment to the Liberal Party's jobs strategy.
<P>
	New Democrats are calling for the government to implement a 
Canadian code of corporate citizenship. This is a very important 
code. It would say to the business community and to Canadian 
citizens that if they are making a profit that they are operating in 
this country, that they are committed to building their 
communities, to maintaining jobs in various occupations and as 
well, they are making a profit and will share the money through a 
fair taxation system and also will give their employees a decent 
increase from time to time.
<P>
	I am absolutely opposed to the speech from the throne and I will 
be voting against it when it comes before this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have heard in the speech by the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden about the cuts that have been made 
in Saskatchewan. No one is happy at all with the cuts that have 
been made by Hollinger.
<P>
	The hon. member has not mentioned the cuts that have been 
made by his former colleagues, the NDP government in the 
province of Saskatchewan. Saskpower has cut literally hundreds 
and hundreds of jobs in the workforce and the government in 
Saskatchewan has devastated rural health care. Nothing is being 
mentioned of these matters.
<P>
	When the federal government is creating work in Saskatchewan 
the NDP in Saskatchewan appears to be destroying the jobs as 
quickly as we can make them. Has the hon. member overlooked 
this particular matter of the job devastation which has occurred in 
Saskatchewan with the provincial government or is it simply 
something that has slipped his mind?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> As usual, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from 
Saskatoon does not have his facts right. Saskatchewan has seen an 
offloading by this federal government of $600 million over three 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="322"> 322 </A></B>
<P>
years. Six  hundred million dollars amounts to $600 for every man, 
woman and child in Saskatchewan. On top of that we have seen the 
elimination of the Crow benefit by the government opposite which 
amounts to another $350 per man, woman and child per year. 
Almost $1,000 per person per year is now lost out of the economy 
in terms of revenue sharing and equalization with respect to social 
programs.
<P>
	The government has not done what Alberta has done or what the 
Liberal government opposite has done, simply hacking and 
slashing. What we have done is we have taken a balanced approach 
to the problem. The balanced approach is that they are making up 
some revenues in terms of trying to minimize the impact of that 
cut. As well, they are going through a process of attrition, early 
retirement and other procedures where people have some dignity in 
terms of what they are doing after they leave certain positions.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	The member talks about devastating health care. This 
government promises in its red book and in the speech from the 
throne to improve health care and make it better. How can the 
government make it better when it is cutting $7 billion from the 
health care plan without looking first at efficiencies?
<P>
	For example, if the Liberal government repealed Bill C-91, the 
drug patent legislation, we would save the governments, the drug 
plans and the health care plans in this country over $2 billion a year 
right off the top. That is the increased cost this bill has allowed 
prescription drugs to increase by as a result of the government's 
supporting the large pharmaceutical companies that give 
substantial contributions to the Liberal Party to get re-elected, 
which is no surprise to the member from Saskatoon.
<P>
	The government allows little things like this to proceed while it 
costs our health care system and devastates it from another 
perspective. I think it should be looking at that issue very closely 
and addressing it.
<P>
	I thank the member for his question. Now that he has the facts he 
will be able to go back to his riding and share them with his 
constituents.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this historic throne speech 
debate.
<P>
	This is my first foray in the House of Commons debate as 
minister of Canada's environment. I am proud to bear this 
responsibility. I am equally proud to stand before the House and 
reinforce this government's direction. A government stands or falls 
on its record. In this regard, the Liberal government stands and 
stands tall.
<P>
	I have listened to opposition members with some degree of 
interest, and some of their criticism may be valid. However, taking 
it in total, they act a bit like  grasshoppers on a Sunday morning. 
They fill the air with a lot of noise but all they are looking at is the 
one single blade of grass in front of them. If they could just get a 
little higher and have a wider perspective they might see the whole 
meadow because it is a big meadow.
<P>
	The priorities before us in the throne speech are straightforward. 
We intend to build on our accomplishments of creating jobs and 
growth over the last two and a half years, provide additional 
security for Canadians and continue to modernize this federation to 
ensure national unity and national prosperity.
<P>
	As the speech from the throne confirmed, the environment has a 
big role to play in all three of these priorities. Sometimes the 
Canadian environment's profile slips, hidden for a while behind 
media generated fog on other issues. However, I can assure hon. 
members that it is constantly in the public's mind and it is 
consistently at the very front of the public's mind.
<P>
	Not many months ago a major research study indicated that the 
so-called elites of our country, senior mandarins, senior politicians, 
senior media and senior captains of industry, the opinion shapers, 
ranked the environment 10th on the list of 22 issues. Yet in that 
same study the general public, people we are accountable to, placed 
the environment as the second most important issue in their minds. 
One good reason Canadians feel so strongly and passionately about 
their environment is it is at the very core of Canadian identity.
<P>
	Our environment is linked to national unity with bonds of 
Canadian granite. Our environment is part of our national 
imagination in the same way that black spruce is part of the forest. 
After all, does it not pervade our literature like a prairie wind and a 
call of the wild? Do we not have a maple leaf on our flag that we 
salute and defend? Do we not have birds and animals on our 
coinage? Do we not sing songs about four strong winds, about the 
Canadian Rockies and our Atlantic and Pacific heritage? You bet 
we do, and so we should.
<P>
	Our natural heritage, whether it is in the Nahanni River of the 
Northwest Territories, the wild shores of the Labrador coast or the 
glaciers of our rugged Rocky Mountains, is not only part of our 
very being and shapes who we are, but it is also a major draw for 
international tourists and a major reason why immigrants come to 
Canada to invest, work and live.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Let us also not forget that our Canadian natural heritage is also 
important to the world. For example, 20 per cent of the world's 
fresh water supply is located in Canada. I might add that 18 per 
cent is in the Canadian Great Lakes alone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="323"> 323 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to contribute to the preservation and improvement of this 
heritage. I am committed to it and I  am proud of this commitment. 
We will cultivate security and fairness in our environment, thereby 
reinforcing our national pride.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the throne speech stressed, we will speak in the national 
interest with a strong voice at home and abroad to protect both our 
environment and the health of Canadians. Because environmental 
security is a goal of Canadians, the House will soon debate a 
revitalized Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA. It will 
change the emphasis of government from reacting to the toxins and 
pollution at the outflow of the pipe to preventing the pollution at 
the front end.
<P>
	We also know this can succeed only if there is a partnership 
between governments and their citizens. That is why the legislation 
will allow citizens, not just their governments, to start action in our 
courts in order to clean up their environment. This legislation will 
not only help defend our environment and the health of our fellow 
citizens, but it will be an example of how this government keeps its 
word.
<P>
	In the red book we promised to focus on preventing pollution at 
its source. CEPA will do this. We said that the winning industries of 
tomorrow will integrate environmental and economic efficiencies 
and CEPA will help make this a reality. We predicted that in the 
years ahead stricter environmental standards will be propelled by a 
number of international environmental, moral and market forces, 
and CEPA will help Canada respond to those very forces.
<P>
	The House will also see an endangered species protection act. 
This too will be part of our environmental security thrust. This is 
important legislation and we need to get it right. We need to 
establish with the provinces a strong national framework within 
which endangered species may seek their legitimate protection. I 
have already received some important input from the committee, 
from environmental groups as well as industry and I anticipate 
hearing more before finally proceeding.
<P>
	Although our watchwords are co-operation and partnership, we 
know that Canadians expect their national government to speak out 
and act on the issue of the environment which ultimately may 
affect their health. These are issues which do not respect political 
boundaries or lines drawn on a map. We intend to meet their 
expectations.
<P>
	When we talk of partnerships we must also stress and recognize 
the role played by the provinces and the territories. We should 
never, therefore, fall into the trap of playing politics with our 
ecosystems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After all, as federal and provincial ministers, we are the 
managers of an environmental heritage that we will pass on to 
future generations.
<P>
	I already had discussions with my provincial counterparts and 
we all agree that we face an enormous task. As we know, progress 
has been made during the past few years, because all levels of 
government responded to the wishes of the people. They put the 
environment at the top of their priorities and they worked together 
as partners.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pragmatist and I will bring a pragmatic approach to 
working with my fellow colleagues from the provinces and 
territories.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	However, this co-operation does not mean giving away the store 
which is the message I get from some of my hon. friends across the 
aisle. It means ensuring there are no gaps in our joint pursuit of 
environmental protection. We intend therefore to strengthen those 
partnerships and those processes in order to achieve that goal.
<P>
	We can point to a number of examples of how partnerships have 
already produced significant and successful results. Look at the 
work that has been done between the province of Quebec and the 
federal government to clean up the St. Lawrence and protect the 
habitat of the beluga whale.
<P>
	Look at the partnership approach to the successful recovery 
programs for the return of the peregrine falcon to southern Canada. 
These magnificent birds have disappeared from southern Canada 
but are now raised through a federal provincial recovery project at 
a federal facility in Wainwright, Alberta, then released to the other 
provinces across the nation. Our work, together with the provinces 
and the territories, is really like a measured journey; we do it one 
step at a time.
<P>
	At the same time our environmental work cannot be allowed to 
start and finish in our own backyard. Just as environmental security 
does not fit tightly and neatly into municipal and provincial 
boundaries, it also refuses to be defined by national borders. 
Consequently the environment is an integral part of our foreign 
policy and we will continue to show leadership abroad on such 
issues as climate change, biodiversity and ozone depletion. On this 
issue we truly are all in the same boat.
<P>
	We will see unity in action when it comes to Canada's 
environment. There will be people working with other people. This 
will mean governments, communities, neighbourhoods within 
communities, environmental organizations and industry all 
working along side each other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="324"> 324 </A></B>
<P>
	There was a classic example yesterday in my riding. The federal 
government through our department's action  21 program was able 
to support financially a group of individuals who have taken the 
initiative for the last number of years to restore Black Creek, a 
major tributary to the Humber River. The impulse, the incentive 
and the idea came from local residents. They were in essence ahead 
of their governments. That is what action 21 is about, trying to 
empower citizens locally in thinking locally and hopefully pushing 
governments to act nationally and internationally.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The throne speech also mentioned three specific areas for job 
creation: youth, science and technology, and trade. These three 
areas fit in very well with our priorities for the environment. It is 
reassuring to note that a growing number of industry leaders think 
that the fact they are being compelled to protect the environment is 
not a barrier to economic growth. The truth is, many of them 
believe that environment protection represents an opportunity for 
growth in the Canadian economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	More work needs to done. Every captain of industry, big, 
medium and small, needs to be convinced of this truism. Take a 
look at some of the leading industrial nations. Japan and Germany 
are both world leaders in energy efficiency, pollution prevention 
and control technologies. They have the very same environmental 
standards that we will be proposing in CEPA. Clearly 
environmental partnerships and environmental sensitivity have not 
held back the performance of those two countries and their 
respective economies.
<P>
	In Canada it is true that we need jobs for Canadians and 
especially jobs for our youth.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I am a firm believer that when it comes to Canada's 
environment, it is not an either/or proposition. The choice is not 
jobs or protecting the environment. As a country we can and should 
have both. We can expand our economy and we can protect and 
promote good environmental practices at the same time.
<P>
	Toward this end, the government will support the development 
of the Canadian environmental industry across the country. Our 
support is based on the recognition that this is a pivotal jobs and 
growth sector and provides the new technologies required to clean 
up the environment both at home and abroad.
<P>
	Today the Canadian environmental industry sector employs 
more than 150,000 Canadians and generates sales of over $11 
billion. Globally the market for environmental products is 
exploding. It is currently estimated at $425 billion. This market 
will double by the turn of the century.
<P>
	One can see the niche for Canadian know-how is already in 
place. What we have to do is expand the niche and the playing field 
for Canadian firms, for Canadian technology and consequently for 
Canadian jobs.
<P>
	That is why Environment Canada is an enthusiastic supporter of 
the Globe '96 conference that will be taking place later this month 
in Vancouver. It will truly be a showcase of our technological 
know-how to the world.
<P>
	The greening of industry means jobs for today and jobs for 
tomorrow. High tech environmental industry will also provide 
much needed employment for Canada's youth.
<P>
	The young are so often the rest of us when it comes to defending 
and promoting the rights of the environment. I have a 5-year old 
who often reminds this 40-year old about the bad practices of 
littering. It starts early.
<P>
	Those of us who have crossed the magic line that separates our 
world from the energy and enthusiasm of the young should be very 
wary if we try to speak for the youth of Canada or that we speak on 
their behalf.
<P>
	Quite frankly, they can and do speak for themselves powerfully. 
Our youth want to participate in the decisions and act on 
environmental issues that affect them and all of us and our country. 
That is one of the reasons Environment Canada will double the 
number of students we will hire this summer to work on 
environmental projects.
<P>
	We have also initiated discussions with the youth corps to 
establish jobs with young people involved in the projects of the 
environment across communities. Ultimately such projects will 
strengthen the national fabric and prepare Canada for that exciting 
new century.
<P>
	Canadian young people should lead, not follow. Their passion 
and energy can be mobilized from Canada's city scapes to our 
northern tundra. The government knows youth are not simply 
partners for tomorrow; they are tomorrow.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the minister for his 
nice speech full of fine words which started off with great flights of 
poetry.
<P>
	The minister used a quotation to tell us, among other things, that 
the Great Lakes represent 18 per cent of the world's fresh water 
supply. We know that there are thousands of chemicals in the Great 
Lakes. We know that the fish are dying, that birds that eat these fish 
end up with crooked beaks and crooked legs. It is polluted water, 
not fresh water.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Granted, these lakes contain 18 per cent of fresh water supplies, 
but it is certainly not drinking water.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="325"> 325 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister told us about the numerous bills he will table in this 
House. We will examine them, of course, according to their merit, 
as they are tabled. I would like to ask him a question, since he is 
making many commitments here today. I would like to ask him if 
he is willing to make real ones, not nice promises, but real 
commitments. We know about the <I>Irving Whale</I>, which has been at 
the bottom of the river for many years. My colleague the minister 
knows very well that, <I>qui va piano va sano e va lontano</I>, as the 
saying goes in his mother tongue.
<P>
	But in that case, we are getting absolutely nowhere. Last year, 
$12.5 million were spent trying to refloat it. I would like the 
minister to commit to pass on the $12.5 million bill not to 
taxpayers, but to the Irving company. That is the issue.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and his question.
<P>
	He is absolutely right to highlight the issue of water. I 
completely concur with him. It is an issue within the environmental 
domain that certainly goes beyond the boundaries of the 
environment. People feel quite strongly about the fresh water 
supply. Quite frankly, there may be conflicts and wars years down 
the road over the whole question of water supply.
<P>
	In my remarks I was trying to highlight not only the Canadian 
issue but that when Canada contains 20 per cent of the world's 
fresh water supply, the lion's share in the Great Lakes, it signals a 
national priority we should attach to water and obviously the 
international repercussions as well.
<P>
	He is also right that there are things in the water we wish were 
not there. The are causing harmful effects to fish, and increasing 
scientific evidence shows that obviously this has an impact on the 
health of Canadians and on reproduction.
<P>
	That is what a reinvigorated CEPA would also do in terms of the 
battle against toxins. I hope we can enlist him and the support of his 
party on the whole question of CEPA when it comes before the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	He also spoke about the <I>Irving Whale</I>. To be fair I think he 
trivialized a very complex situation. There was commitment by my 
predecessor a while ago to try to raise the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	There are people who will harp and ask why. It is very simple. It 
is well acknowledged that the problem will not go away. To think 
that leaving that barge at the bottom of the ocean is the solution is 
simply postponing the solution. It is a bit like the commercial 
which says: ``You can either pay me now or pay me much more 
later''. I do not want to do the latter if we care about our young and 
future generations.
<P>
	Different people have different solutions. There are a number of 
individuals in the majority who suggest raising the barge. It is not 
an easy situation but it is the best situation. Other individuals 
suggest we should pump the oil from the barge to the surface, not 
an easy task at all.
<P>
	We must recognize the complexities involved in the issue. That 
is why we have done a further environmental assessment, the 
fourth assessment in conjunction with independent counsel to 
galvanize the best possible solution to a problem which is 
obviously ticking away.
<P>
	Our interests are in the best interest of the environment and the 
health of Canadians. The hon. member knows there has been an 
additional RCMP investigation into how the PCBs got into portions 
of the oil supply.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I issue a warning that we not seek to politically trivialize what is 
obviously a very complex situation, one in which at the end of the 
day the government will be seized with doing the right thing in the 
interests of the environment and the safety and health of 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the minister on his new appointment and wish him 
well.
<P>
	The minister is probably aware of an event that took place in the 
last two years in my riding of Wild Rose on the Stoney reserve. 
Several thousands of acres of forest were virtually devastated. As a 
result the government is being sued by the Indian reserve to the 
tune of $50 million for the damages that occurred through the loss 
of trees, et cetera.
<P>
	That whole episode is just beginning. We will reap some very 
sad rewards from that event. The sad part of it is the government 
was warned by me and other members on this side of the House that 
this was happening. We urged and encouraged it to get involved 
and do something about it before it was too late. Now it will be at 
least 40 years before another tree will be removed from that entire 
reserve.
<P>
	There are literally hundreds of residents on the reserve who are 
wondering where all the money went for all of this. That is one 
problem. The other problem is the destruction of the ecosystem. 
There is unbelievable damage there.
<P>
	If the minister has not seen it I encourage him to fly over it, like I 
have, and take a look. Is the minister prepared to do something 
about that situation? What steps will he take in the future to make 
certain we never face that kind of thing again?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from Wild 
Rose for his congratulatory remarks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="326"> 326 </A></B>
<P>
	Given there is an impending lawsuit on this file it may be 
inappropriate to specifically talk about this one dossier. In the 
generic sense the hon. member is  reminding us all that there needs 
to be a balance, that there needs to be both development and 
respect for one's environment. That is what the term sustainable 
development captures.
<P>
	There are other instances now in which provincial governments 
are doing assessments on how we plan to manage the growth of our 
forests in the future. It is an issue the federal government takes 
seriously. It is an issue I have spoken to a number of ministers 
about. The hon. member stresses a point that should not be lost on 
any one of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the minister on his speech. I certainly appreciate tying 
the economy in as we recognize economic growth is dependent on 
acceptable environmental practices.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister would enlighten the House and expand 
on his department plans as they relate to the Arctic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from Waterloo 
for his comments. He is right about the integration of the economy 
and the environment. Clearly that has to be the future practice. 
Therein lies the challenge not only for our government but for 
provincial governments across the land and governments across the 
world.
<P>
	When I was at the OECD meetings a few weeks ago one of the 
things we stressed is that we should share the Es in the OECD; that 
is to say the environment and the economy. One of the suggestions 
Canada put forward in a very practical way when we discussed how 
often ministers should meet was that perhaps we should have more 
infrequent meetings but have the meetings with the OECD 
ministers of finance and economy together with the ministers of the 
environment. If we did that we would move the files much more 
rapidly than sometimes happens with the frustrations by all 
governments in balancing and costing the environment into the 
economic equation.
<P>
	The member also asks about our plan for the Arctic. As he 
probably knows, there are two very important conferences coming 
up. I believe my new parliamentary secretary will be playing an 
active role in both.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	One conference will be of parliamentarians from around the 
world. I will be attending, as well as the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, the second conference dealing with the 
setting up of an Arctic council. The environment is in the forefront 
of those concerns because development elsewhere is having a 
detrimental effect on the environment of the Arctic which should 
be kept as a polished jewel.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will now recognize the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm. My colleague, am I to understand that you 
will be sharing your time with the hon. member for Drummond?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Indeed, 
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Drummond.
<P>
	Ever since my constituents from Berthier-Montcalm have 
asked me to represent and speak for them in the House, I have 
witnessed all kinds of manoeuvring on the part of the government.
<P>
	Each time I have spoken in the House, it was solely to defend the 
real interests of Quebecers in my riding.
<P>
	The throne speech, and all that goes with it, is an illustration of 
the governement's political manoeuvring that I have witnessed and 
about which I cannot keep silent.
<P>
	It is always important for a government to take a clear position 
on political issues, and to state its agenda as honestly as possible, 
so that taxpayers have a good understanding of their government's 
vision. As far as the recent throne speech is concerned, taxpayers 
will have to wait to get a clear understanding of the government's 
vision, because it does not seem to have any.
<P>
	Indeed, the throne speech not only leaves us in the dark, but it is 
nothing more than a bunch of empty promises; it is confusing and 
clearly lacking in substance.
<P>
	One wonders why a throne speech was delivered. Those familiar 
with the parliamentary system will say that a throne speech was 
delivered because the session had been prorogued. Still, it is not 
clear.
<P>
	Granted, the session has been prorogued, but the government, 
making the word prorogation meaningless, presented a motion to 
reinstate the bills just as they were before prorogation.
<P>
	So, there was a prorogation, minus the legal implications of such 
a decision. Now, we have a speech from the throne that looks a lot 
more like an excerpt from the <I>Petit catéchisme</I> than a true speech 
from the throne, in which a government clearly states where it is 
headed. This throne speech lacks imagination to say the least.
<P>
	Its vagueness is disconcerting. Yet, this government has been in 
office for over 28 months. Consequently, people had every right to 
expect more than wishful thinking. They wanted concrete 
commitments.
<P>
	People wanted to know how the government was going to make 
our taxation system more fair. They wanted to hear about effective 
assistance programs for our defence industry conversion. They 
wanted to hear about eliminating overlap and waste. Above all, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="327"> 327 </A></B>
<P>
they wanted to  hear the government talk about a realistic and 
detailed plan to revitalize the economy and promote job creation.
<P>
	Upon reading the speech from the throne, we can only conclude 
that the Liberal government did not understand what people wanted 
to hear. According to the very words used in the speech from the 
throne, the government will work, challenge, support, ensure. But, 
after two years in office, it is no longer time to ensure, work, 
challenge or support: it is time to act.
<P>
	In the first two thirds of its speech from the throne, the 
government tells us a lot more about its mood than about anything 
else. Even staunch federalists, such as the Conseil du patronat, had 
no choice but to criticize the government for, among other things, 
its tendency to keep throwing the ball back in the court of the 
private sector when it comes to job creation.
<P>
	However, as a Quebec member of Parliament, I was particularly 
surprised at the federal government's intention to remain involved 
in all major activity sectors, including those that come under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Upon reading the speech from the throne, it is obvious that 
Ottawa crowns itself as the great guardian of Canadian values and 
the protector of citizens against their own turpitude and that of their 
provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	It has appropriated for itself the mandate of being the protector 
of the social union. Whatever our political opinion about the future 
of Quebec, it seems to me that in the last referendum, hundreds of 
thousands of Quebecers, including people who voted against 
sovereignty, were of a different opinion. By acting in this manner, 
the government has shown clearly that it did not understand a thing 
about the claims of Quebecers.
<P>
	I will give you a few examples. In the speech from the throne, it 
is said that the government will not use its spending power to create 
new shared cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction without the consent of a majority of the provinces. Any 
new program will be designed so that non-participating provinces 
will be compensated, provided they establish equivalent or 
comparable initiatives.
<P>
	This approach is totally unacceptable for Quebec, for several 
reasons. First, the government has not indicated that it intends to 
withdraw entirely from areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, 
as has been requested for many years by the Quebec government. 
On the contrary, the federal government is confirming its right to 
interfere, albeit within a certain limit, which is that a majority of 
the provinces will have to agree to the establishment of new 
programs under certain conditions.
<P>
	The provinces that do not agree to take part in the federal 
program will be entitled to financial compensation only if they 
establish an equivalent or  comparable program. This is clearly a 
backhanded way for the federal government to keep control of 
programs and have its views and national standards prevail. 
Moreover, we simply do not know whether or not provinces that 
opt out will be fully compensated. The only purpose of this tactic is 
to isolate Quebec once more.
<P>
	Further down in the throne speech, we read that the government 
will transfer to community based groups, municipal authorities and 
the private sector the management of the transportation 
infrastructure. Where do the provinces fit in that scheme? It is 
obvious the federal government is bypassing provincial legislatures 
in order to keep its control over community based groups, 
municipal authorities or private companies to whom it will transfer 
powers that were never its own in the first place.
<P>
	The throne speech also says that the government is willing to 
withdraw from such areas as manpower training, forestry, mining, 
and recreation. The federal government says provincial 
governments, local authorities or the private sector will take on 
these responsibilities. It takes some gall to mention in the throne 
speech that the federal government is willing and ready to 
withdraw from areas under exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The government had already announced its intention of 
withdrawing from manpower training. This devolution was 
supposed to come quickly. But the new minister in charge has 
qualified that promise by suggesting it might take up to three years. 
It is still the old song and dance routine of the federal government.
<P>
	But that was still not enough. The federal government had to be 
more arrogant towards Quebec. So, it will propose to the provinces 
a partnership in areas under provincial jurisdiction. It does not have 
to propose any partnership. It only has to withdraw from and stop 
interfering in areas where it does not belong. It is clear. It is easy. 
That is the message sent by the referendum held in Quebec last 
October. Also, a partnership means that the parties involved pool 
powers they actually have, and not that areas of jurisdiction are 
taken over and managed by the party with the greater spending 
power. That is surely not the changes the 50.4 per cent of 
Quebecers who voted No last October 30 were expecting from the 
federal government.
<P>
	If the government had gotten the message, it would have stated 
in the throne speech that it was immediately withdrawing from 
every area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Lastly, I have one more example of how the government has 
learned nothing from the latest referendum in Quebec. When the 
hon. Pettigrew and Dion and the Minister of Indian Affairs threaten 
Quebecers with a plan B, where the government would play hard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="328"> 328 </A></B>
<P>
ball with Quebecers, they are really on the wrong track because 
Quebecers, who are on their way to  sovereignty, will never bow to 
the threats made by these ministers.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	What we want right now is for the federal government to at least 
abide by the Constitution it claims to protect and to withdraw from 
all areas where the provinces, including Quebec, have exclusive 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will add a 
few words to the remarks made by the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm about exclusive jurisdiction. When I read the 
speech from the throne, it made me laugh.
<P>
	The federal government says that it: ``-will not use its spending 
power to create new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction- '' that is what my colleague mentioned a 
few moments ago. ``-without the consent of a majority of the 
provinces.''
<P>
	There is something wrong here. The people who wrote that did 
not know what they were talking about. It also says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any new program will be designed so that non-participating provinces will 
be compensated, provided they establish equivalent or comparable initiatives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I looked it up in the Petit Robert and Petit Larousse dictionaries, 
and I found that ``exclusive jurisdiction'' excludes any sharing or 
participation, that it refers to a single person or group of persons or 
of things.
<P>
	That means that if the Canadian government recognizes that a 
province has exclusive jurisdiction over an area, it is supposed to 
have complete control over it. It is just as if somebody told me: ``I 
recognize this is your backyard. I know it is in your backyard. It is 
exclusively yours, you paid for it, it is yours. However, if the 
neighbours so wish, we will dig a pool in your backyard, and you 
will not have any choice. We will install a pool in it. Also, if you 
wish to do it on your own, you may not do so; we will help you dig 
your pool. But if you decide to share your pool with your 
neighbours, it will have to have a certain depth and a certain size''.
<P>
	It is very contradictory. I do not understand the speech from the 
throne when it speaks of exclusivity, and I appreciate what my 
colleague is trying to say when he speaks of exclusivity. It is 
incomprehensible. There is something wrong in the speech. The 
person who wrote it did not know what was meant by exclusivity.
<P>
	In any case, there is a lot of hypocrisy in the government's 
approach towards the provinces. We must reread that. I wish my 
colleague could explain further what he really understands in this 
paragraph which I have just read. I find it incomprehensible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, 
the hon. member for Longueuil, for allowing me to clarify my 
thought. I will use an example I saw in the newspapers the morning 
after the speech from the throne. Here is how a paper that will 
remain nameless,  <I>Le Devoir</I>, interpreted that paragraph. The 
author used education as an example of exclusive jurisdiction.
<P>
	The situation can lead to misunderstandings. If a majority of 
provinces, six provinces for example, decided that the federal 
government could administer a national program in education, 
Quebec could protest all it wants, it would have to establish an 
equivalent program meeting the national standards imposed by 
Ottawa to get part of the funds under that program, to get back part 
of the taxes that Quebecers pay to the federal government. For us, 
Quebecers, that would be unacceptable. If there is one area that is 
vital for Quebec, it is education.
<P>
	According to what the speech from the throne says about 
exclusive jurisdictions, the federal government could interfere in 
an area like education and that is truly unacceptable for Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The federal government has no right putting its nose in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. It should stay clear of such 
exclusive jurisdictions. That is totally unacceptable for us, in 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising to make a few comments following the speech by my 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, having heard and read 
carefully the speech from the throne presented by the Governor 
General in the Senate and having heard what various ministers have 
said over the last few days. A while ago, we heard the Minister of 
the Environment talk about job creation and reaffirm red book 
promises. I do not know whether the minister has looked at his 
government's performance over the last two years, but it is 
imperative that the government, which was elected to create jobs, 
start doing so without further delay.
<P>
	The current government has done exactly the opposite after 
taking office by laying off 35,000 employees, in the public service 
alone. Believe it or not, these 35,000 jobs that were cut were in the 
area of services to the public. Let me just mention, among other 
things, that a number of employment centres were closed and that a 
number of air traffic controllers were laid off.
<P>
	You can be sure that, by cutting jobs, especially in the public 
service, not only does the government not save any money for the 
Canadian taxpayer, but it increases its deficit. Contracting out to 
the private sector by the federal government amounted to $11 
billion in 1995, compared to $1.4 billion in 1984.
<P>
	By closing the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean, the 
government has caused the number of unemployed workers to 
increase. As for the closure and the privatization of federal 
infrastructures, we see more and more of that in the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="329"> 329 </A></B>
<P>
	I also heard the Minister of the Environment talk about 
duplication, an issue that we also talk about regularly. My 
colleague just said that the government should get out of areas 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I am concerned about duplication in environmental matters. Will 
we have a situation where the federal government manages water 
quality while the provincial government manages fish stocks? I am 
afraid that, if it comes to that, the fish in Quebec will be swimming 
on their backs in a few years.
<P>
	Will the federal government manage air quality while we 
manage the birds? I am afraid our birds will start flying backwards 
because of the pollution.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague whether he sees in the speech 
from the throne, between the wishes of the government and reality, 
some hope of a promising future for workers and for the 
unemployed, for our youth and our seniors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. He mentioned some very fundamental truths in the whole 
issue at stake in light of the speech from the throne.
<P>
	To answer only the member's last question, there is absolutely 
nothing in the speech from the throne which would give us a bit of 
hope as to job creation. It is extremely disappointing because, only 
a few days before the speech from the throne, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development had said that the federal 
government had failed regarding job creation and that something 
had to be done.
<P>
	A minister from his riding, in the maritimes, said: ``Look, the 
federal government failed in matters of job creation, and something 
has to be done''. I was expecting specific measures in the speech 
from the throne to boost economy and employment. All the 
government has to say is that there will be job cuts in the public 
service. It has obviously failed in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise in this House to comment on this 
government's second speech from the throne that was delivered in 
the House last week.
<P>
	In having this speech delivered, the Prime Minister's did 
something rather unusual that clearly reflects the disarray of the 
Liberal government. This speech comes at a very particular time, 
that is, a few months after the victory of the no side, which will be 
short-lived. After the October 30th referendum, English Canada 
suddenly realized the scope of the changes demanded by 
Quebecers, That realization has given rise to two completely 
opposite trends among Canadians from the rest of the country and 
their leaders.
<P>
	On one side, there are those who favoured reflection and careful 
analysis, which is normal after such an event.  These people have 
already begun to consider what will happen after Quebec achieves 
sovereignty and are now trying to define a new Canada with a new 
partner: Quebec.
<P>
	On the other side, there is the federal government, which is 
gripped by panic. It is sad to see that the members of cabinet, who 
claim to be able to lead the country, are the ones most reluctant to 
act responsibly. Instead of taking note of the referendum results 
and drawing the necessary conclusions rather than the ones they 
would like to impose, they reacted in an immature and inconsistent 
fashion.
<P>
	The speech that was delivered last Tuesday has three themes: the 
economy, social security for Canadians and national unity.
<P>
	First, let us deal with what the speech has to say about the 
economy. The speech announces with fanfare that the government 
will do everything possible in order to help young people find jobs. 
It contains a proposal to double the number of summer jobs for 
students in the federal public service. The irony is that at the very 
same moment the government is laying off 45,000 public servants.
<P>
	And yet, this government has committed already to help young 
people. That was supposed to be done through better support for 
research and education. The fact is, however, that the Canada social 
transfer will be cut by seven billion dollars over two years. 
Universities are being forced to cut research, tuition fees will 
increase, which will have an adverse effect on access to university 
for young people. On the one hand, they are singing the virtues of a 
strong economy for the future, and on the other they are 
jeopardizing that future by loading university graduates down with 
debt. What a difference between words and actions.
<P>
	To boost the economy, the government committed to eliminating 
the GST and replacing it with another tax that dovetailed more 
smoothly with the provincial tax. The Bloc Quebecois had 
suggested that it be scrapped entirely and this area of taxation be 
transferred to the provinces. We are still awaiting action from the 
government, and we hear not a word about the GST.
<P>
	The same applies to sound public finances. The government 
made a commitment to make better use of the taxpayers' money in 
order to control its deficit. In reality, far from tightening up its 
administration, the federal government is laying its hands on the 
workers' money by appropriating the unemployment fund surplus, 
although it has not contributed to that fund for some years now. 
Once again they will dump on someone else, praising themselves to 
the Canadian public by saying: ``See what a good government we 
are. We have cut the deficit by five billion dollars''. What they 
have done is dip into the unemployment insurance fund, to which 
they no longer contribute. It is the taxpayers, both workers and 
employers, who are helping reduce the deficit from their own 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="330"> 330 </A></B>
<P>
pockets, whereas those funds  ought to have been used to really 
provide us with job creation measures as promised in the last red 
book.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government got itself elected with its slogan of 
``jobs, jobs, jobs''. So where are those jobs? Now, instead of giving 
us jobs, they are taking away money, five billion dollars from the 
most needy in our society. Instead of using it to help them find jobs 
and create measures for that purpose, they are putting it toward the 
deficit. They are dumping the problem onto the provinces and the 
poor. That is what is so offensive. Unfortunately, once again, there 
is a wide gap between words and action.
<P>
	Now, to address the notion of social security contained in the 
throne speech. The government has tried in vain to disguise the fact 
that it has been engaged in dismantling the social security safety 
net for the past two years, particularly in the areas of health and 
unemployment insurance. I can tell you something about health, 
because it is part of my responsibility.
<P>
	A few months ago, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tabled a reform proposal entitled employment 
insurance. It seems to me that we take out insurance to help us, in 
the event a disaster or a mishap, to rebuild or start afresh. Here we 
are talking about employment insurance. What is employment 
insurance. It amounts to taking $5 billion from taxpayers and 
putting it towards the $600 billion deficit.
<P>
	Taxpayers are not being provided with jobs, they are having their 
money taken away from them. No one is creating jobs for them, 
they are being driven to welfare. When they are no longer getting 
social assistance or anything at all, where can they go knocking? 
They will go and get welfare. They have to eat. They get no help 
finding jobs. You know, it costs money to look for a job too. How 
are we going to help them find a job when we take their last nickel?
<P>
	This proposal has elicited a lot of criticism and led to many 
demonstrations. I do not understand. We in the Bloc see people 
every week, who come to tell us that the reform makes no sense. I 
imagine the Liberal members must have the same sort of reaction 
in their ridings.
<P>
	We should join together and tell the new Minister of Human 
Resources Development that it makes no sense, that we have to go 
back to the drawing board. Nobody wants anything to do with this 
reform; it penalizes everyone. It even puts women back 40 years. 
Something must be done. The people are protesting against this 
regressive anti-job reform that will create poverty.
<P>
	Allow me to quote a short excerpt from page 80 of the red book, 
which deals with health care reform: ``A comprehensive 
re-examination of Canada's health care spending is required. 
Without doubt, part of the immediate pressure on the program has 
arisen from the decision of the Conservative government to 
steadily  withdraw from health care funding, thus passing costs 
onto the provinces. Economic conditions may change, but the 
health care requirements of Canadians will continue. It is essential 
to provide financial certainty and predictability for our health care 
planning''.
<P>
	What nice promises. Those who claimed they wanted to revamp 
medicare are now launching a full-scale attack against the health 
care system as a whole. The Canada social transfer will lead to 
additional cuts in the order of $4.5 billion over two years in the 
health care sector alone. In Quebec, the shortfall will amount to 
more than $650 million this year and almost $2 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	Is this what this government calls providing financial certainty 
and predictability for our health care planning? In the recent throne 
speech, the government claims to be open to new methods and 
directions in order to preserve national values. In this case, it is 
high time the federal government considered transferring total 
health care funding to Quebec and the provinces. This would 
eliminate duplication and considerably reduce the size of the 
bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The health department employs 8,000 people and spends more 
than $1 billion every year on bureaucratic organization and 
administration of all sorts.
<P>
	If the entire health budget were transferred to Quebec and the 
provinces, decisions could be made closer to the people and 
implemented so as to meet their needs. In the end, the health of 
Canadians and Quebecers would benefit.
<P>
	Concerning national unity and what was said on the subject in 
the speech from the throne, you must admit that it is not normal for 
a country 130 years old, a country that boasts about being the best 
in the world, to have to put the national unity issue on its priority 
list, along with the economy and social security. Yet, this is what 
this country has been doing for many years.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say that we in the Bloc Quebecois 
have this to say to the Liberal Party: The right of Quebecers to 
decide on their future is not debatable, period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Drummond for her excellent speech. She 
discussed, of course, the speech from the throne, and she showed 
very clearly how we, Quebecers, and particularly Bloc Quebecois 
members, perceive this speech.
<P>
	First, this speech from the throne is strictly for show. The 
government wants to give the impression that it seeks to make 
changes. It wants to impress Quebecers in particular by telling 
them that it will make great changes and share the management and 
the responsibility for certain areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="331"> 331 </A></B>
<P>
	Usually, a speech from the throne includes a new direction. In 
fact, that is the reason for such a speech. It is to set everything 
aside and get a fresh start. It is a new impetus, a new vision, a 
new way of doing things proposed by the government to revitalize 
the economy, stimulate employment and implement major 
initiatives. However, that is not the case here.
<P>
	The day after the governor general delivered this nice speech 
from the throne in the Senate, the government tabled the same old 
obsolete bills that did not work in the first place.
<P>
	This is pure hypocrisy, as we say in Quebec. When someone 
does not tell the truth, we say that person is a hypocrite. The speech 
from the throne misleads people because the government is 
bringing back the same old legislation.
<P>
	My colleague also talked about unemployment insurance. We 
are told that, this year, the UI fund will get $5 billion more from 
workers and employers. Once again, the Canadian government 
finds a way to tax people even more, that is the workers and the 
employers.
<P>
	In Quebec, for years now, both the Conseil du patronat and 
labour have been saying: ``If we are the only ones to pay into the 
unemployment insurance system, why can we not manage it?'' 
Why could employers and employees not manage the 
unemployment insurance fund? Why not, indeed? Why has the 
government not withdrawn from this area instead of cheating the 
people once again, using unemployment insurance as an excuse to 
put its hand on more money, as a new way of collecting taxes? This 
is outrageous.
<P>
	It is the same thing with health care. My colleague mentioned 
health care. Of course, when the health care system was put in 
place, in the 1970s, the federal government had to interfere, saying: 
``I want to get involved''. The provinces refused. The government 
persisted, in spite of the provinces' reluctance. Finally, the 
provinces told the government: ``If you want to get involved, you 
will have to pay your share''. The federal government decided to 
pay 50 per cent of the bill. Today, it only pays 28 per cent, and 
Quebec pays over 70 per cent.
<P>
	The federal government keeps on telling us that it will decide 
how health care will be managed. Once again, this is unfair, this is 
unjust.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	If the federal government had respected the Constitution, we 
would not be faced with the problems we have today. But the 
federal government keeps on encroaching; it does not respect the 
Canadian Constitution. This is why the Bloc Quebecois is here. 
This is why Quebecers elected over 50 sovereignist members to 
this House, because the federal government has never respected the 
Constitution.
<P>
	It is always the same hypocrisy, as can be found in the throne 
speech, especially with regard to exclusive jurisdiction, which my 
colleague mentioned earlier. It is bad to speak about exclusivity 
but, at the same time, nobody really has any exclusivity because the 
federal government says it will deal with it, it will decide, it will set 
standards and if we do not respect those standards, it will not give 
us money. The great master, the boss of this country is the federal 
government.
<P>
	This is not what we created. Two equal states, two equal peoples 
created a country at a point in time. Now we have to obey this great 
master who takes the liberty of writing in a throne speech a 
paragraph like this one:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government will not use its spending power to create new shared-cost 
programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction without the consent of a 
majority of the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What a contradiction! Who do they think they are anyway? 
Furthermore, the government adds:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any new program will be designed so that non-participating provinces will 
be compensated, provided they establish equivalent or comparable initiatives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My colleague, the member for Drummond, talked at length 
about that in her speech and since she is the health critic, I would 
like her to explain the meaning of that paragraph as far as health is 
concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
for Longueuil for his comments. I totally agree with what he just 
said.
<P>
	First of all, I prepared a list of all the commitments from the first 
throne speech which have been reheated, as we say, and 
reintroduced in the new throne speech, to make us believe that they 
are new commitments. This is a replay of the first speech. These 
are promises which were made and not kept.
<P>
	The government promised to improve integrity, appoint an ethics 
counsellor, introduce a bill on lobbyists and institute free votes.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor is normally appointed by the Prime 
Minister, not the House. His or her advice is secret and nothing 
guarantees that the government will take it into account.
<P>
	The bill on lobbyists which was passed, was a very watered 
down version of Liberal promises.
<P>
	As to free votes, there have not been any. There have even been 
sanctions against those who stepped out of line, as we have seen 
when the firearm control bill was put to a vote.
<P>
	Then we were promised support for education and research. 
Instead we had cuts in established programs financing and in 
transfers for education. As I told you a while ago, the result is that 
universities must cut, including in the area of research support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="332"> 332 </A></B>
<P>
	The social security system was to be reformed in close 
co-operation with the provinces; this was another promise. What 
we had was the Canada social transfer and a $7 billion cut over 
two years in the areas of health, education and social security, 
without any consultation with the provinces.
<P>
	The replacement of the GST is something we are still waiting 
for.
<P>
	We were promised that health would be protected. A national 
forum on health was put into place. We had been told: ``in 
co-operation with the provinces''. We ended up with a $4.5 billion 
cut over two years under the new Canada social transfer, and the 
national health forum was criticized by all the provinces. It is still 
going around somewhere and no one knows what it is doing and 
what results it will produce. At the present time, all the provinces 
have taken steps on their own to make their own health reform, 
because health management is a provincial jurisdiction. So what is 
the federal government doing with a national health forum?
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I have nothing against the people who sit on that forum. They are 
certainly qualified people, but what has it got to do with the 
provinces? It is our reform. Health ministers in each province are 
taking care of our needs. The federal government is spending 
billions of dollars on window dressing. It says it is taking care of 
the health system.
<P>
	I would like to tell people who are watching us, Quebecers and 
Canadians alike: Please do not let yourselves be fooled by big 
programs, big forums like the one on health care.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the speech from the throne has carefully set out a number 
of important themes with respect to the unity of Canada, the 
development of Canada's economy and the development of 
Canadian society. These themes respond to the hopes and 
aspirations of all Canadians.
<P>
	One of the themes made very clear in the throne speech is the 
need to understand that we in rural Canada face particular 
challenges that our urban neighbours often do not.
<P>
	As we in rural Canada, in rural Ontario and in rural Parry 
Sound-Muskoka work to increase and expand our economic 
activity, our problems include such things as geography, 
transportation and low population density. Our challenges include 
the delivery of government services and the acquisition of modern 
and sophisticated communications infrastructure. These can be 
handicaps on existing or potential business enterprises. Solutions 
to these problems and answers to these challenges will provide 
many opportunities for businesses and communities in rural 
Canada.
<P>
	An important distinction is found in the type of economies that 
exist in the rural parts of our country. Our rural economies are 
largely based on primary industries and depend on natural 
resources. Pursuing activities in agriculture, fisheries, mining, 
trapping or forestry can generate very different problems from 
those faced in an auto plant, a high tech manufacturing facility or 
the financial offices of Bay Street.
<P>
	Fluctuating commodity prices, stifling regulatory regimes and 
the seasonality of employment are all economic realities faced by 
the men and women working in rural Canada.
<P>
	There are important and often overlooked differences in rural 
Canada. We have defining cultural traits. We honour tradition at the 
same time as we look forward to and embrace the future. We turn 
toward our families and extended families for the type of support 
that today others expect and indeed require from the state. We 
understand the land and the sea and the importance of its riches. We 
have a long tradition of harvesting its abundance.
<P>
	For recreation we also turn to those same places where many 
rural Canadians find their employment. Together with visitors from 
urban Canada and from abroad, we enjoy the natural amenities of 
rural and wilderness Canada in cottage country where hunting, 
fishing and a wide variety of other recreational activities can be 
pursued.
<P>
	Work, family and the enjoyment of our natural world are basic to 
rural life and perpetuate very important values. These values in 
pursuits unite us a nation. Our unique lifestyle in rural Canada is as 
relevant to the farmer in Quebec as it is to the farmer on the prairie. 
It is relevant to the miner of Nova Scotia who understands the 
miner of northern Ontario. The fishermen of Newfoundland is 
closely akin to the fishermen of British Columbia.
<P>
	In the throne speech the government made it very clear that it 
understands and recognizes both the importance of rural Canada 
and the unique nature of its challenges. I applaud the statement in 
the throne speech committing the government to the economic 
renewal of rural Canada. I am particularly pleased that this will be 
done in a way tailored to our specific needs and our specific 
challenges.
<P>
	The task ahead is to provide the framework within which this 
commitment can enfold and to provide the specific measures that 
will lead to economic renewal in all parts of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	It is important that rural Canada have a strong voice in 
government which I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, it does on this 
side of the House. It is important that voices resonate with our rural 
perspective and that these voices find expression at the cabinet 
table. I am confident that  there are many capable men and women 
in the current ministry who can articulate the issues of rural Canada 
as we 
<P>

work to implement our renewed interest in the well-being of rural 
Canadians.
<P>
	As the member for Parry Sound-Muskoka I look forward to 
working with my colleagues in cabinet to help implement the 
government's renewed commitment to bettering the lives of rural 
Canadians.
<P>
	We in rural Canada know we need to diversify our economies 
and to increase our education levels and skills. We know we must 
do this through community based actions in concert with the 
private sector and government.
<P>
	While natural resources will always be an important sector we 
must value add to them to increase the returns to us in the 
marketplace. We must embrace the positive changes that are taking 
place in the world. We in rural Canada will be innovative but we 
will look to the government to develop a process that will 
encourage our potential.
<P>
	The government has begun this process. Since 1993 federal 
departments have worked more co-operatively to improve the 
delivery of programs in rural Canada. Last year we established the 
adaptation and rural development fund which will provide $60 
million per year to help rural Canada adjust to new economic 
realities.
<P>
	Beyond this it is appropriate that the various regional 
development agencies which operate across Canada mandate a 
specific portion of their financial resources to rural Canada. I also 
urge that the $300 million fund that is being proposed under 
changes to employment insurance be used in rural Canada to 
provide the services and infrastructure necessary for long term 
economic development.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier in my speech, rural Canada suffers from a 
relative lack of technological communications infrastructure, 
considering the distances and lower population densities that exist. 
This deficiency sometimes puts our educational institutions and 
business people at a competitive disadvantage. Parents in rural and 
remote Canada also want access to good communication services 
for the safety, education and entertainment of their children.
<P>
	I compliment the Minister of Industry on the school net program 
which is connecting many of the schools in my riding and across 
rural Canada with the Internet. I am also pleased to see the 
implementation of the community access program which will 
provide links to the community access network for up to 1,000 
rural and remote communities, allowing them to market 
themselves and their products.
<P>
	The government at the end of the first session of this Parliament 
announced the reform of the unemployment insurance system. This 
is an important and positive initiative. It must however recognize 
the economic  realities of a rural economy dependent on natural 
resources to generate employment. Many of our jobs are seasonal 
because of climate and natural cycles. People work part time not 
because they want to but because they have to.
<P>
	Reforms are necessary and reduction of costs are necessary, but 
reforms and reductions cannot be achieved solely on the backs of 
rural Canadians who work or invest in seasonal industries. I am 
pleased to see that we are addressing that question in our approach 
to the needs of rural Canada.
<P>
	Another important component of revitalizing the economy is 
access to capital. The government has moved diligently in this 
area. The Federal Business Development Bank, now the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, has a new mandate as a 
complementary lender and has had its debt ceiling raised to $12 
billion.
<P>
	The community futures program is being revitalized and has new 
funds attributed to it so it also can help rural Canadians.
<P>
	Today I call on Canadian financial institutions, which oftentimes 
tell us that it is too risky to lend in rural Canada, to use a portion of 
their $5 billion profit to find innovative ways to lend in rural 
Canada.
<P>
	Canada began as a rural country and we have grown to become a 
world leader, a cosmopolitan people, an industrialized state, a 
highly urbanized nation. I am proud of all this. However we must 
remember our roots. We must remember the millions of Canadians 
who live and work in rural and small town Canada. We must 
remember the basic wealth generated by natural resources. We 
must remember the unique potential that is our rural Canada.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The government will not forget the contribution of rural 
Canadians. Rather, we are working to help rural Canadians make 
their contributions to strengthening the economic and social 
structure of Canada which will be the foundation of the national 
unity we are all working to achieve.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was afraid you might have forgotten me, but I can see 
you had not.
<P>
	I would like you to know that it is nice to have you back. I wish 
to thank my hon. colleague for his speech, in which I could feel 
how truly committed he is to his riding. It was clear to me that the 
hon. member had very deep roots in the community that he 
represents here, in the House of Commons.
<P>
	However, I would like to share my thoughts with him concerning 
two or three statements he made. The hon. member referred to the 
lack of advanced technology in his community, and I can easily 
imagine that high  technology industries could be rather scarce in a 
rural area. This is an issue of great interest to me, and I would like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="334"> 334 </A></B>
<P>
to ask the hon. member what concrete steps were taken by the 
government, in his opinion, in support of science and technology?
<P>
	I am putting the question to him while bearing in mind that 
consultations were held at both the regional and the national level, 
and that the government had promised to table a white paper on 
science and technology. We are in the somewhat paradoxical 
situation where ministers keep telling us: ``Canada is a developed 
country. Canada is a country of plentiful resources. Canada is rich 
with brainpower''. But when you take a look at government 
reports-and I will close on this, because I can detect a trace of 
impatience in you, which is not in your true nature-and consult 
the National Advisory Board on Science and Technology, you learn 
that Canada ranks second to last in terms of public and private 
support for research and development.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret having to interrupt, but other 
members also want to ask questions. The hon. member will now 
answer your question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. The point I 
was making about rural Canada is that the technological 
infrastructure, the ability to access the information highway, which 
is taken for granted in urban Canada as just being there, is often not 
available to rural Canada. When trying to attract business people 
and businesses to our area, one of the handicaps and competitive 
disadvantages often faced is lack of access to the Internet and high 
technology types of facilities.
<P>
	I am pleased that the Minister of Industry has recognized this 
need. We are starting to see some very concrete programs such as 
the community access program and the school net program. These 
are important initiatives being undertaken by the Minister of 
Industry. They are making an impact in my riding and in other rural 
areas of the country. Obviously the minister intends to do more and 
I support this. I look forward to his initiatives in the weeks and 
months to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret, but members will each have their 
turn. The hon. member for Okanagan Center, briefly please.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the hon. member on his remarks. He did a good job as 
he usually does on the industry committee. I was very interested to 
hear him.
<P>
	I would like to address a question concerning three programs 
through which government moneys are distributed: the Business 
Development Bank of Canada,  the community futures program 
and the regional development programs.
<P>
	Would the hon. member please comment on the following. Is it 
not somewhat confusing to rural people to have so many different 
ways of looking at these things? Could these things be 
co-ordinated? What is his opinion about doing some of this in a 
more co-ordinated fashion instead of having one bureaucracy that 
deals with community futures, another that deals with the Business 
Development Bank of Canada and a third one that deals with 
regional development corporations which often become very little 
more than a political patronage type of agency?
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has made a very good 
point. It is absolutely essential that there be a one stop delivery 
component or window for small business, not only in rural Canada 
but in urban Canada.
<P>
	That is why the Minister of Industry has begun a pilot project 
called the Canada-Ontario Business Centre which will do just that. 
It will allow business people to go to one location to see all the 
various products the government and the private sector offers to 
assist them with their businesses. It is essential that there be one 
place to go rather than spending time shopping around. The 
minister recognized that need and he is working toward it.
<P>
	To my colleague in the Bloc, I look forward to working with him 
in the coming weeks and months to see that the program is rolled 
out across Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to give our 
colleague one minute?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time allotted has expired. Is there 
unanimous consent to give one minute to the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to be very 
brief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. I am anxious to put a question to the hon. member because 
I very seldom hear anything about rural communities in this House, 
particularly from that side.
<P>
	The Eastern Quebec Development Bureau, as well as the 
operations Dignity, got started in our region 25 years ago. At the 
time, we worked very hard with people from various organizations. 
These were real people in that they took charge of their destiny. 
Twenty-five years later, I can see that the rural community is still in 
serious trouble.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="335"> 335 </A></B>
<P>
	Governments do not really seek to help us. I could talk about 
that for a long time. For example, we want to build a small 
slaughterhouse because we have to travel 100 kilometres to have 
our cattle slaughtered; we cannot do it locally, because federal 
standards force us to go elsewhere.
<P>
	The Eastern Quebec Development Plan was abolished last year. 
That plan provided direct support to silviculture workers and 
helped land owners to get into forest management.
<P>
	We also had, as everyone else in Canada, infrastructures. I want 
to put a question to the hon. member. In rural communities, what 
purpose did the infrastructure program serve, other than building 
sewers, sidewalks and roads? Such activities provide temporary 
employment, but they never create permanent jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, that reminds me of a question that 
was asked in the first debate on the throne speech about the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	It is not simply about the short term jobs that may be created by 
building a new sewer or road. What we need and what we lack in 
some places in rural Canada is infrastucture. When this program 
builds a new road or sewer system and unserviced lots are now 
serviced, the ability to attract business and economic activity and 
to create jobs is enhanced for the long term.
<P>
	I think the program worked well in rural Canada. It delivered 
what it was supposed to deliver and it will lead to long term jobs. It 
is doing that right now.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to permit 
another question?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand today to support the speech from the 
throne which is the government's formal statement with respect to 
its plans for the new session of Parliament which started on 
February 27.
<P>
	In this speech from the throne the government is setting out its 
directions, its policies, its skeleton legislation for the second 
session of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	While the speech from the throne is set out in general terms, as is 
the case with most speeches from the throne, in my view the 
general directions are good. There seems to be a return to what I 
would describe as traditional Liberal positions.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	There are three main themes in the speech from the throne. The 
first is economic growth and jobs. The expressions of intent by the 
government are first class and praiseworthy especially with respect 
to young Canadians.
<P>
	The second theme is security, security for those who will retire 
through their pensions, security for those who are sick through our 
national health care system, and security for the unemployed 
through an unemployment insurance system. There are also 
proposals with respect to security for our environment, security 
against crime and security in the international arena where we have 
had so much conflict in recent years.
<P>
	The third theme in the speech from the throne is with respect to 
national unity. I will say more about this in a few minutes.
<P>
	The details from the speech from the throne are fleshed out in 
due course following the speech. They are fleshed out in the 
government's actual legislation and in statements by ministers of 
the government. We will all be looking very closely at the 
government's legislative bills to ensure these bills remain true to 
the statements in the speech from the throne and also remain true to 
our election promises in the Liberal red book.
<P>
	I still remain concerned with the high level of unemployment in 
the country. I remain concerned with the amendments to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. I remain concerned with the 
development of the Canada health and social transfer and with 
respect to the proposals for pension reform which we expect to 
receive very soon.
<P>
	With respect to the unemployment insurance amendments which 
were tabled near the end of the last session, there were some good 
provisions in Bill C-111 but others in my view were unfair and 
draconian. It is unacceptable that we should consider cutting the 
benefits of those at the low end of the benefit scale.
<P>
	At the low end of the scale one receives approximately $500 a 
month. This is hardly enough to live on, hardly enough to pay one's 
rent, to buy one's food and the other basic needs of life. 
Consequently I cannot accept that we should lower these low end 
benefits. By doing so all we really do is shift those individuals on to 
the welfare rolls of the province and they end up being paid for by 
the very same taxpayers but in a more demeaning and difficult way.
<P>
	I am anxiously awaiting the changes to the UI bill which will be 
introduced by the new minister. He said when he was sworn in that 
he had in mind making certain changes. We also expect that some 
changes will be made to the bill following the public hearings in a 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	I have only 10 minutes and cannot deal with all the subjects I 
would like to discuss in that time. As a Montrealer I want to spend 
some time on the national unity issue. The federalists, the no side, 
won the referendum in October. However, the margin was so thin 
that we have been left with a serious state of uncertainty which has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="336"> 336 </A></B>
<P>
caused extreme harm to the national economy,  especially in 
Montreal, but also to the whole province of Quebec.
<P>
	I am pleased with the initiatives the government is taking to 
promote national unity and to deter another divisive and harmful 
referendum. First, I give my full support to the so-called plan A. It 
involves programs to inform Canadians about the benefits of 
Confederation, to promote Canadian achievements, to improve the 
operation of Confederation and to make it more effective for 
ordinary Canadians in all parts of the country.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	We must demonstrate to Canadians in Quebec and elsewhere in 
this country that our two official languages, French and English, 
are a great asset and not a burden. Unlike many other countries 
Canada can do business in English and French: diplomacy, 
research, literature, theatre, films, television, music in English and 
French. These are outstanding assets which we should promote and 
use to our benefit. In no way should the asset of our bilingual 
policy be attacked and diminished. We have to convince Canadians 
of that.
<P>
	I was also pleased with the statement in the speech from the 
throne that the government will promote exchanges in Canada so 
that Canadians, especially young Canadians, can get to know their 
country better and get to know other Canadians better. Prejudice 
builds and is fostered in a situation where we do not really know 
each other, do not talk to each other and do not really know each 
other's homes. I would fully support those initiatives referred to in 
the speech from the throne.
<P>
	The government's emphasis and my emphasis is on this plan A 
approach. Our priority and preference is to make Confederation 
work better, to sell the benefits of Confederation and to see that 
Canadians know what is involved in the Confederation agreement.
<P>
	The government has also mentioned what might be called plan 
B. I refer to a few lines in the speech from the throne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But as long as the prospect of another Quebec referendum exists, the 
Government will exercise its responsibility to ensure that the debate is 
conducted with all the facts on the table, that the rules of the process are fair, that 
the consequences are clear.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Such an approach is necessary because until now the agenda on 
these matters has been principally controlled by the PQ 
Government of Quebec. That government decided when it would 
have referendums. It decided how often it would have referendums, 
what the question would be and what the process would be. These 
decisions affect not only the province of Quebec but the unity and 
the continued existence of one of the greatest and longest lasting 
democracies in the world. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	It is essential that some reality be injected into this discussion. It 
is appropriate that this be done by the federal government, which 
must ensure that whatever is done is done in accordance with well 
established  principles of democracy and law. The rule of law must 
prevail. In this respect the federal government must make 
absolutely clear that constitutional referendums, such as we have 
had recently in Quebec and in Newfoundland, have no binding 
consequences either legally or constitutionally. At the very best 
such referendums are only advisory and a possible basis for 
negotiation.
<P>
	Referendums give no right to unilateral declarations for any kind 
of constitutional change, let alone to a unilateral declaration of 
independence. Of course a strong yes vote in a referendum would 
have political consequences, not legal consequences. It would 
provide a certain impetus for negotiation, but that is all.
<P>
	Furthermore, the federal government should make clear that 
referendum results will not even be the basis for negotiation unless 
certain conditions are fulfilled. I suggest the following: first, the 
question must be clear, direct and unambiguous; second, the 
referendum and voting process must be fair and equitable; third, 
the majority required to proceed to negotiation, the next step, must 
be substantial, not marginal.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	In other words, we should have a majority that is at least 
equivalent to the majority required for constitutional amendment. 
No country in the world allows constitutional amendments by the 
simple legislative process.
<P>
	We must affirm in our policy that Canada is a federal state which 
has been internationally recognized and has successfully 
functioned for over 129 years, and that federal jurisdiction and 
sovereignty exist in all provinces.
<P>
	The continued existence of such a state cannot be threatened by 
marginal decisions on ambiguous referendum questions. Steps to 
divide or separate such a state can be taken only after considerable 
deliberation of all relevant factors, unequivocal and conclusive 
agreement by all parties and in accordance with the basic principles 
of democracy and the rule of law. I believe this is essential as we 
continue with this discussion in this country. It is important that the 
realities of the situation be made known to everyone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first part of 
his speech, the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce indicated one 
again that he favours maintaining social programs. He said so on 
many occasions during his long parliamentary career; he has 
always been very consistent on this point, even in the last few 
months. We have to salute him for this.
<P>
	In the second part of his speech, which dealt with the 
Constitution issue, he showed the same consistency. However, I do 
not think that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, can agree with him when 
he says that, in the event of another referendum, a bigger majority 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="337"> 337 </A></B>
<P>
might be required.  To start with, I have this question for him: In his 
opinion, what percentage would be acceptable?
<P>
	On the other hand, he said that extensive consultations would 
have to take place. I do not have the same parliamentary experience 
as the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, but I have been in 
politics long enough to know, as many Quebecers do, that 
constitutional negotiations have been going on for 30 years and that 
they are leading nowhere. Let us remember 1982, Meech and 
Charlottetown. The member has witnessed many reports, the 
Spicer commission and hearings; all for naught. What does he 
expect?
<P>
	I believe that, in this matter, he cannot claim naivety. It cannot 
be said that the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is naive; he has 
too much experience. What I cannot accept is that he wants to 
increase the percentage needed in a referendum. Now that we know 
that the sovereignists needed only 0.6 per cent to obtain a majority, 
he wants to increase that criterion.
<P>
	I would like to ask him what he thinks of the support received by 
the Maastricht accord in various European countries. In seven 
countries, I beliebe it was was carried by a majority of between 50 
and 52 per cent. Is the hon. member questioning these referendum 
results which have led to the accession of some countries to the 
European union and which, by the same token, forced those 
countries to give up part of their sovereignty? Does he find that 
inacceptable?
<P>
	I really would like to appeal to the democratic principles of the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and ask him to tell us what he 
thinks of what I have just said. Also, while we are at it, could he tell 
us what he thinks of plan B which is being promoted by a certain 
Liberal candidate and which talks about the fragmentation of 
Quebec. I would like to know what he thinks of it because of his 
long parliamentary experience. I await his answer.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
questions.
<P>
	To begin with, I did not suggest we needed long consultations. I 
agree with him that the discussions have gone on for a long while 
and they need not go on for another long period of time.
<P>
	What I was suggesting, which would be my plan B, and what I 
thought the government had in the speech from the throne, is that 
there must be some understanding with respect to the clarity of the 
question. What I was saying is that one should not be able to break 
up a country that has existed for 129 years on a vague and 
ambiguous question with a marginal vote.
<P>
	If the question was absolutely clear and direct, that would be 
fine. For example, in the last referendum the question referred to an 
accord. I met many people as I campaigned who thought the 
reference to an accord was to an accord between the federal 
government and the provincial governments. Whereas it really 
referred to an agreement between the three parties that supported 
the yes position. There was reference to a very complicated bill. I 
read it but most people who voted in the referendum did not.
<P>
	What we need are not long consultations, but to respect 
democracy and the rule of law there should be a clear, direct, 
unambiguous question.
<P>
	I suggested that the majority should be more than a simple 
majority for legislation. There were never any rules with respect to 
majority. It is not that we are changing the rules now. The federal 
government never laid down any rules. As a matter of fact, we 
simply sought to win the referendum campaigns that were put to us 
by the provincial government. However, we did not say these 
should be the rules. I believe we should now say there are rules but 
we are not changing existing rules.
<P>
	With respect to what the majority should be, I do not know. I 
have no suggestion to make now but I think that could be worked 
out. Certainly even to amend a club Constitution, even to amend 
the charter of a corporation one does not follow the simple 
procedures one does to pass simple bylaws or simple legislation. To 
amend the Constitution of this country we require two-thirds of the 
provinces representing 50 per cent of the population.
<P>
	I do not speak only of referendums coming from Quebec because 
we recently had another one in Newfoundland with respect to 
removing the rights of religious minorities in schools. On 
Referendums on constitutional issues anywhere in the country that 
would have the effect of changing some very basic provisions, we 
should have an understanding as to what the rules of the game 
should be.
<P>
	The results of these referendums affect the whole country. I 
cannot accept when some of my colleagues in the Bloc and the 
Parti Quebecois say this affects only Quebec. It does not affect only 
Quebec. It will affect the whole country. As a matter of fact, it 
could affect North America to a certain extent.
<P>
	The rules of the game have to be clear. I believe in democracy if, 
to a clear question, there is a substantial majority, although I cannot 
say what that substantial majority should be, and it is clear that the 
people of Quebec want to say yes to a clear question on this issue. It 
is then clear that we have to negotiate. We have to also make clear 
that the results of the referendum alone have no legal or 
constitutional consequences but are simply a basis for negotiation, 
much different than many people thought when they voted the last 
time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="338"> 338 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the throne speech, 
although I feel that what I should do is go to <I>Hansard</I> and pull 
out the last throne after the last election and repeat myself because 
there really is not much there that is new.
<P>
	I will make an effort, though, to address a couple of things. I 
want to talk a bit about the enormous statement in the throne 
speech regarding justice. It is a little paragraph of about seven 
lines. There was nothing there to speak of but I will try.
<P>
	However, before I do that I would like to get into a couple of 
things that were not in the throne speech which I think ought to be. 
I did hear a throne speech from the people, very capably delivered 
by our member for Beaver River. I would much rather speak to that 
one because there is some awfully good stuff in there.
<P>
	What was not in this one is something that is of major concern to 
Canadians all across the land. I have been doing lots of travelling 
and talking to people from lots of places from coast to coast, the 
grassroots. They say when legislation comes out of this room it 
should reflect the wishes of the people. I could not agree with them 
more, absolutely correct. Legislation that comes from this place 
ought to reflect, must reflect, the wishes of the taxpayers, the 
wishes of the people.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	When one operates as we operate in this room, one takes the 
Prime Minister and a handful of front row fellows or ladies who 
might be in charge of some portfolio who go behind closed doors 
somewhere, then emerge and tell their caucus members they will 
have employment equity and they will vote yes, that they are going 
to have gun control and that they will vote yes, that they are going 
to have this and they will vote yes, that they will have that and that 
they will vote yes. If they do not, they will be punished. They could 
even get kicked out of the party. That is not a democracy. That is 
not legislation according to the will of the people. That is 
dictatorship.
<P>
	The people I talked to would like to see that come to an end. The 
people in this place should have the ability and the opportunity to 
represent the people who sent them here. That is not a whole lot to 
ask for. It is thoroughly disgusting when they come from behind 
closed doors and are ordered by a small group on what should take 
place.
<P>
	I will read from a newspaper statement. It was a description of 
what one citizen felt was wrong with this. I used this line quite a bit 
across the country: ``Our country is ruled by unelected, dictatorial 
and imposed judiciaries who were put into place by a self-serving 
parasitic fraternity''.
<P>
	That is pretty strong but that is exactly how people are beginning 
to feel. The kinds of decisions made are not  reflecting their wishes. 
There are things happening in this wonderful land-it is the best in 
the world, I agree and I sure want to keep it that way-that do not 
reflect their opinions. Decisions made at parole boards are an 
example, or decisions at a refugee board or some other judiciary 
body. No one is accountable for any of these decisions and that is 
what they do not understand it.
<P>
	I would really like to see a throne speech address these things, 
saying we will have a little better democracy than what we have 
been accustomed to. For a change, we will allow the people to 
debate an issue before the decision is made, not after.
<P>
	What a farce to stand in the House of Commons and debate an 
issue that is supposed to be decided here when it has been decided 
five days before. Is that democracy? No, it is not. That is the kind 
of thing they would like to see from a throne speech in my riding, 
something that would change and make them feel like they are 
having a little more say in how their country is run. That is not a 
whole lot to ask for.
<P>
	When we get to the judicial part, I have to really smile. I saw the 
Minister of Justice stand in his place the other day answering 
questions, saying to the Reform Party: ``You did not vote for Bill 
C-37. You did not vote for Bill C-41. You did not vote for Bill 
C-45. You did not vote for Bill C-68. Therefore you are the bad 
guys. You are the ones who are not looking after our victims'', et 
cetera.
<P>
	In most cases every one of those bills was highly debated with 
amendments put forward that addressed the victims. That is what 
was defeated from that side of the House. There was no concern for 
the victims when these amendments were offered on their behalf. 
Do not point across the way; point at yourselves when those 
decisions are made.
<P>
	Look at some of the headlines across the land: ``Small schools''. 
One does not get this in national news but in community news all 
the time: ``Parents fear violence at high school escalating''. That is 
happening across our land.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Do I hear anything from this party regarding the violence in 
schools? I have gone into the schools and asked: ``Are any of you 
frightened? Do you have any fear''? They all are. There are 
problems out there. I hear nothing from over there except a lot of 
rhetoric.
<P>
	Then they say we have the Young Offenders Act, Bill C-37. Bill 
C-37 was supposed to do something. I have a hard time 
understanding how that document could be accepted by the 
government and at the same time it instructs the justice committee 
to travel across the land to see what people want done with the 
Young Offenders Act. I thought that was supposed to fix it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="339"> 339 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me read an article that came out of my local newspaper 
about a 16-year old girl who was charged for assault. She bashed 
a girl's head against a brick wall: ``Mid way through the court 
proceedings the crown prosecutor asked the judge to instruct the 
accused to take the matter before the court more seriously. The 
girl and friends in the gallery were apparently laughing and joking 
among themselves as the judge spoke''. I have been to court and 
I have seen these things and that is how they take it.
<P>
	I have spoken to kids in schools and asked: ``What do you think 
about the Young Offenders Act''? They tell me it is a joke: ``If you 
think I am not going to be afraid or that I am going to try and help 
the crime problem by ratting on somebody, forget it. There is no 
protection for me''.
<P>
	Even worse, I have an article quoting a top notch lawyer, an ace 
lawyer, a really good one. I am told he is a tremendously good one 
from the Vancouver area by the name of Russ Chamberlain: ``The 
pushy Richmond lawyer, champion of culprits, says `crime, 
victims and citizens, anti-crime groups, are blood thirsty whiners 
wanting revenge'''. That is how he talks about the victims. Then he 
goes on to say: ``Crime victims want an eye for an eye. They want 
someone else to fix their petty problems and that their pitch for 
personal vengeance can improperly affect a jury's verdict. Victim 
impact statements are just venting the spleen and do not serve 
justice and should be outlawed, banned completely''.
<P>
	I have a few more quotes. One is a lawyer in the legal system, a 
top notch lawyer making these kinds of statements: ``Petty 
grievances, weepy tears. Victims are not doing any good for us in 
our wonderful justice system''. He must be a card carrying Liberal.
<P>
	Another article is from a president of a Liberal association. 
Guess what the president of this Liberal association says. He is 
from Fraser Valley West, talking about the rally we had concerning 
victims the other night, a successful rally with 2,200 people: ``The 
rally is an easy emotional heart string puller for an extremely 
complex problem''. I do not like using this language, but it is 
quote: ``It is easier to sit here and piss and moan for 20 minutes''. 
That is getting to be very common language in the House. I guess 
that is a new word they learned on that side of the House and they 
are spreading it around.
<P>
	We have comments from a president of a Liberal association 
who says that victims are sitting around whining and moaning and 
that it is doing no good, but 2,200 people came to that rally and 
they were not all victims. Many were, but not all of them. They are 
angry.
<P>
	The government ought to be ashamed of itself that the best it 
could come up with in a throne speech is seven lousy little 
sentences when the problem concerns the whole country. It ought 
to get out and take a look.
<P>
	In the two and a half years I have been here we finally have 
something. It is from my colleague from Fraser Valley West, 
victims' rights. We will be fighting for that.
<P>
	According to everything I have seen, we will not see much of a 
response from that side. We have not seen it in the past and I do not 
expect to see it in the future. If I thought for a minute there was any 
hope, then section 745 would be out of the Criminal Code today. It 
has been demanded by Canadians from all across this land for two 
years that killers should not be let out in 15 years. But no, we sit 
and let it die. We do not bring important things like that up. We talk 
about horses or what should be the national sport.
<P>
	If the government were serious about doing something about 
crime it would wake up and pay attention to what is happening. It 
had better start. I do not care what kind of qualifications this 
minister has. If the best he can do is what he has done in the past 
two and a half years, he ought to quit. He is doing a lousy job and 
he ought to resign. He has done nothing except produce documents 
that are very controversial all across the land.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	If the Liberals had any dissension within their own group they 
were scolded. They were scolded because they voted against Bill 
C-41. They were scolded because they voted against the gun law. 
There were darn good reasons why they should have voted against 
those bills.
<P>
	Let us get some democracy back in this House. Let us get some 
people in here who are dedicated to doing the job. Let us represent 
the people across this land and quit being so self-serving and I will 
applaud this place forever.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> I want to raise a 
number of questions with my colleague.
<P>
	The first one is with respect to his first comment which was an 
indication that the legislation should reflect the people's wishes. I 
do not have a lot of difficulty with that assertion. Could the 
member tell us how many people in the ridings his party represents 
were or were not in favour of gun control and whether or not his 
colleagues voted in line with the people's wishes on that 
legislation?
<P>
	The second question is with respect to debate. A point was made 
that decisions are already made before we debate. It was my 
understanding in a number of instances, for example peacekeeping, 
that we did have the debate before the decision was made, but 
perhaps the member has information that I do not have.
<P>
	Perhaps I can get the member's reaction to my final comment. 
He did point out that apparently someone who was a Liberal and 
who was the president of an association had made some remarks 
with respect to a particular meeting which he disagreed with. I 
would caution him in suggesting that because one remark can tar 
the whole group. He is not without knowing there have been quotes 
from Reformers, and I could help him  with some quotes if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="340"> 340 </A></B>
<P>
necessary, that are considered racist, and I do not necessarily think 
that can be applied to the whole party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I can remember all the 
questions. I am getting old, but I will try to remember them. I think 
there were three.
<P>
	In regard to gun control, let me start with my own riding. 
According to all the efforts we made to find out, 86 per cent of the 
people opposed it. However in a neighbouring riding in the city of 
Calgary I believe there was one riding where it was determined that 
they supported it. In Vancouver, if I am not mistaken, there was one 
riding that supported it. Those two members voted for the gun law 
and guess what? They did not get scolded. Most of us happened to 
vote against it and no one got scolded for it because we were 
representing the people.
<P>
	It is hard to tell but every place I go to the question of the gun 
legislation always comes. It is simply a matter of people asking 
whether or not it is going to go through. They do not seem to realize 
that it has received royal assent and they do not understand exactly 
what it is all about. As near as I can tell, most who attend the 
meetings I am at are opposed to it if they are in the rural setting. In 
the urban setting it is not usually an issue.
<P>
	The member mentioned one decision that was made prior to 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> The reverse, where there has been a debate 
without the decision having been made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> There has been debate without the decision 
having been made. I am sorry. My reference was to decisions that 
are made and debate followed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Yes, but there are instances where that is not the 
case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I would hope so. I would not hope it is not 
always like that. I would hope that the decisions are not ever made 
until it is debated but I know that is not the case and that is a real 
problem.
<P>
	I have forgotten the last question. I knew I would forget one.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague had quoted a 
gentleman who had supposedly made some remarks with regard to 
a rally or meeting. I think there might have been an attempt to 
suggest that everyone in the party was as such.
<P>
	I simply pointed out there have been some remarks identified as 
racist that have been made by Reformers but that does not suggest 
that all Reformers are racist. I think we have to be very careful with 
that kind of commentary. I can produce those remarks if my 
colleague doubts my honesty on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not get a question out of that; 
I got a statement and some advice. That advice is well taken. I have 
certainly been painted and tarred with a brush that does not hold 
true to me.
<P>
	The point is it was made public in a newspaper by a leader of a 
group. When people are in those positions they ought to be a little 
more sensitive toward the needs of the people that were being 
represented at this rally, who were the victims. That certainly was 
not the case.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to reply to the government's throne speech 
delivered last week. By tradition the throne speech outlines the 
government's vision for the nation which will ultimately be 
reflected in a legislative agenda presented in this second session of 
the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I became politically active out of my concern for the future 
direction of our society and to address the problems that our 
families from across the country are facing.
<P>
	In examining this throne speech and this government's record, it 
is clear to me that this government has failed to acknowledge the 
problems and challenges facing the Canadian family. In doing so 
the government has ignored the foundation of our society, which is 
the family.
<P>
	As the Reform Party's family issues critic I have concluded that 
family is not seated at Mr. Chrétien's throne.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> To the hon. member, we are all freshly 
back here and we cannot refer to each other by our names. We have 
to say the member or the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's throne.
<P>
	I put to you a simple question: Are Canadian families in a better 
position than they were before this government was elected? The 
record shows that like its predecessors, Liberal government policy 
continues to attack your family and mine.
<P>
	Families are overtaxed due to government overspending. A 1995 
Fraser Institute study found that taxes on the average Canadian 
family rose by 1,167 per cent from 1961 to 1994. In 1984 average 
family after tax income was $43,204, while in 1993, 10 years later, 
it was $43,225. In other words, after tax family income had risen by 
$21 in 10 years. For the family, this has meant less disposable 
income to spend on their children, less to invest in their family's 
future, and less choice.
<P>
	Many will claim that this level of taxation is justified by our 
excellent social programs. Reform believes that social programs 
must be targeted to those most in need. Why would we make such a 
statement? Does present government policy really serve Canadian 
social policy now and in the future?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="341"> 341 </A></B>
<P>
	According to a recent study, Ottawa's fiscal mismanagement 
and unsustainable social programs mean that the next generation 
will be paying in taxes double the amount that they will receive 
in benefits. In spite of this the budget to be tabled on Wednesday 
will most likely include more tax increases such as perhaps the 
gasoline tax increase. My constituents in Port Moody-Coquitlam 
have sent me to say that they vehemently oppose gas tax increases.
<P>
	Need I remind you that this government proposed to scrap the 
GST during the last election campaign. The throne speech however 
simply replaces the GST with a national sales tax. It is another of at 
least 26 broken or forgotten Liberal promises.
<P>
	The government's record stands in contrast to Reform's 
approach to home economics. In our address to the people 
delivered before the government's throne speech, we outlined the 
feedback we have received from Canadians. In that address we 
stated that Canadians will look to government to introduce: a plan 
to eliminate, not just reduce, the federal deficit by 1997-98, and a 
proposal for tax relief to stimulate job creation and improve 
consumer confidence by leaving more dollars in the pockets of 
Canadians; and a commitment to reform the tax system to make it 
simpler and fairer.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	These initiatives would create the financial flexibility that 
families need and deserve so that they, not the government, can 
decide what their priorities should be. Just as families must balance 
their books, so too must the government. Yet the government's 
throne speech offers no such vision and no such hope for Canadian 
families.
<P>
	Another issue that is of concern to families is the care and raising 
of their children. It is interesting to note that the rise of the two 
income family is directly related to their financial decline caused 
by higher taxation and less disposable income.
<P>
	The economic necessity of the two income family is at variance 
with the wishes of many Canadian parents. A 1994 Angus Reid poll 
found that 40 per cent of Canadian parents who work would rather 
stay home to raise their children if they could afford to do so.
<P>
	What is the approach of this government? Last December an 
ill-prepared human resources development minister announced an 
insulting child care program. It was a $720 million insult to 
taxpayers, a $720 million insult to parents who do not believe in an 
all knowing nanny state, a $720 million program that was an insult 
to parents who want a choice.
<P>
	The throne speech completely failed to recognize the critical 
need to expand the choices and options available to parents in 
providing care for their children. The negative consequences of 
institutional day care that the government espouses are starting to 
come to light. A recent study by Dr. Mark Genuis of the National  
Foundation for Family Research and Education found that 
non-parental child care has direct implications for the family and 
society. The study stated that ``insecure bonding to parents in 
childhood is a direct cause of clinical levels of emotional and 
behavioural problems in adolescence, including youth crime''.
<P>
	A proactive, family friendly, innovative proposal would be to 
convert the child care expense deduction into a child care tax 
credit. Currently the child care expense deduction is available only 
to those parents who use non-parental child care. Other methods of 
child care, for instance home care, are not eligible for that 
deduction.
<P>
	My colleague put forward Bill C-247 which addressed this 
problem. That was stifled by this government. This proposal would 
have expanded the options and choices available for parents by 
recognizing that there are many superior forms of child care the 
government can and should promote.
<P>
	Another issue related to children and family is that of child 
support payments and their enforcement. Inaction by this 
government has meant that the needs of custodial and 
non-custodial parents and their children have been left unattended 
by this government through the first half of its mandate.
<P>
	Last April the Reform caucus agreed to a position on this issue. 
We believe that families should be treated equally within the tax 
system. We believe that awards for child support must be 
consistent and fairly taxed. Our principle is that support is not 
income but the fulfilment of an obligation of a parent to their 
children. The tax deduction that a non-custodial parent currently 
has would be eliminated and the additional revenues could be 
targeted directly toward families and children in need.
<P>
	Of greater importance, I would expect the government's 
proposal to address the issue of fair and effective determination of 
child support orders. One innovative reform is that of the unified 
family court which would emphasize mediation rather than the 
present litigation. It would reduce the adversarial nature of 
resolving issues such as child support payments should family 
breakdown occur. The unified family court is already implemented 
in some jurisdictions such as Ontario and Saskatchewan. I have 
introduced a private member's motion in the House to debate this 
reform. Child support decisions must be family support decisions.
<P>
	The throne speech made reference to a growing crisis of 
confidence in the United Nations. This crisis of confidence seems 
very well deserved. Last year the UN committee that monitors 
implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
the Child recommended that Canada become a spank free zone by 
abolishing section 43 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	It is that section which provides parents with the legal protection 
to reasonably discipline their children. That is a prerogative that 
has been long recognized in our law  and by parents. Such a 
domestic policy should not undermine the family. Neither should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="342"> 342 </A></B>
<P>
international policy and activity have that effect. The convention 
on the rights of the child and the more recent Beijing platform for 
action have real consequences that are identifiable.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Prior to even attending the UN-Beijing conference on women, 
the government announced its federal plan for gender equality. Do 
Canadian families know that the government has put gender 
feminists in power to analyse and prioritize every policy decision 
in 24 federal departments and agencies? Does this reflect the 
priorities of Canadians and Canadian families? I think not. I know 
not.
<P>
	There must be greater accountability for the effect and impact 
the UN and the international obligations that the government 
makes in our name. For instance, the Beijing platform for action 
will have sweeping ramifications for the future direction of our 
public policy and yet it was never presented or even talked about in 
this House. It is with this in mind that I have introduced a motion to 
debate this accountability issue.
<P>
	In conclusion, families are not better off than they were before 
the 1993 election. In my judgment, the throne speech reflects on a 
government that will continue to place many other priorities ahead 
of Canadian families. The priority of the government should be the 
future. The Prime Minister characterized that future as one of 
tolerance, respect, generosity and sharing.
<P>
	The birthplace and nurturing of these qualities are not at the 
spigot of government programs but in the homes across the land. 
These qualities are not found in a government endorsed call to arms 
for the rights of women or the rights of children but instead are 
found in the strength and unity of our families.
<P>
	The government's throne speech talks of a caring society and 
social union. Such ideals are not achieved through intrusive, 
activist and expansive government programs. They are best 
achieved through a strong and compassionate society, sustainable 
for future generations that has at its heart and as a foundation 
strong, viable and stable Canadian families.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam for her remarks because I find myself very 
sympathetic to her position on the family.
<P>
	During the election campaign, I well remember canvassing from 
door to door in an urban portion of my riding. I went past house 
after house where no one was home, where the houses had a double 
garage and double driveway but the house itself was very small. It 
was very clear that both parents were away. The children were 
either in local day care or elsewhere. Therefore, the member brings 
up a very important point.
<P>
	However, the member was a little unfair when she suggested that 
the economic necessity of both parents working is a result of 
taxation. I suggest to her that it is a trend that has occurred as a 
result of changes in the labour force, changes in the marketplace 
and changes in the global economy.
<P>
	I wonder if she has taken that into account and has any 
suggestions on how one could address that in the context of the 
economic necessity of both parents working.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. I too look at 
the streets of my neighbourhood and my city and have visited other 
communities across Canada. I have talked to many Canadians 
about this very issue.
<P>
	It is true that more choice is available to Canadians. More 
women have the opportunity to work. It is also true that the cost of 
living, the demands on families and the effect of the dollar that they 
receive in income which has continually been eroded to where 
there are statistics that state that it now takes twice the working 
hours to support a family than it did 25 years ago. When that 
statement is taken to its logical conclusion, it almost demands two 
people working to do that.
<P>
	When we talk about average family income being the same, that 
means that more women actually have entered the workforce in the 
last 25 years to make up the difference to maintain that standard of 
living.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	As I mentioned in my speech, 40 per cent of those parents who 
do work would prefer to be home. Does that tell you something? 
They are not working necessarily by choice.
<P>
	Not long ago, I read an article about a backlash that radical 
feminists are very nervous about. There is actually a trend now, 
when one talks about trends, for women to choose to stay home. 
Many women have been in the workforce and have seen that it is 
not all it is cracked up to be. The pressures and tensions are more 
than they want to take on.
<P>
	One study shows for 60 per cent of parents where both are 
working who have children below three register severe levels of 
tension just co-ordinating activities and the life that two full time 
jobs can force on them. That is being recognized by the women and 
men of this land.
<P>
	We need to step back and ask what is causing this. It is that an 
average family puts half of their earned income into taxes. It takes 
more earned hours to create a lifestyle that is affordable.
<P>
	We need to address taxation. We need to address the debt. We 
need to address the deficit first. We need to get the deficit down. 
We need to help families by giving them some relief, some hope 
that there will be tax relief so that they can make the choices 
regarding how they want to raise their families and how they want 
to afford what we force on them as a lifestyle in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="343"> 343 </A></B>
<P>
	They need choice courtesy of the government. I challenge the 
government to give them that choice by giving them tax relief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise 
in response to the speech from the throne. Might I pick up a remark 
the Prime Minister made in his address in speaking of particular 
challenges following the referendum result in Quebec.
<P>
	His comments are: ``This is not a time for major constitutional 
change. We must continue to adapt, modernize and develop our 
federation, focusing on practical steps within a spirit that respects 
the principles of federalism''. There are some profound truths in 
that statement and a recognition of the social limits to law and to 
legal change.
<P>
	I wrote in a work published a number of years ago in an earlier 
pre-parliamentary phase of my life that not all times are ripe for 
Constitution making, that it is an error to attempt a fundamental 
revision of one's constitutional, governmental system in a period of 
rapid, historical change.
<P>
	If one does produce a document in such a period, the likelihood 
is that the product will jell the process of social change. It will act 
as a brake arresting that change, and it will only lead to confusion 
and unproductive labour.
<P>
	When changes occur of a fundamental, total nature in a 
constitutional system, they are in periods of great national euphoria 
when there is a consensus, however fleeting, usually after a victory 
in a great war or a great social revolution.
<P>
	We are reminded of General de Gaulle's successful venture in 
1944 which led indirectly to the adoption of the fourth French 
Republic Constitution, and again the exercise in 1958. Or we could 
go back to the origins of the American Constitution, not so much 
the unsatisfactory articles of Confederation but the great 
Constitution which is, of course, the only Constitution older than 
our own.
<P>
	It is an important lesson to remember that in this period when 
quite clearly Canada is experiencing fundamental social change as 
a result not merely of factors common to all the world community, 
the revolution in infomatics, but also the impact of large scale 
immigration from many parts of the world on our society. I think in 
terms of the proportion of our existing population. The impact is 
far greater than earlier historical models, such as the United States 
after the revolution of 1848 in Europe, or other societies elsewhere 
in the world.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Canada in transition is really a description of the sociology of 
our country at the present time. But some parts are changing more 
quickly than others. I think, if I  may say so, with some pride my 
own special community in British Columbia is changing much 
more quickly, much more radically, much more dramatically than 
other parts of the country.
<P>
	Some have seen in this, because of the responses that it has 
produced to particular constitutional exercises like Charlottetown 
and Meech Lake before it, some opposition perhaps to other parts 
of the country and some inevitable antagonism. I think that would 
be a wrong view of an important historical process in which we 
participated.
<P>
	It is a fact that voters in British Columbia rejected the 
Charlottetown accord by a majority 70 per cent to 30 per cent. Now 
members will be aware that under provincial law we are required to 
hold a provincial referendum before any future project of 
constitutional change at the federal level can be submitted to our 
legislature for ratification.
<P>
	With respect to the Charlottetown accord, I am attempting a 
historical synthesis of obviously numbers of different opinions 
differently expressed. But there was an objection in some respects 
to a feeling of historical datedness in the approach to the 
Charlottetown accord. It was too particularistic an attitude, one that 
jelled the status quo. A good deal of this opposition focused on the 
attempt to jell the membership of the House of Commons with an 
artificial, for all time, 25 per cent quota for one province.
<P>
	The opposition was not to the province as such. The opposition 
was to jelling the constitutional institutional framework of 
government in a period of emerging great historical change.
<P>
	In making this point I will stress again that in the post 
referendum debate that has followed, no responsible British 
Columbia political leader, either federal or provincial has engaged 
in negative comments in relation to Quebec or the Quebec people. 
There have been no demands for sanctions from British Columbia 
and no talk of partition, no opposition or hostility to the Quebec 
fact as such. This does suggest that a larger constitutional optic is 
needed.
<P>
	If I tell the House that the quest for fundamental constitutional 
vision is already proceeding in my province, it is an invitation to 
join in that.
<P>
	It is a recognition that we have achieved a distinct society in our 
own right, a community of communities. It will compel substantial 
modernization of the constitutional governmental structures the 
Prime Minister spoke of in his response to the speech from the 
throne. It will necessarily affect all federal institutions: the Senate, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="344"> 344 </A></B>
<P>
the House, cabinet and Parliament. And not least, as someone who 
has been a private member without any responsibilities, even as a 
parliamentary secretary until very recently, the necessary relations 
between the House of Commons and cabinet.
<P>
	One thing being discussed with great interest is whether the 
Westminster model is out of date in terms of the end of the 20th 
century and the beginning of the 21st. Would we do better with a 
separation of executive and legislative power, not simply on the 
American model, but on the French model or more particularly the 
contemporary German model.
<P>
	Do we need better electoral laws? If we live in a community of 
communities with many different national communities, we face a 
situation as, I succeeding you, Mr. Speaker, as president of a 
committee devoted to Vietnam I recognize the reality of how 
difficult it is for Vietnamese to be elected in my province to Ottawa 
under the present electoral law.
<P>
	Is the present made in Westminister electoral law necessarily the 
most suitable for Canada at this time? I stress this by simply saying 
that the answer to the particularistic problems that have been 
expressed in Charlottetown and Meech may better be seen in a 
larger constitutional vision. If I am asked, can it be done today, the 
answer is no. I spent the last two weeks lecturing to numbers of 
groups ranging from 1,300 Catholic educators assembled in my 
province to special ethnic communities that said: ``We want to be 
part of the Constitution making process. Can we join it?'' I said: 
``Yes, you're welcome''.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	I anticipate this work will take a number of years to achieve. I do 
not expect it to be ready in the present Parliament. I think by the 
year 2000 this generation of Canadians will have a rendezvous with 
the Constitution Act.
<P>
	It can be done by a constituent assembly. The fatal flaw in most 
of these proposals is that many of the sponsors seem to think of an 
elitist group of people nominated by various other people. A 
constituent assembly has to be elected. If we follow the French 
model, the ultimate constituent assembly was the French 
Assemblée nationale, the people who drafted the fourth French 
Republic Constitution and the fifth. If the legislature were selected 
for that purpose I could see a Parliament, not the next one but the 
next one after that, elected to give us a new Constitution and with a 
one-month mandate to do so.
<P>
	In the meantime the other species of change the Prime Minister 
spoke of are proceeding. In this House I rose a year ago in defence 
of a new law on self-government for the Dene and the Metis in the 
Northwest and Yukon territories. Members of one of the opposition 
parties asked me the question: ``Is that subject to the charter of 
rights and to the Constitution?'' I said: ``It is not expressed in the 
bill but as a matter of constitutional first principles it must be so 
unless it is specifically excluded''.
<P>
	If members have read the recent Nisga'a treaty negotiated on the 
federal side by the same minister responsible for that bill, they will 
notice he has picked up the suggestion made in this Parliament 
during question period that the Nisga'a treaty and the institutions 
under it are deliberately made subject to the constitutional charter 
of rights and subject to the Constitution. This is the way, law in the 
making, the useful role that Parliament can play.
<P>
	In a similar way I was involved years ago as an adviser to two 
provincial premiers in different provinces. I gave negative advice 
on the construction of the airport at Mirabel. My opinion was 
widely quoted and in the end was not followed by the federal 
government. Clearly one was on the right side of history. One gave 
sound technical advice. Notice that the transport minister has 
moved to correct, to negate the negation in Kantian terms, by 
allowing the carriers to transfer back to Dorval. This is the 
pragmatic spirit that is present in federal-provincial relations, the 
new federalism, which is co-operative federalism, not levels of 
government fighting with each other.
<P>
	My message is, in this period of historical transition, when the 
centrifugal forces that reach their pathological outlet in Bosnia and 
places like that and the centrifugal forces, supranationalism, 
European union, these sorts of forces, are in an uneasy alliance, 
constitutional change goes on. I think we will have our rendezvous 
with the Constitution Act in its totality four or five years from now 
when this citizen activity comes to a head.
<P>
	In the meantime constitutional change is going on. It is coming 
very positively and concretely from government ministers and it is 
an invitation to all of us to take part in the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure about the pathological or the centrifugal arguments on 
any of this but I do have a question for the member that has to do 
not so much with his last comments. In his new role as 
parliamentary secretary to the fisheries minister I know he is very 
interested in fisheries issues. He must be. I am hoping he will do a 
good job of representing the concerns on the west coast where he is 
from.
<P>
	I have a concern which is echoed by many people in the fishing 
community, in sport fishing, aboriginal fishing and all the fishing 
communities. It is the decision by the federal government to 
potentially close a good number of the fish hatcheries on the west 
coast. There is nothing in the throne speech that deals with it. Is the 
parliamentary secretary to the fisheries minister prepared to 
advocate that we keep those fish hatcheries open or is he going to 
toe the line and say shut them down?
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a certain amount of past 
history that I cannot put behind me. I do not believe I have been 
noted either as a scholar or an advisor for toeing the line.
<P>
	I was invited by the Prime Minister about a week ago to assume 
a new job. Eighteen inches of briefing books arrived at my desk; 
this is included in them. I have read half of those books which is 
about 3,000 pages. I have noted the subject. I am committed to 
maintain a viable west coast salmon fishing industry by every 
means possible.
<P>
	The member will notice from public statements of the last day or 
two that we are taking a strong line in terms of maintaining our 
position under the Pacific coast salmon treaty with the United 
States. I have examined that problem but I will prefer to save my 
response until I have a little more experience with those briefing 
books.
<P>
	I will assure the hon. member in the spirit of his question that I 
will do my best to see that we maintain our west coast fisheries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, sitting here listening to the hon. member, whom I 
congratulate on his new role, I was reminded of my days as a 
student at Université de Montréal. Incidentally, I would like to 
remind the hon. member of a professor, a former colleague of his, 
with whom he published a book on constitutional review.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member is from the moderate wing of his 
party and I caught myself thinking how nice it would have been, in 
light of things to come, if he had been the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs instead of the current minister. I wish he 
had held that position because the meaning of the old Jesuit 
proverb, according to which the relevance of what you say is not 
determined by how loudly you say it, is lost on the current 
incumbent. During the referendum debate, if we had had someone 
like the hon. member to speak to on the other side, we would 
certainly have been able to lay the basis of a real dialogue.
<P>
	I know that you would like me to put a question to him, and that 
is exactly what I anm about to do. The hon. member is quite 
familiar with the constitutional background of this country, which 
rests on three main doctrines-special status, associated states and 
sovereignty-association-which I have had the pleasure of 
studying as part of a master thesis that no one has read.
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree that the partnership offer that the 
Government of Quebec put on the table during the last referendum 
campaign is the best way to achieve reconciliation between the two 
founding peoples of Canada, and would he mind rising in his place 
and telling  us whether or not, as a constitutional expert, he is 
prepared to concur with this offer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem is as follows. If we 
restrict ourselves to a definition of a certain special status, we are 
bound to fail. Back home, in my province, history shows that there 
must be a referendum on such constitutional amendments. There 
must be some evolution of the constitutional approach.
<P>
	We must consider reforming the bases of institutions such as 
Parliament, the Executive Council and its relationship with 
Parliament, and the Senate, and think about creating a 
constitutional court. You certainly remember that such an approach 
was advocated by your professors at the Université de Montréal, 
including Professor Jacques-Yvan Morin. It is in this context that 
we must examine the issues advanced by the main forces behind 
the quiet revolution.
<P>
	I have tried to show that, where I come from, there is no 
opposition in principle to Quebec or the demands of Quebecers. 
But we do want a serious constitutional approach that would 
include the constitutional demands of all the provinces and all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	I wish to thank the hon. member for his comments. As it did not 
seem to be a question, I cannot give an answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to debate the throne speech. I am 
especially pleased that since the Liberal government came to power 
over two years ago we have worked hard to meet many of our goals 
in the red book.
<P>
	Since being elected as the member of Parliament for 
Saint-Denis, my priority has been to respond to the concerns and 
improve the quality of life for the citizens of Saint-Denis, which I 
have the honour and privilege to represent in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This throne speech outlines our action plan for the second half of 
our mandate. Our objectives are the same. This throne speech 
focuses on three main themes: employment and economic growth, 
the safety of Canadians, and how to modernize the federation in 
order to strengthen Canadian unity.
<P>
	In the area of economic growth, young people are certainly the 
most important concern for me and my constituents of Saint-Denis. 
Today's young people face many obstacles before they can join the 
labour force and thus gain experience.
<P>
	The Liberal government is committed to helping young 
Canadians develop their potential, so that they can join the labour 
force, adapt to it and succeed. We must all join forces to help our 
young people find jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="346"> 346 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal government has already launched a number of 
youth programs I would now like to talk about. So far, youth 
service Canada has funded over 270 projects benefiting 4,200 
participants engaged in community activities.
<P>
	In my riding of Saint-Denis, I managed to put in place two such 
projects providing work for 25 young people. So far, almost 
$300,000 has been invested in Saint-Denis through youth service 
Canada for the creation of two small businesses.
<P>
	For example, thanks to youth service Canada, 15 young people 
in my riding will be able to start their own business. This project, 
co-ordinated by the Parc-Extension youth centre, is unique, in 
addition to meeting a specific need in this area, which is considered 
to be among the poorest in Montreal and perhaps even in Canada.
<P>
	Young people who participate in this project repair various 
pieces of sports and recreation equipment before distributing them 
among low income families. They see to the effective operation of 
their business while collecting the equipment donated.
<P>
	I think that this project in the Parc-Extension area is very 
important because, on the one hand, it will help young people 
overcome the obstacles hampering their access to the labour force 
and, on the other hand, it will help them regain confidence in 
themselves.
<P>
	Also, in the Villeray neighbourhood, Renaissance Montréal 
helped ten young people aged 18 to 24, with difficulty integrating 
into the labour force, gain work experience in the recycling and 
sale of used consumer goods.
<P>
	These two examples show that we do care about our young 
people.
<P>
	I should also mention the program for young trainees which, in 
1995-96, should help some 24,000 young people by easing the 
transition between school and work, thanks to the co-operation of 
the education, industry and community sectors. As an example, the 
Institut de formation professionnelle sur mesure, which is in my 
riding, created 13 jobs for young people, thanks to a $200,000 
federal subsidy.
<P>
	Finally, the Liberal government will rely on the spirit of 
partnership displayed by Team Canada to create jobs for young 
people. To this end, we are working in close co-operation with the 
provinces and the private sector. Moreover, as early as this 
summer, we will double the number of summer jobs for students in 
the federal public service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I welcomed this announcement that will help our youth to make 
the transition into the working world. The skills of our young 
people are Canada's greatest resource for the future.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Both government and the private sector must work together to 
provide them with opportunities. Another area where the 
government and the private sector must work together is in helping 
small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	Saint-Denis industries consist mostly of small and medium size 
businesses. Every day in my riding office I hear of small businesses 
going bankrupt or leaving Montreal. They are the only job creators 
in my riding and they need this government's support.
<P>
	While we set out a concrete strategy for small and medium size 
businesses that helped a few obtain funds and knowledge in order 
to compete in the present economy, much more must be done.
<P>
	The government has been negotiating with our financial 
institutions to assure better financing for small and medium size 
business people. It is my hope that tomorrow the finance minister 
will take a harder stance against these same institutions in his 
budget speech.
<P>
	Last year financial institutions marked record profits. My 
message to them is to provide more help to small and medium size 
businesses that continue to be the engine of Canada's economy.
<P>
	The issues the government is dealing with in Canada are being 
faced by governments around the world. Economic uncertainty and 
sustainability of social programs are issues that are being addressed 
as governments are trying to redefine themselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second theme of the speech from the throne is the security of 
Canadians. While economic growth is essential, our government 
has always felt important to ensure the sustainability of our social 
measures.
<P>
	We reiterate our commitment to medicare and to the principles 
underlying the Canada Health Act. We will also propose measures 
to sustain Canada's elderly benefits system, and particularly the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	In co-operation with the provinces, we will work to draft a bill 
designed to implement a reform of the Canada pension plan. A 
joint federal-provincial paper setting out the problems and 
challenges facing the plan has already been released for public 
consultation.
<P>
	Those are two very positive measures that have been very well 
received in the riding of Saint-Denis as well as across Canada.
<P>
	Another measure that I care a great deal about is the 
improvement of our child support system. With the particular 
objective of helping low income families, that measure will be very 
well received by women and single parent families in the riding of 
Saint-Denis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="347"> 347 </A></B>
<P>
	By acting in this manner, the government is recognizing that 
equal opportunity begins first of all with our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This measure will make the system fairer in my opinion. 
Children will no longer be caught in the middle of custody cases as 
victims and will receive the full benefits that are essential for them, 
especially in their early years. This measure is a positive step in 
helping low income, single mothers provide their children with 
basic care.
<P>
	The new employment insurance system to be implemented July 
1, 1996 also contains in my opinion several measures to help low 
income families, particularly single mothers fighting to stay above 
the poverty line.
<P>
	One of the most fundamental problems we are still dealing with 
in every corner of the globe is poverty, especially child poverty. 
1996 is the year for the eradication of poverty. The importance of 
the issue cannot be underscored. A healthy quality of life is the first 
ingredient to ensure that citizens everywhere can become 
contributing members of society.
<P>
	How is a child supposed to grow and take his or her place in our 
community if he or she does not have the bare essentials to begin 
with? Poverty, particularly child poverty, must be overcome if we 
are to regain our strength as a nation.
<P>
	Too often we associate child poverty with third world countries, 
but there are over 4 million Canadians living in poverty, of whom 
1.2 million are children. This is unacceptable in a country like 
Canada. We must as a government continue to make assistance to 
our poor our number one priority.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another major theme of the speech from the throne is 
international security. Human rights are an important element of 
Canada's foreign policy and are central to the values and concerns 
of Canadians.
<P>
	Freedom, democracy and the rule of law are the foundation of 
our action in favour of security and prosperity in the world.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am proud of the position Canada has taken on numerous issues 
involving the respect and promotion of human rights around the 
world. Canada must continue to play a leadership role in this area.
<P>
	My involvements with NATO have made me very sensitive to 
the important role Canada plays in providing its voice to the 
peaceful resolution of conflicts. It is my hope that we can maintain 
this presence and help resolve issues like the problem of Cyprus 
which, after 21, years remains unresolved.
<P>
	I wish to also applaud the initiatives the government is putting 
forward on the issue of child labour and I look forward to our active 
role in helping to solve this very serious problem.
<P>
	In addition to what I have mentioned, the throne speech 
underlines the importance that unity plays in helping to re-establish 
our economic stability. Simply put, political stability leads to 
economic stability.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our action plan to keep this country together is clear. The 
referendum held on October 30 has raised fundamental issues 
about the future of our country. Quebecers have decided to remain 
part of Canada, but not at any price. They want to see changes. As a 
matter of fact, all Canadians wanted changes. They want a more 
modern federation, a federation better suited to present day 
realities.
<P>
	The government proposes to work hand in hand with the 
provinces and all its other partners to explore new avenues and find 
new ways to operate. The Prime Minister has invited all Canadians 
to show their openmindedness and to work for change.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What unites us is greater than what divides us. The values we 
share as Canadians are as relevant as ever. As I said when I stood 
for the first time in the House, Saint-Denis is a microcosm of 
Canada. With cultural communities originating from every corner 
of the globe, we have created a unique environment of sharing and 
understanding one another. Proud to be Canadians and Quebecers, 
we showed during last October's referendum that we want to 
continue to be both.
<P>
	Political instability has led to the demise of one of the most 
beautiful cities in North America. Montreal once had the potential 
to be the jewel of the east coast. Now it is slowly becoming a has 
been city, with economic flight continuing. I lay the blame for this 
squarely on the shoulders of the Bloc and PQ leaderships whose 
shortsightedness has destroyed-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but your time is up. Is there 
unanimous consent to let the hon. member go on for a few minutes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> The Liberal government has demonstrated 
through its actions the strength of our commitment to Canadians. 
We cannot improve the situation alone. We need the co-operation 
and support of all provincial and municipal governments to 
improve Canada's economy. For my part, I will continue to work 
diligently and effectively with my government for the good of my 
constituents.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member for Saint-Denis for her interest in 
social issues. Since she represents, as she put it so eloquently, a 
riding going through very tough times, I would like to ask her a few 
short questions, so that other members can also have the same 
opportunity.
<P>
	She mentioned the youth strategy. She also talked about the 
youth service Canada program. She was pleased to say that 25 jobs 
were created in her ridings thanks to two projects. She is lucky, 
because many ridings represented by hon. members from the Bloc 
Quebecois have been unable, so far, to get anything from the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	I want to remind the hon. member that 17.2 per cent of young 
people between 15 and 24 years of age are now jobless. In Quebec 
alone, we have 143,000 young people under 30 who are currently 
unemployed. The unemployment rate in this age category did 
decrease slightly, by three-tenths of one per cent, but since Bill 
C-17 was passed, allowing the Liberal government to make the first 
cuts in the UI program, the number of welfare recipients in this age 
group has risen by 20 per cent.
<P>
	I would simply like to ask the hon. member how she can say that 
the Liberal government's employment strategy has been successful 
in the last two years, when the evidence is to the contrary.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said at the end of my speech, 
where there is political instability, there is always economic 
instability.
<P>
	As I said, I believe the Bloc Quebecois is, in a way, responsible 
for the unemployment rate in Quebec. When small and medium 
size businesses leave Quebec because they do not have the political 
stability they want, they cannot create jobs for young people.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have just one small question.
<P>
	Last year in the House Quebec started to be blamed for Canada's 
economic situation, and this is sure to continue in the months to 
come, and people began to point their fingers at the sovereignist 
movement.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my hon. colleague that there is a 
sovereignist movement in Taiwan, which is not in Canada. There 
are 51 elected sovereignist members in Taiwan who want to be 
sovereign from China and no one talks about economic insecurity 
in Taiwan. On the contrary, people want to do business there.
<P>
	The Canadian political situation is not responsible for the 
insecurity we have here, it is the Canadian debt.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not think a comparison can be made between Taiwan and Canada, 
because the sovereignty movement is not at all the same. But if one 
looks at what is going on in Montreal, as I pointed out in my 
speech, when one talks to the small and medium business owners in 
my riding of Saint-Denis, the question always comes back to the 
same point. If there is political stability, there will be job creation, 
people will be prepared to invest when they are sure that Quebec is 
staying in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the member for Saint-Denis is as follows: Unless I 
have been dreaming for a long time, is there a separatist movement 
in Newfoundland, in Ontario and in other Canadian provinces, and, 
if not, why would there be unemployment in these provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no movement in the 
other provinces, but we come back to the same question. The rate 
of unemployment among young people is higher in Quebec than in 
all the other provinces.
<P>
	Moreover, we have set up programs to correct this problem. In 
my speech, I mentioned programs for young people. I am talking 
about 25 jobs-people will say this is not much, but in a riding like 
mine with all I that I described in my speech-there are 25 young 
people who are not unemployed, who had never had the 
opportunity to work, but who were able to start up a small business. 
I find, in our present context, that the government has done things 
to improve the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on the speech from the throne delivered on 
February 27, at the opening of the second session of the 35th 
Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	I believe that this speech has no substance, and is nothing but a 
series of good intentions and vague promises. It opens the way to a 
Canada-wide referendum to decide on the future of Quebec. It 
seems to me that the federal government is denying and 
disregarding the legitimate right of the people of Quebec to decide 
its future alone, and this is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	In spite of the mounting expectations and pressing and repeated 
demands of Canadians and Quebecers, this document contains no 
real measures to stimulate the economy and create jobs. This 
speech contains nothing for regions experiencing serious 
difficulties; it contains for Montreal, which is facing serious 
problems; it contains nothing that could give hope to the people of 
my riding, Bourassa, in Montreal North, who are going through 
hard times. Given the present situation, Canadians would have had 
the right to expect a plan for economic recovery. Instead of that, the 
government of Canada puts on the table a jumble of old 
commitments  that were not honoured during the first part of its 
mandate.

	Many people are concerned about cuts in social programs, 
particularly in unemployment benefits. Employment security is a 
thing of the past. Generosity and compassion for the most 
disadvantaged in our society and protection for the most vulnerable 
tend to diminish and even disappear.
<P>
	The Canadian economy continues to stagnate. But in spite of this 
economic downturn, Canadian businesses have had record profits. 
Statistics Canada reported recently that, at the end of the 1995 
fiscal year, these profits totalled $95 billion compared to $80 
billion in 1994, an increase of 19 per cent.
<P>
	It must be said that, in 1994, business profits had already 
increased drastically during the year, from $17 billion in the first 
quarter to $23.6 billion in the last quarter. Total profits for the 1994 
fiscal year climbed by 44 per cent to reach $80 billion.
<P>
	On the other hand, salaries increased by only 0.9 per cent in 
1995, which is less than the rate of inflation. This means that 
workers saw their actual earnings decrease. In this context, I 
understand why there were many strikes and many demonstrations 
against employers, even against certain governments, including the 
government of Ontario.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to send my support and my 
solidarity to the members of the Ontario Public Service Employees 
Union who went on a strike against the budget cuts imposed by the 
Mike Harris Conservative government. This is a struggle for 
justice. I hope this conflict will not be prolonged indefinitely and 
that the Harris government will resume negotiations to sign a just 
and equitable collective agreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The speech from the throne states that economic growth depends 
on trade. True, imports create employment. The government says it 
will carry on efforts to extend NAFTA to other countries. I agree 
with the principle of liberalization of trade.
<P>
	I recently visited Chile, a country that is supposed to join 
NAFTA. However, it is on hold because of internal problems in the 
United States. The promise made by government leaders and heads 
of states in Miami in 1994 has yet to be fulfilled.
<P>
	I pointed out something to the Government of Canada. In the 
beginning, the government wanted to exclude parallel agreements 
on labour and the environment from  the negotiation of an interim 
bilateral trade agreement between Canada and Chile. I thought it 
was unfair and unacceptable on the part of the Government of 
Canada to be excluding social measures from the bilateral 
agreement between our two countries, because I believe any trade 
agreement, any trade treaty must include social measures in order 
to protect the workers and small businesses who will be affected. 
Such agreements must protect the rights of workers, in particular 
their right to form a labour union, to negociate collective 
agreements, to strike, as well as the principle of 
non-discrimination, pay equity, the minimum working age in order 
to prohibit child labour, measures concerning occupational health 
and safety, minimum wages, etc.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Fortunately, there is now, here in Ottawa, a Chilean delegation 
negotiating this agreement with the government of Canada and, 
thanks to pressures from Canadian and Chilean organized labour 
and thanks to our own pressures, the federal government has finally 
decided to negotiate such social clauses with Chile.
<P>
	The speech from the throne mentions that the government will 
review the Citizenship Act. The new Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration has already begun to make statements about that. 
There are two controversial topics: first, dual citizenship, and the 
federal government's position is not clear yet. It has only served 
one purpose: to threaten Quebecers during the last referendum with 
the loss of their Canadian citizenship, should they become 
independent.
<P>
	There are 400,000 Canadian citizens who have dual citizenship, 
some even have multiple citizenship, including a number of 
government members and ministers. When the bill comes before 
the House, I would like the government to recognize what is 
already a right in Canada, dual citizenship.
<P>
	With this bill, the government wants to strengthen national unity, 
but I believe the results speak for themselves. Once again, when the 
bill is debated, it will be apparent that there are two nations, two 
official languages, two main cultures, and indeed, two countries: 
Canada and Quebec. As far as we, in the Bloc Quebecois, are 
concerned, our position is clear. We are in favour of maintaining 
the acquired right of dual citizenship.
<P>
	Another question the minister wants to raise is that of the oath of 
allegiance to the Queen. We all know that this is a sensitive issue. 
Many English Canadians feel some attachment, even a profound 
attachment, to the Queen of England. I must say the debate on this 
point is not very fierce in Quebec. In spite of all the respect we 
have for the Queen, we feel that the reference to her in the oath of 
allegiance is somewhat a thing of the past and that Canada should 
follow the example of Australia, which eliminated any reference to 
the Queen of England in its oath of allegiance.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	When I became an MP, I did not want to take an oath of 
allegiance to a Queen that I see as a foreigner. I come from another 
country. In Chile, we did away with the King of Spain a long time 
ago. But I was told that if I wanted to become a member of the 
House, I had to swear allegiance to the Queen.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you indicate that I must conclude. I find this throne 
speech very disappointing and I think there is no vision of the 
future in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Bourassa comes from Chile, a 
country with a lot of political problems.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bourassa is an immigrant. He comes from 
a country where there is violence and instability. The hon. member 
is a refugee. Welcome to Canada, hon. member.
<P>
	I would like to ask him this: Could he tell us, from his own 
experience in Chile and now in Quebec, whether political 
instability costs jobs and creates unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. 
member for Hamilton-Wentworth for his excellent French.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is true.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> But not for what he said.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what Chile the hon. 
member is talking about, because its dictatorship is a thing of the 
past; today, there is democracy in Chile. That is why I went back 
there, to see the fruits of democracy.
<P>
	Here, dear colleagues, I do not think the economic crisis is 
attributable to what you call political instability. I think Canada is a 
very democratic country, and so is Quebec. In comparison with the 
Latin American countries I have known, there is no political 
instability. The causes of economic crises are to be found 
elsewhere: in the deficit, in government mismanagement, in an 
unfair tax system, etc. In fact, the causes have to be looked at from 
that point of view, in my opinion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 27, the federal government opened the second session of 
the 35th Parliament. At a point half-way through its mandate, 
Quebecers and Canadiens were expecting a throne speech that 
would give a little inspiration to this government, which seems to 
lack it, and a vision or, at least, some clarification as to its 
intentions.
<P>
	I have rarely seen a stranger mix of clarity and vagueness. 
During the October referendum period, the Prime Minister had 
promised the people of Quebec major constitutional and political 
changes. The throne speech confirmed that we have, on one hand, a 
government without direction on the constitutional front  and 
without any new ideas other that doubling the number of summer 
jobs for young people to solve the glaring unemployment problem.
<P>
	Changes considered as being important during a referendum 
campaign have become mere cosmetic adjustments a few months 
later.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the throne speech is a mix of clarity and 
vagueness in what it says, what it hints at, and what it does not say. 
On the clear side first: fine, noble and generous principles are 
mentioned in the throne speech. On page 1 alone, for example, we 
find at least 12 words calling for generosity, compassion, altruism 
and openness. This is clear, but these are only principles. Is there 
anything clearer than principles?
<P>
	Another example of clarity: when we are told that the federal 
government is prepared to withdraw from its functions in such 
areas as labour market training, forestry, mining and recreation. On 
the vague side, and what is more revealing, is what the government 
does not say. He neglected to say that Bill C-111 had already 
announced the transfer of occupational training to the provinces.
<P>
	Moreover, as the leader of the official opposition said, in its 
speech from the throne, the federal government has finally 
admitted that it has interfered, and still does, in areas under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. In the same breath, it undertakes 
to withdraw from certain areas and it even has the nerve to claim 
that it will turn over these areas of jurisdiction, which are not its 
own, to municipal governments or to the private sector. This is a 
strange way indeed of reversing policy.
<P>
	There is something else that does not appear in the speech from 
the throne and it is the natural tendency of the federal government 
to centralize to preserve the social union of Canada-a new 
expression that evokes many future encroachments.
<P>
	Strangely enough, the speech from the throne does not say a 
word of the fact that three other areas, namely forestry, mining and 
leisure, are also exclusive provincial jurisdictions. It does not 
mention that, besides those three areas, the federal government 
proposed in the failed Charlottetown Accord to withdraw also from 
social housing, tourism and municipal affairs.
<P>
	Is my time already over, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to allow the 
hon. member to continue? There are five minutes left.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="351"> 351 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since someone said no, the hon. member 
will have to wait for another occasion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
