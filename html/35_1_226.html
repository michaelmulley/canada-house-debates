	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have several petitions to present today with well over 2,500 
signatures from all across Canada but primarily from the province 
of Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter of rights and freedoms 
in any way which would tend to indicate societal approval of same 
sex relationships or of homosexuality, including amending the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to include in the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination the undefined phrase of sexual orientation.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXPLOSIVESACT">EXPLOSIVES ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Natural Resources)</B> 
moved that Bill C-71, an act to amend the Explosives Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise before 
you today to support Bill C-71, an act to amend the Explosives Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Explosives Act is an act of public and worker safety which 
regulates the composition, quality and character of explosives as 
well as the manufacture, importation, sale, purchase, possession 
and storage of explosives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The amendment to the Explosives Act is important for a number 
of very good reasons.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, at the present time there is no way to detect plastic 
explosives at airports. This act proposes the marking of plastic 
explosives by adding a chemical which would be detected by 
equipment at Canada's international airports and thus ward off the 
threat of terrorism.
<P>
	Second, this amendment will allow Canada to be among the first 
nations to ratify an international convention requested by the 
United Nations and co-ordinated by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization with respect to the marking of plastic 
explosives. This convention was signed in March 1991 by 40 
countries and 14 countries have already ratified the convention. 
Five of these nations, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Slovakia and 
the Czech Republic, are producer states where plastic explosives 
are manufactured.
<P>
	Third, given the fact that Canada is a world leader in vapour 
detection technology, Canadian equipment manufacturers will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14572"> 14572 </A></B>
<P>
able to take advantage of  international market opportunities for 
their products as more and more countries ratify the convention.
<P>
	Fourth, Natural Resources Canada which maintains the authority 
to inspect and approve the manufacture, distribution and storage of 
explosives in Canada will be responsible for the application of 
measures to mark plastic explosives following the proclamation of 
this amendment.
<P>
	Let me explain these reasons in greater detail. Members of the 
House will certainly remember the tragic events involving crashes 
of two passenger aircraft caused by the detonation of bombs made 
of plastic explosives. The first instance I wish to refer to involved 
Pan Am flight 103 from London which exploded over the small 
town of Lockerbie, Scotland. The other was UTA flight 772 which 
crashed in Niger, Africa. A total of 442 people were killed in these 
two crashes.
<P>
	Then of course there were the Air India tragedies involving two 
747 aircraft both of which began their journeys here in Canada. 
One crashed in the Atlantic Ocean south of the Republic of Ireland 
while the other miraculously made it to Narita International Airport 
in Tokyo, Japan, before a bomb made of plastic explosives blew up 
in the airport's baggage handling area. That bomb killed at least 
two innocent baggage handlers.
<P>
	Although the cause of the first Air India crash has never been 
officially determined there is strong belief that it was the result of a 
plastic explosive device. In any case, plastic explosives have 
emerged as the weapon of choice for terrorist groups, both for 
bombing aircraft and other targets such as public buildings because 
this type of explosive is small, powerful, stable, malleable and 
most important, difficult to detect.
<P>
	It is quite likely that if plastic explosives had been marked or 
tagged with a substance that could have been detected by 
equipment in Canadian airports it is almost certain that the Air 
India tragedies would have been avoided. Consequently, terrorists 
would be discouraged from attempting any attacks in Canada using 
plastic explosives.
<P>
	For these reasons an international effort to mark plastic 
explosives for the purpose of detection was initiated by the United 
Nations and has been co-ordinated by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization. The resulting international convention 
requires states to ensure the marking of plastic explosives to 
enhance their detectability. At the same time the convention 
requires controls over the import, export, possession and transfer of 
marked plastic explosives and the destruction of most unmarked 
plastic explosives.
<P>
	In March 1991 more than 70 states and six organizations 
attended a diplomatic conference where the convention on the 
marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of detection was 
adopted by consensus. Forty states, including Canada, signed this 
convention.
<P>
	The main features of the convention are: only plastic explosives 
as defined in the convention are required to be marked; existing 
unmarked commercial stocks of plastic explosives are to be 
destroyed within three years; an international explosives technical 
commission will be created to assess technical developments; the 
cost of Canadian participation in such a commission will be low; 
and the convention will come into force after 35 states including 
five producer states have ratified it. Canada is one of the world's 
producer states and as I mentioned previously, we will be among 
the first countries to ratify this important convention.
<P>
	It is evident that the proposed bill respects the terms of this 
convention. The proclamation of this amendment to the Explosives 
Act will ensure Canadian official ratification of this important 
international agreement.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-71 specifies that the explosives branch of Natural 
Resources Canada will take the lead role in the implementation of 
the provisions of the convention. Plastic explosives are 
manufactured by the private sector in Canada.
<P>
	Following the proclamation of Bill C-71, Natural Resources 
Canada's explosives inspectors who issue explosives factory 
licences to the private sector under delegation from the minister 
will refuse to license any manufacturing operation to make 
unmarked plastic explosives.
<P>
	Inspectors again under delegation from the minister will refuse 
import or export permits for unmarked plastic explosives. 
Inspectors could take samples of explosives to verify that they are 
marked and could seize and destroy unmarked shipments, 
unmarked stores or abandon unmarked quantities.
<P>
	The explosives branch is best placed to determine the location of 
unmarked plastic explosives and to assure control over them 
through a stringent system of licensing which would be supported 
by regular compliance inspections. Regulations would require prior 
notification of change of ownership along with a statement of the 
details of the physical transfer.
<P>
	The military agrees that it can, except in times of emergency, 
observe all of the terms of the convention. Unmarked stocks of 
plastic explosives would be incorporated in munitions or used up 
during field exercises on a priority basis.
<P>
	Transport Canada, which is responsible for the operation of 
detection equipment at Canadian airports, has indicated that the 
current technology can detect the marked plastic explosives.
<P>
	Further, the extra costs of producing detectable plastic 
explosives are expected to be negligible. The industry has been 
involved in efforts to develop substances to mark plastic explosives 
for the purpose of detection. Therefore  the industry acknowledges 
that the impact of extra costs will not be serious. The industry, the 
Canadian police community and the military were all consulted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14573"> 14573 </A></B>
<P>
throughout the process to prepare this proposed amendment to the 
existing law.
<P>
	The major consumer of plastic explosives in this country is the 
Canadian military. The construction industry is a relatively minor 
consumer using plastic explosives for the demolition of large 
buildings. Given this comparatively concentrated consumer base, it 
will be easy to monitor compliance with the amended act following 
proclamation.
<P>
	While the Canadian military has a 10-year supply of unmarked 
plastic explosives, the convention on the marking of plastic 
explosives provides for a 15-year period of grace for ratifying 
nations to use or destroy unmarked plastic explosives.
<P>
	In addition, given the low volume of plastic explosives 
compared to the volume of conventional industrial explosives, the 
challenge of enforcing the provisions of the proposed amendment 
and by extension the international convention will not pose a 
significant problem or cost to the respective regulatory bodies.
<P>
	Finally, I wish to emphasize that Canada's position as a leader in 
the development of vapour detection technologies will be enhanced 
as a result of the ratification of this international convention.
<P>
	In fact, increased foreign market penetration by Canadian 
equipment manufacturers is virtually a certainty. Therefore the 
proclamation of this amendment has the potential to help stimulate 
job creation and contribute to Canada's future economic growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, this amendment to the Explosives Act clearly 
shows the Canadian government's will to provide good 
government. We are committed to doing our part to protect the 
health and safety of passengers aboard aircraft using Canadian 
airspace and to doing everything in our power in co-operation with 
our partners around the world to ward off the threat of terrorism in 
the skies above Canada and other countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Passage of this amendment will allow Canada to ratify an 
important international convention which sends a strong message 
to terrorist groups that plastic explosives will be detected by 
equipment in our airports.
<P>
	Further, Canada's ratification of the convention will demonstrate 
our leadership among signatory nations and encourage them to 
follow our example. In addition Canada is contributing to the 
development of substances to mark plastic explosives for 
detection.
<P>
	With the ratification of the convention by more and more 
nations, Canadian manufacturers of vapour detection equipment 
will also be able to take advantage of significant marketing 
opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	As a result this proposed amendment to the Explosives Act will 
contribute to two major federal goals: job creation and Canadian 
economic growth. Moreover, the passage of this amendment will 
protect the health and safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	I urge the House give speedy passage to this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what the hon. parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Natural Resources had to say. It goes without saying 
that the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-71, an act to amend the 
Explosives Act, but I still have many questions to ask him.
<P>
	I must admit that I was surprised when I saw Bill C-71 to amend 
the Explosives Act on the orders of the day. I was also surprised not 
so much by the bill itself, although one can easily wonder, but by 
the delay, the time it took the government to react. It should be 
pointed out that this bill implements the 1991 Montreal 
Convention. The Montreal Convention was produced at the March 
1, 1991, meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization.
<P>
	The bill came five years later, give or take a month, considering 
that it was read for the first time on February 24. So, it took the 
government five years to produce a bill only a few pages long, two 
pages and a half to be more precise, giving the impression that this 
government is a bad student. Like some students, only a few, it put 
off doing its homework till the last minute, if not the last second. 
To look good in front of the international community, it has now 
seen fit, five years later, to make the Canadian explosives 
legislation consistent with the terms of the Montreal Convention.
<P>
	The impression we get from that is that this government is not 
efficient. It seems to indicate that this government is no better in 
terms of efficiency than the previous one, which we gladly got rid 
of.
<P>
	As we can see, this government is not efficient. Unfortunately, 
acting on the Montreal Convention is not the only area in which the 
government is not very efficient.
<P>
	Unemployment remains high throughout the country in spite of 
election promises and other commitments. Regions in Quebec and 
Canada are still in an extremely difficult situation in spite of 
repeated promises. This government tells us day in and day out that 
it is concerned with the economy, yet the country is going from bad 
to worse.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14574"> 14574 </A></B>
<P>
	With Bill C-71, the government is hoping to convince the public 
that it is deeply concerned with the problems associated with 
criminal use of explosives. If that were the case, it would be great.
<P>
	One wonders however what purpose this bill is intended to serve. 
Note that I said the purpose of this bill, as opposed to that of the 
government, because in my view we must distinguish between the 
two.
<P>
	Officially, the purpose of the Explosives Act is to ensure the 
public and workers' safety, and that is fine. It also regulates the 
ingredients, quality and properties of explosives as well as their 
manufacture, importation, sale, purchase, possession and storage.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Its scope even includes pyrotechnics commonly called 
fireworks. The act requires the marking of most plastic explosives, 
so as to detect them. It prohibits the manufacture, storage, 
possession, transportation, importation and exportation of 
unmarked plastic explosives.
<P>
	The act also seeks to control the proliferation of plastic 
explosives used in terrorist incidents. It provides for exceptions 
which include research purposes, as well as police and military 
uses. These are the official objectives. However, from the outset, 
we can easily question the effectiveness of such a bill.
<P>
	First, it must be remembered that the Montreal convention could 
not even be implemented because there were not enough 
signatories. Therefore, why bother marking our explosives if we 
are practically the only ones to do so? Sure, it can be argued that we 
should set an example. Canada has always been very good at that, 
but when we are faced with the reality, it is an altogether different 
matter.
<P>
	Canada is a peaceful country, but it is also a major producer of 
military equipment and explosives. I would love to think that, with 
this bill, we will solve the problem of international terrorism and 
that tragedies such as the Air India bombing and the incidents 
currently occurring in France will never happen again. 
Unfortunately, I cannot be convinced that this will be the case, 
because not all countries of the world are members of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization.
<P>
	Those countries that provide weapons and explosives to 
terrorists will be even more reluctant to sign such a convention. 
They will certainly not pass similar legislation. If they do, they will 
continue to act like hypocrites. They will continue to make 
unmarked explosives and to sell weapons and ammunition on the 
international market.
<P>
	The government's only real objective is to save face and to make 
Quebecers and Canadians believe that they will be better protected. 
With this legislation, the government is trying to look better than 
the others;  however, there is a huge gap between theory and reality. 
Indeed, the government's real objective is to give the impression 
that it is doing what it should at home and on the international 
scene. This enables it to publicly pat itself on the back, even though 
it is well aware that the problem will in no way be solved and that 
the safety of Canadians will not be improved at all.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, this government has always created illusions: 
illusions regarding safety, better economic performance, debt 
reduction, greater social justice, etc. So, we are going to mark our 
explosives. We cannot go against virtue. Once explosives are 
marked in Canada, so as to make them easier to detect, terrorists 
will surely be scared to buy them. They will no longer dare bomb 
anything in Canada. They will no longer dare fly on our airlines and 
use our airports. At least this is what the government would like us 
to believe.
<P>
	Let us be honest with Quebecers and Canadians. Let us tell them 
that we are in fact passing this bill to ease our conscience. What 
will terrorists do once our explosives are marked? You know as 
well as I do they will go buy explosives somewhere else, where 
they are not marked.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The question immediately arises: Who sells explosives to 
terrorists? The federal government has no answer to this question. 
However, we do know that Canada is used by many criminal 
organizations as a convenient gateway to North America. This is 
true, for instance, in the case of organizations linked to the drug 
trade. It is common knowledge. Canada has a lot of trouble 
controlling drug trafficking within its own borders.
<P>
	Canada has always had and still has trouble controlling alcohol, 
tobacco and cigarette smuggling. And now we are supposed to 
believe that this legislation will help them control the smuggling of 
explosives.
<P>
	Now, do not get me wrong. I would be delighted if this 
happened. However, I am not so naive as to think that all of a 
sudden, this legislation will give us a superefficient government. 
Once the legislation is passed, its implementation will not be easy. 
Marking explosives is pretty straightforward. Of course we have 
the technology, but do we have facilities across the country to help 
us detect marked explosives? What is the use of marking 
explosives if we do not monitor them?
<P>
	Are border controls stringent enough to prevent smuggling of 
explosives? Will this government invest enough money to ensure 
the bill is actually implemented? I doubt it.
<P>
	Good intentions are fine, provided they lead to tangible results. 
The government will have to answer all these questions if it wants 
to be taken seriously.
<P>
	We support marking explosives if it can really make a difference. 
I am still waiting for evidence that marking will have any impact 
on international terrorism.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14575"> 14575 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill also provides for certain exceptions which I had not 
discussed so far. These exceptions are substantial and have the 
effect of considerably undermining the whole credibility of this 
bill. Everyone knows Canada manufactures arms and explosives. 
The bill provides that explosives for use in research by the police 
or the military will not be marked.
<P>
	The reason is obvious. If you go to war and the enemy can detect 
your explosives, you lose a lot of your effectiveness. That I can 
understand. But these exceptions, necessary though they may be, 
make the bill practically useless.
<P>
	They have the effect of telling international terrorists where they 
can purchase unmarked explosives, and since we do not mark 
explosives destined for research for use by the police or military, 
we can say this bill will only affect a negligible part of the 
explosives used in this country.
<P>
	Fine, we can say we will carefully monitor unmarked explosives 
destined for researchers, the police or military, although here again, 
do not depend on it. Everyone knows that even where security is 
supposed to be tight, there is always a leak somewhere. And 
another thing, the Canadian border is in many respects as leaky as a 
sieve. Government cutbacks have also affected controls at the 
border and in our airports.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	So, even if we do mark explosives, if we cut services further, it 
will not serve much purpose. There are good examples both past 
and present of the permeability of the Canadian border thanks to 
the carelessness of this government.
<P>
	Canada is currently facing serious problems involving a number 
of well armed native communities. Some members of these 
communities are almost as well armed as members of the Canadian 
armed forces and certainly better armed than the police. We have 
experienced this sort of problem in Quebec, unfortunately. We 
might ask ourselves where these individuals got the weapons, 
ammunition and explosives. Are they Canadian or were they 
imported?
<P>
	The Montreal region is currently in the midst of a veritable war 
among organized gangs of bikers. They are also well armed, as you 
know. Where did they get their weapons, ammunition and 
explosives? Can the government tell us?
<P>
	They have shown that Canadian controls are not very effective. 
They have shown that this supposed great country where people 
allegedly enjoy a remarkable quality of life is living on a lot of 
illusions.
<P>
	It cannot be claimed that this bill will give people greater 
security. It is true that the government has to legislate. It was 
established to govern our society. But it has yet to acquire the 
means to carry out the legislation it  enacts. What is the point of 
enacting legislation, if we are unable to carry it out?
<P>
	Instead of trying to ease its conscience, as it is attempting to do, 
and to improve its image internationally and endlessly repeating 
that Canada has one of the highest ratings in the world, this 
government should really make an effort internationally to try to 
correct certain injustices.
<P>
	Except in the case of organized crime, the use of explosives in 
Quebec and in Canada for purposes other than those for which they 
were intended is neither obvious nor particularly frequent.
<P>
	Along with adopting legislation on marking explosives, would it 
not be a good idea for the government to take steps to fight 
organized gangs, to acquire the means to monitor the movement of 
terrorists within the country as closely as possible and to tighten 
controls at border points as well as at ports and airports, ensuring 
more effective surveillance?
<P>
	There is much public pressure now for anti-gang legislation. We 
know that gangs are the ones using explosives for criminal 
purposes. Having such a statute would be a hundred times more 
effective than marking our explosives.
<P>
	Perhaps Canada once enjoyed a certain credibility on the 
international level. By adopting Bill C-71 the government is trying 
to bolster that credibility, which is seriously drooping these days.
<P>
	The aboriginal problem has markedly lowered Canada's degree 
of credibility.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's statements implying that he will not 
respect the choice of 7 million Quebecers in the coming 
referendum suggest that this government does not have a great deal 
of respect for democracy. In fact, this government's sole purpose in 
passing a bill on marking explosives is to give the illusion that it is 
fulfilling its commitments. It is proposing this five years after the 
Montreal convention, when it could have done so far earlier.
<P>
	The effectiveness of such a statute is questionable. Do they 
really believe that Quebecers will be fooled, that Canadians will be 
fooled? On the international level, will the body of nations be 
fooled? Will international terrorism quake in fear of this new 
measure? I beg to differ.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I would be especially happy if this government really respected 
democracy and promised to recognize the results of the upcoming 
referendum in Quebec. I would be especially happy if this 
government did honour another one of its commitments by really 
creating jobs. I would be quite satisfied if this government could 
show me how it will succeed in reducing the common debt while 
respecting the most disadvantaged in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14576"> 14576 </A></B>
<P>
	I would be satisfied if Canada managed to regain a certain 
credibility at the international level, but not by taking action at 
the last minute in order to ease its conscience, as this government 
is doing by proposing this bill. Because contrary to what some 
members of this government and some Canadian extremists may 
think, we in the Bloc Quebecois are not ill-disposed toward 
Canadians. We simply want to give ourselves a country that will 
respect its neighbour.
<P>
	The present government's attitude toward the traffic of 
explosives in Canada and toward the commitments made when the 
International Civil Aviation Organization met in Montreal shows 
everyone that we simply have a vision and that reality is quite 
different when one has to manage a country.
<P>
	For ordinary citizens from the small towns and villages in my 
riding, this bill, whose only purpose is to enable the government to 
save face at the international level, is a little ridiculous. These 
people really feel that the government is wasting its time instead of 
dealing with the big problems they must face every day: earning an 
honest living so they can put bread on the table, as the Prime 
Minister keeps repeating every day; keeping their small businesses 
afloat; living safely and peacefully at home.
<P>
	You can mark manufactured explosives all you want, these 
people will say, but if you do not fight social injustice and take real 
steps against violence, organized crime and terrorism, you are 
simply wasting your efforts. I am convinced that is the message I 
will hear back in my riding, and I can only agree with these people.
<P>
	I urge this government to be a little more serious and take action 
for reasons other than to ease its conscience, because although we 
support this bill so far, we still have many questions. Is the bill's 
only purpose to allow the government to show off at the national 
and international level, or is it a real bill that will be acted on 
because we will give ourselves the means to do so?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
good to be addressing this, the first bill I have had the pleasure of 
addressing in my new role as the critic for natural resources. I 
would like to make a few general comments about the department 
before I detail our support for the bill and the reasons behind it.
<P>
	I would like first of all to tell the Minister of Natural Resources 
that in my travels around the country this summer, checking into 
the background of the department, how her program is being 
received both in industry and among the provincial natural resource 
people, in many ways she seems to be moving in the right 
direction. She has been working hard. I think she is sincere in 
downsizing her department and getting out of areas that are 
traditionally and constitutionally in provincial jurisdiction. As she 
continues to do that, she  will have my support certainly in getting 
the federal government out of those areas and allowing the 
provincial governments to carry out their mandate.
<P>
	The resource industry is tremendously important to Canada. The 
energy, mines and forest sectors account for something like 13 per 
cent of Canada's GNP and a full 39 per cent of its exports, so the 
minister has an important resource to look after. If we were to add 
up the mining, forestry and gas and oil sectors alone, we have 
direct employment of almost two million people in Canada, again 
emphasizing the importance of that department.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting that under the new system we heard about the 
other day, the new system of rating countries in the world, Canada 
came out as the second wealthiest country in the world, based 
largely on its natural resources. Again, it is very important, 
obviously, that we must be good stewards of our wealth, make sure 
that our natural resources are properly managed, and that we take 
advantage in a sustainable way of ensuring that prosperity is made 
available to Canadians.
<P>
	With that background, it is a privilege to be the critic in this very 
important area. I remind the minister that she will have my support 
as long as she continues to move.
<P>
	It is also interesting that the areas in which the government has 
moved in natural resources have stuck very closely to the demands 
we made during the last campaign. For example, we warned against 
the idea that if we are not careful we could have a carbon tax in the 
country. The carbon tax did not come to fruition in the last budget, 
and I am not sure why. This was positive for the industry.
<P>
	The minister has also taken steps to sell off the government's 
share of Petro-Canada, which is something we have been calling 
for, for some years. That is certainly long overdue. I have 
registered my concerns about the process by which the brokerage 
firms were chosen, but other than that we are pleased to see that 
Petro-Canada is being privatized. It is unfortunate that the cost to 
the Canadian taxpayer will probably be something in the 
neighbourhood of $20 billion, so the $2 billion that will be raised 
by the sale will be a small consolation to the Canadian taxpayers 
who are on the hook for about $1,480 each. Be that as it may, it 
certainly was a positive move.
<P>
	Another encouraging move the minister has made was the 
guarantee that the government is out of the megaproject business. 
Again, that is something the Reform Party has been advocating for 
years. We will be out of the Hibernia project after this year, which 
is another positive step. It is interesting that all the things I would 
like to congratulate the minister on were certainly things we 
advocated before and during the last election campaign.

<P>
	I am here this morning to speak to Bill C-71, an act to amend 
the Explosives Act, which will allow Canada to formally 
participate in the international convention on the marking of 
plastic explosives for the purpose of detection.
<P>
	The purpose of the convention is to make sure that as many 
plastic explosives as possible are detected by the legal authorities, 
particularly at airports, in an effort to stop terrorism. This is really 
an anti-terrorism bill. I and my colleagues agree with the intention 
behind it.
<P>
	After the Air India tragedy and the Pan Am bombing over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1989 the United Nations passed two 
separate resolutions. One was passed by the Security Council and 
the other by the General Assembly. The resolutions urged the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, which is another UN 
body, to intensify its work on an international regime for the 
marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of detection. Out of 
the resolutions was born the convention I have already mentioned. 
It was put forward in Montreal in 1991 and signed by 100 nations. 
Although Canada signed at that time, it did not have the legal 
authority to ratify it. The bill we are talking about today will give 
Canada the authority and the ability to formally ratify that 
convention.
<P>
	For the last four years research has been ongoing to consult with 
the industry and to develop an appropriate chemical marker, which 
has now been developed at laboratories in New Jersey. The time 
has come to ratify the convention.
<P>
	Unfortunately the convention will not take effect until 35 nations 
become signatories. At least five of those signatories must be 
producers of plastic explosives. I understand that five producer 
countries have now signed, among them Slovakia, Switzerland, 
Norway, the Czech Republic, and Spain. Canada will be the sixth 
producer country to sign. That still means that only 13 countries, 
including Canada, will have legally ratified the convention, which 
is a long way from the 35 needed to actually put it in place.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	Doubts have been raised as to the effectiveness of the convention 
when it is finally put in place. I fear that it may simply increase the 
black market for unmarked plastic explosives which will still be in 
circulation. It may also strengthen the network of terrorist groups 
that will continue to communicate with each other, more regularly 
perhaps, to get a supply of unidentifiable plastic explosives.
<P>
	However I agree that the ordinary terrorist, if I can call such a 
thing ordinary, without international connections will be harder 
pressed to obtain material that will escape detection devices. 
Therefore the convention is a positive thing. I am recommending to 
my colleagues that the vote in favour of it.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, although the United States has signed the 
convention, it has not yet introduced legislation to ratify that 
convention. We talked with the explosives industry organization in 
Washington called the Institute of Makers of Explosives. Its 
representatives say they endorse the convention. The Federal 
Aviation Administration, which is a leading agency in America, 
may introduce legislation soon to ratify it. To date nothing has 
come about to make sure this happens.
<P>
	We have not had an instance for a long time like the Lockerbie 
incident or the Air India explosion. The urgency has somehow died 
down and the issue has probably taken a lower political priority, at 
least in the United States. I hope that it will not take another 
tragedy to bring this issue to the world stage once again.
<P>
	The convention is not in force right now and therefore is not 
really relevant. Until the United States recognizes it, the remainder 
of the significant players in this game will not join in ratifying the 
convention.
<P>
	The amendment to our act that we are discussing this morning 
will continue to be irrelevant until we do something on a political 
level to bring the United States into the game. Until that happens, 
nothing will get done and airline passengers all over the world will 
not receive the benefits that marking plastic explosives will bring.
<P>
	Today I am calling on the Minister of Natural Resources to 
address this on a political level, to call her American counterpart 
and bring him up to speed on this issue and to urge the United 
States to move on this issue and formally approve the convention 
so we can keep terrorism in its hole where it belongs.
<P>
	The minister has shown leadership. I have mentioned some of 
the positive things she has done in her portfolio. I would ask and 
encourage her to put her words into action now on the political 
front internationally and show some leadership with our American 
friends in urging them to sign this convention as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	I have some relevant comments to make regarding other issues 
about the Explosives Act. Allow me first to give our listeners some 
background on explosives in Canada and then I will get to the 
amendment.
<P>
	First let me talk a little bit about the general explosives regime in 
Canada. There are about 100 licensed producers of other explosives 
but only one manufacturer of plastic explosives in the country. This 
producer is located in Quebec and only produces plastic explosives 
on an as needed basis, mostly for military demolition charges. We 
are not talking about a major market for plastic explosives or, for 
that matter, a major problem with them.
<P>
	Our 100 producers of conventional explosives are served by a 
30-employee branch within the Department of Natural Resources 
Canada and there are five regional offices including one on West 
Hasting Street in Vancouver.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14578"> 14578 </A></B>
<P>
	I have some personal experience with the explosives branch in 
my former life as a logging contractor and a road builder. 
Certainly in British Columbia one does not do a lot of that without 
dealing extensively with explosives. I have in the past received 
my blaster's certificate, taken the exams and so on in order to deal 
with explosives. However, we have not had an extensive problem 
with abusive explosives in Canada. Historically that has been a 
blessing and I hope that will continue.
<P>
	However, there is an ongoing problem that seems to be 
happening in one region of the country. It is what happened when 
the Hell's Angels decided to take things into their own hands in 
Montreal. These ongoing biker wars in Montreal with cars, kids, 
restaurants, bystanders and even the odd member of the biker gang 
have been a concern to Canadians and are a growing concern about 
the use of explosives in terrorist activities. Police warn that this 
could be just the beginning.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	The Hell's Angels are the biggest, wealthiest motorcycle gang in 
the world. It is working hard to tighten its grip on drug trafficking, 
prostitution and gun running right across Canada. It seems to have 
chosen explosives as the anonymous method of choice for killing 
rivals.
<P>
	As the police begin to scrutinize these groups more and more 
closely, the groups may be driven to use more covert methods. 
There is always a possibility that plastic explosives that currently 
are not being used for these purposes will be used in their terrorist 
acts and innocent people may continue to be killed.
<P>
	I have been assured that plastic explosives have not been used to 
date in any of the Montreal explosions, but only explosives that are 
more easily obtainable from regular construction, mining and road 
construction.
<P>
	Who knows when some biker gang could put plastic explosives 
on some kind of public transport and kill many more innocent 
people? Plastic explosive that is marked with a chemical identifier 
would ensure that this would become much more difficult and may 
even deter criminals from using it. That is why Bill C-71 is a 
positive move. Although it may have a very negligible impact on 
that market, at least it is a positive step and deserves to be 
supported.
<P>
	I also have some concerns with conventional explosives. The last 
example is in Montreal, which is not a worker health and safety 
problem that the Federal Explosives Act is meant to address. It is a 
security problem, with these same biker gangs that seem to strut 
their stuff by killing innocent 11-year old kids and so on.
<P>
	What about the explosives used in these biker bombings? It is 
interesting that Quebec has the strongest provincial security regime 
regarding explosives in the entire country, something which it put 
in place following  the FLQ crisis years ago. Yet it cannot seem to 
find out where these people are getting their explosives.
<P>
	I want the House to know that not every piece of explosive was 
detonated in those killings. In one bombing police came upon 
several sticks that did not explode. Why could these explosives not 
be traced back to the original vendor so we could find out who sold 
these explosives to whom and try to catch these thieves and black 
marketeers? Someone must be currently licensed to store or use 
explosives and is selling it via the black market to these gangs. 
However we just cannot trace them. Although the boxes are marked 
at the factory, the individual sticks or cartridges of explosives 
inside the boxes are not. To mark each one individually would be 
an incredible amount of work and probably far too costly to 
contemplate.
<P>
	However a solution to this has been suggested by the American 
Institute of Makers of Explosives, the industry representative of 
explosive manufacturers in the states. Its solution could help 
Canada's growing security problem with explosives. It is not a 
solution that would require legislative change but only a change to 
the regulations attached to the act.
<P>
	The Institute of Makers of Explosives is calling for a study on a 
proposal it has made of including tiny plastic and metal chips in the 
explosive material itself which is coded by colour to identify the 
manufacturer. After an explosion investigators would look for the 
chips in the debris and be able to trace the explosives in that way.
<P>
	I have a description paper on the study that has been proposed. 
The institute suggests studying this to see whether it is either 
economically possible or even a positive move. At least the study 
should include whether those types of identifiable tags of plastic 
and metal parts should be used.
<P>
	The institute promotes the objective study of placing such tags 
into the explosives and whether it would be an effective law 
enforcement tool. It wants to study whether it would be a negative 
impact on the environment because of the presence of these chips. 
It wonders how efficient it is and whether a significant number of 
bombings would be traceable. Although there were 2,300 
bombings in the United States last year, only 36 involved 
commercially available high explosives. They also want to know 
about the cost.
<P>
	The institute is willing to take part and participate in a study on 
all those things. It would investigate whether this could help to 
deter things like the Montreal bombings. It would certainly make 
the explosive traceable to where they are manufactured and sold.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	This study is worthy of support. It may be a suitable way to trace 
explosives. I hope that the Canadian government will participate in 
the IME study to see if it could have application here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14579"> 14579 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that knowing explosives were traceable might deter 
people from being dishonest and selling them on the black market. 
If they do that, they should know they are contributing to murder 
and violence. At the current time they are getting away scot free 
because the explosives are untraceable.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier my support for this amendment. However I 
need to mention, in light of the couple of negative comments I have 
about this bill, the timing of it and so on had to do with what is 
really minor housekeeping business being brought to the House. 
Admittedly, as I mentioned, we will support it.
<P>
	There are a whole slew of very serious issues, some of them 
involving biker gangs, some of them involving other criminal 
justice issues that could be brought to the House and should be 
dealt with as quickly as we are prepared to deal with this one.
<P>
	We have a multitude of problems that people were telling me 
about in my travels this summer, especially in the criminal justice 
area that are far more serious than this anti-terrorism bill. It could 
save more lives if the government would listen to the Canadian 
people and put the rights of the law-abiding citizen ahead of the 
rights of the criminal.
<P>
	I wish today after we deal with this we would be spending time 
next on a crucial and critical bill dealing with amendments, for 
example, to the Young Offenders Act or on critical bills like 
enabling legislation that would allow for a national binding 
referendum on capital punishment. Those are measures of some 
substance that people would say are moving Canada toward a safer 
system or toward a system that I can have faith in.
<P>
	This anti-terrorism bill we are dealing with today is not going to 
affect most people even a little. There are many issues that we 
could be and should be dealing with quickly that could reinforce 
people's faith in the justice system. Certainly I do not see them on 
the legislative Order Paper and that is one of the things that is 
unfortunate.
<P>
	Allow me to sum up. I call on the minister today to contact our 
American counterpart and urge the United States to sign the 
convention, thus making our legislative amendment more relevant 
in the world.
<P>
	I also urge her to take part in the study being proposed by the 
Institute of the Makers of Explosives in the United States which 
would look at the idea of placing identifiable chips in explosives so 
that we could trace them when we are confronted with criminal 
misuse of explosives, a problem that seems to be increasing.
<P>
	For a long time we have had the luxury of concentrating on 
worker health and safety through the Explosives Act. These are 
important issues and it has been most of my experience with the 
Explosives Act in my own personal background.
<P>
	I believe the day is approaching when the federal government 
will have to turn its attention toward enhancing the security of all 
Canadians through more accurately identifying the source of 
explosive charges. We should at least have in our possession the 
options identified and priorized in case we need to move toward 
traceability of explosives in a more extensive way.
<P>
	I want to reiterate my support for Bill C-71. I do not believe it is 
going to set the world on its head, but the intention behind it is 
good and I support it. I do not see why we should take any more of 
the valuable time of the House to deal with this matter.
<P>
	There may even be unanimous consent to move directly to a 
committee of the whole and dispense with this bill in short order so 
that we can get on with dealing with some of the more critical 
issues that I mentioned earlier. If the government wishes to make 
such a motion, I will stand in support of moving to committee of 
the whole.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We will now go to the 20-minute 
speeches.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
offer. I believe the parliamentary secretary to natural resources will 
take his suggestion under advisement. Perhaps there is a way to 
expedite the bill. I am pleased to speak on Bill C-71, the marking of 
explosives for detectability.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	I congratulate the parliamentary secretary and the member for 
Moncton for his fine words this morning on the urgent need to 
essentially deal with an important piece of legislation concerning 
the security of Canadians, at the same time hopefully making it 
possible for us to deter terrorists from using plastic explosives to 
undermine the social fabric and security of the country.
<P>
	There has been some experience around the world with plastic 
explosives being used by terrorists against civil aviation targets. 
The roll call of terrorist acts which have resulted in the deaths of 
innocent people on aircraft and the destruction of those aircraft as 
the result of sabotage by plastic explosives is a tragic one.
<P>
	Unfortunately the world as we know it continues to have its 
dangerous and uncertain elements and conditions remain ripe for 
the emergence of people who will take the law into their own hands 
and cause such tragedies and suffering. Canada and all like minded 
nations must continue to be diligent in order minimize the chances 
of such acts of depredation occurring in their countries or be visited 
on their citizens.
<P>
	The legislation before us to date cannot solve the problems of the 
world that give birth to terrorism. It can however enable us to put 
another brick in the wall which governments are building to reduce 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14580"> 14580 </A></B>
<P>
the ability of  terrorists to act against the peaceful interests of states 
and their people.
<P>
	As has been described so clearly by my colleague, the bill is 
designed to ensure the so-called marking agent is inserted in plastic 
explosives. This action will improve immeasurably the ability to 
detect these explosives using the right equipment. This is an 
essential step in the development of a system which will provide 
Canada with the capability to respond effectively to terrorist threats 
of sabotage using plastic explosives.
<P>
	It should also be a matter of some pride that Canada has played 
such a pivotal role in developing the international framework for 
marking and controlling plastic explosives. Canadian scientists and 
technical experts have been world leaders in solving the technical 
problems associated with putting markers in explosives in a way 
that ensures their detectability while in no way jeopardizing either 
the essential function of legal explosives or degrading their safety 
or environmental acceptability.
<P>
	Both the government and the Canadian explosives industry 
recognize that Canada must continue to be in the forefront of 
developed nations ensuring all reasonable actions are taken to 
thwart the activities of terrorists. Our passage of this legislation 
will send a clear message to other countries including the United 
States that we are committed to improving the framework for 
combating terrorism and that we are taking positive steps to ensure 
this happens earlier rather than later.
<P>
	We must continue to remain aware that the legislation represents 
not so much an end point of a process but rather a point along a 
continuum of actions which must be encouraged and nurtured to 
ensure Canada and other nations remain vigilant in the fight against 
would be saboteurs.
<P>
	In consequence of this approach the government is extremely 
mindful that along with the ability to make explosives more easily 
detectable is the requirement to have the right equipment in the 
right places to detect terrorist activities. The sad history of 
terrorism demonstrates clearly that the air carrier industry has been 
a target for the such activities. We are confident the equipment in 
place at airports today is appropriate to the threat and the risk that 
prevails in Canada.
<P>
	Let me assure members of the House as well as the public that 
we have the capacity today to detect plastic explosives. That does 
not mean the government is complacent about aviation security, far 
from it. For its part Transport Canada keeps it aviation security 
regime under constant review in order to ensure it is properly 
configured to respond both to the situation which prevails today as 
well as to any change in threat that might arise.
<P>
	Mindful of the gains to security that might be available as a 
result of the improvements to the detectability of  explosives which 
will arise in response to this new legislation, and keeping in mind 
constant improvements in detection technology, Transport Canada 
in co-operation with industry and other interested departments will 
soon begin an in depth review of its equipment deployment 
strategy at airports. Once the review is complete the Minister of 
Transport will be looking to see what refinements might be needed 
to ensure Canada remains in the forefront in terms of our ability to 
respond to terrorist threats where and when they exist.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	This legislation is an essential part of the mosaic to respond to 
the scourge of terrorism. It has been developed in close 
collaboration among many departments and is fully consistent with 
the overall approach among many countries. The principles 
contained herein have been embraced by the industry which it 
affects.
<P>
	This collaborate endeavour should be enough to convince the 
most skeptical of observers that Canada is fully committed to 
combating terrorism. I entreat all members to demonstrate their 
personal commitment to this effort by voting for this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment the 
parliamentary secretary for his excellent address. I have a question 
relating to the role of transport and the detection of explosive 
devices and whether this bill will be of any assistance to the 
department in trying to regulate that.
<P>
	We are hearing a number of speeches this morning talking about 
a number of things that are not relevant to what we are trying to 
achieve here, which is merely to detect plastic explosives normally 
in a situation in which they are being transported on an aeroplane. 
Transport obviously has an integral role to play with respect to that. 
Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, while my remarks may have 
addressed Transport Canada's concern with regard to the absolute 
necessity that we have this legislation in place, it is important to 
note-and I assure my colleagues in the House as well as the 
public-that Transport Canada has the ability and the equipment 
which are important at our airports to ensure we can detect plastic 
explosives.
<P>
	It is in place now and we will continue to review any 
improvements required to ensure the travelling public at our 
airports that the aviation security regime is in place and is at the 
forefront of detecting these plastic explosives.
<P>
	It is important that all nations ratify the convention. Our borders 
are open and Canada deals with every country in terms of trade, as 
well as tourism. It is important to ensure Canada take this 
leadership role  today and move on with the legislation so that 
hopefully it will encourage other nations to participate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14581"> 14581 </A></B>
<P>
	To answer the question of the parliamentary secretary, through 
him to the public, Transport Canada has the equipment and the 
confidence that we are able to detect any plastic explosives 
introduced in the aviation regime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus to say a few 
words about Bill C-71, an act to amend the Explosives Act.
<P>
	The Explosives Act is an act of public and worker safety which 
regulates the composition, quality and character of explosives, in 
addition to their manufacture, importation, sale, purchase, 
possession and storage. It also controls the use of fireworks. This 
amendment is necessary, according to the government, to require 
the incorporation of a detectable additive in plastic explosives, 
coupled with a provision to make regulations to control unmarked 
plastic explosives.
<P>
	It is claimed this will hinder terrorism and enable Canada to 
ratify an international civil aviation organization convention on the 
marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of detection.
<P>
	The principal provisions of the bill require the marking of most 
plastic explosives for the purpose of detection and prohibit the 
manufacture, storage, possession, transfer of possession, 
transportation, import and export of unmarked plastic explosives, 
except that may be permitted by the terms of the convention or 
required by overriding military necessity. Also the principal 
provisions of the bill allow the governor in council to make 
regulations governing the possession, transfer and disposal of any 
unmarked plastic explosives.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	New Democrats support positive initiatives which reduce crime, 
reduce terrorism or which make our country safer for Canadians, 
all those to be included in that heading.
<P>
	The bill, although not as timely as we would like, will be a 
positive first step in addressing illegal and other terrorist acts. We 
are concerned as New Democrats that this initiative is a delay on 
the government's part.
<P>
	We have other concerns about the bill. One is that in June 1989 a 
United Nations Security Council resolution called for the 
international civil aviation organization to intensify its work on 
devising an international regime for the marking of plastic or sheet 
explosives for the purpose of detection. Later that year, in 
December 1989, the same resolution was passed by the United 
Nations General Assembly of that sitting. We are now looking at 
1995 where the government is undertaking to introduce this bill 
which would achieve the convention.
<P>
	I heard the parliamentary secretary say in the House that it was a 
leadership role. I have some questions with respect to how 
forthright and how strong this leadership is mainly because Canada 
has had five or six years to introduce the legislation in the House of 
Commons. The government is just meeting the requirements of the 
convention. Why is the government not undertaking to make it 
more restrictive to purchase explosives and safer for Canadians? 
Why is the government not undertaking to make it more difficult to 
purchase explosives?
<P>
	We have seen a long and drawn out debate on gun control 
legislation and the registration of firearms. Where was the 
government in terms of saying there is one manufacturer in 
Valleyfield, Quebec, manufacturing explosives? However the 
government will not deal with making it more difficult to purchase 
bombs.
<P>
	It is a indication of the weak leadership capacity of the 
government where it is not going beyond the convention. Why not 
go beyond the convention and undertake to introduce regulations 
which will make the purchase of plastic explosives and bombs 
more difficult for Canadians and for others outside the country? 
The government could have gone one step further.
<P>
	Has the government undertaken to study whether there is new 
technology on the horizon which would detect existing plastic 
bombs? We have seen all sorts of new computer technology 
introduced in the last number of months. It is being introduced on a 
weekly basis from a number of different companies, not just 
computer companies but technologically based companies. Why 
has the government not pursued with private sector corporations 
developing a technology which would identify plastic explosives 
now as opposed to waiting for 35 other countries to sign this 
convention and hopefully in the next 15 years have this problem 
addressed?
<P>
	I think 15 years is a bit long to be waiting to have this problem 
addressed. In 15 years a lot of people and a lot of organizations can 
purchase explosives and use them in a very damaging way, 
especially on the Canadian population.
<P>
	We are wondering what the government is doing in that regard, 
why it has not taken a leadership role, as it calls it, in undertaking 
to make it safer as opposed to meeting the basic requirements of an 
international convention which will not be in effect internationally 
for another 10 or 15 years, or who knows how long.
<P>
	I wonder what the bill will do with respect to diminishing 
terrorism in Canada, for example in the Montreal situation where 
motorcycle gangs are having a bit of a set to in essence. They are 
killing each other with bombs, perhaps not plastic explosives but 
with dynamite and other explosives. What is the government doing 
in response to making our communities safer, making Montreal 
safer and addressing this very serious problem in Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14582"> 14582 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me share with members of the House and Canadians what the 
government is doing. It is not doing a  lot. The Minister of Justice 
travelled to Montreal to meet with the mayor of Montreal to 
discuss anti-gang legislation which the mayor has asked the federal 
government to implement. What has the Minister of Justice done? 
He listened to the mayor, had a nice little trip and had a lunch, but 
he will not do anything with respect to this issue because there are 
more important issues like gun control and registering which are 
creating all sorts of problems. He will not look after the bombs. We 
will leave the bombs up to the gangs. We will let the manufacturers 
of explosives continue to manufacture these things and sell them in 
the communities of our country so that people can use them to kill 
each other and innocent bystanders in larger numbers than with 
rifles.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I am wondering what the government is doing with respect to 
solving this problem in Montreal. I share the concern of members 
of the House, particularly from the province of Quebec, who are 
very concerned that this very serious problem be addressed. The 
bill will have absolutely nothing to do with addressing this problem 
in Quebec. I am sorry to see that happen.
<P>
	I will not take up a lot of time on the bill. As I said, it is a good 
first step. I have another concern, and it is in response to the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources when 
he says that the military has a 10-year supply of plastic explosives.
<P>
	Canadians are wondering what will happen with this 10-year 
supply of plastic explosives as it relates to the bill. Will the military 
use the explosives as they are, with undetectable components in the 
explosives? Will the government have the military destroy the 
undetectable explosives and have it purchase the new formula 
explosives so that they are detectable?
<P>
	These are questions the government should be answering. I 
guess Canadians would like to ask what the military is doing with a 
10-year supply of plastic explosives. Are they assuming that 
something very serious is going to happen internationally and we 
may require these explosives?
<P>
	These questions have to be addressed by the government. The 
bill excludes the military use of plastic explosives being detected 
for emergency purposes. I would like to know how the government 
defines emergency use of plastic explosives by the military so that 
it may be exempt from the clauses of this convention. Does this 
mean that all the military in every country in the world is exempt as 
well, or is it just the Canadian military? If that is the case, does it 
have a very secure system of storage of plastic explosives so that if 
it is undetectable at least it is safely stored away and for the 
purposes of military uses only?
<P>
	What kinds of restrictions, what kinds of regulations, what kinds 
of registration systems do they have for plastic explosives for the 
military?
<P>
	In summary, we are very concerned with respect to the bill. It is a 
good first step. It is not a large enough step in terms of addressing 
the issue. I do not think it is happening quickly enough. If the 
Canadian government is serious about passing the bill, it will have 
a plan of action in place to contact other countries that are 
co-signators of the convention to have them introduce their 
legislation in a very timely way so that we can address this problem 
quickly, as opposed to over the next 15 years.
<P>
	I would ask the government in its initiative to undertake to 
contact these other governments in a very formal way to ensure that 
this convention is signed by the minimum number of countries 
required to make it effective internationally.
<P>
	New Democrats support the bill in principle. If some of these 
questions can be answered accurately and satisfactorily, we will 
give our support to the bill. I wait for and look forward to the bill 
coming to committee so that we can ask these questions in greater 
detail.

	The House resumed from September 18 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-83, an act to amend the Auditor General Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
very real pleasure for me to stand to speak in support of Bill C-83.
<P>
	It is entitled an act to amend the Auditor General Act. It seems to 
me that it is very difficult to get excited about a bill with a title like 
that. However, I should explain that this legislation is designed to 
fulfil a commitment made in the Liberal red book and supported by 
all environmentalists and all environmentally minded business 
people before and during our election, that is a commitment to 
appoint an overseer for environmental matters in the federal 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14583"> 14583 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to read out the red book commitment before 
addressing the actual terms of Bill C-83. The red book states that 
the government:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-will appoint an Environmental Auditor General, reporting directly to 
Parliament, with powers of investigation similar to the powers of the Auditor 
General. This office would report annually to the public on how successfully 
federal programs and spending are supporting the shift to sustainable 
development. The report would also evaluate the implementation and 
enforcement of federal environmental laws. Individuals could petition the 
Environmental Auditor General to conduct special investigations when they see 
environmental policies or laws being ignored or violated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-83 deals with that promise we made in the red book. It 
deals with appointing an auditor for sustainable development in 
government.
<P>
	Sustainable development is simply common sense in 
government, in business affairs, and in our everyday lives. 
Sustainable development is human beings living on the planet in 
such a way that they maintain a healthy environment around them.
<P>
	It is illogical and also immoral for us to think that we can live on 
the planet, conduct a business on the planet, or conduct a 
government operation on the planet without taking into account the 
health of our environment in the long term. If we do not, one day 
those bad policies would catch up to us. Our personal health would 
suffer, the health of our children would suffer, and so on.
<P>
	Sustainable development, which is mentioned in our promise, is 
simply a sensible way of living on the planet, a sensible way of 
conducting business, and a sensible way of running a government.
<P>
	I am delighted to see Bill C-83 before the House. Its purpose is 
to establish a commissioner for the environment and sustainable 
development within the office of the auditor general. I should 
explain this, because our red book commitment states that we will 
appoint an environmental auditor general.
<P>
	When the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development was conducting public hearings there was a great 
deal of support for the idea of having an environmental watchdog 
in the federal government. There was a good deal of discussion on 
what form or what powers that person and that office should have. 
One view was that there should be a separate office called the 
environmental auditor general. That office would have functions 
very similar to those of the auditor general's office today, the 
general watchdog on government.
<P>
	Another view was that there should be a commissioner. In some 
other jurisdictions there is a commissioner for the environment 
who performs not only the sorts of watchdog functions that our 
auditor general does for the federal government processes but also 
acts much more as a conscience for environmental matters as a 
point of contact for ordinary citizens who want to communicate  
their concerns with government, in this case about the environment 
and sustainable development.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Under Bill C-83, in fulfilling our promise to provide an 
environmental auditor general I believe we are going further. We 
are providing a commissioner for the environment and sustainable 
development, whose office will be within the present office of the 
auditor general.
<P>
	It is important to realize that we are putting our environmental 
concerns in exactly the same place as our business concerns, our 
concerns about the efficiency of government.
<P>
	Under Bill C-83 we will see the creation of a commissioner 
whose new office will confirm the government's commitment to 
put its own house in order from an environmental and sustainable 
development point of view. Any greening of government policies 
we put into place will be monitored by the commissioner.
<P>
	This person will be available to the public and will be required to 
report to Parliament. By making the appointment the government is 
holding itself accountable for its own environmental performance. 
Because the federal government is a very large and powerful 
organization-and some of us think it too large and powerful-the 
commissioner will be able to promote sustainable development not 
only in our own government but throughout society by example 
and in other ways.
<P>
	The commissioner will be the auditor general's right hand person 
on all environment and sustainable development matters. In 
addition to helping the auditor general in those very special and 
important areas, the commissioner will monitor and report to 
Parliament every year on how all government departments are 
putting their sustainable development strategies into practice, on 
how the ministers are responding to petitions from the public on 
environmental matters.
<P>
	On reading the legislation I was also interested in something 
else, which actually is different from the way I have thought of the 
environmental and sustainable development commissioner 
watchdog as it was presented in the red book, that is the matter of 
appointment of the commissioner. Mr. Speaker, to be honest with 
you, I was a involved a little in developing parts of the red book and 
I had not given much thought to that. I had not thought through how 
one would appoint a person who is independent of government and 
who could criticize government.
<P>
	In this case, it is interesting that the legislation we have before us 
provides for the auditor general, who is already well accepted as an 
independent arm's length office holder, to make this appointment. I 
like the fact that this will not be an order in council appointment. It 
will not be an appointment by the Prime Minister. It will be an 
appointment by the auditor general, who will be directed to seek 
out an appropriately independent person  who will become our 
commissioner for the environment and sustainable development. I 
like that. That fits in with the already existing-and I think 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14584"> 14584 </A></B>
<P>
accepted by the general public-arm's length principle of the 
auditor general's office. It is very important that the commissioner 
for the environment be independent and be seen to be independent 
of government. I am glad the appointment is being dealt with in 
that way.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that one of the ideas discussed was the 
watchdog would be a separate office like the auditor general's 
office. In this legislation we provide for it to be within the auditor 
general's office itself. What are the advantages of that? Mr. 
Speaker, since you read the auditor general's reports from cover to 
cover when they appear every year, you will know that the auditor 
general already makes a point of reporting on environmental 
matters. It is not something that has been ignored by the auditor 
general. In a sense that function is already there and we are 
strengthening it by the appointment of a commissioner who will be 
working with the auditor general.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The commissioner, unlike some of the other people who are 
appointed to the auditor general's office, will be appointed because 
of his or her expertise in the area of environment and sustainable 
development. That is quite different from the present where 
naturally in the auditor general's office accountants and people 
who can read financial statements are needed. This is all very 
important.
<P>
	There will be a specialist who can advise the auditor general on 
environmental and sustainable development aspects of 
government. This will strengthen the auditor general's office and 
will give the commissioner a sound foundation for his or her work.
<P>
	Another advantage is that the auditor general already has a 
respectable reputation for independence. Instead of having to start 
spending considerable time building a new position and to show 
very clearly that he or she is independent of government, this new 
commissioner will already be working in a respected arm's length 
office which I believe helps.
<P>
	There is a financial advantage to it. We already have an auditor 
general's office and there are efficiencies in terms of support and 
things of that nature. It fits in with our concerns for efficient and 
economical government at the present time.
<P>
	There are a couple of other things about this matter. One is that 
by being in the auditor general's office the commissioner 
immediately has the advantage of sharing the spotlight which is on 
the auditor general's report every year.
<P>
	One way the auditor general works, and I think ministries feel 
paranoid about it, is that the publicity which surrounds the release 
of the auditor general's  report is used as a vehicle to make sure that 
the recommendations of the auditor general are implemented. That 
spotlight does exist.
<P>
	The media now wait every year, as members do, for the auditor 
general's report. When the scandals appear they are in the 
spotlight. It is one way our system works to cleanse itself and make 
itself more efficient. By putting the commissioner in the auditor 
general's office we immediately get a share of that spotlight for 
environmental and sustainable development affairs. I like that.
<P>
	The other reason I like the integration in the auditor general's 
office has to do with what I tried to say about sustainable 
development in the first place. The environment and sustainable 
development are not things which are separate from government. 
They are not things which are separate from the way we live our 
daily lives. They are not things which are separate from the way 
business is conducted. As I tried to explain at the beginning, if we 
do not live in a sustainable way on this planet, in the end the planet 
will destroy us. I do not believe the planet is at risk, I think it is 
human beings who are at risk.
<P>
	By putting the commissioner for sustainable development and 
environment in the auditor general's office, we are sending out a 
signal that we realize business, environment and sustainable 
development are all part of the same thing, that the functions of our 
auditor general automatically include environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
	In the section of the red book I reminded the House of, the 
recommendation included the matter of citizens petitioning the 
government with their environmental concerns. I am pleased to see 
in this legislation that the commissioner is required to deal with 
petitions and to monitor petitions received by all of our ministries 
on environmental matters. This means that citizens dealing with 
ministers have someone watching over their concerns.
<P>
	I like to think that most ministries take petitions seriously but in 
this case the commissioner is required to monitor each minister's 
response to petitions on the environment. This extends the public's 
power to influence government in what I consider to be a very 
important area.
<P>
	Ministers will have 120 days to respond to the petitions with 
extensions to that only under very exceptional circumstances. The 
commissioner will see to it that the ministers respond. That is very 
important.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Another item which is built into the terms of reference for the 
new commissioner is the fact that our government departments are 
required to develop their own sustainable development plans. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14585"> 14585 </A></B>
<P>
have to develop these plans within a certain period of time. Once  
they are established, every three years they have to renew them.
<P>
	I know directives of this sort go out on various matters to 
departments from ministers' offices and we sometimes wonder if 
anything happens because the organization is so big. In this case 
the commissioner is specifically directed to monitor each 
ministry's ongoing plans for the environment and sustainable 
development within that ministry's jurisdiction. The commissioner 
is required to report annually on those plans. This is building 
checks and balances into the basic system of government which 
ensure that the environment and sustainable development are built 
into everything we do.
<P>
	I know this is not easy. When the economy is difficult we have 
the tendency to forget environmental matters and the basic health 
of our population and the effects a polluted environment will have 
on us. When the minister introduced the legislation yesterday she 
mentioned some of the things which have been done. These are 
things which will help the commissioner to ensure that these 
measures are properly implemented.
<P>
	In Environment Canada we have already implemented green 
procurement policies which emphasize reduction, reuse and the 
purchase of environmentally sound products. The fact that we have 
announced that policy and the fact that we will have an 
environmental watchdog to see that we implement it are very 
important.
<P>
	We are already managing the ministry of the environment 
vehicle fleet to reduce emissions by 30 per cent by the year 2000. 
In all offices in the ministry zero waste is now the target. We are 
improving energy efficiency in all ministry buildings and 
conserving water by means of water audits in all Environment 
Canada buildings. Those are examples of what one ministry is 
doing. Those are the sorts of things which the new commissioner 
for the environment and sustainable development will be asked to 
monitor.
<P>
	In summary, under Bill C-83 the auditor general's office is 
exclusively given the environment and sustainable development 
responsibilities and the staff to carry out those responsibilities. The 
commissioner will allow us to show leadership in a wide range of 
areas involving green government and sustainable methods of 
governing. The commissioner will monitor all ministries 
continuously and will ensure that they are accountable. The 
legislation will allow Canadians to approach the government much 
more readily with their environmental concerns.
<P>
	In particular, the commissioner will integrate the environment 
into the normal business of government. That is what sustainable 
government is all about. I congratulate the Minister of the 
Environment on this legislation and I look forward to its rapid 
implementation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague's speech indicates a certain naivety. I understand the 
creation of a Commissioner of the Environment and, moreover, we 
are in agreement with the bill, but it will not solve all 
environmental problems.
<P>
	In listening to what he has just said, I got the impression that this 
commissioner was to solve all of the problems in place within 
departments and all of the problems in Canada, and I do not think 
that this will be the case.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	If I may, I would like to make a small comment on the role of the 
Commissioner of the Environment, his or her appointment in 
particular.
<P>
	It is our sincere wish that this commissioner's appointment be 
non-partisan and non-political. In environmental issues, I feel that 
the minister has made political decisions rather than environmental 
ones. Among others, the <I>Irving Whale</I> issue alone is a great 
scandal.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague whether he feels that the 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development 
ought to have total power to reverse a decision such as the one in 
the <I>Irving Whale</I> situation, where everyone is fully aware that the 
environmentalists were against that decision anyway. I would like 
to know his opinion. Should this commissioner not be totally 
empowered to act in a very timely manner so as to be able to 
reverse just such a decision as we have seen this summer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. Bloc member for her 
question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On the matter of the member's first point, I am sorry if in my 
enthusiasm I conveyed the idea that one step like this can solve all 
problems. We all know that in all areas of government there is no 
magic formula which solves everything. It does not.
<P>
	I believe that this is not just one decision. It builds something 
into government which will tick away day in day out, year in year 
out for decades and I hope longer to come. It will continuously 
influence and produce changes which will go on for very long 
periods of time. I appreciate the member's point and I apologize if I 
gave the impression that it would solve everything.
<P>
	On the appointment I explained that I like the idea it will not be 
an order in council, that it will be an appointment made by the 
auditor general. The auditor general is an arm's length person. He 
is not a political person. I believe it will be non-partisan. As I said 
in my remarks I like that idea.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14586"> 14586 </A></B>
<P>
	On the point about the power to reverse decisions, I do not 
believe for example in the case of the auditor general who 
overviews all government that a watchdog of that type should be 
able to step in and have draconian powers to interfere with the 
general running of government. I believe he or she should have 
all possible power to pressure for changes, but I do not believe 
it is feasible to have a watchdog who in fact can stop government 
or change government on any particular issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will make my question very short and succinct for the 
hon. member.
<P>
	Government watchdogs in the past have proven to be little more 
than government lapdogs taking the direction of the government. Is 
it the government's position that it is going to come up with a new 
concept of a watchdog, or is this simply the government's way to 
ensure that it can control the agenda of environmental processes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really am shocked by this, 
particularly in the context of this debate. Perhaps there are some 
specific examples which the member can refer to. Is he really 
saying that the auditor general is a lapdog of this government or 
previous governments?
<P>
	I believe it is something that the member should withdraw with 
respect to the person of the auditor general today and with respect 
to the office of the auditor general. He can criticize the way an 
office like that functions. He can criticize their views and things of 
that sort. I know he did not mention the auditor general and perhaps 
that is what he is going to say, but this is what the debate is about. It 
is about the office of the auditor general. I think that is a shocking 
aspersion on the auditor general.
<P>
	I have agreed that such offices do not cure all our problems. I 
have to believe the auditor general is independent, is honest and is 
efficient. I know the auditor general cannot cure all the ills in 
government.
<P>
	I hope the member will withdraw.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I might just clarify my colleague's point to the hon. 
member for Peterborough.
<P>
	He was saying that we have seen example after example in the 
House, during this Parliament and in Parliaments before, where the 
auditor general has come down with scathing reports about the 
operation of government departments and ministries, only to have 
these reports totally ignored by the government of the day.
<P>
	Unless the government is truthfully committed to 
acknowledging, respecting and acting on the recommendations and 
the findings of the auditor general we could appoint a million 
government watchdogs and a million auditors general to keep an 
eye on the  government. If the government continually will not do 
anything about it, what is the use? That is the point.
<P>
	What assurances do the House and the Canadian people have that 
this new appointment, if it is to be effective, will act on the 
recommendations and on the reports and criticisms of this 
position?
<P>
	There has been no example in the past of the government making 
any meaningful move toward acting on auditors general's reports. 
What assurances do we have now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley for his remarks and for his clarification. I 
accept that and it was not as personal as his colleague intended.
<P>
	It is the job of the House, including the member opposite, to see 
that governments of the day carry through with their commitments. 
In this case I mentioned environmental policies put into effect by 
the government. We are debating a promise the government made 
before it was elected, which it is putting into place. Here is an 
example of something being done.
<P>
	When the commissioner starts to report and the member 
opposite receives this new information about what is happening in 
government I hope he will use it as a stick to see to it the 
government of the day, ours or any other, makes the government as 
green as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to the second reading of Bill 
C-83, an act to amend the Auditor General Act to establish an 
office for monitoring and auditing government departmental work 
involving sustainable development.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to the bill because it addressed a subject 
very important to me. In the previous Parliament I had a private 
member's motion that called for the government to establish an 
environmental auditor general. It had a lot of support from all 
political parties of the time, environmental organizations and 
ordinary Canadians. I also sat on the environment committee last 
year when it studied and reported on the idea of establishing such 
an office.
<P>
	That report, issued in May 1994, looked at the need for 
environmental auditing and concluded Canada needed not just an 
auditor but a commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
	The committee stated in its report: ``Virtually all witnesses saw 
the area of independent policy review as being the biggest gap that 
currently exists in the framework by which the government is to be 
held accountable for its sustainability efforts''.
<P>
	Most of the witnesses said more than an auditing function was 
needed. François Bregha, president of Resource Futures 
International, said a policy evaluation role was necessary because 
we do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14587"> 14587 </A></B>
<P>
not have the criteria  right now to measure our progress toward 
sustainable development.
<P>
	Bill Andrews, executive director of the West Coast 
Environmental Law Association, agreed: ``What is missing is an 
independent policy analysis role so that if there are major gaps in 
policy decisions there is some way of knowing they will come to 
public attention''.
<P>
	The committee also recommended that the office of 
commissioner be established by new and separate legislation, not 
just with an amendment to the Auditor General Act.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Paul Muldoon, former member of the task force on the Ontario 
bill of rights, stated separate legislation is necessary because the 
roles, functions, mandates, scope and powers must be crystal clear 
in the minds of the public, in the minds of government and in the 
minds of other affected constituencies.
<P>
	Sadly, as with so much the government does, its actions in 
response to the good words of the committee and to the witnesses 
who appeared before it fall short of what is needed. Bill C-83, as 
we will see in our study of the legislation, has little to do with 
sustainable development and is not what is desperately needed in 
Canada today.
<P>
	When second reading concludes the legislation will return for 
clause by clause study to the same standing committee on the 
environment which drafted the original report. I hope the other 
members of the committee will challenge Bill C-83 aggressively 
and defend the interests of the report they wrote. The committee 
cannot overlook the fact that the Minister of the Environment in 
drafting Bill C-83 has ignored 11 out of 17 recommendations 
contained in that committee's extensive report.
<P>
	At the same time it is important that we do not lose sight of the 
fact that witness after witness told the committee environmental 
auditing would not be proactive enough.
<P>
	Art Hanson, president and chief executive officer of the 
International Institute for Sustainable Development, said the audit 
of how well existing policies are implemented does little to inform 
the need for new policies.
<P>
	Kenny Blacksmith, deputy grand chief, Grand Council of the 
Cree, agreed: ``It would be preferable to have no commissioner 
than to have a commissioner whose terms of reference are so 
restrictive that she or he cannot influence the substance of policy, 
implementation and content and interpretation of laws on 
environmental issues''.
<P>
	I quoted yesterday in the House Helen Hughes, New Zealand's 
commissioner for the environment, who said she would find it very 
difficult to operate without being able to look at government 
policy.
<P>
	As these witnesses confirmed, what is needed is an independent 
commissioner who can take a forward looking approach to 
evaluating the effectiveness of the federal government's policies, 
laws, regulations and programs in moving Canada toward 
sustainability. Instead of independent policy analysis what we have 
in Bill C-83 is an auditing function of how well existing policies 
are being implemented and whether government departments are 
meeting the objectives of their own sustainable development plans.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes and with all sincerity this is a role 
that should be carried out by the departments and the auditor 
general today. There is nothing new in Bill C-83 that could not be 
done without it.
<P>
	Truly effective environmental auditing is something different. 
Truly effective environmental auditing would look at the policies 
and objectives which govern the departments and their programs 
and tell us if those policies and objectives are adequate or 
desirable.
<P>
	The function proposed by the minister for this new office 
through Bill C-83 is a reflective model. It asks the office holder to 
look at the past and tell us what we have done wrong. The function 
proposed by my previous work and the function supported by 
Canadians and the committee as most needed is a proactive one, 
one that looks at the future and guides us through policy and 
program design to that future, a future in which Canadians through 
their efforts and activities can live a sustainable life and ensure our 
activities on the earth are sustainable.
<P>
	It is most important that this generation leave the earth a better 
place for the next generation. This means we have to change many 
of the ways we are currently doing things. Obviously we can learn 
from looking at the past and therefore an audit function in and of 
itself about to be performed by the auditor general's office, if the 
legislation passes, is important. I am not saying we should scrap 
the legislation and go back to the status quo, which is obviously 
even more inadequate. What I am saying is that simply knowing we 
have done something wrong is not good enough.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	More than anything else it is important Canada have a vehicle to 
help promote sustainability in all that we do. This means knowing 
how something can be done right and then steering the mechanics 
of government in that direction. We do not get where we are going 
simply by looking at where we have been and acknowledging the 
mistakes we have made along the way. We need a map in hand and 
the foresight to design our travel route to achieve our stated and 
understood goals.
<P>
	Bill C-83 will not help in moving Canada's environmental and 
sustainability goals forward. It will not give us the tools we need to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14588"> 14588 </A></B>
<P>
evaluate our policies until  whatever damage those policies will 
cause have already been done.
<P>
	There is a big job in this field to be done. When the environment 
committee concluded its review of this matter it said the new 
commissioner's office should have many functions. I will outline a 
couple of those functions as set out by the environment 
committee's report.
<P>
	The commissioner should evaluate all federal policies, laws, 
regulations, programs and guidelines to determine those which 
encourage and those which impede Canada's progress toward 
sustainable development and to make recommendations 
accordingly.
<P>
	The commissioner should examine all federal policies, laws, 
regulations, programs and guidelines to determine the extent to 
which they comply with Canada's international commitments, 
including protocols, treaties and conventions in the area of 
sustainable development. We know how important this function is 
in relation to the latest round of agreements Canada has signed, 
particularly those reached in Rio de Janeiro in 1992; agenda 21 
comes to mind immediately and Canada's commitments to the 
international community.
<P>
	In this regard Bill Andrews, whom I quoted earlier, told the 
committee: ``We have a glaring lack of systematic assessment of 
the extent to which we are meeting our international 
commitments''.
<P>
	The committee also recommended the commissioner be given 
additional tasks to encourage consultation and co-operation 
between federal and provincial levels of government with respect 
to sustainable development, to liaise with government, 
non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders to monitor 
and report on the evolution of sustainable development concepts, 
practices and technologies. The committee further recommended 
to advocate to Canadians the necessity for sustainable development 
in all of our actions.
<P>
	These were among the many functions recommended by the 
environment committee one year ago, recommendations worth 
defending by every member of the environment committee who 
debated these issues before the report was written.
<P>
	In response Bill C-83 guts that report and instead sets out the 
following function. Section 23(1) of Bill C-83:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The commissioner shall make any examinations and inquiries that the 
commissioner considers necessary in order to monitor (a) the extent to which 
category I departments have met the objectives, and implemented the plans set 
out in their sustainable development strategies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What a difference in approach. The committee which studied 
this field extensively says many important functions are necessary 
for this office to operate successfully. The Minister of the 
Environment responds by saying in Bill C-83 it is just enough to 
monitor how well the departmental staff has succeeded in meeting 
the  targets it has set, targets that have been designed with this in 
mind.
<P>
	These sustainable development strategies do not have to be 
written for another two years. The legislation exempts 
departmental staff from rewriting them for another three years, if it 
wishes. Under the terms of Bill C-83 the new auditor will not even 
have plans to monitor for the first two years of his term of office. 
None of the matters before government, as I mentioned earlier as 
set out by the committee, can be looked at during that period of 
time.
<P>
	All the plans the departments write during those two years will 
be recently written plans. This whole thing strikes me as being a bit 
ridiculous.
<P>
	Another provision of the legislation requires our attention as 
well. We should all object in principle to the provision that directs 
government departments to respond to public petitions on matters 
of environmental concern. As it stands, if Bill C-83 passes 
unamended, any public petition to investigate a complaint received 
by the auditor general's office must be passed on to the relevant 
government department for review, report and response within four 
months. This means that any department that wants to justify its 
actions rather than evaluate them is given carte blanche to do so.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	What is needed is an ombudsperson function where members of 
the public can petition the commissioner to conduct special 
investigations if they think that environmental policies or laws are 
being ignored or violated. The minister called for this in the 
original terms of reference given to the committee. Writing polite 
responses to serious environmental concerns is simply not good 
enough.
<P>
	A further provision in the bill allows the minister to tell a 
petitioner that it is not possible to reply within four months. My 
question to all on the government side, and particularly those who 
have served on the committee, is what happens then. How long can 
departments take to respond to petitions?
<P>
	What moves me to speak at length about this is the recent court 
case involving the government's decision to raise the <I>Irving Whale</I> 
off the coast of Prince Edward Island when the environmental 
impact assessment had not considered the PCBs which were in the 
heating system of the barge.
<P>
	The court upheld the citizens' petition and threw out the 
government's nice words defending itself. If Canadians and myself 
as concerned environmentalists want real teeth in our 
environmental legislation, there must be real independence and 
enforcement in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14589"> 14589 </A></B>
<P>
the monitoring and investigating office charged with protecting all 
of our long term interests. Bill C-83 provides none of that.
<P>
	At the same time there is plenty of other evidence, including the 
collapse of the east coast fishery, to show that we need a truly 
independent environmental auditor. By not recommending this 
independent ombudsperson function for the commissioner, the 
environment committee's report did not go far enough. This 
missing investigative role is an important aspect of the issue before 
us today as we review Bill C-83 and before the committee studies 
the issue for a second time.
<P>
	In conclusion, in support of my argument that Bill C-83 is 
inadequate and different legislation must be written to take its 
place, let me, as I did yesterday in comments and questions, quote 
briefly from the chair of the environment committee, the hon. 
member for Davenport who has contributed a great deal to the 
debate already. I quote from the foreword to the committee's 
report, written by the chairperson a year ago:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the 1993 election campaign, all major political parties committed 
themselves, once again, to the concept of sustainable development. In 
particular, the current government made several specific promises designed to 
further the implementation of environmentally sustainable policies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As a result of its deliberations, the committee has concluded that the most 
appropriate way to implement the government's proposed functions is through 
the creation of a commissioner of sustainable development in conjunction with 
an expanded role for the office of the auditor general.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee believes the creation of a commissioner of the environment 
and sustainable development is a priority, one which appropriately answers the 
requests of the government and which will provide the necessary momentum for 
the shift toward sustainability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Obviously the member for Davenport thinks as I do, that Canada 
needs to begin the shift toward sustainability at the first available 
opportunity, not two years down the road from now as Bill C-83 
implies.
<P>
	The member for Davenport, the chairperson of the committee, 
acknowledged that his party campaigned on such a platform. He 
clearly states that at the very least to fulfil those campaign 
promises, a new office with new functions is required.
<P>
	If Bill C-83 passes it is clear to me and to Canadians watching 
that yet another Liberal promise to the people of Canada on the 
environment has been broken. More important, the needs of the 
planet and its ability to sustain life have once again been ignored by 
the government.
<P>
	At this time when the environment department's budget is being 
cut by 30 per cent to 40 per cent and the government's commitment 
to the environment seems to be lapsing, a commissioner working 
for the auditor general is not necessarily what is needed. This 
response to Canada's long term sustainability needs does not go far 
enough.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Yesterday, as I listened to many of the speeches that were made 
relating to this issue, I questioned certain members of government 
on this issue. It totally amazed me that as Liberal members of the 
environment committee stood to speak to this issue not a single one 
defended the report. Not a single member of the environment 
committee that met last year on this issue, who worked so hard and 
listened to so many witnesses testify about the need for an 
independent proactive commissioner of the environment and who 
signed that report indicating their support for that position, 
defended the report in the House.
<P>
	The environment committee has just finished a major report 
reviewing the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Thousands 
of hours have been committed by members of the environment 
committee. They produced a report of which I think most members 
of the House would be most supportive. The recommendations of 
the committee have been well received in the environmental 
community across Canada.
<P>
	I am most concerned these members who will not defend their 
own report on an environmental auditor will now not defend this 
important report on CEPA when the government responds to it in 
five or six weeks. I would hope the members who worked so hard 
on the Canadian Environmental Protection Act review are prepared 
to defend the interests of the committee, the witnesses who 
appeared before the committee and the recommendations 
contained in that committee report when the government responds.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time today to speak on this 
important issue. I look forward to the work the committee now has 
to review the clause by clause study of Bill C-83.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the last speaker talked about the need for independence 
and authority on the part of an environmental commissioner. I 
agree.
<P>
	In follow-up to the comments made by the previous speaker on 
the Liberal side, trying to twist and make light of the integrity of 
the auditor general, I find it very curious that he defends the 
integrity of the auditor general at a time when his party ignores 
most of what the auditor general recommends.
<P>
	To put into perspective what I was talking about with regard to 
watchdogs being lapdogs I would point his attention away from the 
auditor general and toward the ethics counsellor. It is absolutely 
useless to appoint someone who is either going to do whatever the 
government tells him or her or who is going to make 
recommendations only to have them ignored.
<P>
	The last speaker has clarified the issue. If we are going to have 
some kind of commissioner or special watchdog-if we can use 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14590"> 14590 </A></B>
<P>
that word-it has to be someone  who has both the independence of 
this body and the authority to see these actions are carried out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member was not actually posing a 
question to me but responding to a matter that occurred earlier this 
day in the House. I want to comment briefly also on the auditor 
general who appeared before the environment committee as a 
witness during our deliberations on this important matter.
<P>
	It is worth stressing, as the member for Davenport did yesterday, 
that even the auditor general indicated to the committee that it was 
beyond the scope of his office to do some of the things the 
government is now asking his office to do. The auditor general's 
office is one that functions as an auditor of government programs. 
The audit can only occur on matters that have already been set out 
as objectives of the government. If the government's objectives are 
wrong, the auditor general is not in any position to comment on 
that. Obviously those rules would apply to any desk or any worker 
within that office including the new commissioner of the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	It is quite possible that the auditor general's response to Bill 
C-83 will be that he is willing to take on the task before him, but we 
must bear in mind that some of the mandate which he has been 
given goes beyond the realm of what his office is capable of doing.
<P>
	It is important to recognize in reviewing Bill C-83 that the 
auditor general performs a valuable function, but to ensure 
sustainability we need to go beyond the office of the auditor 
general. The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development last year supported the view that we need something 
over and above the role which an auditor general can perform. I am 
surprised that members of the environment committee have not 
defended their own report.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House to speak on Bill C-83. 
It has been over a year since the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development took on 
the task of examining the government's commitment to establish 
an environmental equivalent of the auditor general. This was a key 
commitment of the Liberal red book in the 1993 election campaign 
and it is a commitment to Canadians. It is an idea which has been 
discussed and debated for many years and a request of the public.
<P>
	One message which came through loud and clear from the 
stakeholders was the message that there is a real need in Canada for 
leadership in making the shift to sustainable development. For 
more than a decade we have been exploring the concept, examining 
the implications and considering the measures it requires. Now is 
the time to move words into action. That will take bold and 
decisive leadership. That is the leadership which we are seeing in 
Bill C-83.
<P>
	Another message was that, above all, the leadership must come 
from the federal government. This is the largest business in Canada 
and what it does has an immense influence throughout our society. 
That is true not only of federal policies, programs and regulations 
affecting various sectors, but also of the way in which the 
Government of Canada operates. The federal government must be 
held publicly accountable for its progress in making the shift to 
sustainable development and to sustainable policies. These are not 
only sustainable policies which are fiscally responsible and 
economically responsible, but, specifically, environmentally 
responsible.
<P>
	At the same time the government must look back and assess 
whether existing initiatives create barriers to the achievement of 
sustainable development. The government must consider how to 
achieve existing policy goals in a way that promotes sustainable 
development. We must build the cost of the environment into the 
cost of doing business in Canada today.
<P>
	I know that in preparing its report the committee paid careful 
attention to the stakeholders' messages. The office of the auditor 
general has much clout and that is why in preparing these 
amendments the bill has put into the Auditor General Act. We are 
creating a commissioner who is part of and the responsibility of the 
auditor general's department. It is independent from government. 
The reason is because the auditor general's department has high 
respect among the public of Canada. It has solid expertise which 
can be put to use at once. It has the framework and the structure in 
place that may be held responsible to the public. For all of these 
reasons it can greatly enhance the auditing of the government's 
environmental performance.
<P>
	In addition, by giving this department specific environmental 
responsibilities we can ensure that the issues of the environment 
and issues of sustainable development will be integrated solidly 
and directly into economic considerations. This kind of integration 
is what sustainable development is all about. The office of the 
commissioner will provide leadership. It will put Canada in the 
forefront in making the shift to sustainable development.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	First, the amendments create a commissioner of the environment 
and sustainable development. This official will report directly to 
and work closely with the Auditor General of Canada on matters 
relating to the environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	One priority is for the work to carry on. No matter what happens 
to the position of auditor general there would be continuity. The 
position of the commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development would be  ensured. By doing this we are guaranteeing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14591"> 14591 </A></B>
<P>
that it becomes a post created for a commissioner who will serve 
the sustainability of the environment for Canada.
<P>
	There are other amendments in the bill which do provide for 
more leadership in making the shift to this sustainable development 
policy. They require that federal government departments, that is 
every department of the Government of Canada, prepare and table 
results oriented sustainable development strategies within two 
years. That is, they must set goals and spell out the action by which 
they will achieve those goals.
<P>
	These strategies will promote the shift to sustainable 
development policy at the program level and also in other ways the 
departments operate their buildings and facilities. This is a means 
of control, a watchdog, over all departments in the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	The departmental strategies will be developed in an open, 
transparent manner with the involvement of external stakeholders 
such as the national round table on environment and economy. We 
will involve the environmentalists, the public sector, the private 
sector and all citizens of the country so that they have an 
opportunity to be heard to express their views on what the country 
should be doing to maintain a sustainable environment, sustainable 
economic development.
<P>
	They will also establish benchmarks against which to measure 
the government's performance. These will enable the 
commissioner and the auditor general to do their job effectively 
and independently.
<P>
	What is more, every three years each department must update its 
sustainable development strategy and the minister responsible 
must table this update in the Parliament of Canada. This makes 
sure that the strategies are continually updated, continually 
responsible to new technologies and new developments which 
occur throughout the country.
<P>
	Public accountability has come up this morning. The 
amendments provide for enhanced public accountability by the 
government in making the shift to sustainable development. The 
commissioner must submit a yearly report to this House on matters 
relating to the environmental aspects of sustainable development 
whatever the commissioner considers appropriate. By that 
amendment I believe he has the freedom to look at any issues in 
any department of this government and to make assessments to 
report on those if he deems it appropriate in his opinion.
<P>
	The report will focus on the environmental performance of all 
federal departments. In other words, the extent to which the 
department has implemented its plan of action it will be held 
accountable and the extent to which the department has achieved 
its sustainable development objectives it will be held accountable.
<P>
	Further, the report will present the number, the subject and the 
status of petitions received by ministers  on environmental matters. 
Let me refer to the bill. In this context the public has the 
opportunity to present a petition; that is any citizen of this country 
might present a petition, if he takes the time to get citizens' 
signatures.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The petition would be received by the commissioner. It would be 
forwarded to the minister responsible for that specific department. 
The recipient minister would then be required to acknowledge in 
the House receipt of that petition within 15 days and to respond to 
the petition within four months. The four-month period might be 
extended by the minister if the petitioner and the auditor general 
were notified that it would be impossible to respond within the four 
months.
<P>
	This puts the petition on a time line. It holds the commissioner, 
the minister and the department responsible to the citizen who has 
presented the petition. That is accountability on behalf of the 
government in the introduction of Bill C-83.
<P>
	The task of appointing the commissioner of the environment and 
sustainable development will be the responsibility of the auditor 
general. This arrangement will give the commissioner the needed 
and utmost independence from the Government of Canada. This 
again gives him credibility and accountability to carry out his 
duties responsibly.
<P>
	The third message of stakeholders was the need to assess new 
and existing government initiatives for their consistency with 
sustainable development. The government has already acted in this 
area. Keeping track of its performance will be the responsibility of 
the auditor general and the commissioner.
<P>
	Last November the task force on economic instruments and 
disincentives to sound environmental practices submitted its 
report. It contained recommendations to the ministers of finance 
and environment. These advised on how to review existing 
policies, to check whether they contained barriers to the promotion 
of sustainable development. This reviews some of our policies and 
legislation that might be outdated, that might be antiquated and 
will inhibit or maybe even prohibit the advancement of sustainable 
development in a sustainable economy. They also advised on how 
to prevent the unnecessary creation of barriers in the future.
<P>
	As promised in the budget, the ministers will respond to the task 
force within the coming months. Once again this holds the 
government accountable to sustainable fiscal policy, to sustainable 
economy and to sustainable environment for the people of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14592"> 14592 </A></B>
<P>
	As I mentioned, in preparing their sustainable development 
strategies, federal departments must act in an open, honest 
accountable way. They must involve the citizens of Canada and the 
stakeholders, the environmentalists.
<P>
	In their part III estimates which will come out annually 
departments will again be required to report their progress toward 
sustainable development. They must provide information on the 
number, the type and the status of environmental assessments 
which they are conducting.
<P>
	There are additional actions that will integrate the environment 
into decision making. The third component of the government 
response is a commitment to additional steps we will take to 
integrate the environment into all decision making in all 
departments of the government.
<P>
	I spoke of the task force to identify barriers and disincentives to 
sound environmental practices. The government followed up on its 
short term recommendations in the last budget. We are in the 
process of preparing a formal response to the task force report, 
including its longer term recommendations. The response will set 
out how the government plans to move forward on implementing 
economic instruments and on identifying barriers and disincentives 
to these practices in the existing government policies. The 
commissioner will play a very important role in holding this 
government and all future governments publicly accountable with 
ongoing efforts in this area.
<P>
	These measures along with the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act will do much to integrate environmental 
considerations, environmental evaluations into virtually every 
federal government decision.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	So many things are happening in Atlantic Canada in 
development, whether they are large pulp mills, lumbering 
industries, the transport of chemicals and products, that are 
detrimental to our environment should there be difficulties and 
accidents. We talked about the <I>Irving Whale</I> this morning.
<P>
	The legislation will be a tremendous asset. Citizens will have the 
opportunity to bring a petition forward to a commissioner, to a 
minister of the department to assess, to evaluate, to judge 
objectively what is economically feasible, what is environmentally 
sustainable and what will serve the country for the long haul.
<P>
	The government has taken a strong stand in Parliament on no 
quick fix solutions, a strong stand that we will be part of long term 
sustainability. This is part of our policy and philosophy. In each and 
everything we do, we will build for the next generation.
<P>
	The Brundtland report ``In Our Common Future'' uses technical 
terms describing what is meant by sustainability. I studied that in 
doing some university work at the masters level. The kind of 
responsibility we have to a global society today is to act in a 
responsible way particularly here as legislators over and above the 
citizen's responsibility.
<P>
	We are caretakers of this environment, of this earth only for a 
short time. We have a grave responsibility during that period to act 
responsibly. We should take only from the environment and the 
economy what we need to meet our needs today so that we do not 
build our economy on greed but on need. In that way we leave 
something for those in the next generation so that they too might 
take a living from the environment, from all the wonderful great 
natural resources we have been so fortunate to have had bestowed 
on this great Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, the amendments to this auditor general act are 
part of the broader effort I have just described. They are a 
fundamental and crucial part of what the philosophy of the 
Government of Canada is today. It will radically change the way in 
which the federal government does its business, in which the 
federal departments do their business.
<P>
	This will be a major step forward, making sustainable 
development a reality to this country. It will be a major step 
forward in the eyes of the world. Canada will be viewed as a 
progressive nation that is caring, looking to the economy and to the 
environment and that one must be integrated into the other.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to rise in support of the bill now 
before the House.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the bill to amend the Auditor General Act provides 
for the appointment of a Commissioner of the Environment and 
Sustainable Development, who will report to the auditor general 
and provide him with an overview of all federal government 
activities and operations related to the environment and to 
sustainable development.
<P>
	Bill C-83 also requires all federal government departments to 
develop sustainable development strategies to be laid before the 
House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill has particular relevance in light of a report that was 
released this past week by the World Bank regarding the wealth of 
nations. By this report, Canada is the second richest country in the 
world. This is not what we are used to hearing about our economy. 
We are used to being ranked well down in the teens by the old way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14593"> 14593 </A></B>
<P>
of looking at the wealth of a nation based on income, investment, 
and those things that can be measured in dollars moving about in 
the economy.
<P>
	The ranking that was done by the World Bank last week was 
formulated using a system of measurement that derives wealth 
from the value of a country's natural resources as one of the 
components. Based on this measure, the majority of Canada's 
wealth lies in its natural resources. Therefore, our capacity to 
develop a  healthy economy not only for our future but for future 
generations lies in how we use those resources. It lies in using those 
resources in a sustainable way.
<P>
	The system used by the World Bank in this new methodology 
challenges conventional thinking by looking beyond the normal 
measures of wealth that have been used until now. It starts moving 
the assessment of the worth of nations to a process and a standard 
based on sustainability in the long term.
<P>
	That is why the measures we take to husband our natural 
resources, to use them in a way that ensures that future generations 
also have resources on which to build their prosperity, are not only 
matters of economic well-being. They are matters of survival. 
Perhaps that gives this bill new relevance. We can begin to see it 
not only in the context of how much we have in land and the quality 
of that land, what we have in forests, what we have in subsoil 
resources and the quality of our water, but we can begin to see it in 
the context of the whole quality of life.
<P>
	We had one horrendous reminder this year that if we do not 
husband those resources, if we do not regard those gifts the world 
has to give as something that has to sustain our country and the 
world for future generations, then we face tragedy. We have had the 
virtual elimination of the cod stock, which has been a source of 
income and an important part of our country and other countries 
around the world for generations. That source has now been 
virtually lost. We would be only guessing if we tried to estimate 
whether that resource will ever be restored.
<P>
	The World Bank is starting to recognize that the wealth of 
nations has to be looked at in a different way, that the value of the 
resources we have and how we use them is an important component 
of our present and future prosperity and that depleting those 
resources in fact depletes our wealth.
<P>
	I would like to give another example to make the point quite 
concretely about what was wrong with the old system and how we 
have to start changing how we look at things.
<P>
	Under the old system the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> oil spill was a 
tremendous benefit to the economy. It put up our GDP quite 
significantly because it generated millions of dollars in lawyers' 
fees and millions of dollars in clean-up costs. It was good for the 
economy under the old system. I do not think any one of us wants 
to stand in the House to say that the spilling of oil into our oceans is 
a positive benefit for our country.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Let me now turn to this particular bill and how it is consistent 
with this concept of sustainable development. It requires 
government to look at every policy, program, spending decision, 
activity and operation of government to determine its impact on the 
environment. It requires every minister to look at every aspect of 
that minister's  department and table a strategy to ensure that the 
operations, programs, and policies of the department are consistent 
with sustaining the environment of the world in which we depend 
not only for economic prosperity but for our very survival.
<P>
	It requires the government to establish an environmental 
commissioner who will oversee the environmental impact and the 
impact on sustainable development not only of new policies, new 
legislation and new programs, but of all existing policies, 
legislation and programs.
<P>
	The legislation sets up a new public accountability for the 
government. One thing that has been learned by the nations of the 
world over the years is that it is public oversight of our 
responsibility that determines how responsibly we act. One of the 
key messages coming out of the earth summit in Rio a couple of 
years ago was that transparency, public oversight, and 
accountability of governments is vital to achieving the plan of 
action that all nations agreed to at that very important world 
conference.
<P>
	The World Bank report made it clear that Canada, as one of the 
wealthiest countries in the world, based largely on its tremendously 
wonderful supply of natural resources, also has the most to lose if it 
does not act in a sustainable way. If we do not set up a society in 
which government, in our partnership with the private sector, 
informs and motivates individual Canadians to do their part as well 
to sustain the environment, then all of us lose. The country will 
lose. To the extent that any country in the world fails to exercise its 
responsibilities for sustainable development, the world itself and 
future generations lose.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before closing this morning, I must say that I have a little trouble 
understanding the Bloc's position on this bill. Personally, I 
remember very clearly the time when the current leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois was minister of the Environment in this House and a 
member of the government. I remember very clearly his 
commitment to the environment and his belief in the government's 
responsibility to take action in order to protect the environment.
<P>
	I also remember that the Bloc tabled in this House a minority 
report proposing exactly what is being proposed in this bill, namely 
that the government create the position of Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development as part of the Office of 
the Auditor General, instead of creating a new, separate office.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I find it difficult to understand today why the Bloc is opposing 
legislation which does exactly what it has proposed to the House of 
Commons and to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I see this as a step back from their previous position and that of 
their leader, who is now Leader of the Official Opposition, as 
regards environmental protection, sustainable development and the 
government's responsibility to show leadership in these areas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has a right to be proud of the leadership role it has played 
globally on many of these important environmental issues, 
particularly in the area of global climate change.
<P>
	It is easy to think of this as an administrative bill that relates to 
the Government of Canada and to how it conducts its business and 
to how ministries are administered on a day to day basis. I believe 
its impact is far greater than that. It demonstrates leadership on the 
part of government, just as Canada has traditionally played a 
leadership role in these very important issues for some time now. It 
demonstrates the kind of leadership that was there when the 
previous Parliament implemented the program of greening the Hill, 
believing that we as the Parliament of Canada first and foremost 
had to demonstrate we were taking our responsibilities both 
personally and seriously.
<P>
	However, the bill does more than that. It addresses some of the 
key issues facing the world today. Those issues were again very 
much front and centre at the United Nations conference held in 
Beijing, which ended just last week. The concerns of women in 
developing countries about things we take for granted, like basic 
health needs, basic protection and a safe environment for them and 
their children, were very much at the forefront of the agenda.
<P>
	We still face the situation where 14 million children around the 
globe die every year of diarrhoea. That is 40,000 children a day 
simply for lack of access to clean water. That is the importance of 
measures we take as a nation and measures we take as an important 
actor in the global community to ensure that preserving the wealth 
of this world, which we hold in trust for the next generation, is a 
priority for us as a Parliament, for us as individual parliamentarians 
and for our government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is therefore a privilege to witness this bill being 
tabled in this House and to have the opportunity to support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to support the legislation, to let 
us get on with the important work of making sure that everything 
the government does is consistent with the preservation of the 
environment as part of our global responsibility.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
that my hon. colleague from Ottawa West, who just spoke on Bill 
C-83, did not have all the facts, when she was wondering what the 
position of the official opposition, that is to say the Bloc 
Quebecois, was regarding the establishment of a position of 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development. I 
would like to remind her that, yesterday, around 1:50 p.m., I rose in 
the House of Commons to say, and I will quote this slowly to make 
sure she hears me very clearly: ``The official opposition does not 
intend, at least for the time being, to challenge the mandate that the 
minister wants to give to the commissioner of the environment. 
However, we deplore the fact that, ultimately, the commissioner 
will merely have the power to make suggestions''.
<P>
	If she had listened to me as carefully as I listened to her a 
moment ago, she would have found out that the Bloc Quebecois 
does not intend to oppose the establishment of a position of 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development. 
On the contrary, we want the commissioner to have power to do 
more than just make recommendations like the auditor general at 
present.
<P>
	After the Christmas holidays, the auditor general will once again 
present his annual report. We, the official opposition, will have a 
field day as the terrible things this government has done are 
revealed to Canadian taxpayers. There will be much talk about it 
the first week, hardly any the second week and, by the third week, it 
will be all but forgotten.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Ottawa West mentioned future 
generations. I would like to remind her that, as we speak, between 
the Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island, we have a barge 
that has been sitting in the bottom of the Gulf of St. Lawrence for 
over 25 years, as of last week. This barge contains bunker C oil 
and, as we learned at the end of June, large amounts of fuel 
contaminated with PCBs. In 1970, and for the next 14 years until 
1984, the Liberals were in power in Ottawa. Within three weeks, 
your government will be celebrating its second year in office. Yet 
nothing has been done.
<P>
	Your government is all talk and no action. It is all fine and well 
to talk about future generations and say that every Canadian is a 
billionaire. Those are fine words, but idle talk nonetheless. If my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14595"> 14595 </A></B>
<P>
colleague wants to get richer, I suggest that she buy shares from 
Quebecers or  Canadians who may be prepared to sell their shares 
to her for a very reasonable price.
<P>
	To conclude, I wish my colleague from Ottawa West would urge 
the Minister of the Environment to ensure that the Commissioner 
of the Environment and Sustainable Development has not only the 
power to make recommendations but also effective power to force 
the government and its departments to respect the environment and 
sustainable development, favourite topics of certain government 
members these days.
<P>
	I remember the St. Lawrence action plan, phase 1, phase 2, 
designed to depollute the river. Just last week, there was a report 
where they were catching fish to analyze their flesh. It is worse. 
Really.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. My colleague 
should be given an opportunity to respond and there is very little 
time left to do so. The hon. member has embarked on a windy 
discourse that will leave no time to my hon. colleague to respond to 
his tale of woes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair always gives the hon. member 
who asks a question and the hon. member answering it equal time.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, it is a 
tactic of the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis to try to 
distract the opposition. These days, it seems as though the 
government wants to gag the official opposition. It is afraid to hear 
what our fellow citizens are telling us in our ridings.
<P>
	I was talking about the St. Lawrence action plan to clean the St. 
Lawrence River. Listen to this: out of a budget of $19.2 million, 
this government took $6 million to commission studies on the 
cleaning up of the river. However, these studies were conducted in 
Miramichi, New Brunswick, several thousand kilometres from the 
St. Lawrence River. Where is the logic in that decision?
<P>
	I would like to hear the member for Ottawa West tell us about the 
effect that this will have, other than to suggest the appointment of a 
commissioner of the environment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to remind the member 
opposite that, when the Bloc leader was Minister of the 
Environment, it was his responsibility to take action regarding the 
<I>Irving Whale</I>, but he did not do anything.
<P>
	Personally, I asked specific questions in this House, but the 
government at the time, with the Bloc leader as its environment 
minister, did not do anything about the <I>Irving Whale</I>. The current 
environment minister was the first to have the courage to make 
decisions regarding the <I>Irving Whale</I> and take action to have it 
refloated.
<P>
	We know, and so does the hon. member, that the operation must 
be conducted with great caution because it involves risks and 
danger.
<P>
	I also have an answer regarding the auditor general's 
responsibilities. It may be that the Bloc would like a government 
structure whereby the only way to make things move would be for 
people to rely on the courts to enforce actions. We prefer a system 
where the departments, which are accountable to this House, to the 
Prime Minister and to the people of Canada, have a duty to do what 
they can and what they should to ensure that their initiatives 
comply with the principles of sustainable development and 
environmental protection.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	If the Bloc thinks that the commissioner of the environment will 
have no power, then it does not believe in the power of the public. 
The commissioner will be required to inform this House and the 
public, and he will be accountable to members of Parliament, to the 
government, to the departments and to the ministers. This is the 
strength of a democracy that works.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
pleasure for me to talk about Bill C-83. This is a very important 
bill. I want to talk about this on behalf of my constituents in 
Vancouver South. To them this is a very important issue.
<P>
	The environment is an issue which I have learned a lot about 
recently. I have probably learned more about the environment from 
my children. I have three young children who have made my wife 
and I learn more about the environment than we knew before. It is 
very important because our young people often lead in a lot of ways 
and we do not pay the attention we should to them. We can learn 
from our younger generations, as I have learned more about the 
environment.
<P>
	I was interested to talk about the environment because as we 
have learned in history economic prosperity is closely linked to our 
respect for the environment. There are lots of examples in history 
of how when civilizations do not respect the environment they can 
destroy themselves. There are many examples in history of how 
societies deforest areas around them and sometimes continue to do 
that because of their need for fuel only to be left with erosion and 
then have problems in agriculture and in growing their food. Lo 
and behold they have taken a resource that was valuable to their 
society and destroyed it.
<P>
	The legislation is in the red book. The Liberal government said 
the national environmental and economic agendas can no longer be 
separated, which means our future economic prosperity is very 
important. We want to preserve that economic prosperity. We want 
to grow and respect the environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14596"> 14596 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why this is very important from the point of view that 
government action will be determined by a commissioner and the 
environmental factor will be considered when government 
decisions are being made. Bill C-83 demonstrates to Canadians 
the Liberal government is serious about the environment and 
sustainable development.
<P>
	We often use the term sustainable development. It is a term used 
very wisely and widely. We should define sustainable 
development. For members in the House and for those watching, to 
me sustainable development is that our actions do not take away 
from future generations their standard of living or their quality of 
life. We in this generation must ensure our actions do not take away 
from future generations.
<P>
	In a lot of ways we have already failed in that. We have taken 
away from future generations that which we have had. For 
example, we often hear the warning that children should not play 
outside during certain hours because of depletion of the ozone layer 
and the effect this can have on our children. I can remember as a 
child there was no such warning. We did not have to heed these 
warnings but our children do. We have already taken away from 
future generations in that by having a higher standard of living now 
future generations will be deprived of things like being able to play 
outside during the day at any time.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We have a long way to go but this is a start and sustainable 
development is all about ensuring we are not taking anything away 
from generations to come and we want to give them more. We want 
to make sure future generations have more than what we have 
today. I hope we can have that philosophy of giving them more. We 
are only the trustees of the resources we have to pass on to our 
children at the minimum in the same condition and hopefully in a 
better condition than how we received them.
<P>
	I had an interesting experience when someone who often 
lectured about the environment put a time line on the board, a long 
line from the start of plant and animal life and stretched on to the 
time of mankind on earth. On this huge line there was a very tiny 
spot during which mankind has been on the.
<P>
	Other animals have lived as long as 400 million years, but 
mankind between 1 million and 3 million years. If we collectively 
destroy our environment and destroy future generations, in respect 
of that time line we will barely be a footnote in the history of 
animal life on earth. That really opened my eyes to say we have 
been on the earth for such a short time and we have done so much 
damage already and we have lots of work to make sure we continue 
on that time line for a long time to come. We can only do it if we 
respect our environment.
<P>
	Bill C-83 ensures federal government policies and operations are 
closely looked at in terms of the environment, as well as what 
effects it has on the economy. Canadians look to the federal 
government for leadership on sustainable development. By getting 
its house in order, by showing leadership the federal government 
can promote the shift to sustainable development throughout 
Canadian society. This is what Bill C-83 is all about.
<P>
	The government's response to the committee's report focused on 
integrating the environment into federal decision making. The 
government has already followed up with a number of initiatives. 
To name a few, proclamation of the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act, actions to green government operations, the task 
force on economic instruments and disincentives to sound 
environmental practices and the initial follow up to the task force 
in the last federal budget.
<P>
	Bill C-83 explicitly incorporates the environment and 
sustainable development in the Auditor General Act. This is very 
important because we do not want a commissioner without clout. 
We want a commissioner with clout and that is why I commend the 
Minister of the Environment who has brought this in under the 
Auditor General Act. It will give the auditor general the clear legal 
mandate to include environmental effects alongside the 
conventional considerations of the economy, effectiveness and 
efficiency among the considerations he uses to determine the 
observations he will bring to the attention of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, Bill C-83 will also provide federal government 
leadership in making the shift to sustainable development. The 
amendments will proactively promote sustainable development 
across all federal departments by requiring ministers to table in the 
House sustainable development strategies that include their 
departments' objectives and plans of action to further sustainable 
development. Departments will be required to update these 
strategies every three years and ministers to table the updates in the 
House.
<P>
	Bill C-83 will also authorize the auditor general to forward 
petitions from the public on environmental matters to the 
responsible ministers. The ministers will be required to respond 
within a specified time frame.
<P>
	These amendments are significant in and of themselves. 
However the bill goes much further. Bill C-83 also creates a truly 
independent commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development. The commissioner will be within the office of the 
auditor general. He or she will be appointed by the auditor general 
and will report directly to him as his right hand person in all his 
environmental and sustainable development related duties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14597"> 14597 </A></B>
<P>
	The committee had recommended a stand alone commissioner. 
However, the commissioner can operate effectively and efficiently 
in the office of the auditor general because the office of the auditor 
general is well respected. It has clout and it has solid existing 
expertise which can start implementing the amendments right 
away.
<P>
	Moreover, it means environmental and sustainable development 
issues will be integrated with the economic considerations in that 
office just as they should be in a sustainable development world.
<P>
	The commissioner will also assist the auditor general in 
addressing the environmental and sustainable development aspects 
of his general auditing work. The commissioner will monitor and 
report annually to the House on the government's progress toward 
sustainable development. The commissioner will review 
departments' sustainable development strategies and monitor the 
implementation of the action plan and the achievements of the 
objectives. The commissioner will be required by Bill C-83 to 
report annually to the House on anything related to environmental 
aspects of sustainable development he or she considers merits 
attention, including the extent to which action plans have been 
implemented and objectives met and on the number, subject matter 
and status of petitions received by ministers.
<P>
	These amendments are historic and unprecedented. They have 
far reaching implications for the way the federal government does 
its business. They ensure that no matter who the auditor general 
happens to be, environment and sustainable development will have 
a high profile in the workforce. They will provide leadership on 
sustainable development by proactively promoting and 
operationalizing sustainable development within federal 
departments and across major economic sectors of our country. 
They will hold the government fully accountable to the public for 
its leadership and progress in making the shift to sustainable 
development.
<P>
	As I look back over the past year or so I am gratified that the 
government has taken a red book commitment and engaged 
Parliament and Canadians in fulfilling it and in going beyond.
<P>
	However, this is only the beginning of the road to making 
sustainable development a practical reality. Because of the bill, in 
the months and years ahead departments will be engaging 
stakeholders in the development and implementation of sustainable 
development strategies.
<P>
	I know some members on the other side have said we should 
have gone further and that we did not go far enough. This is a very 
important start because it recognizes how important the 
environment is. It recognizes how important the environment is to 
future generations. It recognizes the importance of the environment 
to our future economic prosperity. It is no use enjoying tremendous 
economic prosperity now only to have it taken away from future 
generations.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We must ensure we protect for generations to come that we have 
a liveable environment, an environment with clean water, clean air, 
and that our decisions as a government fully take into consideration 
a development that is sustainable, a development that maintains a 
quality of life for future generations, a development that does not 
put hardship on any sector of society.
<P>
	We have seen in some developing countries where when they do 
not respect the environment, when there is no clean water 
available, for example, sometimes the poor, the women have to pay 
a very heavy price when they have to go two miles to get it. 
Children die because they do not have clean water.
<P>
	We have come a long way and I am sure my colleagues and the 
Minister of the Environment will continue to work on this. It is 
very important to me and to my constituency. In the west this is a 
very important issue and I am very thankful I had the opportunity 
to speak on behalf of my constituents of Vancouver South.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to comment on some of the statements made 
by the hon. member for Vancouver South.
<P>
	I think all Canadians recognize the importance of paying close 
attention to what is happening with our environment, and certainly 
sustainability in our environment is a most important factor.
<P>
	The member mentioned that Bill C-83 contains some 
amendments unprecedented in Parliament in dealing with the 
environment. We have had the auditor general's department 
operating as an exclusive body making a critique of the 
government, scrutinizing the operations for many years now.
<P>
	We have seen report after report from the auditor general being 
critical of the different government departments and making 
recommendations only to have those reports go somewhere on a 
shelf and collect dust.
<P>
	It is one thing to appoint a commission, a body or an individual 
to be independent, to look at how the government runs its business. 
It is one thing for the reports to be made, for the recommendations 
to be made, for the observations to be made clear, for that outside 
body to call for accountability. Another thing is for the government 
to act on those recommendations. We have not seen a very glowing 
record of governments acting on recommendations and criticism 
by the auditor general's department. We have not seen it in many 
years. Certainly the government has not done anything to stop that 
record of ignoring the auditor general's report.
<P>
	As Bill C-83 contains some amendments unprecedented in 
Parliament in the field of  environmental sustainability, I suggest 
the government begin to take some unprecedented steps in not only 
acknowledging the reports of the auditor general and not only 
receiving them but actually acting on them. It would be a most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14598"> 14598 </A></B>
<P>
unprecedented step if the government would start to act on some of 
the recommendations of the auditor general's department.
<P>
	I will leave the hon. member with that thought. I am sure he will 
want to give me his assurances that whatever criticism and 
recommendations come from the new position will be acted on by 
the government.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
statement and his question.
<P>
	I assure him that as a government we would not be setting up 
such a commissioner without taking full responsibility and 
ensuring that the reports that are issued are taken very seriously and 
that the government respond to those reports.
<P>
	I can say that there have been many occasions in the House when 
the auditor general has brought forward concerns. On many 
occasions I have seen the minister or the appropriate department 
respond very quickly and assure the auditor general that they take 
those matters very seriously. I have seen members on the opposite 
side stand and quote the auditor general. Obviously they also take it 
very seriously. I know all members take the issues very seriously 
and bring them forward.
<P>
	There are a lot of examples that have shown that governments do 
respond, take action, and investigate to assure that anything the 
auditor general puts out, where it is possible and where it is felt to 
be advantageous, is responded to and dealt with in an effective 
manner. I can assure the member that this will be continued by the 
government whenever those reports are issued.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a couple of comments.
<P>
	First, the member went on for a considerable time talking about 
clean water and the necessity of being aware how important it is. 
That almost goes without saying, but it does not hurt to repeat it. I 
wonder if the member is aware of the swim for the Fraser River 
effort by Finn Donnelly from British Columbia, who is currently 
swimming the entire length of the Fraser River in an effort to raise 
environmental awareness about the necessity for cleaning up what 
is really the major water artery in British Columbia.
<P>
	Second, when he talks about sustainable development, on which 
coast of British Columbia does he think the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans has done the best job on sustainable 
development in the area of fisheries, the east coast or the west 
coast?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East said, clean water is a very important  asset. As we saw 
recently in the World Bank report, clean water is going to be a very 
important resource for the world.
<P>
	I also acknowledge the gentleman who is swimming the Fraser 
River to raise awareness of having clean water. An important thing 
to remember is when a resource like water is polluted it is 
expensive to restore the resource and bring it back. It is much 
easier to prevent pollution from happening in the first place.
<P>
	As parliamentary secretary it has been a great experience to learn 
about sustainability and how all resources are so interdependent. 
Our ecosystem is so sensitive to change, and we do not understand 
a lot of it. We do not understand what water temperature does to 
fish. We do not understand the interdependence of our whole 
ecosystem. We have a lot to learn. We have to do a better job for 
our future generations.
<P>
	I will do everything I can to ensure that we have sustainable 
development and do not take away from future generations. To the 
best of my ability I will try to achieve that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?

	The House resumed from June 19 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the 
importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese based 
substances, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the federal government is 
given the opportunity to protect jobs, save the environment, protect 
consumers, and keep Canada on the leading edge of automotive 
technology, should we take it? You bet. You bet that we will seize a 
chance to support technology that helps us improve fuel economy 
and meet our climate change objectives. You  bet that we are going 
to do everything we can to reduce air pollution and smog. That is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14599"> 14599 </A></B>
<P>
why we have taken action to remove MMT from Canadian 
unleaded gasoline, and that is why I am happy to stand today in 
support of Bill C-94, the manganese based fuel additives act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will prohibit the importation of and interprovincial 
trade in MMT, a manganese-based fuel additive manufactured in 
the United States. The proposed bill will come into force sixty days 
after the day on which it is assented to. At the present time Canada 
is the only country in the world still using MMT in unleaded 
gasoline. Even in Bulgaris, studies have even been carried out, and 
it was decided not to use it. The USA banned it in 1968 from their 
unleaded gasoline. Bulgaria and Argentina are the only other 
countries showing any interest whatsoever in its use and, as I said, 
Bulgaria finally decided against it.
<P>
	Why is MMT not used by more countries? Because it adversely 
affects the operation of the pollution control equipment in today's 
cars and trucks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My department has received and reviewed study after study of 
the effects of MMT on this equipment. I have seen the studies 
myself: studies from Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota, 
Honda, Subaru, Nissan, Mazda, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, 
Volvo, Saab, Lada, Jaguar, Land Rover and Hyundai. They are 
separate studies, which all say the same thing: MMT adversely 
affects onboard diagnostic systems where pollution control 
equipment is found. These systems are extremely important for the 
environment.
<P>
	One only has to travel in the lower mainland of British Columbia 
to know how we need strong legislation on vehicle emissions. 
MMT is preventing the kinds of clean emissions governments 
across this land are seeking.
<P>
	These systems of onboard diagnostics are crucial for 
environmental gains. They are responsible for monitoring a 
vehicle's emission controls and for letting a driver know when an 
anti-pollution system is not working. They make sure that the 
cleaner burning engines coming off the production lines today 
operate as they are designed. They make sure that automobiles are 
properly maintained, resulting in decreased tail pipe emissions and 
improved fuel economy.
<P>
	One only has to drive a new car off the lot to know that the 
models of this year and next year and the year after are 
substantially improved in terms of their emission levels, fuel 
economy, and anti-pollution devices. Those cars should be given a 
chance to work, not only in the best interests of their drivers, but 
particularly in the best interests of the lack of air pollution in our 
cities.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	This is critical technology. It is technology that has to be given 
the chance to do its job. With the legislation we are making sure 
that modern anti-pollution technology can be put to work in 
Canadian cities, cities that were reeling last summer under the 
burden of smog caused by too many cars clogging the arteries of 
our nation's communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This government would not allow MMT to stop the Canadian 
automobile industry from designing far less polluting vehicles. 
Canada's environment and Canada's consumers are entitled to the 
best pollution control equipment possible.
<P>
	The federal government had been waiting since 1985 for the 
automobile and petroleum industries to get together on a solution 
to this problem, which the government had already identified ten 
years ago. I made a personal appeal to the two industries to pool 
their efforts towards finding a solution. I even proposed to the 
MMT manufacturers that they give consumers the choice, that 
there be at least one pump without MMT, and they absolutely 
refused. They are not interested in what consumers want. They are 
not interested in anti-pollution matters. They are interested only in 
a polluting product imported from the United States, which is not 
even used there, because its use has been prohibited since 1978. 
But we have to allow it here. How can that be?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to repeat that, because I think it is important to this debate 
that the House understand we have waited 10 years for the 
importers of this product to get together with the automobile 
manufacturers to find a common solution. We are not interested in 
legislating solutions to all consumers' problems.
<P>
	I offered in personal meetings with the importers of the 
particular product to have a solution where at least one gasoline 
pump per gas station was free of MMT. Give the consumer the 
choice. They refused. They categorically refused, even though 
there has been study after study after study. I believe at last count 
there 17 automobile companies either manufacturing or selling in 
Canada that have asked for gasoline free of MMT. Somehow there 
is this tremendous conspiracy inflicted on them by consumers.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, how do you think Canadian consumers feel about 
the fact that sparkplugs in Canada fail at 17 times greater rates than 
in the United States? Why? Why do you think the Toyota manual 
right now advises against using MMT gasoline? The new manuals 
will have disclaimers in them, that if you use MMT in your 
gasoline they may not be able to in fact guarantee your warranty. 
Why is it that automobile manufacturers in Canada have suggested 
that if we cannot move on MMT  they may be forced to add up to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14600"> 14600 </A></B>
<P>
$3,000 to the cost of a new car in Canada, the same car they sell in 
the United States? The variable is MMT.
<P>
	For some reason, despite direct offers by the Government of 
Canada for the importers of this product to find a replacement or a 
consumer alternative, they refuse again and again. Ten years of 
waiting for a solution is long enough. With the new requirements of 
automobile emissions pending, we have to move quickly. As we 
speak there are cars rolling off the assembly line dedicated to the 
1996 market that do not have an onboard diagnostic system 
attached because at the moment the companies cannot be 
guaranteed that it is going to work as long as we have MMT in the 
gasoline.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Even then, I waited, I gave the companies a deadline of last 
December to resolve the problem. They could not do it. I waited 
until February, but for some reason, the companies importing ethyl 
could find no other way but to force it on all fuel levels.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Once again, we waited. Well, the ten year wait has gone on long 
enough. It is time now for the government to act on consumers' 
behalf, in support of anti-pollution technology and above all in 
support of the environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Without action our vehicle emission reduction programs will be 
put in jeopardy. We risk missing out on major reductions in smog, 
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.
<P>
	If we do not act now, Canadian consumers will be prevented 
from taking advantage of state of the art emission technology 
because they do not have access to MMT free gasoline. If we do not 
act now we will face the situation where automakers will turn off 
the diagnostic systems for the 1996 models because of the damage 
caused by MMT.
<P>
	Right now General Motors is bringing cars off the assembly lines 
with on board diagnostic functions disconnected from the system. 
It is no longer prepared to assume the increased warranty risks for 
damage caused to pollution control equipment by MMT.
<P>
	In the end it is the Canadian consumer, the Canadian taxpayer, 
the Canadian who drives a car who has to pay more. The 
maintenance of our cars is costing more because of the presence of 
MMT. We will not let this happen. We will not allow leading edge 
Canadian technology to be put at risk.
<P>
	This substance is not manufactured in Canada but imported from 
the United States where it has been banned for almost 20 years. 
They can make it there but they cannot use it there so they use it in 
Canada, the last bastion of MMT. We will not allow the buck to be 
passed to Canadian consumers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> We will not allow anti-pollution equipment in 
Canada to be less effective than anti-pollution equipment in the 
United States. We will not allow the competitiveness of our 
automobile industry to be threatened. We will not allow investment 
and the thousands of Canadian jobs which depend on that 
investment to be put in jeopardy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Properly resolving the MMT question will have positive effects 
on the environment through the use of the most sophisticated 
emission control techniques. Moreover, Canadians will enjoy the 
same guarantee as American automobile owners. Resolving the 
MMT problem will guarantee that Canadian automobile emission 
control programs are in line with American programs. This means 
that Canadians will continue to enjoy the economic and technical 
benefits of having a standardized North American automobile 
population.
<P>
	It also means that the Canadian automobile sector, whether in 
Quebec or Ontario, will remain competitive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us be clear. The job of reducing motor vehicle pollution can 
no longer be addressed just by an industry, whether it be the 
automobile industry, the petroleum industry or the government. 
Progress at reducing vehicle pollution demands action by every 
single Canadian.
<P>
	The petroleum industry needs to move forward in making 
improvements in the composition and properties of the fuels 
burned by those engines. The auto industry needs to make 
improvements in vehicle emission control technologies such as 
those offered through on board diagnostic systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for the government, it must act to reduce pollution from 
vehicles. This is the sort of action we have begun with Bill C-94, 
the sort of action we take when we establish a global automobile 
emission control strategy, which includes more rigorous standards 
on vehicle exhaust systems.
<P>
	In meeting these standards, we are counting on sophisticated 
emission control techniques and the fuels they require. We need 
new technology. We must reduce smog and carbon monoxide and 
hydrocarbon emissions. We have to reduce this type of emission, 
which have a significant negative effect on the quality of the air and 
on the greenhouse effect on the climate. This government takes its 
responsibilities seriously in the area of climatic change.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a fact that temperatures increase when carbon emissions 
increase. It is a fact that carbon dioxide has  reached concentrations 
that are 25 per cent higher than at any time in the 220,000 years of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14601"> 14601 </A></B>
<P>
atmospheric history. It is a fact that the average global temperature 
today is four to six degrees higher than during the last ice age.
<P>
	The member of the legislature from Prince Edward Island who is 
in the gallery today will no doubt be aware of the profound impact 
of what the failure to address climate change will have on our 
coastal regions, including the lower mainland of British Columbia 
and Prince Edward Island. It is a fact that if we fail to take action 
average global temperatures will rise another 1.5 to 4.5 degrees 
within the next 50 years.
<P>
	In other words, our children could confront the kind of global 
warming which triggered the end of the ice age. They could face 
the kind of global warming that causes sea levels to rise, that dries 
forests, that desertifies farmland, that wipes out communities and 
in some cases that wipes out entire countries.
<P>
	Climate change is not like other environmental problems. Action 
after the fact is not an option. If we wait for the problem to 
overwhelm us, if we ignore the scientific evidence that is coming in 
harder, faster and stronger than ever before, it will be too late. With 
climate change preventive action is the key. Preventive action 
means producing goods more cleanly. It means having access to 
cleaner automobiles. It means using less energy through the likes 
of onboard diagnostic systems which can warn us when the systems 
are malfuctioning and when in fact our conversion is not as 
efficient as it should be. It means using less energy. It means 
conserving our natural resources and developing and implementing 
the latest in green technologies like the emission reduction 
technologies in today's cars and trucks.
<P>
	The bill before the House is one small measure in the battle for a 
better environment. The bill is pro-environment. It is pro-consumer 
and it is pro-jobs. Eighteen of Canada's automobile companies 
think we are doing the right thing. Canadians think we are doing the 
right thing.
<P>
	MMT can no longer stand in the way of progress that we 
continue to make on reducing vehicle emissions in the face of the 
continuing need for environmental protection.
<P>
	Let us protect Canadian jobs. Let us protect Canadian investment 
in high technology. Let us protect the pocketbooks of Canadian 
consumers. Let us above all protect the air that we breath. Let us 
make Canada the last country in the world to finally to put an end to 
the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I applaud the Deputy Prime Minister's commitment to the 
environment and what she professes to say. I would like to point 
out a few facts which she omitted from her speech.
<P>
	If we were to withdraw MMT from gasoline the nitrous oxide 
content of the environment would increase by 20 per cent which is 
a very important additive to smog, a causative agent for smog.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister brings forward a whole host of 
studies. Every one of those studies was done by an auto 
manufacturer. I would also like to tell the Deputy Prime Minister 
that the EPA just came out with studies which show that MMT does 
not do anything to damage onboard devices.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister how she can account for 
removing MMT from gasoline if the nitrous oxide content coming 
from cars is going to increase by 20 per cent. Also, is she going to 
commit to having an independent party review MMT to determine 
once and for all if it is going to damage onboard computers and also 
if it is going to harm people?
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the preamble to his question the 
member implies that somehow these 18 automobile companies 
have an interest in destroying the market for MMT. The only 
studies I have seen in support of MMT are coming out very thick 
and fast from the company that imports the product, the same 
company that I am sure supplied the figures to the member that 
talks about the level of environmental contribution made by MMT.
<P>
	If he wants to put it in context, the abolition of MMT will create 
a situation where air emissions can improve by up to 600 per cent 
specifically because it will permit the onboard diagnostic systems 
of new cars to work. The presence of MMT will not help the 
environment. The presence of MMT will hurt the environment.
<P>
	Companies such as Toyota, Ford, GM and Saab are companies 
that are in competition with each other for a market. They are not in 
collusion. For some bizarre reason 18 automobile companies both 
domestically producing and importing cars have all done 
independent studies which have identified a single variable 
between the Canadian and the U.S. gasoline which contributes to 
the failure rate of onboard diagnostic systems. That single variable 
is MMT. Those same companies have provided the department 
with studies that show the failure rate for Canadian spark plugs is 
17 times higher than in the United States.
<P>
	Should a consumer in the lower mainland of British Columbia 
have to change his spark plugs 17 times? Mr. Speaker, if you buy 
the rather weak argument of the Ethyl Corporation that this is such 
a fantastically great product, why would the Ethyl Corporation not 
accede to the demand of the government that it offer the consumers 
a choice? Why would the CPPI producers not arrive at a gas station 
and let people have the choice? If this is such a fantastic product 
why not let the consumers decide? Why did the company refuse my 
offer made to  them in person to have only one pump in gas stations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14602"> 14602 </A></B>
<P>
across the country which would be MMT free? If this is such a 
great product why is Canada the only country in the world that 
currently authorizes its use?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
some of the remarks the hon. Deputy Prime Minister has made. I 
wonder if the Deputy Prime Minister would be willing to table 
some of the studies she has quoted from today, referenced and held 
physically in the presence of this assembly. Would she be willing to 
table those for our use and examination?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, those studies were shared. As the hon. 
member will know, when companies test their automobiles it is a 
very confidential matter. As I gave my word, the companies in 
question actually met with CPPI in a private meeting organized 
through my department where they could individually review all of 
those studies.
<P>
	Unfortunately CPPI broke the agreement of secrecy and those 
studies ended up being passed to other individuals. It was a breach 
of the confidentiality that every automobile company expects to 
have in terms of its own testing of vehicles.
<P>
	I can provide him with analyses of the material that went before 
the CPPI. I can provide him with some general views from the 
industry. I cannot provide the individual studies because when they 
were provided to CPPI through an agreement with my office they 
subsequently found their way into the public domain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Minister of the Environment for her efforts 
today.
<P>
	I believe the bill in front of us does receive the support of the 
majority of members of the House of Commons. I congratulate the 
minister for bringing it forward. At the same time, as she knows, a 
lot of what she says about the environment and fuel, about the need 
to be proactive and moving ahead into the future, can also be done 
through the support of ethanol based fuel additives.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Many in western Canada are engaged in ethanol development 
projects as a way of not only assisting the environment but also of 
assisting in regions which require assistance with economic 
development. I am wondering if in the course of her remarks today 
the minister might indicate her support and commitment for 
ethanol based fuel additives and what she can do for western 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, when we introduced legislation which 
will require 75 per cent of all new federal government vehicles to 
be run on alternative fuels it was in part to try to accelerate the 
market. The federal government currently has an annual fleet of 
about 25,000 cars. If we factor in the number of cars in crown 
corporations there are 39,000 cars that are on the road as  a result of 
federal government activities. We are mandating that 75 per cent of 
those cars be fuelled by alternative fuels within the next five years.
<P>
	We think that will provide the kind of niche market which will 
hopefully be a catalyst for further development in the area of 
alternative fuels by the private sector. We have not in a sense 
mandated a particular kind of fuel, but certainly ethanol is an 
alternative and particularly is one which can be mixed into current 
vehicle emissions. It is a very positive alternative.
<P>
	We have tried to build market demand for consumer moves to 
alternative fuels in a very large way which will help a rather 
fledgling industry. As the hon. member will know, ethanol can 
currently be mixed at a 10 per cent ratio. Any further conversions 
will be good for renewable resources and an alternative for the 
current growth in global warming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to be able to debate this issue, particularly after having 
had the summer months to do research and become more familiar 
with this topic.
<P>
	I was quite flabbergasted when I heard the Minister of the 
Environment in her impassioned speech. I could not help but think 
that the passion was little more than the political puppet dancing 
when the strings are pulled by the masters of the power brokers in 
the country.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the bill has come before the House 
today because the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association 
claimed that MMT was setting off the warning lights on onboard 
diagnostic systems when nothing was really wrong with the 
systems. I understand the association basically told the minister 
that she had to ban MMT in Canada or it would disconnect the 
onboard diagnostic systems on cars headed for Canada, or it would 
increase the cars' warranty costs or shorten the warranty period. 
The MVMA also claims that MMT has caused the misfiring of 
certain sparkplugs.
<P>
	I fail to understand, in view of how extensively this topic has 
been studied, particularly in the United States where the product 
has been banned for 18 years and will again be available for use 
before the end of the year, why the minister has accepted without 
question the position of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers 
Association.
<P>
	Furthermore, I understand that the proponents of the bill claim 
that banning MMT will lower pollution and health risks to human 
beings. There have also been numerous claims in favour of banning 
MMT, such as the need for uniformity in gasolines in the North 
American market. I would like to address all of these points briefly 
in my presentation to the House today but most important I wish to 
show how the ban on MMT could be detrimental to the Canadian 
market.
<P>
	Let me say before I get into my presentation that I and numerous 
other members of my caucus have met with  both sides of this 
argument a number of times, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers 
Association and Ethyl Corporation, which is more than I can say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14603"> 14603 </A></B>
<P>
for what the minister has done. She has consistently refused to 
meet with both sides of the argument and has only met with the 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. I hardly think one can 
form a balanced view of the issue without meeting and listening to 
both sides of the argument.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	After having done so, I firmly believe that there is no health, 
environmental or technical reason for banning MMT in Canada. 
MMT has been used in Canada since 1977. It was used in the 
United States until 1970 and was banned in 1970 due to a U.S. 
clean air act establishing a process requiring new fuel additives not 
substantially similar to gasoline to obtain a waiver by 
demonstrating compatibility with vehicle emission systems.
<P>
	The company that manufactures MMT, Ethyl Corporation, 
undertook an extensive fuel additive testing program which 
resulted in the Environmental Protection Agency's conclusion in 
December 1993 that MMT will not cause or contribute to the 
failure of any emission control device or system.
<P>
	Contrary to the minister's statement of May 5, 1995, the U.S. 
court of appeal ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to 
grant waiver approval to Ethyl Corporation on April 14, 1995. The 
minister was fully informed of this decision.
<P>
	In December 1993 following a large fuel additive testing 
program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded 
that the use of MMT will not cause or contribute to the failure of 
any emission control device or system, including onboard 
diagnostic systems. The Environmental Protection Agency and 
subsequently the U.S. court of appeal rejected concerns about the 
impact of MMT on onboard diagnostic systems presented by U.S. 
automakers.
<P>
	The U.S. automakers have experienced significant difficulties in 
the certification of onboard diagnostic systems in the United States 
where MMT is not currently used in unleaded gasolines. The U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air 
Resources Board have recently changed the regulations to allow for 
certification of vehicles that do not comply with the OBD-II 
requirements.
<P>
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has stated in the 
federal register that automobile manufacturers have expressed and 
demonstrated difficulty in complying with every aspect of the 
onboard diagnostic requirements and such difficulty appears likely 
to continue into the 1996-97 model year.
<P>
	In Canada the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association appears 
to be blaming the OBD-II system difficulties on MMT. The Motor 
Vehicle Manufacturers Association members have lobbied the 
Canadian  government threatening to disconnect onboard 
diagnostic warning systems and pass the cost on to consumers 
unless the government passes legislation to ban MMT.
<P>
	The Canadian government appears to have responded to these 
threats without noting that the vehicle manufacturers have failed to 
achieve OBD-II certification in the U.S. for most new models.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would like to know if this minister can explain 
her statement that if vehicle manufacturers carry through on threats 
to remove onboard diagnostic systems this would result in a tenfold 
increase in vehicle emissions. This false claim shows a 
fundamental misunderstanding of the technical issues involved and 
underlies the need for independent technical assessment of the 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association claims.
<P>
	Onboard diagnostic systems do not reduce emissions on 
vehicles. Onboard diagnostic systems are a monitoring system 
designed to notify the driver when emission control equipment is 
not operating properly. Removal or more likely disconnecting the 
onboard diagnostic systems would only serve to prevent a 
dashboard malfunction indicator light from illuminating. No 
emission control equipment would be removed.
<P>
	On the sparkplug issue that the minister makes much of, the 
Minister of the Environment cited the claims to help justify her 
proposal for the legislation to remove MMT. However, she failed to 
point out that the automakers' claims related primarily to one type 
of platinum tipped sparkplug used primarily on one engine version 
only in GM automobiles. The sparkplug in question was 
discontinued by GM indicating that problems were related to 
design, not MMT.
<P>
	No casual links have ever been established between MMT and 
sparkplug problems. To my knowledge no warranty data has ever 
been made public.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	I have learned that to further assess the validity of GM's 
concerns independent testing was conducted at the Southwest 
Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, using the platinum 
tipped, long life sparkplugs used in all 1994 2.2-litre Chevrolet 
Cavaliers. The goal of the study initiated with General Motors 
Corporation in the U.S. was to determine the differences between 
new sparkplugs, failed sparkplugs and sparkplugs used which have 
had no problem.
<P>
	The sparkplugs were fired by a power supply which increased 
output to the plugs in a ramped manner. Current leakage up until 
the plugs fired was measured. Movies were taken to document 
whether arcs occurred between electrodes or from electrode to 
shell.
<P>
	The sparkplug test program showed that MMT is not associated 
with reported sparkplug related problems. To satisfy the U.S. clean 
air act requirements for the reintroduction of MMT in unleaded 
gasolines in the  United States, Ethyl Corporation informed me that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14604"> 14604 </A></B>
<P>
it had conducted the most extensive series of tests ever undertaken 
on a gasoline additive.
<P>
	The testing program was designed with the assistance of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. automakers to evaluate 
and document the effective MMT performance additive on 
automobile tailpipe emissions and to determine the implications 
for air quality if MMT additives were used in the U.S. gasoline.
<P>
	The initial MMT emissions test program involved 48 cars 
representing a broad cross-section of automobiles driven in North 
America operated for a total of more than three million miles. Half 
of the 1988 cars used the test fuel with the additive and half used 
the same fuel without the additive.
<P>
	Tailpipe emissions were checked every 5,000 miles. Testing 
demonstrated conclusively that MMT decreases nitrous oxide by 
approximately 20 per cent. As a note, the EPA participated in 
determining the test protocols. Also, independent testing data 
analysis organizations used procedures similar to those used by the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
<P>
	On the issue of health, I would like to address the concerns with 
MMT. On December 6, 1994 Health Canada released the results of 
an independent risk assessment focusing on new epidemiological 
studies and Canadian exposure data titled ``Risk Assessment for 
the Combustion Products of MMT in Gasoline''.
<P>
	The Health Canada study concluded that the use of MMT in 
gasoline does not represent a health risk to any segment of the 
Canadian population. Specifically the report states: ``Airborne 
manganese resulting from the combustion of MMT in gasoline 
powered vehicles is not entering the Canadian environment in 
quantities or under conditions that may constitute a health risk''. 
The study also concluded that there is no connection between levels 
of ambient respirable manganese and MMT sales or use in 
unleaded gasoline whether examined by geographical area or by 
season.
<P>
	Back on April 25, 1995 the hon. Minister of Industry stated that 
it is crucial that we have uniformity in standards of gasoline in the 
North American market. The hon. Minister of Industry was 
referring to the fact that at the time MMT was not used in the 
U.S.A. but was in Canada and it was important to have the same 
gasoline-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course the hon. member will have the floor 
right after question period. It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by 
Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Premier Frank McKenna for a decisive victory at the polls on 
September 11. The citizens of New Brunswick have reaffirmed 
their commitment to the provincial government's vision of job

<P>
	The former official opposition party, the Confederation of 
Regions, is a party that opposes bilingualism both in Canada and in 
New Brunswick. It is important to note that it was completely shut 
out of the legislative assembly. In my own riding, five core MLAs 
were defeated and only one finished second. This sends a message 
to the people of New Brunswick that both linguistic communities 
are an integral part of our province and our country. I applaud the 
citizens of Fredericton and of New Brunswick for asserting their 
vision of an equitable and tolerant society.

tomorrow, students will hold rallies throughout Quebec to protest 
against the federal government's cuts to social programs and its 
intransigent attitude toward the Quebec National Assembly's 
unanimous and legitimate demands.
<P>
	The budget cuts made by the federal government will have a 
disastrous impact on the provinces' tax burden, which the Prime 
Minister is loath to admit. His government's cuts to social transfers 
have left the provinces and the students with no way out. These cuts 
are forcing the provinces to impose an unprecedented hike in 
tuition fees, on the one hand, and to increase student indebtedness 
to unmanageable levels, on the other hand.
<P>
	Given all the secretiveness and tricks used to hide the 
consequences of his reforms, how can Quebecers trust the Prime 
Minister of Canada?

one decision he and his department have made about the Crow

<P>
	Farmers on the prairies and particularly in northwest 
Saskatchewan who grew forage crops in 1994 in rotation with their 
grains have been declared ineligible for compensation on those 
land acres seeded for forage. All summer long I received calls and 
letters from producers caught in this unfair situation. Most recently 
I have been receiving letters from individual rural municipalities 
asking that this unfair situation be changed because forage acres 
will see the same reduction in land values as cultivated acres.
<P>
	Prior to the decision being made, the Minister of Agriculture 
said he consulted with the Saskatchewan Association of Rural 
Municipalities and valued its opinion. I hope he continues to value 
its opinion and will now reconsider so that producers who are 
managing their lands properly will not be unduly penalized by this 
unfortunate and unfair circumstance.

	Mr. Tobin was only 17 years old when he enlisted in the army. 
He had no way of knowing then that on July 1, 1916, his Royal

Beaumont Hamel. Over 300 people died or went missing; 386 were 
wounded. The next morning only 68 men were able to answer the

received medical attention and then returned to the battlefield.

appears to be interested in contributing to the success of the

Friday the heritage minister gave what he claimed would be a 
visionary speech on the future of Canadian culture. To be kind, we 
will just say it fell somewhat short of its billing.
<P>
	The speech was really a little temper tantrum replete with 
contradictions and embarrassing pleas for respect from the big bad 
Americans. The sub-theme of the speech was: ``It is not our fault; 
we are all victims''.
<P>
	In the face of worldwide competition the Canadian cultural 
industry needs to take full advantage of American capital markets. 
We need competition. We need international partnerships. We need 
new markets. Subsidization and protectionism will only produce 
trade wars, feeble and inefficient companies, and the loss of the 
choice and value that Canadians deserve.
<P>
	Yes, change sometimes can be frightening, but the minister 
should quit his whining and stand out of the way. Even while he 
spoke and with no help from the government, individuals and

introducing Canadian culture to the world and the 21st century.

leaders deciding not to honour their promise to make the question 
clear and simple.
<P>
	Does the leader of the Bloc Quebecois remember making a

be asked a simple question that would go something like this: Do 
you want Quebec to become a sovereign country, yes or no?

Mr. Parizeau has reason to be proud because he kept his promises; 
he had promised to ask a clear question and that is what he did.
<P>
	It is obvious that the Prime Minister is out of touch with reality

<P>

choose instead to allow Her Majesty's only real and national

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fog thickened yesterday around the Prime Minister's 
real intentions, following statements he made in this House. When 
he speaks French, he remains ambiguous about the recognition of a 
Yes vote, but when he answers in English, he makes it clear he will 
reject a Yes from Quebecers.
<P>
	Since the very future of Canada and Quebec is at stake, the 
public has the right to expect the Prime Minister to be consistent 
and to be clear about his position.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will he, as the 
Reform Party did yesterday, respect Canada's democratic traditions 
and recognize a Yes or a No to the Quebec referendum question as 
equally valid?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what I said yesterday in English was translated into 
French, as you can see in <I>Hansard</I>. We have a system: if I speak 
French, it is translated into English, and if I speak English, it is 
translated into French. I said the same thing.
<P>
	And perhaps I could explain this to the Leader of the Opposition. 
I would like to quote to him from a document produced by the 
government of Mr. Lévesque, and of course he knows Mr. 
Lévesque. In 1977, in a document which appeared under the title: 
<I>La consultation populaire au Québec</I>, they said: ``Referendums 
would be consultative in nature''. I agree. The document says: 
``The first imperative of politics in a democracy is a clear 
majority''. I agree. The document goes on to say: ``The 
consultative nature of referendums'', they should have said 
referenda, in any case, ``means that it would be unnecessary to 
include in the legislation special provisions on the majority 
required or the minimum participation rate''.
<P>
	It is a consultative system, as Mr. Lévesque and his government 
admitted in 1977. Today, we have a confusing and ambiguous 
question, and I am asked whether we would recognize a vote with a 
majority of one. As Mr. Johnson put it so well yesterday, we are not 
about to separate from Canada on the basis of a judicial recount.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister just quoted Mr. René Lévesque. 
However, I am sure he will remember, the day after the 1980 
referendum, that Mr. Lévesque accepted the people's decision. He 
did not see it as just a consultation, a point of view. He agreed and 
bowed to the people's wishes, while the Prime Minister reneged on  
commitments he made to get a No from Quebecers in 1980.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> We are all aware the Prime Minister is trying to 
treat the current referendum as a mere consultation without 
consequence. I would ask him to confirm, and he also hinted at this 
yesterday in one of his replies, whether it is true he is preparing to 
call a federal referendum to put pressure on the Quebec Yes side?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not even have to consider that, because we will tell 
Quebec that the Leader of the Opposition is proposing Quebec's 
separation from the rest of Canada. They will vote to stay in 
Canada. If the question had been clearer- The leader of the Leader 
of the Opposition said this during the election campaign: Do you 
want Quebec to become a sovereign country on such and such a 
date? He said that would be the question.
<P>
	However, when the Leader of the Opposition realized he could 
not win, he said: We will come up with a winning question. Is that 
respect for democracy, coming up with a winning question because 
they cannot convince Quebecers to leave Canada?
<P>
	I have great confidence in the judgment of Quebecers. They will 
stay in Canada, and the question asked by the Leader of the 
Opposition is doubly hypothetical.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister continues to maintain a state of 
confusion and ambiguity. He refuses to tell us outright whether or 
not he will feel bound by the results of the referendum. He refuses 
to set aside the prospect of a counter-referendum by the federal 
government.
<P>
	I would ask him to raise the veil of secrecy at least partially and 
clarify the following: Would he not see as illegitimate any federal 
referendum aimed at short-circuiting a democratic decision by the 
people of Quebec on their political future?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Leader of the Opposition saying that when 
Quebecers voted against the Charlottetown proposal that would 
have given Quebecers a distinct society-the Leader of the 
Opposition himself voted against it-the referendum was 
legitimate because everyone was consulted? Canada's future is not 
the business of a single group of citizens. This has an impact on all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I must say I hardly have to consider holding a national 
referendum as authorized by Parliament, since Quebecers will 
realize that the separatists are trying to hide the truth. The leader of 
the Leader 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14609"> 14609 </A></B>
<P>
of the Opposition has refused to table documents paid for by  
taxpayers because these documents will clearly prove they are 
trying to hide the truth from Quebecers, because they know 
perfectly well that Quebecers want to stay in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
appreciate the Prime Minister's efforts to create a diversion in 
order to avoid answering the real question that the Leader of the 
Opposition has been asking and that all Quebecers have been 
asking through us over the past two days. I will try for an answer 
once again.
<P>
	He is becoming the ambiguity champion, shifting subtleties 
according to whichever language he is speaking or leaving the 
possibility of a second referendum in doubt. His answers are never 
clear. I will ask him the question once more. I want to give him an 
opportunity to respond clearly.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister of Canada not realize that he himself is 
confusing the whole question with his ambiguous statements? Does 
he not realize that his role as Prime Minister in fact is to act 
democratically and responsibly in response to the choice of 
Quebecers and to say so clearly and unambiguously?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is no.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for criticizing me for 
being too subtle. This is the first time this has happened to me in 
my life, and so I am very happy. For me, my duty is clear. I do not 
need any lessons from the hon. member for Roberval on what my 
duty is. I understand my duty very well. I was elected to administer 
this country, to give Canadians good government, to create jobs 
and to make this country even better. To do so, we must ensure that 
Canada remains united.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	This is what I am going to do over the next forty days with Mr. 
Johnson in Quebec City, to do my duty as Prime Minister and keep 
this country united for the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true 
that subtlety is a quality, but shifting subtleties according to the 
language you are speaking is devious.
<P>
	Speaking of Daniel Johnson, the chair of the ``No'' committee, 
he refused this morning to reiterate before the National Assembly 
the commitment he made last week to honour Quebec's yes vote.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the Prime Minister of Canada has just 
called the chair of the ``No'' committee in Quebec to order as he 
did last week in the case of his Minister of Labour? Did he use the 
same process?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Johnson understands the current debate very well. He 
has said we are not about to divide a country following a judicial 
recount to find out whether there was one more vote or not. It was 
in fact Mr.  Lévesque himself and his government that clearly 
established the rules whereby a majority must be clearly expressed 
in such a situation. These are the words of the person the Leader of 
the Opposition wants to replace. He admires and reveres him, he is 
always saying. I am therefore simply following the democratic 
principles established by Mr. Lévesque; and Mr. Johnson has said 
so as well: Democracy begins with treating people honestly and 
asking them a clear cut question.
<P>
	I challenge the opposition once more; I defy the Leader of the 
Opposition to call Mr. Parizeau. With one day of debate still to go 
at the National Assembly, let him replace the question with a clear 
one: Do you want to separate from Canada on a given date? They 
will have a clear cut answer. Quebecers will say: We are staying in 
Canada. That is being clear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has rightly accused the separatists of 
softening and confusing the referendum question in a vain attempt 
to guarantee a yes vote. This is obviously the separatist strategy 
and we denounce and deplore it. However, the Prime Minister is 
also sending out contradictory signals on the meaning of a yes vote 
that is hurting the federalist cause.
<P>
	Last week the Prime Minister said that a yes vote would be a one 
way ticket to separation, but yesterday in question period the Prime 
Minister implied that the one way ticket might include the return 
fare.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister now make it perfectly clear to 
Quebecers that a yes vote means separation and not just a new 
round of bargaining with the federal government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always said that the goal of the Parti Quebecois and the 
Bloc Quebecois is to separate from Canada. It is clear to me.
<P>
	I am very disappointed that the leader of the Reform Party is 
trying to position himself in a situation like this. I would like to tell

Quebec remains in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> If the Prime Minister wants to make comments 
about the loyalty of members to Canada let him direct them to the

difference is I am committed to federalism with my head as well as 
my heart. My head tells me-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am having a little difficulty hearing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am committed to federalism with 
my head as well as my heart. My head tells me the only way 
Canada can lose this referendum is for some Quebecers to think 
they can vote yes for separation and avoid the consequences of that 
vote. They think they can vote for separation and still enjoy the 
benefits of federalism. That is why we asked the Prime Minister to 
make clear that yes means separation and only no means 
federalism.
<P>
	I will again ask the Prime Minister sincerely, as we are not 
playing games here, why he is so reluctant to make that distinction 
crystal clear.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for 32 years I have travelled to every part of Canada and 
have made the same speech about this great country. I have 
travelled to Quebec and to the west, Alberta and B.C. It is my duty 
to say what I said. They want to create separation but they do not 
have the intellectual honesty to ask a clear question. This is what I 
have to tell them.
<P>
	In a country like ours to recognize that at one time a rule of 
majority plus one could break up the country would be 
irresponsible on my part. Even in the Reform Party, as a journalist 
wrote this morning, in order to change its constitution one has to 
ask for two-thirds of its membership.
<P>
	Therefore I will not break up the country with one vote. It is not 
real democracy. Real democracy is to convince the people they can 
express themselves clearly, which is what we are doing.
<P>
	This is why we are telling Quebecers these people want to 
separate but they will not succeed because it is our collective duty 
to tell all Quebecers the scheme they have, the virage, the mirage 
and so on will not work. They will not succeed in fooling the 
people of Quebec because the people of Quebec will know when 
they vote 39 days from now that they will not separate. They will 
stay in Canada because it is their destiny, their future and their 
desire.

	On September 12 the federal Unity Minister said: ``Quebecers 
have the right to express themselves about the future of Quebec in 
Canada. We are a democratic country, so we will respect the vote''. 
On the same day Daniel Johnson, the leader of the no forces in 
Quebec, when asked if he would accept a 50 plus 1 yes vote, said: 
``Yes, everyone will have to live with the result''.
<P>
	The federal unity minister and the leader of the no forces in 
Quebec have endeavoured to be clearer on the meaning of yes than 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	For the sake of national unity, we are not disagreeing about the 
goals, for the sake of making the issue crystal clear, will the Prime 
Minister get on side with the unity minister and with the leader of 
the no forces in Quebec by saying he agrees with them on the 
meaning of a yes vote?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very sad to see the leader of the Reform Party asking 
exactly the same questions as the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I have said all along the minister replied very clearly yesterday 
that we want a clear question on separation. This is not a clear 
question on separation. It is a confusing question which we are 
denouncing. When I hear that confusing question from the leader of 
the Reform Party, saying that with one vote he will let Canada go, it 
is a very sad day for the people of western Canada.

responsible for the No side.
<P>
	Yesterday in this House, the Minister of Labour tried to justify 
her about-face with respect to the referendum results by claiming 
that the question was ambiguous.
<P>
	On September 12, when she said she would respect the decision 
of Quebecers in the referendum, would the Minister of Labour 
agree that at the time she already knew what the referendum 
question was and had known for several days?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata certainly 
did not pay attention to the statements I made in my own riding. I 
was in the Lower St. Lawrence the day after the question was 
tabled in the Quebec National Assembly, and I said then that we 
were dealing with a question that was ambiguous, and I still say so 
today. And that is why the ``No'' coalition will work very hard 
during this referendum campaign to make the stakes clear to 
Quebecers, and the stakes are the separation of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Minister of Labour agree that it was intellectual 
dishonesty on her part to refuse to admit that a reprimand from the 
Prime Minister caused her to change her position on the results of 
the referendum?

words ``intellectual honesty''.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

in the reverse order, we will proceed as we have stated to operate on 
the basis of rolling two year targets so that in the course of the next 
budget we will obviously be setting a target for the year after 
1996-97.
<P>
	It will be a pleasure at that time to be establishing that target 
since it will be the fourth year in a row the government will have hit 
its deficit target.
<P>
	We intend to proceed in terms of the fall update exactly as we did 
last year. At a certain point following the beginning of the 
consultation process when it is important to make that appearance 
after there has been enough consultation so that the government 
reacts I would be delighted to appear.
<P>
	There is one major distinction between this year and last. It was 
very important last year to very clearly establish the direction the

very successful. What I will be doing this year is confirming that 
direction.

once worked, which never once met its deficit targets-that is to 
say to simply set five year targets, long term targets out of the way 
after an election was held and never meet them-was not the way 
to go.

growth, public finances. His finance minister does not share that 
interest, however, since he will not be taking part in the work of the 
finance committee leading up to the pre-budget consultation before 
the Quebec referendum is held.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How does the 
Minister of Finance explain his decision not to personally initiate 
the pre-budget consultations starting up today, but to wait until 
November to appear before the finance committee?

coincidence that the Reform Party and the Leader of the Opposition

	At any rate, Mr. Speaker, I will give you the answer. It is our 
intention to follow exactly the same timetable as last year. In other 
words, I went before the Finance Committee around October 17, or 
after the financial statements had been tabled. They are not yet 
ready for last year. Presentations were made to the Finance 
Committee by four or five other groups. I certainly intend to go 
before the Committee, once I am able to make worthwhile interest

Speaker, if a prebudget consultation process is initiated, the 
minister should be present to provide guidance. Last year, he gave 
direction to prebudget consultations. So, why is his office now 
telling us that he will be available from November 1 to 4 only? Is it 
because he has things to hide from the people of Quebec, who are 
about to make a decision regarding their future? Is he trying to hide 
his incompetence, seeing that there has been no net job creation 
since November 1994 and that economic growth is stalled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the reason why I 
testified slightly ahead of schedule last year, on October 17, was to 
clearly set out the government's economic policy. This year, as I 
said, we intend to confirm this.

now have a new program of loans and grants for the first time, 
including new grants for those in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	We have a new program where close to 25,000 young people will 
now be enrolled through various private sector initiatives in a

	The Canada pension plan is not in a state of collapse. In fact it is 
providing very secure pensions for all Canadians. We will be 
changing the Canada pension plan as we are required to do every

counterparts to discuss those matters because it is based on a pay as 
you go system.

something about the criminal justice system from their perspective.
<P>
	Among other things, I saw for myself the nuisance of street 
prostitution and the tragedy of juvenile prostitution for the children 
who are exploited. It served only to deepen the commitment I have 
to doing something about juvenile prostitution.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that Edmonton was one of the cities I 
visited. The Edmonton police was one of the forces that was kind 
enough to take me with them in their work.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member the government is now preparing 
legislation. We expect to introduce proposals later this year to 
amend the Criminal Code to deal particularly with juvenile 
prostitution.
<P>
	The hon. member should also know we have distributed an 
options paper to the provinces with respect to other measures and 
we are awaiting the completion by at least three of those provinces 
of their own internal consultations before taking further steps.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. There are many things 
today that are not unifying Canada but one thing that does unify 
Canadians is our belief in a national health care system.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Now that the 
ministers of health are meeting, as Minister of Finance what 
message did he give to the Minister of Health to take to this 
meeting about the federal government's commitment to stable 
funding by the federal government for our health care?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the budget 
produced last February we stated unequivocally that the principles 
of the Canada Health Act were there to stay. They were conceived 
by a Liberal government, they are part of this country's greatest 
heritage and we will defend them to the hilt.
<P>
	Subsequently the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and 
myself all stated that as part of the negotiations of the CHST we are 
going to ultimately stabilize cash at a level that will enable us to 
protect the health care system for as long as Canada is here.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, today we have some rather special 
guests with us. In keeping with an initiative that I started in the last 
session, on your behalf I am inviting distinguished citizens of our 
nation to be with us. Today we have with us five members who 
were chosen by our national magazine <I>Maclean's</I> to be part of its 
honour roll.
<P>
	If you would, I would like you to hold your applause. I am going 
to introduce the five recipients. We can all be justly proud of them 
and for what they were noted. At the end, if you would join me in 
saluting them on behalf of our Canadian citizens, I would 
appreciate it.
<P>
	I would like you to recognize in the gallery Dr. Adolfo de Bold, 
whose medical research led to the discovery of a substance linked 
to the control of high blood pressure; the Right Hon. Brian 
Dickson, whom many of us have known for many years as Chief 
Justice of Canada from 1984-1990; Colonel Don Ethell, Canada's

ministerial responsibilities.
<P>
	Here is my question: How can the Liberal member for Vaudreuil 
be allowed to question the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs of 
Canada about something that is not within his jurisdiction or that of

How can the minister be allowed to be asked a question, and then

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-94, 
an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese based substances, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Athabasca has approximately eight minutes remaining in his 
intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
was interrupted by question period I attempted to raise substantive 
questions concerning the position taken by the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturers' Association as voiced through the Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	In continuing my presentation, I would like to talk about some of 
the difficulties that will be imposed on Canadians if this bill is to 
proceed and become law.
<P>
	On April 25, the Minister of Industry stated that it was crucial to 
have uniformity of standards in gasoline  formulation in the North 
American market because we exist in one North American market. 
I hope that the minister still agrees with that statement and still 
agrees that it is crucial to have uniformity of standards, particularly 
since the U.S. court of appeals has now ordered that the U.S. EPA 
grant Ethyl Corporation's application for waiver, paving the way 
for the use of MMT in unleaded gasolines in the United States. In 
fact, several refiners in the U.S. have provided written notice of 
their intention to use MMT in gasoline formulation.
<P>
	Uniformity of gasoline additives within North America would 
now require that Canada maintain rather than restrict MMT. 
Certainly it should not mean that it is no longer crucial to maintain 
that uniformity of standards.
<P>
	Also the refining industry has raised a number of objections to 
the initiative, basically that it would increase the cost to refiners 
and it will increase refinery emissions. A 1995 study by T.J. 
McCann and Associates Limited of Calgary concluded that 
removing MMT from Canadian gasolines would add significantly 
to the refinery cost for formulating gasoline and increase the 
severity of the refining process required to achieve cleaner burning 
fuels, leading to increased refinery emissions and higher oil 
consumption.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment made much of need to control 
pollution in this country. The study by Calgary based T.J. McCann 
and Associates and Environ International Limited of California 
showed the likely range of increase in nitrous oxide emissions if 
MMT were banned. The testing utilized Environment Canada's 
own criteria, Mobile 5-C data and Ethyl fleet test data. The study 
concluded that the banning of MMT would increase Canadian 
nitrous oxide emissions from its vehicle fleet by 32,000 to 50,000 
tonnes by the year 2000, an equivalent of adding over one million 
automobiles to Canadian roads.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	Last May, Environ California concluded that Environment 
Canada and the McCann study underestimated the annual increases 
in tonnes of nitrous oxide emissions that would result from the 
removal of MMT. Environ examined the inappropriate use and 
application of the Mobile 5C emission factor by Environment 
Canada and concluded that Canadian nitrous oxide emissions 
increases resulting from the removal of MMT would range 
between 49,000 and 62,000 tonnes.
<P>
	Putting these studies in a non-technical format, removing MMT 
would increase nitrous oxide levels from automobiles by up to 20 
per cent. I cannot believe the Canadian Minister of the 
Environment is pushing legislation that would increase pollution in 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14617"> 14617 </A></B>
<P>
	Almost all provinces in Canada oppose this initiative by the 
environment minister. In the interest of time I will quote Alberta's 
position. Ty Lund, Alberta's minister for environmental 
protection, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is unclear that the removal of MMT from gasoline has net environmental 
benefits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alberta favours the design of a suitable, binding process to resolve the 
dispute in a fair and timely fashion. An open, multi-stakeholder review of the 
environmental and economic merits of MMT should be key to this dispute 
resolution mechanism to credibly solve the vehicle-fuel compatibility issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Further, Alberta is concerned that the actions of the federal government to 
affect the interprovincial trade of MMT appear to contradict the provision 
found in the energy chapter of the draft agreement on international trade. 
Article 1209, section 1 of the draft agreement currently states: ``No party shall 
prohibit or hinder access to its petroleum markets or its petroleum products 
markets''. It is our understanding that the intent of the federal-provincial 
agreement was to remove interprovincial barriers to trade in petroleum 
products.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also have similar objections from Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia 
and New Brunswick.
<P>
	When we examine all the evidence before us and if we examine 
the evidence impartially we cannot help but to at least conclude 
there is some doubt to the argument and position put forward by the 
Canadian Automobile Manufacturers Association.
<P>
	Based on that information it is only reasonable that instead of 
passing this bill the government should ask-in my mind there is 
no doubt-if there still remains a doubt and ask for an independent 
study to determine what the affect of MMT in gasoline is required 
in Canada.
<P>
	The minister says she has seen numerous studies on the issue in 
Canada but those studies come from only from the automobile 
manufacturers association which has refused to release those 
studies or the minister has refused to table those studies in the 
House so that we might all have a look at them in order to decide 
whether they are legitimate studies containing legitimate evidence.
<P>
	I challenge not only the Minister of Industry to reject this bill 
and vote against it, but I challenge Alberta's only representative in 
cabinet, the Minister of Natural Resources, who professes to 
support the industry and Alberta's position, to vote against the bill 
on that basis.
<P>
	I am disappointed that Canada's environment minister has been 
unwilling to listen to both sides in this argument and judge the 
evidence from both sides. She chose instead to simply voice, as a 
political puppet, the concerns of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association and carry it forward on its behalf instead of taking the 
interest of all Canadians into consideration on this issue.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talked about the  minister being a 
political puppet of the auto manufacturers association, which is a 
very serious accusation. Contrary to what he stated in his speech, is 
he aware the minister met with the Canadian Petroleum Producers 
Association directly as representatives of the Ethyl Corporation on 
this very issue twice and that they twice flew in in the corporate jet 
to meet with the minister?
<P>
	Is he also aware the minister has met with the CPPI on at least 
four or five occasions? I do not think the hon. member is fair when 
he says the minister never gave the Ethyl Corporation or its 
representatives any hearing. That is completely false.
<P>
	If this is your information, I suggest you correct it. I do not think 
the minister is the type to be a political puppet of anyone I know.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I grant the floor to 
the hon. member to reply, I simply caution both sides of the House 
and all members to please make all interventions through the Chair 
and not directly across the floor to one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been advised by Ethyl 
Corporation, one of the stakeholders in this issue, the other being 
the Canadian Automobile Manufacturers Association, that the 
Minister of the Environment refused to meet with it. That is the 
information I have to go with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe the member should, because 
he seems to have very close relations with the Ethyl Corporation, 
ask it to correct this misstatement. The minister has assured me 
personally that she met twice with the CPPI on behalf of the Ethyl 
Corporation to discuss this very subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, the real issue here is not who has 
met whom and on whose behalf but whether both sides in this issue 
have had a chance to argue directly with the minister the question at 
hand and whether both sides have had an equal chance to produce 
unbiased independent studies on the issue, which has not been the 
case in Canada.
<P>
	This issue has been studied to death in the United States. The 
conclusion by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been 
that MMT has no detrimental effect on the environment, on health, 
on the onboard computer equipment in cars. That should indicate at 
least some doubt in the minds of the Minister of the Environment 
and the parliamentary secretary to the validity of the automobile 
manufacturers association's evidence, which it have refused to 
provide to the public.
<P>
	The very lease we should do is provide an opportunity in Canada 
for independent study, independent of both stakeholders in this 
issue. We should then make a decision based on that impartial, 
independent evidence. I do not think that is an unreasonable 
request.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
friend from Athabasca initially made what one would consider a 
rather unwise accusation in his speech. He suggested the 
government was succumbing to big powers or big business or the 
shakers and movers in the country and so on.
<P>
	I listened intently when he talked about the wisdom of 
continuing to use this American produced product and I wondered 
where he was getting his information and the kind of thing he was 
reading into the record.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The first of three questions is who is turning his crank? Who is 
cheering him on to stand up and deliver his own set of figures 
especially when a perfectly valid Canadian produced substitute is 
available?
<P>
	No oil refiner would feel threatened in any way to be substituting 
an oxygenate like ETBE or ethanol or whatever for MMT. Some 
refineries are in the forefront of that change right now. He 
suggested refineries have been reporting they would have increased 
emissions. Did all refineries say that? Some refineries are a way 
out in front.
<P>
	He referred to the pollutant nitrous oxide. NOx is the one 
pollutant whose quantity increases without the use of MMT or with 
the inclusion of an oxygenate, but it increases from what? What is 
the base line of the pollutant?
<P>
	If the pollutant increase were 150 per cent it would still be 
incredibly small. How does that tiny increase in nitrous oxide 
emission compare with the decreases in all of the other emissions 
when one takes MMT out?
<P>
	Maybe it is not fair to ask the hon. member to deliver statistics 
but I want to get on the record the fact that NOx, while it is an 
admitted pollutant, is not the big ticket item here. There are other 
things.
<P>
	In terms of the minister's supporting the industry she has 
supported the petroleum industry very well and has been written 
up. Her support has been publicized.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite perhaps sheds 
some light on the mysterious position of the minister and the 
government on this issue.
<P>
	I was under the impression the issue here was one of a problem 
with onboard diagnostic equipment and environmental protection. 
He raises the issue of perhaps finding a way to force the refining 
industry to use a Canadian product rather than an imported 
American product. Perhaps that has something to do with the 
position the government has taken on this issue. Others would find 
interesting under the free trade agreement with the United States 
that it would choose to do that. That was not my understanding as 
part of this issue.
<P>
	Certainly the people who turn my crank on this issue are my 
constituents and the Canadian people who are being sold a con job, 
a fraud job on this whole issue  because the environment minister 
and the government refuse to do independent studies on the issue 
and to gather independent unbiased information. They choose 
rather to accept solely without question all the evidence presented 
by the one stakeholder in the issue.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a couple 
of hours ago the Minister of the Environment indicated in the 
House her meetings with industry and the offers she made to 
industry in the period preceding the introduction of this bill. Was 
the member in the House when the minister spoke a couple of hours 
ago?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly was in the House. I called 
into question her sincerity in offering to meet with all the parties 
involved in this issue. That is not my understanding of what has 
happened. I raised what I think is a valid question. According to my 
information, she consistently refused to meet with-
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> I heard her and I questioned the validity of that 
remark. I think it is a legitimate question and I will continue to 
raise it.
<P>
	She also raised a lot of other issues. I might point to the one 
concerning sparkplug failure. In a very emotional manner she 
raised the issue of Canadians having to change their sparkplugs 17 
times more frequently than Americans. However in an 
independent, valid and verifiable study it was concluded that was 
an absolute fraud. One particular sparkplug failed 17 times more 
often than others simply because of a flaw in the manufacture of 
that sparkplug. It did the same with MMT or without MMT. It had 
no significance.
<P>
	If I am not allowed to raise questions concerning the validity of 
the comments made by the minister, then what am I doing here? I 
believe my question was valid and reasonable and I will continue to 
raise it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my support of Bill C-94 on the abolition of MMT in the 
gasoline we Canadians use every day comes out of a strong 
conviction.
<P>
	For me it is not a question of backing this or that kind of 
production, this or that manufacturer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have no brief for the automobile industry nor have I a brief for 
Ethyl Corporation. That is not my business. I believe very deeply in 
the environment. I have always done so. I am convinced that the 
bill will go a long way to solving a very significant environmental 
problem relating to gasoline in our cars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14619"> 14619 </A></B>
<P>
	For me it is a question of pollution prevention. I have satisfied 
myself, not because I believe in Toyota, General Motors or any 
other company. Frankly I do not care.
<P>
	Unfortunately there are more and more cars on the road. I wish 
we had cars that used ethanol, electricity and hydrogen rather than 
gasoline, but that is a fact of life. As long as there are cars the only 
way to ensure that they perform with the least damage to the 
environment is to ensure, first, that they are equipped with the 
latest technology and that they are inspected and maintained 
properly.
<P>
	That is why all provinces across Canada have an inspection and 
maintenance service which ensures that the drivers of cars, 
especially older cars, go to inspection stations in order to verify 
that their cars are safe and sound for the environment. The idea of 
putting new technology on board the cars is to prevent damage 
before it occurs, to ensure that we have less need for inspection and 
maintenance stations and the cars will tell the drivers when the 
systems have failed.
<P>
	I have satisfied myself that MMT does not help the systems. The 
fact is that the manufacturers in Canada have said that if we 
continue with MMT they cannot and they will not install the latest 
diagnostic systems in these cars. That is not hypothetical, it is a 
fact.
<P>
	If we are conscious of the environment, and if we use a 
precautionary system, we have to make decisions in favour of what 
is the most environmentally and technologically sound decision.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Acting to ban MMT makes us uniform with the United States, 
paradoxically. The speaker before me was pretending that we 
should do exactly the reverse. He was quoting the Ethyl 
Corporation's many appeals to the United States' courts-which it 
eventually won-to force the EPA to permit MMT to be added 
again to gasoline.
<P>
	I will correct the member because the EPA has still not agreed. 
Contrary to what the member stated, in August 1994 Mrs. Carol 
Browner, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, indicated the EPA had concerns about the potential effects 
of manganese emissions on public health, especially in light of the 
broad exposure of Americans to car emissions.
<P>
	A risk assessment on manganese emissions conducted by the 
EPA determined there were important unanswered questions about 
potential public health risks and that studies on health effects and 
exposures are needed.
<P>
	The EPA has said: ``Despite the appeals of Ethyl Corporation we 
want a risk and health assessment to be completed before we will 
okay MMT''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some time ago, our standing committee on the environment and 
sustainable development held  environmental hearings where 
Ralph Ferguson, a former MP and colleague, gave testimony on the 
MMT issue. He raised a number of points relating to health. I know 
that they will tell us that Health Canada has found that MMT 
presents no significant problem for health. This is their decision. 
Still, according to many experts we ought to be very careful. I 
would like to quote from this hearing we had on the environment, 
where Mr. Ferguson spoke of a hearing that the American EPA had 
held on June 22, 1990. Helen Silbergeld of the University of 
Maryland and the Environmental Defence Fund gave the following 
testimony:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Manganese, like lead, is a cumulative toxin in that both its 
absorption and retention as well as its toxicity increase with time''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	She also cited well-known Canadian scientists specializing in 
neurotoxicity, Dr. John Donaldson and Dr. Frank Labella and 
others who have carried out experiments at the University of 
Manitoba on the manganese question. Dr. Donaldson also stated 
the following at that same EPA hearing in Washington:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I believe that manganese is such an age-accelerating toxin and I 
believe it is the answer to manganese's ability to produce 
biochemically, pathologically and clinically the picture that is very 
similar but not identical to Parkinson's disease''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Later on, the health and environment committee of the United 
States House of Representatives also appeared before the EPA. Its 
representative said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Like lead, manganese is not only neurotoxic, it is an element 
and thus does not degrade or lose its potency with the passage of 
time. As a result the manganese released into the environment 
through the use of MMT in a given year accumulates over time 
with all the MMT released in the next year and all subsequent 
years''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The University of Pittsburg, the Western Psychiatric Institute 
and Clinic, said the following in a report to the EPA:
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 15-page appendix to their waiver application, parlant de la 
corporation Ethyl, that deals with health, nowhere mentions the 
newer toxic properties of manganese, nor does it attend to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14620"> 14620 </A></B>
<P>
extraordinary risks to the brain of alkali manganese compounds. 
This document cannot be taken as a credible submission in  support 
of this application. It is incomplete, biased and tendentious.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why Ms. Carol Browner, the administrator of the EPA, 
said as recently as June 1994 that many health questions remained 
unanswered and that additional assessments were needed before 
MMT could be approved.
<P>
	So there are potential problems. I am not saying that it has been 
proven 100 per cent or 50 per cent safe, but if we feel that caution 
must be a guiding principle in health and environmental matters, 
we must be very careful indeed. If we really believe in climatic 
changes and are convinced that cars are the main source of air 
pollution in Canada, it is because it is a fact.
<P>
	According to a recent study by all deputy ministers of the 
environment in Canada, cars are the main source of harmful 
atmospheric emissions. These figures are quite striking. 
Gasoline-and diesel-powered motor vehicles account for 60 per 
cent of carbon monoxide emissions; 35 per cent of nitrous oxide 
emissions, which cause smog; and 25 per cent of hydrocarbon 
emissions. I know we will be told that MMT reduces nitrous oxide 
emissions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As stated by my colleague very recently in a question to the 
Reform Party, what is the basis of that? In fact our studies show in 
the Ministry of the Environment that the way this figure is 
contrived, used in test cars of Ethyl Corporation, in fact results in a 
completely insignificant factor when explained in actual ratio 
relating to all cars in Canada.
<P>
	The gains produced by the use of onboard diagnostic systems in 
new cars are so much greater in proportion that the environmental 
advantages far outweigh any disadvantages by the removal of 
MMT.
<P>
	We have been debating this issue for 10 years, since 1986. 
Contrary to what the member from the Reform Party said a few 
minutes ago, the minister sat not only with both sides, but talked to 
the Ethyl Corporation directly twice on this issue, and as she stated 
very recently in the House, offered Ethyl Corporation this 
compromise: ``I won't put legislation through if you will agree 
with me to produce one type of gasoline blend without MMT to let 
the consumers make their own choice''. Ethyl refused this very fair 
and open compromise because it did not want to let the consumers 
judge.
<P>
	I ask the members here who believe that Bill C-94 is not needed, 
how is it that environmentally sound countries, leaders in the field, 
the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Germany 
and Japan do not use MMT. How come it is only in Canada of all 
the countries in the world that is using MMT? Are we supposed to 
be the smart ones? The irony is that we do  not even produce it 
ourselves. The Americans produce it but do not use it. Then we 
take the American product and use it on our own soil regardless of 
the fact that the rest of the world does not want any of it.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party will suggest that we be uniform with the 
United States, co-ordinate so that MMT is used both in Canada and 
the United States when the EPA has been fighting tooth and nail for 
18 years to ban MMT. The only reason they are now faced with the 
possibility of MMT being reintroduced is court case after court 
case after court case by Ethyl Corporation.
<P>
	Does Ethyl Corporation care about the environment? No it does 
not care about the environment. It cares about its profits, about its 
existence. It cares about the Canadian market because it is the only 
market it has for selling MMT. If it was such a good product the 
Dutch, the French, the Germans, the Finnish and the Japanese 
would buy it to put in their cars but they do not want any of it. Why 
should we be the suckers?
<P>
	Instead of defending Ethyl Corporation and MMT it is time that 
we started to think, as my colleague from London stated so clearly, 
about using our talents, our brains, our tremendous resources to use 
environmentally sound products. There are additives which are 
beckoning us. We could use ethanol in gasoline tomorrow morning 
and it would perform even better than MMT and is completely 
environmentally sound. It is time we started to use ethanol fueled 
cars, electrically driven cars, hydrogen fueled cars. I do not have 
any grief for the Ethyl Corporation which fights for MMT and goes 
back like the dinosaurs into the past. I want to see the future.
<P>
	Bill C-94 points to a change of habit. It forces all Canadians to 
look at a different way of doing things and not to accept the dictates 
of a big corporation that only wants big profits and could not care 
less about the consumer or the environment.
<P>
	I am an environmentalist. All I care about is quality of life and 
potential health dangers if it is slightly possible that there are 
health dangers. I have read these documents and they prove that 
there are significant health dangers. Many universities and many 
doctors of repute have said to beware. They said it about lead many, 
many years ago and we never believed them.
<P>
	As a result of what I have heard and because of the weight of 
evidence I have read, I say let us go with Bill C-94. Let us change 
our habits and make our gasoline cleaner. Let us go to the new 
generation of fuels, the clean fuels, ethanol and the new energy 
patterns of electricity and halogen. Let us live more cleanly. Let us 
put the environment first. The automobile industry and Ethyl 
Corporation can come last. I do not care.
<P>
	To Canadian consumers I say Bill C-94 is one step forward and I 
hope we all vote for it.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members on this side of the House are well aware that, according to 
certain documents, MMT is said to be a dangerous pollutant, while 
other studies say that it has not been conclusively proven to be 
harmful.
<P>
	The member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis made comments 
about Ethyl Corporation which, over the years, has commissioned a 
number of studies on MMT. Consequently, I do not think it is 
appropriate to lash out at a company which, after all, did its 
homework. And if the courts made some decisions in favour of that 
company, it is because Ethyl Corporation did its homework 
properly.
<P>
	As regards MMT, the problem is that the United States could 
re-introduce that product.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I am not saying that they will, but they are considering 
re-introducing it on the American market. Personally, I am just 
concerned that Canadian companies, including our oil companies, 
will have to make major and costly changes in order to stop using 
that product.
<P>
	As you know, we agree with Bill C-94. Nevertheless, I ask 
myself this question, which I put to the hon. member opposite: Is 
this truly the right decision to make? Should we pass this bill that 
quickly, without knowing what the United States will ultimately 
decide?
<P>
	Let us not forget that we live in North America. We could pass 
Bill C-94 only to find out two years down the road that the 
Americans are re-introducing MMT. In the meantime, we would 
have asked our oil companies to change everything so as to comply 
with this legislation. I am not convinced that MMT is harmful to 
our health. I have read studies. Ethyl Canada provided us with its 
studies and we also had discussions with the EPA.
<P>
	We were told that it remains to be seen whether that product is 
truly harmful. Sure, we have to promote progress, environmental 
protection and sustainable development. We fully agree with that. 
However, we should wait for the decision of the Americans, 
because it is vital for us regarding this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the points made by the hon. 
member for Laurentides were very constructive and they are well 
taken. I agree these are important matters that must be dealt with.
<P>
	After a lot of soul searching, we finally decided that Bill C-94 
was the answer. There was a decisive factor. The United States is of 
course looking into the MMT issue, following a number of appeals 
filed by Ethyl Corporation. However, the EPA is dragging its feet. 
Until June 1994, the EPA administrator was fighting very hard, but 
in fact they keep asking for studies and health impact assessments.
<P>
	The United States might reintroduce MMT and it would then 
become legal. It is quite possible, but meanwhile, it is up to us as 
Canadians to take the kind of action that may also influence our 
neighbours to the south.
<P>
	Today, we are part of NAFTA. NAFTA includes Mexico, and I 
think that we have to make decisions on the basis of their intrinsic 
value. We think that today, Canada could add ethanol to gas. My 
colleague has done an extraordinary study of ethanol. Today, we 
have an ethanol industry in eastern Canada. We have one in western 
Canada. The United States, because of the legislation, is now 
getting involved in massive production of ethanol. I believe that 
they want 10 per cent of the oil industry to be ethanol-based by the 
year 2000.
<P>
	It seems to me we should start making an effort to seek additives 
that are more environmentally sound. I realize there are arguments 
for and against MMT.
<P>
	I think the weight of the evidence would support a new process: 
gas without MMT. What strikes me particularly is that none of the 
countries that enjoy an outstanding reputation for the quality of 
their environment-the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and the 
Scandinavian countries-none of them uses MMT.
<P>
	If tomorrow morning one of these countries were to opt for 
MMT, I would think again. If the United States had opted for MMT 
because it was environmentally safe, I would reconsider. However, 
the EPA does not accept it because it wants to but because it was a 
legal decision. I think we should go ahead with C-94.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me 
that this issue is not terribly unlike the issue of the ethics 
counsellor. We need to have some distance between the person who 
is making a judgment and the people who are directly involved.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	It looks to me that what we have here are two studies that were 
made and are being distributed by the principals of the dispute. I 
personally feel that we have a very strong reason to doubt the 
validity of the evidence.
<P>
	I would like to become very personal here. I do most of my own 
mechanical work. I always have in order to save a buck or two. On 
Saturdays I change my own sparkplugs.
<P>
	Not long ago, I turned out the plugs on my car in order to replace 
them because they had 75,000 kilometres on them and I had never 
touched them. It stood to reason that by then I should be changing 
them. I turned them out. They were almost as good as new. I 
cleaned them up, regapped them and put them back in and finally 
replaced them at 100,000 kilometres.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14622"> 14622 </A></B>
<P>
	The studies we are asked to believe say that these plugs will fail 
17 times as often using MMT. I am in an  environment where as far 
as I know there is MMT in our fuel. If that is really a cause of 
sparkplug failure then either I was the recipient of a miracle or the 
studies are not to be depended on.
<P>
	I have a tendency to think that it is the studies that are not 
reliable because I have many acquaintances and I talk to many 
people and not a single person has complained to me of premature 
sparkplug failure. That is a sample of I do not know how many 
thousands of people. I am sure that if that were happening, I would 
have heard about it as the representative from Elk Island.
<P>
	If we cannot trust this study in the area of sparkplugs, why 
should we then trust the same study when it tells us that it is very 
harmful to the environment and has all these other dangers? It may 
or it may not.
<P>
	I personally do not believe that these are to be trusted. That is 
why we need to call for a truly independent agency that is reliable 
and trustworthy to evaluate the merits or demerits of the use of 
MMT. Let us have the truth instead of a bunch of wildly stated 
causes and effects that may or may not rest in truth.
<P>
	I would like the member who just spoke to respond to this. I 
would like to ask him also why there is a reluctance on the part of 
the government to submit this to a truly independent study.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have always considered that in 
these questions the government is there to make decisions after it 
evaluates both sides of a story.
<P>
	The feeling is that only the automobile industry's case has been 
studied but that is not correct. I have letters from the deputy 
minister. There are evaluations made by the Minister of the 
Environment completely, impartially and objectively, including the 
minister's commitment to the Ethyl Corporation to suggest to Ethyl 
not to go with legislation, that the minister would prefer to have a 
compromise on this issue between the two industrial groups 
concerned and suggesting and offering to Ethyl to produce one type 
of gasoline without MMT to let the consumers judge and compare.
<P>
	That is fair. It is objective. It is impartial. It is a fact. I know the 
minister made this offer. I know that this offer was turned down 
because Ethyl Corporation today has a solid market with MMT that 
it does not want to give up. It is a monopoly.
<P>
	If Canada turns down MMT, there would be no MMT sold 
anywhere around the world. That is a fact. As I said before, if it is 
so good for cars why is MMT not used in the fuels in all the 
countries that are just as sophisticated as we are? I find that very 
strange. I am convinced that the step we are taking today is a step 
forward for the environment.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While we do not have a great 
deal of time left, I know the hon. member for Mackenzie has been 
seeking the floor. I ask if possible the question to be as brief as 
possible, and the reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the last 
number of years I have been involved along with the former 
member from London, Ralph Ferguson, in pushing the issue of 
better acceptance and more use of ethanol, one of the alternate 
octane enhancers to MMT.
<P>
	I believe we were very close to passing, if we did not pass in the 
House in the last Parliament, a private member's motion to accept 
ethanol as a replacement for MMT. There was a lot of support at 
that time for replacement of MMT for many of the reasons the 
parliamentary secretary has outlined for us today.
<P>
	At that time we were not made aware of the EPA's requirement to 
review the whole question of MMT because of the court ruling. 
However, one of the things we were trying to use at that time from 
the farm production point of view was the fact that ethanol was a 
very good replacement. It was renewable and at that point there 
was a surplus of grains, the source of ethanol, and they were very 
cheap.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us what the economics of ethanol 
production has become? I know I have one of the larger ethanol 
production units in my riding. It is concerned about the sudden 
increase in the cost of inputs. Grain prices have more than doubled 
since the time that Ralph Ferguson introduced his bill.
<P>
	Will this change make a sizeable change to the cost of gasoline 
because the ethanol may cost more than the MMT and what will the 
economic costs of such a change be? Has the Department of the 
Environment looked at the new costs of ethanol given that the raw 
material going into ethanol production, namely grains, has 
virtually doubled or more over the last three or four years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not have these figures with me at 
present. I know the ministry and others, including several MPs 
here, have made extensive studies on ethanol and the cost of 
ethanol as an additive. I will commit myself to make these figures 
whatever we have available to the hon. member as soon as possible.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Milliken: </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that you will obtain the 
unanimous consent of the House to revert to the presentation of 
committee reports.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-94 to ban the 
importation and interprovincial trade of MMT.
<P>
	The bill is fascinating but for the duplicity inherent in the 
process of how the bill came about. MMT is 
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, an additive to 
unleaded gasoline, an octane enhancer. It reduces nitrous oxide 
emissions and makes gas burn a lot cleaner.
<P>
	Nitrous oxides when released are the primary cause of smog 
which causes respiratory problems in a great number of people 
within our country, in particular those suffering from asthma and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
<P>
	The minister tried to ban MMT but found she could not do it. 
MMT has proven not to be a hazard to people's health. She tried to 
find some other way of getting MMT out of Canada by putting 
forth this bill to ban the trade of MMT which in effect is a ban on 
MMT in this country.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	It has been demonstrated through Health Canada which has 
looked at MMT that this was a perfectly benign substance for the 
people in the country. Therefore there is no scientific ground to ban 
MMT.
<P>
	Let us take a look at why is the minister doing this. Before the 
minister put the bill forward MMT was made the Ethyl 
Corporation. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association 
claimed MMT has been destroying its on board diagnostic 
computers which no doubt are very important to keeping cars 
burning cleaner so we can all have a healthier environment. No one 
would dispute having OBDs.
<P>
	However we dispute having one view from the manufacturers of 
automobiles saying MMT destroys its OBDs and one view from the 
Ethyl Corporation which says it does not. The Ethyl Corporation 
supports this view through studies done by an independent 
environmental protection association. It has proven conclusively, 
contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister said, that MMT does 
not affect on board diagnostic computers. In spite of this the 
minister has proceeded with this ban.
<P>
	We can see this is clearly not an environmental bill. Health 
Canada has even shown MMT has not been deleterious to the 
health of Canadians. However, it has been proven-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I hesitate to 
interrupt the hon. member but I think there is now unanimous 
consent that I put these motions which are somewhat urgent 
because I understand there are committees waiting for and 
depending on these.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-94, 
an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese based substances be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is clearly not an environmental bill. MMT has proven 
not to be deleterious to the health of Canadians. I quote from the 
Deputy Prime Minister's own press statement demonstrating our 
commitment to protecting the environment. It had nothing to do 
with that but everything to do with protecting the auto 
manufacturers' industry.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Before the bill came about both the Ethyl Corporation and the 
vehicle manufacturers' association were under negotiation to solve 
this problem outside of the House. They were close to making a 
decision. Then the minister came forward with this bill and the auto 
manufacturers, knowing they would get a response in their favour, 
understandably backed away. Sure enough this bill rather than 
solving a problem is muddying the waters. That is unfortunate. We 
would not be wasting House time with the bill if we had let nature 
take its course.
<P>
	We have requested an independent third party to review MMT to 
determine if it damages onboard devices. If it does we have two 
options. We need to look for an alternative to MMT or we need to 
change the onboard devices and work out some agreement with the 
private sector.
<P>
	The minister noted that MMT has been banned all over the world 
and Canada is the only country still using it. I bring to the attention 
of the minister that last year the U.S. district court of appeals said 
MMT could again be used in the United States. Therefore while we 
are pursuing a course to ban MMT the United States will now allow 
its use. Why are we engaging in this behaviour?
<P>
	The Minister of Industry wants one unified gasoline for the 
entire continent. Why are we pursuing a course which would take 
us into a different type of gasoline when the United States is trying 
to bring back gasoline which contains MMT?
<P>
	This is telling us there has been an abuse of power. We have seen 
legislative shenanigans and the government is favouring one group, 
the automobile association. That is reprehensible.
<P>
	I hope the Deputy Prime Minister will take the mature course 
and ask for an independent study, as my friend from Elk Island has 
requested. That study would give us the answers we require and it 
would serve the people of Canada and the environment well. It is 
fundamental for us to get these answers not only for the citizens of 
Canada but for the environment.
<P>
	If we remove MMT the minister must lay out another plan. She 
must be aware that nitrous oxide content would actually increase in 
the emissions from cars by up to 20 per cent or more, which would 
greatly increase health hazards to Canadians. Having seen many 
people with pulmonary diseases, that is grossly unfair.
<P>
	She also spoke about having two types of gasoline in Canada. 
Quite frankly that is a fantasy. Why do we not have one gasoline, 
the best and the cleanest, which we could responsibly and cost 
effectively use, that would be fair to both sides, the auto 
manufacturers and the petroleum corporations?
<P>
	I ask that we act together on this issue. It is not an issue of one 
side against the other. It is an issue for all Canadians and for the 
country.
<P>
	I also strongly suggest that in the area of transport there is much 
which can be done by new technology. Fascinating advances have 
been made in making cars and other vehicles burn cleaner and 
safer. Much of these technologies have not been brought forward in 
an aggressive fashion. I believe we can take a leadership role in 
promoting these very substantial discoveries and bring them to the 
forefront. It is the responsibility of the House to bring them 
forward in order for them to become a practical reality for all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca for his comments.
<P>
	I would like to get his opinion on a couple of suggestions we 
have put forward. What does he feel would be served by having a 
completely independent study done by an independent agency, for 
example something from the National Research Council, to study 
independent of the automakers or the Ethyl Corporation whether 
this MMT stuff actually does any harm? Is there a need for that? Is 
there a need to have a completely independent study? If so, is the 
National Research Council perhaps the group that could perform 
that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
apologies for getting up prematurely. It was such a good question 
from my friend that I could not resist it.
<P>
	To echo basically what my colleague, the hon. member for Elk 
Island, just said, the reason we are asking for an independent study 
is that the Deputy Prime Minister brought forth a slew of papers, all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14625"> 14625 </A></B>
<P>
of which were from members of the Automobile Manufacturers 
Association.  They are very interested party in this debate, but in 
fact they are one side of this debate.
<P>
	What we can do is determine whether or not the studies that have 
been put forth are in fact legitimate, sound, scientifically based 
studies. If they are, then we should believe them. If they are not, if 
there is any question whatsoever, then we definitely need to have 
an independent third party to do the study. We cannot have a 
member or a group as intimately associated with the question at 
hand-in fact a combatant in this debate-to decide what is true 
and what is not. That is why we in this party are asking for an 
independent review, an independent group to do this. Perhaps the 
National Research Council or some other group could do this. The 
important point to remember is that it must be an independent party 
that is not intimately associated with either the Ethyl Corporation 
or the automobile manufacturers association.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
ask this question because I do not hear the question coming from 
the opposite benches and I think it is an important issue.
<P>
	After we have heard all of the discussion about using ethanol as a 
substitute for MMT, given that the two products are equally 
effective and setting aside the argument of whether one is better for 
the environment or not, I would ask my colleague to tell the House 
why this government would not choose to ban MMT in favour of 
ethanol in gasoline as an octane enhancer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. friend for the interesting question on ethanol.
<P>
	Ethanol is a very important additive, but it unfortunately 
requires a government subsidy in the order of eight cents per litre in 
order to get to market. That would be an enormous cost to the 
government, and during these times of fiscal restraint we would not 
advocate in any way, shape, or form that the government put more 
money into this and spend more money. It would cost billions of 
dollars to do this.
<P>
	This party has been very emphatic about prompting and 
encouraging scientists and researchers in the country to come up 
with a more cost effective way of making ethanol and other fuel 
additives so we can have automobiles burn fuel more cleanly.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	We have always been strong advocates for the research and 
development sector in the country because it is one of the pillars 
that will enable our country to be highly competitive in the future 
to create economic niches for longlasting, high paying jobs.
<P>
	I encourage the government to continue to support the research 
and development sector, which does some fantastic things in the 
country. We must not lose sight of  the fact that it is a pillar that will 
enable us to be economically competitive in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
always intrigued by how hard things die. Here we have a situation 
where a product has been on the market and it was discovered 
nearly 20 years ago that there were problems with it. It was 
discovered about 10 years ago in Canada by the Ministry of the 
Environment that there were some problems with it. Now there is 
an alternative.
<P>
	I do not blame the vested interests that keep promoting these 
things, but the fact is that it has taken a long time for reality to set 
in and for life to take its course, as it should.
<P>
	I would like to go back a little in terms of the history of fuel 
additives. In about 1928 it was discovered that tetra-ethyl lead 
added to gasoline would enhance the octane and provide some 
upper cylinder lubrication to engines. It was called the anti-knock 
compound and was produced by the Ethyl Corporation. At the same 
time another body of equally distinguished scientists and chemists 
promoted the idea of ethanol in gasolines. As a matter of fact, 
Henry Ford had been a strong advocate of ethanol. His first Model 
T ran on pure ethanol.
<P>
	The debate raged through the 1930s and finally lead won out 
over ethanol. It is an interesting story. According to the information 
I have, the Du Pont Corporation owned and controlled the Ethyl 
Corporation of America and it also held 24 per cent of General 
Motors' stock. Consequently, General Motors became a promoter 
of lead. In 1929 Ford stopped putting extra jets on carburettors so 
that ethanol could be burned. That is not the only story like that in 
history.
<P>
	When I was a young person spraying the apple trees at our home 
farm, I used arsenical to kill grubs and worms. It was discovered 
during my early teenage years that arsenic really was a heavy metal 
and it was not very nice to spray on trees and on the ground. 
Finally, by the time I got to agricultural college a solution had been 
found to the problem-mercurial. Mercurials were going to be the 
be-all and end-all. It was not for many years, too many for me to 
admit to, that industry realized that products used in these areas 
have to be biodegradable, able to return to the soil from whence 
they originate. The same realization is slowly coming with our fuel 
additives.
<P>
	So we went to lead. It was discovered that lead really was not 
what we wanted to be spewing around into the environment in ever 
increasing quantities. When government decided to take lead out, a 
substitute was found, which was going to be the miracle 
replacement for lead. It was another heavy metal, methyl 
manganese. There are a lot of $10 words following that one that I 
am not prepared to repeat.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14626"> 14626 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	For almost a generation we have realized that there are some 
difficulties. The people who support one side of  the case and the 
other side of the case make their stories, but we know now that 
there is a better substitute. There is a substitute.
<P>
	My friend from Athabasca felt that one of the motivations of the 
government was because the product ethanol could be 
manufactured in Canada. That has not been a motivation of the 
government. It is one of my motivations, because I believe that a 
Canadian ethanol industry has potential to be one of the great 
things for Canadian agriculture.
<P>
	Since the government did its little arrangement about a year ago, 
about $300 million has been committed in Ontario alone for 
ethanol development. If ethanol were to replace MMT at the rate of 
10 per cent in Canada, it would take approximately 10 investments 
of the size that are taking place in Ontario right now in order to fill 
that need. One can see that there is great potential.
<P>
	The cost of ethanol has been raised, and it is a very legitimate 
argument. What about the cost? The cost of grain is increasing at 
the present time, and of course grain is a cyclical thing.
<P>
	The answer to that is twofold. One is that the cost of grain is not 
the only factor in determining the cost of ethanol production. There 
are by-products. If we are making ethanol from wheat, gluten and 
some of these other things are important products and they are 
important in the economics of the ethanol industry. If we are 
making it from corn, corn oil, distillers grains, distillers solubles 
and so on, they are also very important by-products and they are 
quite meaningful when we are calculating the cost.
<P>
	The other part of the cost equation is not just eight cents, which 
was the excise tax on ethanol. The cost of any fuel is not just the 
direct cost. The cost of a shovelful of coal is not whether you are 
going to pay 30 cents or a dollar for that shovelful of coal. It has to 
be looked upon as the whole cost. What is the cost of the impact on 
the environment? There is a dollar attachment to those things now. 
Things can be costed. I think I once saw the word monetized. When 
you have emissions into the environment, they carry with them a 
real cost, a real impact cost.
<P>
	When we talk about substituting ethanol in gasoline for MMT, 
the actual cost of the ethanol itself is not the true cost. The injection 
of MMT and the cost of MMT is not the true cost. The whole 
costing is what is really important here.
<P>
	If we have a product like ethanol that is going to result in certain 
reductions in emissions, which are positive, I think of carbon 
monoxide and I think of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon 
monoxide is touted to be reduced by about 20 per cent or 25 per 
cent and carbon dioxide by approximately 15 per cent.
<P>
	Then we get to the cost of nitrous oxide, which tends to offset 
that to a certain extent. But I beg you to look at  the figures when 
you are looking at the emissions, because nitrous oxide is the 
smallest of all the emissions. It is very tiny. If you were to increase 
the nitrous oxide emissions by 150 per cent, you are still looking at 
150 per cent of zip. However, it is the only emission that increases 
in this whole scenario.
<P>
	A comment was made about looking for one type of gasoline. I 
am not sure how that is evaluated. There are about four types of 
gasoline on the market right now. Most of them are based on 
octane. One of them is based on whether or not there is an ethanol 
additive which is presently increasing in interest and usage. About 
two years ago there were 50 outlets selling gasoline containing an 
ethanol additive. Right now there are 500 and the prognosis is that 
there will be 5,000 within the next two years.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The oil companies should not be the least bit concerned about 
enhancing their product with ethanol versus MMT. The kind of raw 
product they produce is a little different. The vapour pressure of the 
two is different but that is really where it ends. In terms of a public 
relations gesture they should be able able to say that they are 
striving for a cleaner product. Here it is a cleaner product when 
they used ethanol instead of MMT.
<P>
	As I say, I do not blame the Ethyl Corporation for wanting to 
protect its turf. One of the things I would say to a company like the 
Ethyl Corporation is that there is a time when one has to put the 
past by and move on into the future. If I were that corporation right 
now I would be looking very hard at producing ethanol, ETBE or 
whatever in order to get on into a more modern mode.
<P>
	We cannot spend our whole lives trying to hang onto the past 
forever and ever. The fact is too that some refineries have already 
made the switch to ethanol. I do not know whether my friend from 
Athabasca buys gasoline at Mohawk outlets, but the Mohawk 
adopted this some time ago and promoted it in Ontario.
<P>
	Sunoco is refining ethanol gasoline and does it because it 
considers it to be good business. In Canada it should be considered 
good business.
<P>
	We are starting to use grain to produce ethanol and it is helping 
agriculture. That will become a base line now. As science and 
technology and research and development continue in the 
production process the next natural move is into cellulosic waste, 
sawdust, wood waste and so on. That technology is known now. It 
is being done commercially in France but it is not competitive yet. 
When it is competitive in Canada, it will be more competitive 
probably than ethanol from grain. That is only a few years down the 
road.
<P>
	What we are dealing with here is simply the conflict between 
moving on to something that is better and finally putting past us 
something we have been hanging onto for nearly two decades. 
According to what I know we are  the only country left in the world 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14627"> 14627 </A></B>
<P>
that is using MMT. Even tiny Bulgaria considered using MMT and 
turned it down for whatever reason. We have every reason to get on 
with the modern age and let things move.
<P>
	The automobile industry is supporting it for its own reasons. 
Whether or not those studies are correct it is amazing that all the 
studies the automobile companies did were independent unto 
themselves and they all came to the same conclusion. That is very 
interesting in terms of emission controls or the monitoring that 
reads the emissions and indicates whether or not the emission 
control system is working properly. Canadian citizens deserve to 
have on their cars the most modern emission control systems as can 
be manufactured and researched. I do not think we want to accept 
second best in order to continue on the importation of this 
manganese product in our gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	My humble submission is yes we should get on with the job, 
allow the past to go by and get on with the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was an 
interesting presentation.
<P>
	I would certainly agree with the member's presentation if it was 
a level playing field. If independent studies could show me reliably 
that MMT is harmful to the environment and ethanol could be 
produced in competition with MMT without government 
subsidization and the industry could stand on its own, then I would 
accept his argument as realistic. In that case we certainly should go 
ahead, but exactly the opposite is true.
<P>
	The fact is that the ethanol industry is not a viable industry in 
today's technology. Some day it may be and good for it if it is. 
Certainly the other side of the argument is that MMT has not been 
proven to be harmful to the environment. The endless studies done 
by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States have 
stated that it is not harmful to the environment. In Canada the 
Minister of Health states that it is not harmful to the health of 
Canadians. In fact, by banning it we raise the levels of nitrous 
oxide. By banning it through the extra refining processes that must 
be done to obtain an equal octane rating in gasoline the refineries 
have to substantially raise the emissions of CO2 and benzene.
<P>
	The argument that it is a product of the past and we have to move 
on because it is so harmful to the environment and we should spend 
tax dollars to subsidize the ethanol industry is a false one. I ask the 
member to respond to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the member's colleagues brought 
up the question of waiting until the United States made its final 
decision and so on regarding the future of MMT. I should just point 
out to him that in  the United States the tax relief on ethanol 
gasoline has doubled what it is in Canada. They gave it a leg up.
<P>
	I should also point out to him that in the United States 39 cities 
mandate the use of gasolines containing ethanol for environmental 
reasons. This is because of what is called ground level ozone.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. Deputy Prime Minister, talked about 
ground level ozone. Some people believe it is not a problem in 
Canada and that it really does not exist. If we divide the ozone 
emissions into the square footage of Canada it is not a problem. It 
does not exist. However, if we take the area of metropolitan 
Toronto, the Ottawa valley, Montreal, Vancouver or southwestern 
Ontario it is a serious problem. It was a problem this last summer 
with ozone warnings that stayed with us for a number of weeks. 
The previous year I believe it stayed on for two weeks.
<P>
	There are real reasons that we might want to give an industry a 
leg up. In this case it is not subsidy but excise removal. We can 
worry about the semantics of it but the fact is that the most 
industrialized country in the world has seen fit to promote ethanol 
this year. In 1995, 45 new ethanol plants are being built in the 
United States. There is only one reason for that. They want ethanol 
as an additive. In the United States right now 8 per cent of all 
gasoline has an ethanol additive. That is pretty substantial when we 
consider that the whole thing began very few years ago.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They will be bringing back MMT.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> We do not know whether or not the U.S. is going to 
bring back MMT but the fact is that ethanol is a superior product 
notwithstanding the fact that it will be manufactured in Canada in 
quantity. I do not think Canadian farmers would dismiss that out of 
hand and say that it will not help them if MMT remains. They want 
ethanol gasoline. In southwestern Ontario farmers are clamouring 
for ethanol gasoline from dealers who do not normally handle them 
at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member says, there is nothing wrong with giving an industry a 
leg up. That strikes at the heart of the bill. This bill has nothing to 
do with the environment; it is really an industry issue.
<P>
	If the government wants to ban MMT just because it wants to 
ban it, then why does it not say so? If the object is to do that, then 
go ahead and do it. What annoys many of us is that this is being 
done under the pretence of an environmental clean up. That is the 
excuse which has been given. All that we can do is ban the 
cross-border traffic of MMT because there is no health reason to 
ban it. I wish the government would be honest and say that it 
decided to do it because it wants to do it. At least that would be 
honest if not prudent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14628"> 14628 </A></B>
<P>
	As an example, why is it that Ford and GM in their 1996 models 
make no mention at all about MMT or the effect it has on the 
onboard computers?
<P>
	This has nothing to do with the environment. This has to do with 
a decision of the government to ban it for reasons known mostly to 
the Deputy Prime Minister. It is not a health issue. It is not an 
arsenic issue, the example which was used earlier. This is a 
decision of the government to do it for reasons other than the 
environment. It is really an industry issue. If the government wants 
to promote ethanol, as the hon. member mentioned, then the 
Minister of Industry could do that. I do not know why the Minister 
of the Environment is picking on this issue when it is not an 
environmental or health issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, the argument that it is an economic or an 
industry issue is mine. It is one I have put to the House. I have put it 
to the House proudly because I believe that a crossover into ethanol 
will be a leg up for agriculture and the economy of the country.
<P>
	The decision of the Minister of the Environment was based first 
on evidence of what was happening in the United States. Why 
would the EPA mandate gasoline containing ethanol in 39 cities? 
There is quite a wealth of evidence coming down to demonstrate 
that in the United States at least it was believed there was a 
problem. This country was faced with this conundrum long before 
the current government took office.
<P>
	There is some counter evidence, which might or might not prove 
valid, but where do we stop the study process? Everything could 
stand more study. I do believe that a great deal of independent 
study has been done, so I do not know what independent study 
would be acceptable to my hon. friend.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> But you will not do one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> No, and you know why.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I was made aware 
earlier by the hon. member for Halton-Peel that he is some 
distance from the Chair, but I am at the same equal distance and I 
would not want to be forgotten. I would urge all members to direct 
their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> My apologies, Mr. Speaker. There is a terrible 
temptation to get carried away at this end of the House. I am going 
to have to get stronger glasses to see you.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I hope I have answered the question as well as I can. The 
evidence was that this was a legitimate cause for concern. It has 
been aided by the automobile companies, that admittedly will not 
reveal their sources because of commercial confidentiality. 
Apparently the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister was 
leaked. However, it gave us the opportunity to say: Here is the 
evidence as we  know it and in the name of cleaner air we should 
act on it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we resume debate I 
would like to make the House aware that five hours have lapsed 
from the beginning of second reading. We will now go to the next 
stage of debate in which there will be straight 10-minute 
interventions without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure my colleagues will be very sad to know that I only have 10 
minutes, but I will try to confine my remarks to that period of time.
<P>
	I know that many Canadians watch the debates in the House of 
Commons, odd as it may seem, and I would like to remind them 
that we are now debating Bill C-94. The name of the bill is an act to 
regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based products. That 
might not seem like a very gripping title. It sounds quite innocuous, 
quite routine and regulatory. However, the bill raises issues of 
which Canadians ought to be made aware and we on this side of the 
House are doing our best to raise those issues and to bring them out 
in the public debate.
<P>
	The manganese product in question, which is the subject 
substance of the bill, is called MMT. MMT is short for some long 
scientific name which probably none of us can pronounce or would 
want to. It is really an octane enhancer for unleaded gasoline. We 
all know that most of our vehicles use unleaded gasoline. We want 
to get the maximum mileage because it saves us a few nickels here 
and there. Therefore all Canadians should be quite interested in 
anything which enhances the octane of gasoline and MMT does 
that.
<P>
	However, the Minister of the Environment now wants to prevent 
this product from being imported into Canada and does not want it 
to be traded as a common product across interprovincial borders. It 
is very interesting the way this dreaded product is being handled. It 
raises the question: Is this sudden concern on the part of the 
environment minister about MMT, this octane enhancer, because 
MMT is unsafe or dangerous? If it is, we certainly want to know. 
We do not want it floating around in the air and soaking into our 
fingers when we gas up our cars.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that MMT is not dangerous. The 
minister is not going to ban the product outright. It is not even 
going to be labelled as unsafe. One wonders why the environment 
minister, since the product is not going to be banned as unsafe or 
labelled as unsafe, is mixing into this. It is very strange.
<P>
	Surely if the product has been determined to be unsafe or if it 
causes injury, then it should not be readily available to the public. 
If that is the case, then why is the product not being banned?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14629"> 14629 </A></B>
<P>
	Under this bill, MMT can still be manufactured in Canada. In 
fact, a manufacturer could potentially set up a plant to produce 
MMT in every province of the country and not be breaking the 
law, since Bill C-94 merely prohibits the interprovincial trade or 
the importation of the substance.
<P>
	The obvious question to be asked is: Why this bill at all? My 
hon. friend opposite just spent a great deal of time talking about 
ethane. Maybe the conclusion we should draw is that MMT is being 
banned so that somehow ethane producers can have a bit of an 
advantage and not so much competition from MMT. I do not know. 
We are not being given any answers to those speculations. 
However, the question is really puzzling because the substance has 
not proven to cause any harm to Canadians at all.
<P>
	We have an environment minister who certainly should be 
concerned about environmental pollutants, environmental 
hazardous substances, and yet there is no hazard here. Nothing has 
been shown to cause any harm to us. This has been demonstrated 
not just by American studies, which I suppose we could dismiss, 
but a 1994 study by Health Canada found that MMT is not harmful 
to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	What is really happening here? We suggest that the Minister of 
the Environment has dragged the government into a dispute 
between manufacturers of MMT and the automobile manufacturers 
in the United States. These manufacturers have plants and provide 
jobs in Canada. Some of those jobs are fairly close to Ottawa.
<P>
	As we have heard, there are some suggestions that MMT in 
unleaded gasoline causes the onboard diagnostic systems in our 
modern computer chip driven cars to malfunction. Automobile 
manufacturers, therefore, want MMT banned. They are not being 
very specific about the data on which they base these allegations. In 
fact, they are holding it quite close to the vest. Some has been 
leaked. Therefore, because of a few allegations and suggestions 
and some leaked data we are now rising to the occasion and making 
sure that our onboard diagnostic systems are protected. I would 
suggest that is not really a function of a highly paid environment 
minister.
<P>
	The evidence is sketchy. It is inconclusive. The manufacturers of 
MMT have produced evidence that shows that their product is not 
harmful and does not cause the problems in question. Not only does 
it not harm the environment, does not harm Canadians, it does not 
even harm our cars, our onboard diagnostic systems.
<P>
	However that evidence is not good enough. The car 
manufacturers are saying: ``We have a big problem''. The two 
parties talked and one side said: ``You are causing a problem'' and 
the other side is saying: ``No, this product does not cause a 
problem. We will have  scientific studies done by experts that we 
both respect, who have credentials that we can both accept and we 
will get to the bottom of this''.
<P>
	In spite of that very sensible suggestion, before it could be 
carried out, before the independent expert advice could be sought, 
the minister jumps in and says: ``I am going to come down on the 
side of the automobile manufacturers and I am going to decide that 
MMT should be banned'', for reasons which do not seem to be very 
specific and certainly are not very persuasive. We object to this.
<P>
	We agree with the submissions that have been made from the 
other side that Canadians are tired of problems being studied to 
death. However let us look at the situation. Has this been studied to 
death? We have had very sketchy and unspecified evidence on the 
part of the automobile manufacturers. We have heard allegations 
from the industry people who are producing MMT. We have no 
independent reports except Health Canada saying that there is no 
danger or harm from the substance. That is not studying the subject 
to death. This bill has been put in place willy-nilly without proper 
thought or evidence, without any proper reason. We object to that. 
We do not think that is how a government should run things. We do 
not think that is how decisions should be made and we certainly do 
not think this is an area in which the environment minister should 
be involved.
<P>
	In fact, a ruling in the United States in June concluded that the 
tests on the impact of MMT that had been done were inconclusive. 
Presumably the Americans do have some experts worth listening 
to. Therefore, the ruling was that the substance ought not to be 
banned. Others have alluded to the fact that this will very likely 
result in having MMT again approved for use in unleaded gasoline 
in the United States as an octane enhancer.
<P>
	The end result of all this is that the Minister of the Environment 
is taking unwarranted action on an issue that should have been, 
would have been and could have been settled by the concerned 
parties themselves.
<P>
	There is a lot of concern about the impact of this legislation. 
There is a lot riding on the bill in both of these sectors, the 
manufacturers of both the vehicles and MMT.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	The provinces have also demonstrated that they have a real 
concern about this. Ontario, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova 
Scotia have all expressed concerns that any replacement of MMT 
might actually impair the air quality in our communities.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to propose a motion. I move:

thereof referred to the Standing Committee on Industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to speak to the amendment of the member for Calgary 
North.
<P>
	One of the things about this House that concerns me is how many 
of us become experts in certain fields in which we do not know 
anything.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have said that they want to cut 
taxes, they want to cut the deficit and this kind of stuff. Here they 
are asking us to go to the National Research Council, hire a group 
of scientists to work for the Ethyl Corporation and do all the work 
that corporation is supposed to do. We have all these automotive 
manufacturers, BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo, Saab, Lada, Jaguar, 
Land Rover, Mercedes Benz. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	I will speak about how a car actually functions. We are talking 
about an octane enhancer. The octane rating is a unit of 
measurement established by the automotive industry to determine 
the action of variable fuels. In the laboratory is an engine with a 
variable compression ratio and various substances, gasoline, 
stoichiometric and some of these additives are added. At the point 
where it knocks-at 100 per cent it does not knock-the enhancers 
put into the gasoline are reduced.
<P>
	Why do they do this? They want the combustion process to be 
predictable. Mr. Speaker, if you have ever driven a car and turned 
the ignition off and the engine still was running this is called 
after-runner or dieseling. What you have got is the gasoline 
reaching so high a compression ratio that it explodes by itself. We 
do not want that happening in our cars. We want to trigger it when 
we turn the ignition on, getting a spark from the sparkplug. When 
we turn the ignition switch off we want the spark to stop and the 
engine to shut off.
<P>
	What happens in a modern car with all this onboard diagnostic 
equipment? Starting with a PCV valve, exhaust gas recirculation, 
the use of a catalytic converter, a sophisticated combustion 
chamber design and raising the temperature of the engine by using 
higher thermostats is a sophisticated modern engine where we are 
trying get a stoichiometric mixture of 14 pounds of air to 1 pound 
of gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	We want that condition all the time. We want a good spray in the 
combustion chamber. We want a certain amount of turbulence and 
we want the predictability so that when that gasoline explodes at a 
certain point in the cycle, when the piston is travelling down a 
particular angle, the maximum pressure is built up.
<P>
	This is done by antiknock. For instance, if one went to a modern 
car, took a hammer and hammered on it, if the timing light is used 
the spark will retard when that happens.
<P>
	These cars are very sensitive. The bottom line is that they have 
these onboard diagnostic pieces of equipment. The onboard 
diagnostic piece of equipment is a way of refining the entire 
combustion process from start to finish making sure the 
contaminants that come out in the air do not pollute the 
atmosphere.
<P>
	That is what the Minister of the Environment is trying to do. The 
Minister of the Environment has said if there were no onboard 
diagnostics on cars in Canada but available in the United States, 
Canadians would get a inferior product to their counterparts in the 
United States. We would be actually manufacturing the cars in 
Canada and exporting them to the States while we are using cars 
with obsolete technology.
<P>
	Study after study by the automotive manufacturers has said 
MMT interferes with diagnostic onboard pieces of equipment and 
causes them to foul up. It causes them to trigger warning lights. It 
causes them to take the car under warranty which in turn would 
cost more money for the car.
<P>
	These cars are supposed to go well over 100,000 kilometres 
without these parts being replaced or without some major clogging 
up of the complicated three way catalytic converter.
<P>
	What has the Government of Canada done? The Minister of the 
Environment went to the manufacturers and went to the Ethyl 
Corporation and said solve the problem and they could not solve 
the problem.
<P>
	If the Ethyl Corporation feels so strongly that its product is so 
good, let it take the risk. Do not ask us to go to our National 
Research Council and use our researchers to prove its product is 
good or bad. Put it in sample cars and prove it. The idea that there is 
a court case in the United States is a sham because the Americans 
have not been using MMT for 17 years.
<P>
	There is still a ban. It is not legal to buy MMT in the States and 
the Environmental Protection Agency has said it has to go through 
that series of tests which are so important to environmental 
protection. It has to go through that thumb print required by any 
fuel additives that have certain restrictions which have to be met.
<P>
	Hydrocarbon emissions, nitric oxide emissions and all these 
things are calibrated through an acceptable level which cars have to 
go through in order to make sure they pass the test.
<P>
	We have an automotive industry of which we use 10 per cent and 
17 per cent is exported. It is important to get into the new model 
year. The minister had to act and she acted.
<P>

<B><A NAME="14631"> 14631 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not see why any of my colleagues being lobbied by the 
Ethyl Corporation are trying to tell the government side that we 
should be spending any more money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a privilege to speak to the proposal of my colleague to refer 
this Bill C-94 to the Standing Committee on Industry to examine it 
further.
<P>
	During today's debate we have fairly firmly established that the 
decision on the government's behalf to ban MMT is not an 
environmental decision at all but a decision made by one of the 
most political of our ministers, the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	It is interesting that years ago she made news by jumping over a 
table to confront a Conservative cabinet minister. Perhaps she feels 
she has not been in the news enough lately so she is tabling Bill 
C-94 to attempt to show that she is doing something about the 
environment. Obviously it is a purely political bill.
<P>
	Bill C-94 is a bill which would ban the importation and 
interprovincial trade of MMT. It is interesting the Liberals have no 
reason to ban MMT on environmental reasons. This is why they 
cannot ban it. They can simply prohibit interprovincial trade of it, 
which of course has the same effect.
<P>
	It is a shame they do not come out and say as a policy of the 
government under industrial diversification or whatever that they 
want to claim they are going to ban it. This would be the honest 
thing to say. It is not based on the environmental criteria.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Again it was interesting today when the environment minister 
quoted extensively from all the reports she has seen, none of which 
she will table in the House of Commons. They are all classified or 
secret or whatever.
<P>
	If she would agree to an independent study or table the study so 
that everybody could have a look perhaps we could believe the 
purity of her motives. As it is now, because she will not table it, 
because she will not have an independent study, it raises the 
question of the sincerity of the minister on the environmental 
impact of it, especially in light of some of the other studies on what 
the EPA has said that MMT does not cause or contribute to the 
failure of vehicles to meet applicable emissions standards required 
by the U.S. clean air act.
<P>
	The clean air act is much more stringent than our own. It is 
unfortunate that she has used this as a political statement of some 
sort. It is really to her detriment that she continues to push this idea 
instead of referring it to the committee on industry where it could 
be properly studied so we could get some scientific reason why 
MMT is good or bad.
<P>
	On November 30, 1993 the EPA determined MMT does not 
cause or contribute to the failure of emission control systems in 
automobiles and the courts on April  14, 1995 ordered the EPA to 
grant a temporary waiver of its ban on MMT to a private company 
that wants to market it again. The EPA, which I do not think is 
anybody's lapdog, has said it has no reason to prohibit MMT and 
will allow it again into the United States.
<P>
	The United States is almost at the point where it will once again 
allow MMT in unleaded gasoline at the very time when Canada is 
trying to ban it.
<P>
	The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute said its industries 
will not remove MMT unless there is conclusive proof the additive 
is harmful to the environment, which was one argument, or that it 
causes the onboard diagnostic computers to malfunction.
<P>
	It is willing to move on that if the proof in either of those 
departments is forthcoming, but there is no such proof. The 
opposite is true. In December 1994 Health Canada published a 
study which said there is no health risk from MMT, and therefore 
the minister cannot ban it. All she can do is try to stop it from being 
transported.
<P>
	In order to enhance the octane in gasoline refineries will have to 
substitute something else. What will that be? We have heard some 
arguments on both sides and one of the things could be an 
unpronounceable chemical additive called MTBE which will cost 
refineries some $50 million to change over to and will cost an extra 
$25 million every year to make the switch, not an insignificant 
drop in the bucket.
<P>
	The higher prices will be passed on to the consumers at the 
pumps. The Minister of the Environment should also have included 
in her portfolio the minister of gas, not only for the political nature 
of her remarks but also for her notable contribution to the higher 
gasoline prices if this bill continues.
<P>
	Even more ironically the new substance which will replace 
MMT is also known to cause increased pollution even while the 
substance she is banning has been determined to be safe by Health 
Canada. Her own officials say banning MMT will increase nitrogen 
oxide emissions by a full 20 per cent. Nitrogen oxide is the stuff 
that increases ground level ozone which makes the lives of people 
with lung problems a little harder to bear.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment, who also could be called the 
minister of gas, could be the minister of lung problems. Not only 
does it point out her normal tendency to rash comment but it also 
highlights her contribution to worsening an already serious air 
pollution problem in Canada.
<P>
	If the banning of MMT hurts people and the environment, and if 
the American EPA says an MMT does not hurt automobile 
emission systems, what could be the real motivation behind the 
minister's introducing such a bill?
<P>
	The obvious reason is purely political. Is it the lobbying efforts 
of the powerful automobile companies?  Is it a weak minister who, 
when she is confronted by a powerful group in central Canada, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14632"> 14632 </A></B>
<P>
buckles even though there is no evidence from her own department 
that this is causing serious harm.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	The minister should remember she is a national minister who is 
supposed to look out for the entire country and that all parts of 
Canada will be affected by her decisions.
<P>
	We all know the producing fineries are located mostly in western 
Canada and therefore western Canada will bear most of the costs. 
The big car manufacturers located near the minister's riding will 
not have to spend any more time or money trying to figure out what 
is wrong with their faulty on board computers. They will not have 
to justify their opposition to MMT on scientific or technical 
grounds but merely lobby really hard and hope the minister 
supports them, which apparently she does.
<P>
	I wonder what the Minister of Natural Resources thinks about 
the bill. I mentioned earlier today on a different subject that I have 
been quick to applaud the Minister of Natural Resources when she 
has stood up for industry and when she has made decisions based 
on sound, scientific evidence. However, I wonder where she is on 
this matter. I would dearly like to ask her whether she agrees with 
the intent of this bill and whether she is willing to sell out the 
industry she represents so the minister of gas and lung problems 
can protect her own political turf. Is the minister really fighting for 
her industry at the cabinet table or is she losing out to the political 
heavyweights sitting across the cabinet table?
<P>
	I am waiting for the Minister of Natural Resources to announce 
her own feelings about this bill. I want her to come out and say why 
on a scientific basis she thinks MMT should be banned. I would 
also like her to come out forcefully and either support or argue with 
the Minister of the Environment on those issues.
<P>
	I hope the Minister of Natural Resources does want to represent 
all of the producers in this country, not just the automobile 
producers, but the people in the resource industries who are asking, 
as is the minister of the environment in, for proof as to why MMT 
should be banned.
<P>
	The media release I have is from a respected international 
brokerage firm, the Solomon Brothers, with strong research 
capabilities in this sector. Talking about the EPA rulings in the 
United States:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We continue to strongly believe that the rule of law will prevail in this case 
and not some half baked EPA policy stance. In other words, MMT will get a full 
green light by year end.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The firm used the term half baked. We could use the same term 
to refer to Bill C-94. It is a half baked political attempt to appease 
some groups of people, although I am not sure who. The 
environment minister seems ready and willing to turn her back on 
her own portfolio which  is to protect the environment for all 
Canadians on a technical and scientific basis.
<P>
	How ironic that even while the U.S. is moving forward on this 
issue Canada is furiously back pedalling. I encourage the Minister 
of the Environment to back pedal in one more way and do what she 
knows is the right thing and refer this bill to the committee of 
industry where it can have a detailed study and hearings on it to 
bring it to a proper scientific conclusion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-94, an act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial 
purposes of certain manganese-based substances, and in particular 
to the motion now before this House to adjourn the debate as 
proposed by the hon. member for Calgary North.
<P>
	I feel it is important not to delay the debate under way. We 
cannot keep putting off indefinitely environment issues. Matters as 
important to our future as the environment cannot be postponed 
endlessly. But before talking about the proposal to adjourn the 
debate on this crucial matter, I would like to say a few words about 
some general environmental issues that deserve our attention.
<P>
	This morning, we debated in this House a bill to amend the 
Auditor General Act, which provides for the appointment of a 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development 
reporting to the auditor general and requires departments to 
develop environmental strategies to be laid before the House.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Environmental matters are always a little less tangible than 
issues such as finance, revenue or day-to-day management. I used 
to sit on the public accounts committee and the auditor general 
often came to explain or question the regular management of 
various government departments. Regarding the environment, 
however, I think it is important for the government to be concerned 
about the environment, about the future of all Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	Environmental issues transcend borders. Some examples come 
to mind. In my riding, we have one, in fact two international lakes, 
namely Lake Memphremagog and Lake Champlain, about which 
we are having environmental difficulties with our American 
neighbours.
<P>
	It makes us realize that not all problems are resolved with 
borders. Agreements must be reached with neighbouring states. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14633"> 14633 </A></B>
<P>
Over the summer, I participated in discussions with our neighbours 
in Vermont and people in Washington to try to resolve an 
environmental problem affecting Lake Champlain. I think it is 
important for neighbours to make an effort to  understand one 
another and ensure that future generations on both sides of the 
border, in Canada as well as in the U.S., can agree in future.
<P>
	In that sense, I do not see the use of having borders sprouting up 
all over the place in terms of the environment. With NAFTA, with 
the World Trade Organization, we are now in an open economy and 
the same should hold true for the environment.
<P>
	As far as this bill is concerned, I think we should move on this, 
and not in six months time. There have been enough studies. I think 
that the government should go ahead with this bill.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier how important the environment is to this 
country. I would like to share with you more of what I have learned 
during the summer. We witnessed this wonderful co-operation 
between the federal, provincial and municipal governments across 
the country. I am referring to the infrastructure program which had 
an impact on the environment in Quebec. Some communities got 
funding from the infrastructure program to build a water treatment 
plant. The program helped promote environmental projects in 
several sectors.
<P>
	I want to go back to the importance of the decisions which have 
to be made today, not tomorrow, to preserve our future. As you 
know, when a decision is made concerning the environment, it 
costs money. However, it may be better to pay today than to be 
blamed by future generations for not having acted quickly enough 
regarding the environment.
<P>
	This is important for our safety. There is the ozone depletion, as 
well as all the problems with our lakes and rivers, pollution 
problems. We have to act immediately and this is what the 
government intends to do. It wants to take immediate action, so 
that our future generations can live safely.
<P>
	We must also look at the impact on the industry sector. By acting 
now, the government prompts the industry to develop, produce and 
export new technologies and products. The environment is a 
promising sector for our engineering firms, our industries, our 
producers, our exporters, and everyone else. For that reason, we 
should not let the debate go on and on. We should look at this bill 
right now.
<P>
	Earlier, I alluded to the debate that took place this morning 
regarding the auditor general, the new commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I think that this act, which seeks to regulate interprovincial trade 
in and the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese-based substances, shows that this government is a good 
government. This is a good government's program. It is a program 
which makes people realize that environmental  safety is 
important. It is important to all Canadians today and it is also 
important for future generations. Such an initiative does solve the 
real issues, even though it may not do much for hypothetical 
questions such as where will the border be located, etc. We are 
together in this country and we work together to find solutions to 
the real issues that confront Canadians. This is what is important.
<P>
	There has been co-operation on environmental matters between 
the Canadian government and the provinces. To mention only two 
instances, under the previous Quebec government, the Liberal 
government, the environment minister at the time, Pierre Paradis, 
and the present Minister of Environment of Canada, Ms. Copps, 
signed a number of agreements. The plan for the St. Lawrence, for 
instance, referred to as Vision 2000, and the agreement between the 
Government of Quebec and the government in Ottawa on the St. 
Lawrence. But the St. Lawrence starts in the Great Lakes. 
Everything is inter-related. So these agreements are extremely 
beneficial for Quebec and for Canada, for present and future 
generations. It is important to have this co-operation between the 
federal government and the provincial governments.
<P>
	Ten months later we had a second agreement, an agreement with 
the pulp and paper mills, an agreement signed by the Government 
of Quebec and Ottawa. Incredible. We have not had many 
environmental agreements since the separatist government came to 
power, but we have had an agreement between Quebec and Ottawa 
on environmental matters. This bill, sponsored by the Minister of 
the Environment, makes me proud to be a Canadian, to be a 
member of a generous and sharing society, a society that is open 
and secure.
<P>
	We live in a system that is evolving. We should let it evolve. Let 
there be new agreements and new ways of sharing. Let us also 
ensure that Canada, which, according to a UN report, ranked first 
on quality of life and, according to a report by the World Bank 
published yesterday, is the second richest country in the world, let 
us make sure that in the future, this country keeps up the good work 
through its environmental programs, as we have done in the past 
and will continue to do so.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the motion to 
amend Bill C-94, an act to ban the importation of MMT.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Calgary North, proposes to 
withdraw Bill C-94 from second reading and refer the matter to the 
Standing Committee on Industry. I support this motion, because 
when we look at the facts it will become very clear that the banning 
of MMT is clearly an industry issue, not an environmental issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14634"> 14634 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill revolves around an industry dispute, a dispute between 
the Canadian Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, the 
MVMA, and the Canadian Petroleum Producers Institute, the 
CPPI. It should be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry.
<P>
	The environment minister has Bill C-94 on a fast track through 
the House on environmental grounds, but there is no impartial 
evidence to support this approach or the minister's supposed 
environmental claims. That is the reason we are debating an 
interprovincial ban on MMT, as opposed to environmental 
concerns.
<P>
	It concerns me that after a review of legislation proposed in Bill 
C-94 and of the scientific evidence or lack of scientific evidence 
presented both in support of the bill and in opposition to it, I am 
still left with one question: Why is this government proposing to 
ban MMT?
<P>
	In the last session I asked the House to lay out the facts that 
support this proposed legislation. I am still waiting for those facts 
to be presented, which leaves me asking the same questions and 
drawing the same conclusions. The minister's decision to ban 
MMT is purely political. The fact is that the minister's decision has 
been influenced by the MVMA.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The MVMA wants the minister to ban MMT because it claims 
that MMT is responsible for problems with onboard diagnostic 
systems. However, there is a problem with this claim. Automakers 
are experiencing the same problems in the United States, where 
MMT is not in current use. Given this fact, and without any 
impartial evidence, it is difficult to understand how equipment 
problems could be the result of MMT's presence in Canadian 
gasoline. We have two different cases.
<P>
	There are many things that do not make sense with this bill. For 
example, it is difficult to understand why this government is 
proposing to ban a substance when research has shown that 
removing MMT will increase vehicle emissions that cause smog 
and poor air quality by up to 20 per cent.
<P>
	Over the last decade Canadians have worked hard to reduce 
emissions of nitrogen oxide to meet international and domestic 
commitments to improve air quality. While we have been 
successful at freezing NOX emissions at 1987 levels, and we have 
pledged to do so with the OECD, can we now afford to consider 
increasing NOX emissions by 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes a year? This 
is what will happen by removing MMT from gasoline.
<P>
	The government has yet to provide any answers regarding what 
will replace MMT in gasoline. MMT is the only fuel additive that 
has been scientifically proven to reduce emissions of NOX. 
Alternative fuels such as ethanol also benefit from addition of 
MMT, so this will affect their performance as well. Without MMT 
ethanol puts NOX into the atmosphere, but when MMT is added  to 
a 10 per cent solution of ethanol blend it reduces emissions of NOX 
by 30 per cent.
<P>
	In addition, the minister has failed to address what the health 
impacts of banning MMT will be. Air pollution can be a threat to 
public health and health costs. NOX is one of the leading 
contributors to formation of urban smog. Scientific testing has 
demonstrated that without MMT, emissions of NOX will increase 
by 20 per cent over current levels. That means additional 
production of NOX every year, which would be equivalent to 
adding a million cars to our roads.
<P>
	Despite the environmental and health evidence, the environment 
minister still echoes the concerns of the MVMA that MMT in 
Canadian gasoline is causing problems for the onboard diagnostic 
systems in the new model American cars. The minister says she 
wants to ban MMT so that consumers will not have to pay $3,000 
or more for their automobiles next year. However, there is no 
scientific evidence to support this claim. These claims were made 
by the MVMA's counterpart in the United States, and the U.S. court 
of appeals has determined they were totally unfounded. In addition, 
automakers are having exactly the same problems with OBDs in 
the U.S., and MMT is not currently used, so it cannot be the MMT 
that is causing the problem.
<P>
	The environment minister has also stated that if vehicle 
manufacturers carry through on threats to remove OBD systems the 
result would be a tenfold increase in vehicle emissions. The OBD 
system does not reduce emissions. OBDs are monitoring systems, 
which provide drivers with notification by a dashboard light of a 
potential problem that could increase emissions. Removal or 
disconnection of the onboard system would prevent the dashboard 
malfunction light from illuminating, but it would not have the 
direct result of increasing emissions.
<P>
	It concerns me that the minister does not appear to understand 
the function of these onboard systems, especially as she cited this 
as one of the major reasons for banning MMT. The environment 
minister also indicated that she has received studies from the 
MVMA that illustrate that MMT is the cause of onboard failures. I 
find this most interesting. If these studies exist, why has GM 
recently announced that it plans to conduct tests in the U.S. to 
determine the effects of MMT on the onboard systems?
