</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-41, an act to amend the statute law in 
relation to veterans' benefits, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am not going to give a major speech 
today.  I am going to be as short as possible because there 
appears to be agreement, and I am pretty sure there is, among the 
critics of the other parties in the House that we try to deal 
with the bill today at this reading so that it can go on to the 
standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had excellent co-operation from the hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain of the Canadian Alliance, the hon. member 
for Terrebonne—Blainville of the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member 
for Saint John of the Progressive Conservative Party and the hon. 
member for Halifax West of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we all agree that the bill should be passed as 
quickly as possible is that it will provide some much needed 
benefits to our veterans and the survivors of our veterans.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also does something that should have been done many 
years ago.  It gives the civilian groups that served overseas 
with our soldiers access to the same pension and disability 
provisions as those who are recognized under the pension act and 
the War Veterans Allowance Act.  In other words, the bill gives 
the ferry command personnel, the civilian group of pilots who 
piloted the planes across the Atlantic during the war, access to 
the full benefits of the pension act and the War Veterans 
Allowance Act.  Five hundred Canadian pilots lost their lives 
bringing the planes over for use in the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives the nursing aids, the nursing sisters of the 
first world war and the second world war, the Canadian Red Cross 
workers and the St. John Ambulance workers who worked right at 
the front access to the same pension provisions as our veterans 
receive today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives welfare workers of the second world war and the 
Korean War access to those same benefits.  It gives Canadian 
firefighters for service in the United Kingdom group access to 
the same benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives a group called the Newfoundland foresters access 
to those same benefits. The Newfoundland foresters went overseas 
during the second world war before Canada was involved in the 
war.  Newfoundland was not a part of Canada at that time.  The 
ships left Newfoundland with about 3,000 people who had joined 
the Royal Navy or the Merchant Navy in Britain, people who were 
called upon as foresters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian foresters who went overseas received full benefits 
after the war but the Newfoundlanders did not because 
Newfoundland was not a part of Canada at that time.  It should 
have been in the terms of union but, unfortunately, the 
individual who was supposed to negotiate this in the terms of 
union came to Ottawa in 1948, stayed at a local hotel and the day 
before this was supposed to be negotiated in the terms of union, 
he died.  So it was an omission in the terms of union between 
Newfoundland and Canada.  This bill will correct the error that 
was made back in 1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things in the bill which will be good for 
veterans, veterans' widows and family members of veterans who are 
alive today.  I will give members of the House two short examples 
that I know they will appreciate being included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are about seven excellent changes.  Take for example one 
case of a veteran's widow who has an overpayment on a health 
benefit.  Another widow has an overpayment on the funeral benefit 
and the debt stands.  Why is there a debt?  It is because 
somebody made an error inadvertently in paying the money to that 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally, when there is an overpayment, for example, in 
employment insurance or in any of the the municipal, provincial 
or federal government programs, then the person who received the 
money is responsible for paying it back. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill states that those overpayments, which were 
inadvertently made and stand as debts to the crown, will be 
erased.  Although it will not cost that much money and is only a 
small thing, it is huge to somebody like those two widows who 
actually owe money because of overpayments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to another section which I think was commendable 
for members of parliament and those people who participated in 
the process to put into the bill.  I just want to mention them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Legion spent a lot of time with the 
department drafting the bill and setting up meetings.  President 
Bill Barclay and particularly Allan Parks participated in the 
drafting of the legislation.  The National Council of Veterans 
Associations also participated.  Brian Forbes was at the meeting 
on behalf of Cliff Chadderton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is perhaps no one individual in Canada today who has 
contributed more to the process of legislation for veterans than 
Cliff Chadderton.  He is an incredible individual who constantly 
works for veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peter Ambroziak of ANAVETS, the Army, Navy and Air Force 
Veterans of Canada, took part in the negotiations as did Mr. 
Lloyd Thompson of Botwood, Newfoundland.  He is a Newfoundland 
forester but he wore the British uniform overseas so he gets the 
benefits.  He is working on behalf of the other foresters in 
Newfoundland who number anywhere from 500 to 1,000 that I know 
of.  They deserve these benefits and should have received them in 
the terms of union.  However, as I said, the person responsible 
for negotiating them died the night before the terms were being 
negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also Louis Lang of Montreal from Ferry Command participated. 
Louis spent a lot of time lobbying on behalf of Ferry Command 
pilots who perhaps had the greatest loss of life of any one group 
that took part in the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are about seven items in the bill that will benefit 
Canadian veterans today.  I mentioned the overpayments to the two 
widows and other people in a similar situation which would be 
forgiven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to mention is that in all of our income 
tested programs we always rely on somebody's last year's income 
as reported on the income tax return.  Old age security, 
guaranteed income supplement and spousal allowance are based on 
the income tax return for the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes somebody might receive a benefit, say a capital gain, 
this year not knowing that next year the spousal allowance could 
be gone or the guaranteed income supplement would be reduced 
accordingly.  That is one of the aspects of income tested 
programs that is very difficult to deal with when we have cases 
where somebody loses something because of what happened last year 
on the income tax return, especially with our senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course disability pensions and so on are not income tested. 
That is the marvellous part of this bill.   All these civilian 
groups that served overseas will have access to the full 
benefits.  Some of them will not be income tested.  A lot of our 
civilian groups did not understand that this would be a real 
benefit to the people who need home care, for example.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people in Canada who went overseas for four and five 
years and do not have access to home care because the bill is not 
law today.  That is why we are trying to pass the bill as quickly 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to what we are doing as far as someone's income is 
concerned, we are saying that the income tested portion of 
veterans payments will be based on estimated income for this 
year, not what is on the income tax return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the benefit in that?  I will give an example.  Perhaps 
someone received a capital gain last year.  Perhaps he or she 
were left some money or sold some property last year and the 
guaranteed income supplement and spousal allowance will drop.  If 
it is a veteran's payment that is income tested it will rise 
accordingly, thereby cancelling the reduction that would take 
effect under the guaranteed income supplement or the spousal 
allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the excellent things in the bill.  They 
certainly set a standard that should be looked at by provincial 
governments and by everyone who deals with guaranteed income 
programs in federal and provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had preliminary discussions with the member for Halifax 
West of the New Democratic Party.  He has been very active with 
regard to the bill over a period of time.  In fact prior to the 
announcement being made he was very active with regard to this 
subject material, as well as the member for Saint John of the 
Progressive Conservative Party and the member for 
Terrebonne—Blainville of the Bloc Quebecois.  As well, within 
the last three or four days the member for Souris—Moose Mountain 
supports the bill wholeheartedly and wants it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I will not say anything else.  I will just shut up 
and hope that other members of parliament will also shut up. Then 
we could pass the bill with as little comment as possible.  We 
have until 11 o'clock this morning and then we will reconvene on 
the bill at about 12.15 p.m. until 1.30 p.m.  Therefore we have 
until approximately 11 a.m. now and then about an hour and a half 
after question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could so arrange it as to get over this stage of the bill 
and send it to committee, we would be answering the prayers of a 
good many veterans.  We would be responding positively to what 
every political party wants to do in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing like a good dose of 
maritime eloquence to begin the morning.  I thank the minister 
for his eloquent speech.  In fact we could pass the bill very 
quickly, as he and other members of the House would like to do, 
except for one little clause.  Clause 46 needs to be removed from 
the bill to provide the equitability and fairness I know the 
minister would like to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Souris—Moose Mountain, as the minister 
has mentioned, who has done an incredible amount of work not only 
for our party but, more important, for the members and the 
veterans who are waiting for the bill to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the aspects of clause 46.  I am glad the minister 
will listen.  I know he is a man of fairness. 
I am sure he will encourage and convince his members to remove 
this clause.  If he does so, our party will support the bill and 
help him expedite it through the House to relieve the suffering 
that our veterans have been enduring for far too long.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports Bill C-41 because it gives civilian groups 
the same fairness and equitability as it has to other veterans 
who have laid their lives on the line for our country, for peace 
and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives it to groups such as the Canadian Red Cross, St. John 
Ambulance, the Corps of Canadian Civilian Firefighters, the Ferry 
Command personnel and the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit 
because these people provided invaluable service to the war 
effort.  These people, as the minister mentioned, put their lives 
on the line.  Many of them lost their lives while supporting the 
war effort.  Their efforts, while they did not pick up a weapon, 
were absolutely essential for the men and women who were in 
Europe and other parts of the world fighting for the peace and 
security that we enjoy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our armed forces personnel must have access to existing veterans 
benefits today if they served overseas during World War I, World 
War II and the Korean war.  Merchant navy vets gained full access 
to these benefits in 1992.  Unfortunately the issue of 
compensation took far too long to come about.  We do not want 
this to happen with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The groups affected by the bill have historically had limited 
access to veterans benefits previously given to other veterans, 
but the bill recognizes that fact and does a very good job of 
providing them with the benefits they so justly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say these groups are worthy recipients because they served 
alongside other forces personnel and their lives were in no less 
danger during those perilous times.  The efforts of these 
organization deserve the recognition they have so long been 
denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite a few examples.  The overseas air crew of the Ferry 
Command ferried military aircraft across the Atlantic Ocean.  In 
many ways those brave pilots were trail blazers.  Some of them, 
interestingly enough, were among the first to chart a path across 
the North Pole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was dangerous work, flying over uncharted territory.  Many of 
the pilots lost their lives in the endeavour to provide planes 
that were absolutely essential for us to carry on the war effort 
in Europe.  During World War II about 340 civilian pilots and air 
crew were contracted to deliver aircraft to Britain and 
elsewhere.  Today about 100 of these brave souls are still alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coal was vital to Britain's war effort and mining activity.  Its 
use increased so much that Britain did not have enough and wood 
had to be cut in Scotland.  As a result, the Newfoundland 
Overseas Forestry Unit was created on short notice.  It went over 
there to harvest timber.  Of the 3,680 Newfoundlanders who went 
to Scotland during the war there are roughly 1,000 of these souls 
alive today who cut the wood that was necessary to build tunnels 
and for other uses during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second world war the Corps of Canadian Civilian 
Firefighters bravely put out fires during the blitz, which was 
central to saving the lives of many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Red Cross and St. John Ambulance worked 
alongside people who were terribly injured during the war. They 
were as close to the action as anyone could get.  There are 
approximately 450 members of this group alive today and they need 
the care they require as they age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that with the passage of time there are so few 
left and it has taken so long for this legislation to come 
forward.  We as a party are happy and encouraged by the 
government's effort to move the bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be a lesson for all of us as Canadians to take a 
more active interest in our military and service people who 
historically have given us more care and consideration than I 
think the House has given them.  We must pay more careful 
attention to the long term effects of war that for a long time 
have been ignored:  post-traumatic stress disorder, depression 
and the effects on the family that are so often hidden. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, historically after World War I and World War II many of 
these problems were buried but now that medical science and 
others have taken a more active interest, these problems are 
coming to light.  As these problems come to light, so too is it 
necessary for the care to be there for people who have been 
traumatized by horrors that most of us can only imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will civilian groups benefit from the bill but members 
currently serving in our armed forces will benefit as well.  The 
bill amends the pension act to allow Canadian forces members in 
the regular force who have acquired service related disabilities 
to receive pensions while still serving.  This brings it in line 
with the public service and private industry. This is important 
because this is not a stand-alone issue.  It does not affect only 
the military.  In fact the bill brings the military up to today's 
standards in the public service and private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address our primary criticism which the member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain raised with the minister. I am sure we can 
find a way to ensure that this tiny issue will be resolved 
expeditiously.  It involves the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill alleviates a past injustice to our armed forces, 
it creates an injustice to the RCMP.  The RCMP pension is tied to 
the armed forces pension but is funded by the RCMP.  Currently 
RCMP officers are in the same position as Canadian forces 
personnel in that they cannot receive a disability pension while 
being employed by the force.  I will give an important example 
very shortly, one of which we are probably all aware.  Because 
clause 46 was added to the bill, by its very wording it removes 
previous legislation that prevented those in the armed forces 
from receiving a disability pension while employed, but it 
prevents the RCMP from getting the same benefits as will be 
accrued to other members that the bill actually supports, brave 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example I will give now is one which we all remember very well. 
Constable Laurie White was shot in the leg while trying to serve 
a search warrant and had to get a portion of her leg amputated. 
Constable White is back on the force working very hard, bravely 
so, despite having had part of her leg amputated.  She 
demonstrates the best that we have within our RCMP service 
personnel and indeed she deserves all of the honours that have 
accrued to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this amendment exists, people like Laurie White in the 
RCMP cannot receive the benefits the bill gives to other 
individuals even though the RCMP is tied to the essence of the 
bill.  We ask that clause 46 be removed purely in the name of 
fairness.  We cannot ask the RCMP to be involved in the bill and 
have its entire benefits package tied to those of veterans and 
the personnel that this involves as the bill does, while on the 
other hand exempting it from an aspect that would be very 
important for individuals such as Constable Laurie White. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also makes a provision for peacekeepers which is very 
important because peacekeepers serve in very dangerous 
environments.  Peacekeeping is a misnomer in that one thinks it 
has something to do with peace.  It has, but the problem is that 
peacekeeping is really war by another name because peacekeepers 
confront land mines and snipers.  They are often put in between 
warring factions which are often under no control by their 
supposed leaders.  It is a very dangerous situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government historically has given our armed 
forces personnel the equipment for a peaceful situation. One 
other thing I would like the government to know, and I hope the 
minister of defence pays close attention to this, is that we 
simply have to arm our soldiers for war in a peacekeeping 
situation because peacekeeping, as I said, is war by another 
name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our veterans have faced a litany of problems when they have 
returned from war situations, particularly recently.  I and many 
other members in the House have received many legitimate 
complaints from brave men and women who have come back from the 
theatre and have not received the care they require.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister is very interested in this and that his 
heart is in the right place.  I know he would not like to see 
these people go without the medical care they so justly deserve. 
He would want them to receive the required care for such things 
as gulf war syndrome, other poisonings as yet unidentified, 
post-traumatic stress disorder and severe major depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifteen per cent of people who suffer from major depression 
commit suicide. Imagine the numbers that would involve with 
respect to our armed forces personnel who go abroad and raise our 
flag to fight for the noblest of elements of humanity. They fight 
for peace and security, the things we gratefully enjoy in our 
country.  Let us give them the same care and consideration they 
have given us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has seen fit to give the members a cost of living 
allowance.  We support this.  We have been working hard for a 
long period of time to right this injustice.  We applaud the 
government for doing it, but there is a problem. While the 
government has given the members a cost of living allowance and 
an increase in pay, it is surreptitiously yanking that money away 
by increasing their rents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their rents have increased dramatically in many areas. On the 
base in Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca the members are so happy and 
pleased to finally get some recognition and fairness in their pay 
but there have been massive and dramatic increases in their 
rents.  While money has been given with one hand, the government 
has taken it out with the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government really does not want to do this, at least 
I would like to think it would not.  I challenge the government, 
as all of my colleagues here do, to please stop yanking money out 
of one pocket while putting it into the other pocket.  Stop 
giving our military forces money and talking about it as if it 
has done something and then taking the money away. This has 
created an incredible negative impact on the morality within our 
armed forces.  They do not deserve that.  They have been 
extremely patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other small section I would like to talk about briefly 
concerns the civilian population in our military who have done a 
yeoman's job under very difficult circumstances.  Their numbers 
have been cut dramatically.  They did not mind, as they 
recognized that came down the pike in an effort to save money. 
Their members have been cut by 50% or more. They have increased 
their efficiency dramatically and in fact have been given awards 
for it.  On the other hand, alternative service delivery is 
taking place.  They do not mind alternative service delivery but 
they do want to ensure that they are able to compete on a level 
playing field with the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one request for the government.  Make sure that the 
people there today are treated as fairly as other competitors. 
That is what they want.  They are confident they will be able to 
compete well, and as they have done for a long time, do their 
jobs to support our military. They have done this well but they 
want to be considered fairly with the private sector that is 
competing for their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take a good look at that because they have 
done an excellent job.  They have provided high quality service. 
They have probably done a better job than many private workers 
could do.  Take a look at that and compare it fairly. I think the 
government will find that in many cases the civilian workers have 
done an excellent job and deserve to keep doing their work. Do 
not let them be lost in the cracks.  I would ask the government 
to make sure that they are listened to and that their concerns 
are dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain said, the 
improvements made in the bill involve:  clarifying how private 
information can be exchanged within the department to expedite 
benefits, which is a good thing; protecting the public servants 
from having to testify in courts of civil litigation; 
compassionate awards to be continued to survivors, which are very 
important; deleting penal provisions from veterans legislation 
where the provisions are either unnecessary or substantially 
duplicated in the criminal code; where two disabled pensioners 
are married to each other, both receiving the married rate of 
pension benefits; and allowing for remission of overpayment based 
upon compassionate grounds if the debt is not collectable. 
These are fair things.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the groups of people affected by this bill have a 
very legitimate claim to the benefits provided.  We compliment 
the government for putting this bill forward.  The civilians who 
went alongside the armed forces personnel did yeomen's jobs. Many 
of them lost their lives in the process.  Their survivors and the 
remaining few deserve the care this bill provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension act prohibits armed forces personnel from receiving 
a disability benefit while employed in the forces and this has 
been removed. But clause 46 has been added to the bill and it 
prevents the RCMP from being able to acquire the benefits of this 
part of the bill.  This inequity must be addressed before our 
party can fully support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government removes clause 46 from the bill, we will have 
a piece of legislation that will correct years of injustice.  If 
the clause remains, the RCMP will be exempt from the very 
provision and benefits that our armed forces will enjoy and it 
will therefore be instrumental in creating an injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of fairness, let us include the RCMP in the bill as 
it ought to be.  Let us remove clause 46 and let us pass the bill 
for our veterans.

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, better 
late than never.  Half a century after the fact, we have our 
government acknowledging that a variety of Canadian civilians, 
such as firefighters and Red Cross personnel, took part in World 
War II and the Korean War and shared the merits and often the 
dangers of military personnel.  Yet until now they have not been 
entitled to the pensions and other benefits received by 
uniformed veterans which are concrete expressions of this 
country's gratitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41, which we are looking at now, has the praiseworthy 
objective of remedying that injustice. 
It does so only partially, however, as I shall attempt to 
demonstrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another category of civilians also has been waiting 55 
years for recognition of their merits.  These are the merchant 
mariners.  Until now, it appears that those in high places have 
forgotten that these are the people to whom we owe the fact that 
the weapons and ammunition, without which our soldiers could do 
nothing, were able to be shipped across the Atlantic on merchant 
ships hounded by German U-boats.  Many of these merchant mariners 
now sleep at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  Only this year 
did the surviving brave mariners, or the widows, get any 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compensation was awarded to the Merchant Marine veterans of 
Canada and Newfoundland who served in wartime and were not 
members of the armed forces, or to their surviving spouses if 
they were deceased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This settlement for the Merchant Mariners is close to the amount 
of compensation mentioned in the dissenting report tabled by the 
Bloc Quebecois on this issue.  We called for a minimum of 
$20,000.  They received a maximum of $20,000.  It is interesting 
that this amount is within $1,000 of the amount that would have 
been paid in 1945, taking inflation and interest into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today concerns other categories of civilians 
who served overseas.  They are primarily the members of the 
corps of Canadian firefighters for service in the United 
Kingdom.  These men helped fight the fires in the German bombing 
raids in London and elsewhere for the first two years of the 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others benefiting from the bill are the Canadian members of the 
voluntary aid detachment of the British Red Cross during the 
first world war.  It took 82 years to remember them. 
Welfare workers and voluntary aid workers in the second world 
war and the Korean war are also finally being recognized.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not forgotten either are the civilian pilots in the ferry 
command, who often at the risk of their lives convoyed aircraft 
built here and destined for the European front between Canada 
and Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of these various categories of civilians deserving 
of recognition by their country are, under this bill, being 
accorded the same treatment as military veterans—and this is 
fair—and therefore are entitled to a pension.  As many of them 
are dead, their widows will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part of Bill C-41 that grants them full eligibility for 
pensions from the Department of Veterans Affairs is an 
improvement over an existing act, namely the Civilian War-related 
Benefits Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that act, welfare workers who worked with the Canadian 
armed forces during the war have had limited access to pensions 
from the very beginning. The same goes for Ferry Command 
personnel. In order to have access to the benefits provided 
under that act, these people had to have suffered injuries 
during an offensive or a counter-offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these civilians did not get any disability pension 
following accidents that occurred in situations such as the 
moving of troops and materiel. Bill C-41 would eliminate that 
restriction, which has the effect of granting pensions, contrary 
to what is done in the case of veterans, only to those who were 
injured while on duty, under certain conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this good legislation will not be 
retroactive. It does not provide any compensation for the 55 
years during which all these brave people were forgotten by 
their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an injustice. Since we are now recognizing that these 
people are entitled to national recognition just like military 
personnel who have been getting pensions since the end of the 
war, it is totally unfair to make them pay for the fact that the 
government waited for over half a century before recognizing 
their contribution, and thus their rights to national 
recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, when this bill is reviewed in committee, I will 
propose that the government take action to correct this anomaly 
by making the act retroactive in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find it acceptable for the government to permit itself 
what would be considered a reprehensible abuse of power by the 
courts if it had been the action of an individual against his 
employees.  Can anyone imagine a business leader admitting that 
some of his staff had been unfairly treated for years and 
agreeing to remedy the situation only if no retroactivity were 
involved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this principle of obvious equity does not seem popular with 
the government, if we are to judge by its reaction to the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission ruling ordering it to 
compensate those of its employees who, because they were women, 
had for years been paid less than their male counterparts—another 
example.  It will be recalled that Ottawa held out against 
making  these retroactive payments for a long time.  It only did 
so because it was forced to by the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-41 is to correct another anomaly. 
This one involves members of the Canadian armed forces who are 
still serving but are suffering from service-related 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These men and women are not currently entitled to disability pay 
before their release.  This situation is going to be corrected. 
We need hardly say that we are in favour of this provision of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we do not understand why clause 46 excludes the RCMP from 
this measure.  I will be raising this in committee and calling 
on the government to withdraw this provision from the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another anomaly is corrected. As the result of an error for which 
the recipient is in no way responsible, a veteran might receive 
a higher amount of pension than his entitlement for a certain 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, when the error was detected, the person concerned was 
required to pay back the overpayment under conditions and a 
deadline that might be prejudicial to his quality of life.  From 
now on the victims of these administrative errors will be 
treated more humanely.  We approve of this provision, while once 
again regretting that it has been so long in coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now give some of the other provisions of this bill in 
favour of pensioners with which we are totally in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permitting veteran disability pensioners who are married to, or 
living common-law with, each other to both receive the married 
rate; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing for a one-year continuation of a deceased veteran's 
pension to the guardian of the veteran's orphaned children; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correcting the pension indexing formula to accommodate declines 
in the consumer price index; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consolidating the provisions relating to service in special duty 
areas, peacekeeping and Korean war service, directly into the 
Pension Act; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing compassionate awards to be continued to survivors 
without the necessity of a time-consuming high-level 
re-adjudication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we naturally approve the housekeeping amendments to 
clarify regulation-making authorities, ensure the use of gender 
neutral language, correct cross-references, correct the French 
name of the department—it is called in French the ministère des 
Anciens combattants, with a small “c”, whereas it should be a 
capital “C”, thus ministère des Anciens Combattants—and, finally 
to repeal obsolete acts and provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I come to the date the bill will come into 
effect.  In light of the already considerable delay in the 
bill's correction of the various injustices, the Royal Canadian 
Legion would like, quite rightly, that once the bill has 
received Royal Assent and an implementing order has been issued 
for it, to have the changes it provides to be made effective not 
on the date of the order but rather as of March 1, 1999, the 
first day of the month the minister announced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again all these civilian and military individuals, who are 
entitled to recognition must not be penalized by the length of 
time it has taken to put a statute in place in order to correct 
the various injustices these people have faced up to now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, we support this piece of legislation in principle, 
but reserve the right to propose certain amendments to improve 
it.  Subject to these amendments we are happy with the content 
of Bill C-41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, we regret that this legislation comes some 50 years 
too late.  However, as I said at the start, better late than 
never.  We will propose to the government that the text of it be 
amended, either to make it effective retroactively or to have it 
provide for the payment of an indemnity to correct, at least for 
those still living, the injustice this delay represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also propose that the RCMP not be excluded from the 
application of the law with respect to the pension for 
individuals wounded in the line of duty but still serving.  I 
add that we will ask for a greater assurance of confidentiality 
for personal information that candidates for benefits will have 
to disclose to the department.

on behalf of the NDP, I urge the government to change its 
approach to the issue of residential school lawsuits.  The 
approach to date has been far too legalistic, has threatened the 
work and viability of some churches, has delayed compensation for 
victims and has been an attempt to evade the extent of the 
federal government's responsibility by obscuring the fact that 
the churches acted on behalf of the federal government and not on 
their own.  No one but lawyers and the tendency of this 
government to drag things out rather than deal with them fairly 
is being served by the current approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of the Deputy Prime Minister to talk to the 
churches about this issue is, we hope, a good sign.  The churches 
are willing to accept responsibility and pay their fair share of 
compensation.  However, to burden them with all the legal fees 
associated with the federal government constantly naming them as 
third parties in the suits, shows either a hostility to the 
churches or a cynicism at the heart of Liberal strategy on this 
issue that will no longer go unnoticed by Canadians who want 
justice for aboriginal victims, but who also value the ongoing 
work of the churches.

a recent discovery of a 1958 infrared photograph taken by the

to an area now known as Fort Beauséjour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the British took possession of the site of the

will the minister finally be brave enough to listen to public 
opinion and announce significant changes to the employment 
insurance plan established by this government, which affects 
women, young people and seasonal workers especially. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent on the government to 
ensure that its programs are efficient.  As I have said on a 
number of occasions, we continue to look at the impact of the 
employment insurance legislation and, if changes need to be made, 
we will make them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member that we are having this debate 
in the context of making sure that Canadians have the opportunity 
to work.  In that regard, I am very proud of our record.  Since 
taking office in 1993, the level of unemployment has been reduced 
significantly.  That is something we should all be supportive of.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the people who made the greatest contribution 
to eliminating the deficit are the very people denied their fair 
share of the fruits of the economic recovery.  Cabinet bickering 
is denying justice to seasonal workers, women and young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Human Resources Development drop this 
pointless bickering, assume her responsibilities and announce 
the specific measures that these workers and unemployed 
individuals have been awaiting for all too long? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member to look at 
the facts.  He makes reference to women.  We see that the 
unemployment levels for women are particularly positive over the 
course of the last number of years.  A million more women are 
working today than there were in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to seasonal workers, again, we understand the 
realities facing men and women who work in seasonal industries, 
but the status quo is not acceptable.  We are in communities in 
the Gaspé and the Acadian Peninsula, working with employers and 
employees to change that status quo.  I just wish the hon. member 
opposite would assist us in that regard.

responsible for the mess created by the Liberal's employment 
insurance scheme also has all the information she needs to make 
quick decisions in order to remedy the injustices created by her 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is keeping her from announcing changes to the system in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

sides of his mouth.  He sits there and talks about the grants and 
contributions with reference to the investments that we have been 
making and it is those grants and contributions that go directly 
to seasonal workers, that go directly to women and that go directly 
to Canadians who want to improve their own capacity to be part of 
this great economy.  Is he now saying that we should not be 
making those investments?

last night.  Our enforcement staff did remove more than 100 traps 
last night.  If those traps are not removed, we will ensure that

out of the water and he did.  He set a 40 trap limit and he 
ignored it.  He set a 40,000 pound catch limit.  He ignored that.

are less than 1,700 traps in the water according to our

</I></B></P><P align=left>Enforcement action is taken both on the water and on the land. 
If the traps are not removed, we will have to take enforcement 
action.  I have said that will continue.  This will be 
enforcement action both on the water and on the land, but 
enforcement action will be taken with due respect for public 
safety.  Our number one concern is to make sure that we avoid

effort that is already being taken by the government to ensure 
that we do have the right long term policy in place.

to grain transportation last June despite recommendations from 
the official opposition, farmers and the Estey and Kroeger

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a direct result of not listening, we now have the ridiculous 
situation where the Canadian Wheat Board is threatening grain

emerging in the grain handling and transportation system.  That 
is a big change.  All of the players have been accustomed to 
decades of administration and regulation and they must now 
function in a much different environment.  The request for 
mediation will be responded to appropriately, but in the meantime

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians have been devastated by the government's 
assault on the unemployed.  Since elected the Liberal government 
has left a trail of discrimination against women, youth, older 
workers and seasonal workers.  Now we have a huge surplus of 
which over $7 billion was built on the backs of these same 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years we have heard the Liberal government 
talk the talk but refuse to walk the walk about the EI changes. 
Will the government commit today to make the necessary changes to 
EI so that more unemployed Canadians will qualify? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government's record when it comes to 
unemployment is very good.  We see the fact that two million more 
Canadians are working today than there were in 1993 when we took 
office.  We see the levels of unemployment at historic lows.  We 
see the job growth numbers increasing on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is as a result of investments we are making in the economy. 
This is as a result of the work we undertake with employers and 
employees, and we are talking about seasonal workers and women. 
Again I remind the hon. member that when it comes to employment 
levels for women in Canada, the results are ever increasing.  We 
should be proud of that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr.

Resources Development says she needs evidence.  Only 40% of those 
unemployed qualify.  How is that for evidence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister talks about changes.  The leader in waiting 
says “Don't touch it because it helps build a surplus”.  Who is

pockets of working Canadians instead of in the pockets of the 
finance minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

results of that report.  If the program is not working as

mediator was put forward by Burnt Church and he was exploring the 
options with the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly did not approve any option which required a payout 
to the commercial fishermen, but the mediator is looking at all

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr.

fishermen to turn a blind eye to conservation should never have 
been put on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is saying he was not aware that it was being put on 
the table.  What we need to know now is what is the mandate of

should stick to it.

Nova saying “Allow me to commend both you and your department 
for the tremendous efforts you have devoted toward enforcing 
fisheries regulations along the coast of Burnt Church and New

Mr. Speaker, I was just on my way up to the chair to give you

of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this arises out of the

specifically to your behaviour in the chair when you said that 
maybe we could let this wait for a couple of minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You and I are both school teachers.  You know what to do when we 
have people who are personally our responsibility and we hear an 
alarm.  You are up and out.  You know that I got up and out as 
quickly as I could.  The galleries cleared sooner than this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just a little laugh or chuckle.  I am deadly 
serious.  No, we could not smell smoke and maybe you wanted to 
hear the minister's answer.  However, you said that we would 
leave it for a couple of minutes.  It could have been a bomb and 
there could have been not just members of parliament here.  There 
could have been people in the galleries and staff in the 
building.  I do not think that we need to just pass this off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been here many years and you longer.  That was a 
different sound than many of the alarms than we have had.  It was 
incumbent upon us and it was incumbent upon you to get people up 
and out of here as quickly as possible.  You are responsible for 
the Chamber and, in fact, the whole place.  I think it was— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I take the chastisement as one former 
teacher to another that I did not react as quickly as I might 
have.  It is good that you brought it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been through this on a number of occasions and I usually 
wait for my Sergeant-at-Arms because we do have false alarms.  We 
were in the middle of a question period and perhaps I wanted to 
hear some more questions and responses.  The alarm that you heard 
is the same alarm that we have always had here.

The millions of people who ride these trains literally flush 
their toilets on the tracks.  This is a serious question and I 
have been asked about this by various railway unions who work on 
the tracks.  The Minister of the Environment of course will be 
aware of the environmental implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he see fit, at least, to get in touch with VIA officials

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to respond to a question of 
privilege filed by the member for Wentworth—Burlington, if you 
are prepared to entertain the government's response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yes, I am.   I will set the stage for you. 
This was a point of privilege which was brought up before 
parliament adjourned for the summer.  This is a response to that 
time.  The hon. parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you may recall on June 15, 
2000, the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington raised a point of 
privilege concerning the defeat of his private member's bill, 
Bill C-206, an act to amend the Access to Information Act at 
second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of privilege alleges that the Department of Justice 
may have wilfully deceived MPs by means of a document marked 
exhibit A, which MPs received on their desks in the House prior 
to the June 6 vote on Bill C-206. 
The documents stated that “the privacy commissioner had 
expressed concerns that, under Bill C-206, 30 year old records 
would be made accessible resulting in the potential release of 
personal information held by the government”.  It is alleged 
that the document falsely attributed these concerns to the 
privacy commissioner.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also claimed that the privacy commissioner's concerns were 
misrepresented in a talking points document dated May 26 to 
cabinet ministers, which was marked exhibit B.  This document, 
which was provided to cabinet ministers for discussion purposes, 
stated that the privacy commissioner considered Bill C-206 to be 
“a serious threat to the privacy of Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will demonstrate that exhibits A and B are a fair 
representation of the privacy commissioner's concerns regarding 
Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington “The 
problem is the privacy commissioner was not in official 
communication with the Department of Justice on Bill C-206 until 
10 days after the May 26 memo outlining his position and never 
described his concerns as a serious threat, nor ever provided the 
example cited in the document above”.  In fact, those concerns 
were exposed and expressed in different forums long before May 26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be some misunderstanding of the facts.  From 
October 1999 to June 2000, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner 
consistently indicated that Bill C-206 raised privacy concerns. 
Let me illustrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1999 the executive director of the Office of the 
Privacy Commissioner called a meeting with Department of Justice 
officials.  Officials from the privacy commissioner's office 
indicated that they had two major problems with the changes 
proposed in Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they were concerned that the changes proposed in clause 
14 of Bill C-206 would “eviscerate” the Privacy Act by imposing 
a mandatory obligation to disclose personal information.  The 
example used was that data collected by Revenue Canada is shared 
with HRDC under section 8 of the Privacy Act.  Changing the 
discretionary “may” disclose to “shall” disclose would result 
in all the income tax returns of Canadians for the last 10 years 
being accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they were concerned that the proposed 30-year rule, 
which would release virtually all documents after 30 years, would 
have privacy implications.  The confidential information 
collected by the government continues to be sensitive even after 
30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice officials took the concerns of the Office of the Privacy 
Commissioner very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 16, 2000 the privacy commissioner tabled his annual 
report in which he referred to, at page 75, the bill by the hon. 
member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Bill C-264, 
which was the predecessor to Bill C-206.  He indicated the bill 
could have “negative privacy impact” and that the proposed 
disclosure of information older than 30 years would, in his view, 
“completely disregard the protections of the Privacy Act”. 
Furthermore, he expressed concern over the removal of the 
critical discretion that the Privacy Act gives heads of federal 
institutions to determine whether to disclose individuals' 
personal information to third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on these statements, the document marked exhibit B was 
prepared for cabinet ministers.  It concluded that “The privacy 
commissioner believes Bill C-206 is a serious threat to the 
privacy of Canadians”.  This statement is clearly a fair 
representation of the views expressed by the Office of the 
Privacy Commissioner during the October meeting and in the 
privacy commissioner's annual report of May 16, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in a letter to the Minister of Justice dated June 
5, 2000, the privacy commissioner confirmed what his office had 
previously flagged.  The privacy commissioner stated at line 2 in 
the second paragraph of the letter “while I support the ultimate 
goal of a more transparent and accountable government, I fear the 
bill will have, perhaps unintentionally, a detrimental effect on 
the Privacy Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Privacy Act protects the private 
information of Canadians held by government institutions. 
Therefore, anything that would have a detrimental effect on the 
Privacy Act would be a threat to the privacy of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no deception on the part of the Department of Justice. 
The privacy commissioner's office expressed serious concerns 
about clause 14 and the 30 year rule in October 1999.  The 
commissioner's annual report of May 16, 2000 reaffirmed in a more 
general manner these concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 5, 2000 the privacy commissioner officially indicated 
that the same clauses would have a detrimental effect on the 
Privacy Act.  From October 1999 to June 2000 the message to the 
Department of Justice from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner 
was the same:  Bill C-206 represented a serious threat to the 
privacy of individuals.  The examples used indicate the nature of 
that threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that at the beginning of the 
previous parliament the government indicated that private 
members' business would be subject to free votes. Each member 
must assess the long term implications of any private member's 
bill or motion and vote accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice simply and correctly expressed a 
legitimate concern about Bill C-206 and shared the information 
she had with her colleagues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want to review the transcript of what 
has transpired not only today, but want to put in 
juxtaposition what happened last June.  I have a request from 
another member who wants to speak to this particular point of 
privilege.  I will of course reserve judgment until I hear from 
the member if indeed he wants to intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I will take both the submission of the member for 
Hamilton Mountain and your own submission.  I will hear from at 
least one other member and then I will come back to the House 
with my decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want the House to be apprised that I received a message 
earlier from the Deputy Prime Minister asking to rise on a point 
of order but we had the fire alarm.  He is not here, but I will 
hear whatever point he wants to bring up when the House convenes 
on Monday or after question period.  I want that to be on the 
record.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CIVILIAN WAR-RELATED BENEFITS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK158">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-41, an 
act to amend the statute law in relation to veterans' benefits, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour for me to address Bill C-41, an act to amend the statute 
law in relation to veterans' benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to provide the House with some background 
information. 
This bill proposes to provide benefits for civilian groups that 
served Canada overseas, such as the Canadian Red Cross, St. 
John Ambulance, the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit, the 
Corps of Canadian Firefighters and other organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to allow Canadian forces members to receive 
disability benefits while still serving their country, thereby 
ensuring equality with those whose disabilities arose in special 
duty area service and reserve force service. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to state at the outset that there may be some 
issues we wish to pursue in committee.  Some of these have been 
mentioned already by previous speakers, for example, section 46 
concerning the RCMP and also the concern of the legions with 
respect to retroactivity.  While we may want to pursue these in 
committee, the New Democratic Party at this point stands in 
support of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have some skepticism.  My skepticism does not arise from 
the words in the legislation, but from the government's intent on 
following through with its commitment to Canada's veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, almost half of 
the claims received from merchant mariners are still waiting to 
be processed.  These Canadians risked life and limb during the 
war to deliver fuel, food, goods and people, and were under 
attack from German submarines, facing casualty and, all too 
often, death. Every month more of these brave members of our 
communities succumb to illness and old age. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that merchant mariners are dying at the 
rate of about 12 per month.  The Department of Veterans Affairs 
reportedly has 45 people working on these claims.  Clearly, 
staffing levels should be increased to meet the demand created by 
merchant mariners' claims.  The decision not to hire more staff 
likely translates into a decision to let more merchant mariners 
die without seeing their claims processed and justice done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if the government wishes Bill C-41 to be taken 
seriously by the people who would be affected by the bill, it 
should state here now that it is committed to ensuring that all 
merchant mariners entitled to compensation will receive their 
full benefits and that the government will not turn its back on 
these merchant mariners after the first payments have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation sets out to extend veterans benefits to a number 
of civilian groups with overseas service and would allow all 
serving members of the Canadian armed forces who suffer a service 
related disability to receive disability pensions while serving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the New Democratic Party representative on the all party 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, I am 
pleased to see that the government is responding to issues raised 
by our committee in a positive way.  Allowing the serving members 
of the forces who qualify for disability pensions to receive 
these disability pensions while serving does indeed begin to 
address issues relating to the quality of life of Canadian forces 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am pleased to see that the government is taking some 
steps toward addressing the issues raised by the all party 
standing committee, I strongly suggest that the government could 
be doing much more to address broader issues relating to working 
and living conditions for our troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Military personnel who live on bases in single quarters or 
in permanent married quarters must contend with old and 
deteriorating accommodations that are among the worst to be found 
in this country.  The quarters in some regions were called 
dilapidated by the committee, and that was being very generous. 
From leaky roofs to cramped, old, deteriorating spaces, Canada's 
forces personnel deserve much better from the country they so 
admirably served, and in particular from the Liberal government 
that is responsible for these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian forces accommodation policy cites the need for well 
maintained quarters, respecting dignity, privacy, safety and 
security.  The Liberal government's policy is “tough luck, you 
lose”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government had cash on hand to spend $15 million 
building a brand new armoury in Shawinigan which, by a great 
coincidence, happens to be in the Prime Minister's own riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the legislation sets out to ensure serving 
forces personnel may receive disability pensions while still 
serving.  In other words, troops serving Canadians through 
assisting with crises, like the great ice storm of 1998, fighting 
floods on the Red River or working as peacekeepers in Bosnia, 
would be able to collect a veterans affairs disability pension 
while continuing to serve the country.  This will ensure equity 
with members whose disabilities arose in special duty areas and 
reserve force service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the legislation as it would extend veterans benefits 
to certain civilian groups who served overseas in close support 
of the war effort.  This would include groups such as the 
Canadian Red Cross, St. John Ambulance, Newfoundland Overseas 
Foresters, Canadian firefighters, pilots who ferried across the 
Atlantic and other groups who assisted the military overseas. 
This move will provide these individuals with greater access to 
Veterans Affairs Canada income support, disability pensions and 
additional health care benefits, including the veterans 
independence program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overseas crew of the Ferry Command assisted the war effort 
by ferrying military aircraft across the Atlantic Ocean from 
North America.  During the second world war, some 340 Canadian 
and Newfoundland civilian pilots and aircrew were under contract 
to deliver aircraft from North America to Britain and elsewhere. 
The members of the Ferry Command, who today number approximately 
100 people, have never had access to veterans programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit assisted the war effort 
by cutting timber in Scotland, which was then predominantly used 
in British coal mining operations.  Britain quickly realized the 
increased production of coal was a strategic imperative to fuel 
the war effort and thus the immediate need for experienced 
loggers to produce timber for mining was paramount.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the war some 3,680 Newfoundlanders served in 
the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit although many later 
transferred to the British armed forces or served with the 
British Home Guard.  There are about 1,000 members alive today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada was negotiating the terms of union several years 
after the war it was agreed that Newfoundland armed forces 
members would be eligible for veterans benefits from Canada but 
members of the forestry unit were not included in that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second world war the Canadian Corps of 
Firefighters served in the United Kingdom.  It served the war 
effort by fighting fires in Britain that were created by the 
dreaded blitz. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also during the war overseas welfare workers, which included 
members of the Canadian Red Cross and St. John Ambulance 
served overseas in support of the injured.  They have had basic 
access to income tested veterans programs but limited or no 
access to pensions for a service related disability and no access 
to the veterans independence program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more important aspects of the bill is working to 
ensure equity of access to services and benefits to all Canadian 
forces members regardless of whether the injury occurred in 
Canada or in a foreign deployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time Canadian forces members can only receive a 
Veterans Affairs Canada disability pension for a service related 
disability if the disability occurred in or resulted from service 
in a special duty area such as a peacekeeping mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those Canadian forces members who suffer a service related 
disability while fighting a flood in Canada, for example, their 
disability can be assessed and their entitlement to a disability 
pension may be agreed upon while they are still serving. However, 
no Veterans Affairs Canada disability pension can begin to be 
paid until after they have left the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Bill C-41 would remove this inequity and allow 
all Canadian forces members with a related disability to receive 
a Veterans Affairs Canada disability pension upon application 
regardless of where the injury occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the legions 
in my riding of Halifax West for their work not only in support 
of veterans but also in terms of the incredibly positive role 
they play in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attended many events hosted by these legions.  I continue 
to be struck not only by their camaraderie but also by their 
social conscience and community support.  The legions in my area 
have sponsored seniors dinners at Christmastime.  When we go to 
those dinners and see the joy on the faces of those seniors, we 
realize how much these veterans are giving back even yet to their 
communities in terms of supporting our seniors and helping to 
bring some joy and happiness into their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attended special awards nights where legions honour 
members who have served for a long time within their 
organizations.  It is important that we honour people while they 
are still alive.  Far too often people are spoken of after they 
have gone.  It is nice when we take the time to honour people 
while they can still appreciate receiving that honour for the 
service they are rendering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also gone to events in the Camp Hill hospital in Halifax 
where legion members go at Christmastime and visit with seniors 
and people who live in those residences.  They take not only 
material gifts but also the gifts of love and compassion.  The 
appreciation is reflected in the faces of the people who reside 
in that facility when someone comes around and wishes them a 
merry Christmas and a happy new year and shows some interest and 
concern in their state of well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a cousin who is a veteran.  He unfortunately suffered a 
stroke many years ago so he is not able to speak.  He recognizes 
me and has a wonderful smile on his face when I go to visit him. 
The legion from Whites Lake quite often takes the residents from 
Camp Hill out to its headquarters to a special event for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one occasion when my cousin was there a family with a small 
infant allowed him to hold the baby. Just seeing the look on his 
face, the smile, the sense of contentment and happiness at 
holding that young child, showed that even though he was disabled 
by a stroke he still had a certain compassion and a certain 
sense of well-being. His relationship with that infant was 
something that one had to be there to experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tells us again how important veterans are to our community 
and what they give back to our community.  Even those who may 
appear to have a disability are still able to give and to 
appreciate love and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the following legions in my area for their ongoing work: 
The Beford Royal Canadian Legion Branch No. 95, Lakeside Royal 
Canadian Legion Branch No. 156, Spryfield Royal Canadian Legion 
Branch No. 152, St. Margarets Bay Royal Canadian Legion Branch 
No. 116, and Whites Lake Royal Canadian Legion Branch No. 153.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to have it recorded in the House of Commons that these 
legions provide an outstanding service to their communities and 
for this we thank them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we stand in support of this legislation, the point I want to 
leave is that anything we can do to advance the cause of equity, 
fairness and justice for veterans who served our country so well 
we should be glad to do.  It is for this reason that the NDP is 
standing in support of this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-41 
on behalf of the member for Saint John, our veterans affairs 
critic who has certainly done yeoman service on behalf of 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure she takes a personal interest in every veteran in the 
country.  If veterans fall somewhere and hurt themselves, I often 
think she feels the pain because she is so much involved with 
them and so concerned about their welfare.  In fact she will drop 
any issue she is working on if a veteran's issue comes up.  She 
will deal with it first as a priority item. That is a very 
commendable approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking we support Bill C-41 for all the good things 
it proposes to do, but we do it with reservation because of the 
problems that are already in the system which are not being 
addressed or not being resolved.  We would like to see those 
problems addressed first before we add additional 
responsibilities for the department and add new obligations for 
very lean resources that are not available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament I am sure we all deal with veterans 
affairs issues.  Certainly in my area I deal with veterans on a 
day to day basis.  Veterans have all kinds of challenges and all 
kinds of problems.  In the run of a day if I have nine 
appointments usually three of them will be Canada pension plan, 
three might be Revenue Canada, but there will be three with 
regard to veterans affairs.  They are very similar.  They are 
almost all the same.  They run along the same lines of a few 
subjects.  It is a repeat event on every visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The veterans independence program, the VIP program, is designed 
to make the quality of life a little better for veteran.  It has 
a very low threshold of income before one is disqualified from 
access to VIP.  That is a problem we have in our area.  Many 
veterans who really need the service, just to improve their 
quality of life a bit, are denied access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also access to pensions for disabilities is an ongoing problem. 
It is an involved procedure that seems to be dragged out for long 
periods of time and causes more stress and grief for already 
disabled veterans.  Part of the problem is that medical records 
in the military are not complete.  Often a veteran has a problem. 
Everyone knows of it, but there is no proof in his or her medical 
records.  When there is no proof it is extremely difficult to 
convince the Department of Veterans Affairs to acknowledge the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from veterans who served overseas but there was no 
record of that service, even though everyone knew they had been 
there.  I have heard from veterans who served in Atlantic waters 
but still there is no record of it and they were unable to prove 
they had that service even though their colleagues would 
acknowledge it and back them up.  The benefit of doubt clause 
sounds good but sometimes it seems that the benefit of the doubt 
is not given to veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also there is access to the merchant navy package which passed 
in February 2000.  This was something for which the member for 
Saint John fought long and hard to try to access.  We were all 
very pleased when it came through, but we understand only half 
the applications for this program have been addressed.  There are 
a lot of problems in qualifying.  Half the applications are not 
even processed.  Of the half that are processed some have 
received some money but none have received all the money that has 
been talked about and promised to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day my office receives calls asking when they will get 
money from the merchant navy program or when they will get the 
balance. 
There seem to be no answers to these questions.  That in itself 
is frustrating and creates more stress for veterans, none of whom 
are very young.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises a question.  If the resources are not there to 
address the program instituted in February of this year, how can 
we add new programs when we know the resources will not be 
available to deal with them?  The program is good but the 
resources are weak.  That is the problem.  There is no point in 
having the programs if the department and the minister do not 
have access to the funding.  Certainly they do not have the 
access to funding to deal with the current programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I mentioned earlier was the VIP program.  I am 
certainly glad to see all the important ministers in the House 
today.  I am certainly pleased to see the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs in particular.  I would like to make him aware of an 
initiative taken by branch No. 10 of the legion from Amherst, a 
group led by Pastor Harold Higgins which included Russell Clark, 
Harold Ettinger and Peter Lynd.  They developed a motion that was 
taken to Atlantic command of the legion and then went to dominion 
command.  It was passed all the way through the system.  It was 
to make it easier for veterans to access VIP.  This is a good 
program.  It does not cost a lot of money and it increases the 
quality of life of veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most veterans are disqualified because the program is income 
tested at a very low threshold.  We would like to see the 
threshold increased so that veterans can earn a little money, 
have a little income and still access the VIP program.  It is not 
an expensive program, but it is a good program and it should be 
expanded to all veterans.  Many people think it should include 
all veterans.  At least the threshold should be changed to allow 
more veterans to participate in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion went all the way through dominion command and across 
the country to almost every legion in Canada.  They all had a say 
in it.  It started in branch No. 10 at Amherst.  I am proud to be 
associated with that legion.  I hope the minister will take note 
and see if he can access the motion and approve it, as I know he 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very frustrating to be approached by veterans as a member 
of parliament.  We know what they have done.  We know the 
sacrifices they have made.  In some cases they have visible 
disabilities.  In some cases we cannot see the disabilities but 
we know they have them.  I can think of several situations that 
are very trying.  These people cannot access pensions because the 
appeal board or whoever says there is no proof that the injury 
was incurred while in service.  There is no proof how it 
happened.  There are no records in the files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, all their colleagues and the veterans involved know.  I 
find it very frustrating to deal with those situations.  It is 
not their fault the records are not complete.  It is not their 
fault the information and the backup are not there.  It makes it 
extremely difficult for them to access these programs.  I know of 
some veterans personally and it is awful to deal with them 
because we know we cannot arrive at the right solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is some indication that the veteran is qualified for 
the pension and some information that says he may not be 
qualified, the veteran is supposed to get the benefit of the 
doubt.  I find that they do not get the benefit of the doubt.  I 
would like the minister to make note of that if he would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill C-41.  We are really pleased that the government 
will recognize the people involved in these conflicts even though 
they were not directly in the military.  These civilians were 
involved in all kinds of duties and activities which provided 
support and help to our military people who actually carried arms 
and were involved in the conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also pleased that Canadian forces members who are still 
in the service will now be recognized if they have a disability 
that was incurred while in service.  That is most appropriate. It 
recognizes the contribution they made to our country and to the 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support the bill we are a little skeptical because of 
the history and the track record of the merchant navy process. 
That has not gone as well as expected.  I understand they have 
had far more applications than their homework had indicated they 
would have and this has created a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that there are merchant navy veterans who 
feel they are entitled to this program and are not able to access 
it.  We hope that this does not happen with the new programs that 
are included in the bill. 
It is one thing to have the program but we have to have the 
people, the resources and the funding to back them up.  Otherwise 
all it does is create more frustration and more difficulty for 
veterans rather than help them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the member for Saint John, our veterans affairs 
critic, we are pleased to support Bill C-41.  We do hope that the 
minister has the support of the finance minister to put the 
resources and people in place to support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last speaker mentioned the involvement of the legions in his 
riding.  My riding has 17 legions and every single one is active 
as a community organization.  They are great organizations which 
provide all kinds of things like meals on wheels and help to 
seniors.  They provide money for people who have disabilities who 
are not involved with the military at all. Every single legion in 
my riding performs an important service to the community.  I 
would like to acknowledge them as the last member did because 
they are often not recognized for their contributions to the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have watched the minister take notes with every word I said 
and I am sure he will respond to them exactly as I asked. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I too am very pleased to join my colleagues, the Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, the opposition critics and others to speak in 
support of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an omnibus bill and by definition is quite detailed on 
the various pieces of veterans legislation that it updates.  It 
is not our purpose today to debate the intricate details. I am 
sure that will be handled well enough by the committee. Today 
perhaps is the day to agree to the principles contained in the 
major sections of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the extension of benefits to civilian groups who 
performed wartime overseas service.  I hope this is not presuming 
too much on my part but I dare say that aside from the reference 
to the Red Cross, most of us do not know of the services 
performed by other civilian groups such as the Newfoundland 
foresters, Canadian firefighters or Ferry Command, and if we have 
heard of them, we do not necessarily associate these groups with 
the provision of veterans benefits.  Yet when we look closer at 
what they did, their contribution was monumental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit assisted the war effort 
by cutting timber in Scotland which was predominantly used in 
British coal mining operations.  The British were in dire need of 
increased production since coal was a desperately needed fuel. 
Many of the 3,600 Newfoundlanders who served with the forestry 
unit would later join the British armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Corps of Firefighters represent another hidden 
story of service and sacrifice.  They were called on to help 
fight the dreadful fires created by the blitz on London and other 
British cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the overseas welfare workers which included the 
Canadian Red Cross and St. John Ambulance who served as welfare 
workers overseas in support of the injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And finally there are the overseas air crews of Ferry Command 
who assisted the war effort by ferrying military aircraft across 
the Atlantic from North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women of these civilian units, like their military 
counterparts, served their nation and the allied cause with duty 
and dedication.  Like their military comrades from the second 
world war their numbers are quickly fading with the passing of 
the years. It does not seem too much to ask for easier access to 
disability and allowance benefits and through regulatory change 
to health care benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of clause 46 of the bill has come up.  It was 
mentioned by the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  It 
relates to the benefits enjoyed by members of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking with the minister on this issue, it would appear as 
though there may have been an unfortunate oversight with respect 
to that clause appearing in the bill. I know it is the minister's 
desire to have that clause removed. I am prepared to undertake to 
the House to introduce an amendment to that effect to deal with 
the concerns that have been raised by members, and which exist as 
well on the government side, to have that issue dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning briefly to currently serving military personnel, the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs has 
studied the modern day problems of the regular forces. 
I have been a member of the committee since the last election and 
was pleased to work with colleagues from every party in the House 
who were part of the quality of life study. Each of us came away 
from that study feeling as though we had made a contribution and 
a difference in the lives of the men and women serving in the 
Canadian forces.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has taken the recommendations of the committee to 
heart and has acted in concert with DND to take a more 
comprehensive approach to dealing with injured or disabled 
clients.  For its part, DND has established five regional 
operational trauma, stress and support centres located near major 
military bases across the nation.  Veterans affairs clients have 
access to DND's post-deployment regional health centres for 
clinical evaluation and assessment purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the department continues to deploy its personnel to 
bases to deliver briefings on our services and benefits to 
Canadian forces members across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where veterans affairs can act to improve access to veterans 
benefits without changes to the legislation, it is in fact doing 
so.  Where there is a need for legislation of course is in having 
a level playing field for all members of the armed forces 
wherever they serve at home or abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members have heard, this bill fills that gap by allowing 
all Canadian forces to have equal access to disability pensions 
and related health care benefits regardless of whether the injury 
occurred in a special duty area. I know hon. members will have no 
difficulty whatsoever supporting the provisions of the 
legislation in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor do I imagine will members opposite have any difficulty 
supporting the removal of longstanding irritants that veterans 
have had with current veteran legislation, irritants such as the 
handling of mistaken overpayments, the correction of the negative 
consequences of lump sum payments and their effect on war 
veterans allowance, and the issue of income testing and access to 
health care. The changes proposed by Bill C-41 will remove those 
irritants. As a result veterans will feel more secure that their 
benefits will continue unimpeded by bureaucratic rules and 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the department prides itself on is the front 
line service it gives to veterans at its offices across the 
nation.  Staff in the field have developed long term 
relationships with veterans, some of them spanning the decades. 
They realize that many of their aging clients can have difficulty 
navigating the complex and complicated rules and regulations, not 
only as they exist within veterans affairs but with other federal 
departments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has taken on a full service profile when a 
veteran walks in the door.  Put simply, this client centred 
approach makes a commitment to design, implement and maintain 
services from the client's point of view, not from the point of 
view of the bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Veterans Affairs Canada has been a leader in client centred 
service delivery.  At its best, this type of service means 
cutting red tape and communicating in plain language.  It means 
making sure that our veterans and all other clients who require 
our services never feel that they have knocked on the wrong door 
when looking for our help.  Veterans affairs has served clients 
in this manner for decades now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will notice provisions in Bill C-41 which ensure that 
the department can continue to render this type of front line 
service.  The provisions have been carefully worded in order to 
balance service for our increasingly aging clients with their 
privacy rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally there are several more specific measures, some of which 
we have already heard about.  They include for instance: 
permitting both veteran disability pensioners who are married or 
living common law to receive the married rate; extending 
remission authority to all types of overpayments of veterans 
benefits; reformulating the provisions governing the assessment 
of outside disability benefits, such as dealing with workers 
compensation or court awarded damages for personal injury; and 
providing for a one year continuation of a deceased veteran's 
pension to the guardian of the veteran's surviving children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures included are: consolidating the provisions 
relating to service and special duty areas as well as Korean war 
service directly into the pension act; improving and clarifying 
the exchange and use of client information, both internally and 
with other departments; insulating client information from having 
to be disclosed by public servants in non-criminal legal 
proceedings; reformulating the provisions governing the amount of 
income support under the War Veterans Allowance Act when income 
has declined since the previous year; allowing compassionate 
awards to be continued to survivors without the necessity of a 
high level readjudication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also technical housekeeping changes to clarify 
regulation making authorities, to improve the wording, to ensure 
the use of gender inclusive language, to correct cross 
references, and to remove obsolete acts and provisions.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite a list.  It is not called an omnibus bill without 
good reason.  Some of the changes are pretty technical and they 
can be discussed at length during the committee.  As a committee 
member, I certainly look forward to that discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we keep our eye on the ball we see three distinct parts to 
the legislation.  It provides benefits to previously overlooked 
civilian groups who provided service to the war effort.  It 
improves access to disability pensions for currently serving 
Canadian forces members so that the playing field is level for 
everyone.  It makes housekeeping changes that will remove 
irritants for veterans and clean up or remove outdated parts of 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make reference to the issue of the merchant navy 
special benefit which has been raised by a number of members and 
provide some up to date information with respect to the 
processing of those claims.  That issue has certainly been raised 
in the local media around Ottawa and it is essential that members 
have the most up to date information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the current status of the merchant navy special benefit. 
As of the July 31 deadline for applications, 13,928 applications 
had been received.  Sixty per cent of those have been processed. 
More than 4,300 cheques totalling approximately $31 million had 
been issued by September 14, 2000.  The Government of Canada had 
earmarked $50 million for the merchant navy veterans special 
benefit and Veterans Affairs Canada is currently doing a 
statistical sample of the remaining applications in order to 
project the total cost of the benefit.  This information should 
be available early in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the early weeks of August 2000, departmental officials 
consulted with five veterans organizations that represent the 
interests of merchant navy veterans.  The purpose of the 
consultations was to provide information to the organizations 
about the status of processing applications and to seek their 
advice and input on policy issues that had been previously 
raised, including dual service in the military, review and appeal 
process and the requirement for payment of war risk bonus. The 
discussions were productive and the veterans organizations 
continue to provide constructive input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of that to say that the government is certainly very, very 
concerned about the status of veterans in Canada.  I for one, 
working with the defence and veterans affairs committee, have 
sensed a very non-political approach to this by members of the 
committee.  I find it unfortunate personally that some media 
people have decided to try to turn this into something of a 
political football. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as far as Bill C-41 is concerned, it has my full 
and unqualified support.  With some changes I believe that the 
committee can make it an even better bill to ensure that our 
veterans receive the very best of benefits and care from the 
Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-321, an act to amend the criminal code to provide for the 
forfeiture of property relating to child pornography crimes, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be here today to 
lead off the first hour of debate on the second reading of Bill 
C-321.  This is my first private members' bill.  For those 
members who do not have a copy of the bill in front of them, 
C-321 is an amendment to section 163.1 of the criminal code, 
which would allow a court that convicts a person of an offence 
under the provisions relating to child pornography to order the 
forfeiture of anything by means of which or in relation to which 
the offence was committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get too carried away, there are a number of people I 
want to acknowledge and thank for their hard work in making the 
bill happen.  This is in no particular order, but I wish to thank 
Detective Inspector Bob Matthews who heads up Canada's lead 
agency in the fight against child pornography, the 16 member 
Ontario Provincial Police Child Pornography Unit, Project P. 
Detective Inspector Matthews is a widely respected voice in the 
debate between free speech advocates and law enforcement.  He is 
one of Canada's top law enforcement agents in the field of child 
pornography investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early 1999 my office was researching the contentious issue of 
child pornography and controls on the Internet.  During the 
course of the research my assistant contacted Mr. Matthews and 
asked him what we could do as parliamentarians to assist police 
in their fight against the sexual exploitation of children.  This 
bill resulted from that discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Detective Inspector Matthews “Thank you very much, sir, for 
giving me this opportunity to assist law enforcement agents in 
their efforts against child pornography.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second person I want to thank is Detective Noreen Waters of 
the Organized Crime Agency of British Columbia. Detective Waters 
has been a child pornography investigator for eight years and was 
part of the team that brought in the now infamous John Robin 
Sharpe.  She has been an enthusiastic supporter of our bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank Sergeant Randy Brennan of the 
Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police High Tech Unit.  Sergeant Brennan 
has been involved in many successful child pornography 
investigations and is a valuable source of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to recognize Mr. Steve Sullivan, the hardworking 
president and CEO of the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of 
Crime.  Steve has been a tireless advocate of victims' rights and 
has worked with members of parliament to change the justice 
system to place the rights of victims above criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go on, I also want to thank all of my staff who helped 
me work on this, especially Klaas Deemter, my executive assistant 
here in Ottawa, who has spent many hours on this bill. He is a 
graduate of the University of Lethbridge in my home riding, one 
of the best universities in Canada.  I also want to thank my 
family and some of my friends who have supported me through all 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on.  Those people and many other law enforcement 
officers, victims' advocates, federal parliamentarians, 
provincial justice ministers and Canadians across the country, 
particularly in my riding, have contacted me and offered their 
support.  To these concerned Canadians I say “Thank you and keep 
up that good work.  Thank you for fighting to protect children 
because today more than ever they need our help”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to broaden the theme of my speech today to discuss the 
challenges of controlling child pornography in today's Internet 
age.  In my speech I hope to expose the depth of the problem 
facing policy makers and law enforcement.  I also wish to share 
with members and viewers some of the ideas that I have to tackle 
these challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the root of these challenges lies the Hydra-like nature of the 
Internet.  In its humble beginnings as a forum for academia and 
the military, the Internet was boring and difficult to navigate. 
It contained only dry text, no images or flashy graphics. 
However, the creation of graphical interface known as the world 
wide web in 1993 has created a surge in popularity unlike 
anything seen before.  From little more than 100 sites in 1993, 
the web has grown to the point where some industry experts 
estimate that over 800 million web pages exist today, with some 
160,000 pages being added each and every month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet has revolutionized communications.  Most of us in 
the House did not even know what e-mail was a few years ago, but 
today our children and our grandchildren are growing up having 
never known anything but instantaneous communication as developed 
through the Internet. 
Businesses, organizations, government agencies and individuals 
have seized on this technology, setting up websites and changing 
how we interact with each other.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with increased usage comes increased abuse. In his 
report “Innocence Exploited:  Child Pornography in the 
Electronic Age”, prepared for the Canadian Police College, 
Winnipeg Professor Doug Skoog estimates that there are at least one 
million sexually explicit images of children on the Internet.  It 
is a horrible thing to even think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>OCABC Detective Waters shared with me recent stats which 
estimate that 53% of Internet traffic is concerned with sexually 
explicit material.  Calgary Detective Butch Dickens of the vice 
unit had this to say about child pornography on the Internet in a 
newspaper article last year “A year ago, we probably only got 
one phone call a month about it.  Now, on average, we get four a 
day”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the advent of the world wide web, child pornography 
detectives around the world could say with confidence that they 
were winning the war against child pornography.  The old methods 
of creation and distribution were tremendously risky.  Instead of 
safely and anonymously zipping images down the fibre optic 
pipelines of the Internet, carefully arranged meetings, secret 
mailing lists and postal drops placed pedophiles at extreme risk 
of arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that has all changed.  Detective Inspector Bob Matthews 
states “The Internet has become almost the perfect vehicle for 
pedophiles to distribute child pornography, the reason being that 
at the stroke of a key, anyone can send large volumes of 
information from one country to another without being detected by 
authorities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child abusers and pedophiles are rapidly creating a no holds 
barred red light district on the web where they can distribute 
vast quantities of pornography, often extremely explicit and 
violent, to the point of murder, and organize with other 
like-minded individuals.  The anonymity offered by the Internet 
allows child molesters to stalk their victims in their homes, 
schools and libraries without ever being physically present in 
any of those places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are a few of the techniques that they employ to 
exploit children.  Chatting online in Internet chat rooms where 
users can talk to each other by keyboard provides plentiful 
hunting grounds where child pornographers can stalk their young 
victims.  With minimal effort and nominal expense, they can 
physically track down their victims regardless of where they 
live.  These chat rooms and the similar Internet relay chat 
channels, IRC, allow for instantaneous messaging in exchange of 
contraband files such as images, videos or text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is sex tourism.  With the increase in the use of 
the Internet for the sex trade and sexual abuse of children, the 
number of websites providing information to travelling pedophiles 
has increased dramatically and the sites are extremely explicit in detail. 
Children in second and third world countries, 
often regarded as little more than property, are routinely 
victimized by jet-setting foreigners who then return to their 
homes to brag about their exploits.  Weak local laws often 
restrict the ability of even honest law enforcement agents to do 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is image morphing.  With a decent computer and a 
little skill, child pornographers can turn almost any picture 
into a pornographic image.  An $80 software program can morph the 
picture of an adult body into a child's, creating the illusion of 
reality, a horrific thought when taken to its conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is real time molestation.  Streaming video, which 
shows live video on the Internet, enables child molesters to 
display their victims in real time to selected members of child 
pornography rings and clubs, even permitting them to respond to 
requests from their viewers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is encryption.  Skilled child pornographers will 
encrypt their messages rendering them unreadable to outsiders. 
Some pornographers even have access to the codes of the former 
KGB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents who were once confident that living in a small town 
insulated them from troubles associated with big cities can no 
longer be unmindful about the security of their children.  With 
the click of a mouse, children in remote areas can be exposed to 
the seamy underside of the Net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In what is becoming an all too often occurrence, cases are being 
publicized where children under the age of 18 are being 
threatened or even molested by someone they met online. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July of this year a 45 year old man from the quiet P.E.I. 
town of Summerside pleaded guilty to a child pornography case.  He 
had secretly videotaped a 14 year old girl whom he had coerced 
into doing a striptease, then broadcasted it live on the Internet 
for viewers in a special interactive online chat room. In same 
month, on the other side of the country, police arrested a 28 
year old Washington man in a line-up for the ferry to leave 
Vancouver Island.  In his van was a 14 year old B.C. girl who he 
had met online.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in March of this year, the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> reported 
that an 18 year old man was arrested and charged with possession 
and distribution of child pornography.  An undercover police 
officer met the man online while the accused was looking for a 
partner in a plot to kidnap, rape and kill a young child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While stats are hard to come by, there is also evidence that 
child pornography, traditionally restricted to bartering, is 
becoming very profitable for some criminals.  A heavily edited 
1998 RCMP report obtained by my colleague for Kootenay—Columbia 
indicates that child pornography from Europe and Asia is flooding 
into B.C. in the wake of the court ruling suspending the ban on 
possession.  The videos and magazines sold for between $50 and 
$200 depending on content.  An arrest by the U.S. customs service 
several years ago broke up a child pornography ring where people 
were making $25,000 a day showing CD-ROMs of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While for pedophiles, child molesters and pornographers the 
Internet is like a dream come true, it has become a nightmare for 
everyone else.  Where once a pedophile may have been able to 
control his sexual urges toward children, the Internet has 
created a situation where temptation lurks around every corner on 
the web.  They seek out other pedophiles as a form of peer 
validation.  This psychological validation leads budding child 
molesters and pornographers to believe that they are not strange 
or different after all and that it is society, with its laws 
declaring sex with children and child pornography to be criminal, 
that is wrong.  The downward spiral into child exploitation 
usually begins with the so-called harmless collection of child 
pornography, progressing to sexually explicit online 
conversations with children and eventually seeking child victims 
online. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically, authorities can only act when the pedophile acts on 
his urges.  Experts report that before he is arrested the 
average child molesting pedophile abuses 35 children.  They will 
share methods and techniques by which to find children and then 
reduce their inhibitions and facilitate seduction.  Along the 
way, many compulsively and systematically save mementoes and 
souvenirs to validate their actions.  This is how child 
pornography is created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But understanding the problem, as difficult as it may be, is 
only half the job.  Problems require solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those concerned about this problem advocate complete 
censorship and regulation of anything that appears online. Others 
lecture that any restrictions on speech are unacceptable and 
prefer to place the responsibility on the users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer, as it always does, lies somewhere in the middle of 
these two opposing viewpoints.  As policy makers, it is our task 
to strike that balance, for we alone have the democratic mandate 
of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after her swearing in as Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court, Madam Justice Beverley McLachlin predicted that the court 
would deal extensively with issues of computer crime.  The court, 
she said, would have to find ways to cope with offences that are 
international in scope, given the breadth of the Internet and 
computer communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong, effective legislation is one way that the impact of 
child pornographers can be reduced.  The supreme court holds in 
its hands the linchpin on which many child pornography cases 
hinge. It must uphold the ban on possession of child pornography 
and its decision on the Sharpe case, which is expected later this 
year. Without possession, police are stripped of their most 
effective tool and are powerless to stop many cases of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, in the wake of the R v Butler decision, parliament 
passed Bill C-128 which criminalized all aspects of child 
pornography, including the creation, distribution and 
importation, as well as simple possession of such material. 
Although the constitutionality of the provision criminalizing 
possession is currently under review, section 163.1 is considered 
among the strongest anti-child pornography legislation in the 
world, something Canada can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, a provision ordering forfeiture was omitted. 
This omission can be best described as an oversight when one 
considers that forfeiture exists in 55 different federal statutes 
and in various places in the criminal code, clearly demonstrating 
that the justice system is not philosophically opposed to such 
penalties for criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To correct this omission in the law, I introduced Bill C-321, 
which would give courts the authority to order forfeiture and 
would give police an extra weapon in their fight against child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently forfeiture of equipment in the context of a child 
pornography offence is handled differently across the country. In 
Ontario, the equipment is often forfeited as part of a bartering 
between the defence and the prosecution.  In British Columbia, 
the prosecutors rarely ask for equipment to be forfeited.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To see the danger in this patchwork practice, a little insight is 
required into how charges under section 163.1 of the criminal 
code are dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hardly a worse crime than the 
sexual victimization of our children and perpetrating the sexual 
victimization of children is the most insidious purpose of child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the strong public condemnation of child pornography, many 
offenders will do anything to keep their names out of the public 
domain, often eagerly agreeing to plea bargains resulting in 
reduced sentences and often with no jail time.  This creates a 
situation where the case law on the section is scant because the 
courts have had few opportunities to comment on it.  More 
dangerously, these plea bargains often allow the offender to 
return to the same environment in which he lost control of his 
pedophiliac urges in the first place.  Returning him to this 
environment with all his equipment intact is a temptation that 
could prove too strong to resist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By ordering forfeiture the risk of recidivism can be lowered. 
Because a child pornography addiction is fueled by psychological 
problems and not profit, many offenders have limited means. 
Indeed, their compulsion likely creates financial hardship as the 
individual spends much of his free time and money in the pursuit 
of his fantasy.  Confiscating several thousand dollars worth of 
computer equipment and perhaps even a vehicle or something more 
substantial will create a financial barrier to re-offending.  Of 
course I understand that is only money and does not address the 
root cause of the problem, but it is one way that we can slow down 
traffic in this horrific crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology of our rapidly changing world continues to create 
legislative challenges for us here in parliament.  Expanding the 
legislation, filling in the holes, adapting to change, as we are 
trying to do, is necessary because criminals do not stand still 
and neither should we. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-321 is only one example of an amendment to section 
163.1.  Some have suggested that the encryption of child 
pornography be treated the same way as using a firearm to commit 
an offence is.  Others are concerned that sound files are not 
restricted under section 163.1.  Still others advocate the 
creation of a national task force, similar to those in the United 
States, staffed with federal, provincial and local police 
officers and given an aggressive mandate to stamp out child 
pornography in Canada.  Just last week the federal justice 
minister met with her colleagues and proposed to criminalize the 
luring of children for the purposes of sexual exploitation via 
the Internet.  I commend her for that.  All of these are measures 
are things that I and, I am sure Canadians are strongly 
supportive of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 10 or 15 minutes we have heard about 
the dangers of the Internet.  Some of the members are no doubt 
concerned about the safety of their loved ones.  I would be glad 
to share some of the steps we can take to help protect our 
children from predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was out of my own concern for the safety of Canadian children 
that I took this initiative.  We researched the issue of child 
pornography on the Internet and tabled this bill.  I acknowledge 
that my bill may not be written in the most precise legal 
terminology and I am open to any improvement to it.  I took on 
the challenge of tabling a private member's bill as a justice 
themed bill knowing that the odds are stacked against my success, 
but I did it because I believe in the spirit of my bill.  I could 
not stand by without doing something to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members return to their families this weekend, relax and 
enjoy their company.  I urge all members to take some time to 
think of the difference, even if it is just a small difference, 
that my bill could make in the fight against child pornography. 
Let us think of the law enforcement agents who have made it their 
life's work to make our country safe from the perversions of 
these child molesters.  Let us think of the victims of these 
cold-blooded criminals and help me make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is in the fourth year of its mandate and the next 
election could come at any time.  It seems to be getting closer 
and closer but nobody is telling us.  As the House knows, when an 
election is called all legislation is dropped from the order 
paper no matter what stage it is at and no matter how 
commendable. Bearing this in mind, I urge the government, as 
part of its commitment to criminalizing the luring of children 
over the Internet for the purposes of sexual exploitation, to 
acknowledge that not all good ideas come from its side and adopt 
the forfeiture provisions contained in my bill.  Let us give the 
children of Canada the maximum protection allowable under the 
law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our children are the most vulnerable members of our society and 
we must do all that we can to protect our children from harm.  No 
one will deny that child pornography seriously harms children.  I 
believe it does so in at least two ways.  It creates a permanent 
record of the sexual abuse of children and perpetuates the 
message that children are appropriate sexual objects.  Indeed, 
they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child pornography was specifically prohibited by amendment to 
the criminal code, enacted in 1993.  This amendment, which is now 
subsection 163.1 of the criminal code, created new offences for 
the importation, distribution, sale, production and simple 
possession of child pornography.  All these offences carry a 
greater penalty than the offences prohibiting obscene materials 
involving adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These criminal code provisions against child pornography take on 
a greater importance with the rapidly expanding use of the 
Internet.  It is now easier to communicate valuable information 
and carry on discussions on all kinds of subjects with people who 
share our interests.  Unfortunately it also makes it easier to 
disseminate and collect images of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the child pornography provisions is primarily to 
protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation, but also to 
send a clear message that it is not appropriate to have sex with 
children or to portray them as sexual objects.  I know that 
Canadians are greatly supportive of this legislation prohibiting 
child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-321 is very much in line with the purpose 
of the child pornography provisions since its purpose is to 
create an additional deterrent to child pornography.  It would 
add to the sentence currently available under the criminal code a 
financial penalty that would result from a forfeiture to the 
crown of all tools and instruments that have been used in the 
commission of the offence.  Bill C-321 would provide the judge 
with discretion to forfeit anything “by means of or in 
relation to which” a child pornography offence was committed. 
I wholeheartedly support this purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have some questions on the working of the provisions 
as drafted.  I am particularly concerned that the bill might 
unnecessarily penalize individuals who have nothing to do with 
the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be the case of an employee who uses the Internet during 
his lunch hour to download child pornography images on an office 
computer.  He might also transmit these images to others; to do 
so, he would use the computer provided by his employer for 
conducting business for which he is employed.  He would also use 
it to access and distribute child pornography without the 
knowledge of his employer and, of course, without his consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offence would clearly be committed by means of the computer. 
If the employee was convicted of a child pornography offence, 
the judge could, in addition to sentencing him to imprisonment 
for up to 10 years, order the forfeiture of the computer.  Bill 
C-321 would allow this.  In this case the forfeiture would 
penalize the employer and not the employee who committed the 
offence.  The person penalized would be an innocent third party 
and not the person guilty of the offence.  This is a 
consideration that we should keep in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see another problem in relation to forfeiture of 
“anything by means of which the offence was committed”.  In 
order to receive and transmit on the Internet one needs a server 
or a router, which is typically owned by a service provider. 
Could the server be forfeited?  I do not see anything in the bill 
that would prevent it.  Other criminal code provisions that would 
allow forfeiture of the tools used in the commission of an 
offence specifically exempt public communications facilities and 
equipment from forfeiture.  That is not the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the purpose of this bill, but I have concerns with its 
practical implications.  This bill may require further 
consideration and amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak today at second reading of Bill C-321, an 
act to amend the criminal code to provide for the forfeiture of 
property relating to child pornography crimes.  This bill, 
introduced by the member for Lethbridge, is votable, and the 
Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the amendment to the criminal 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill consists of a single clause, which I will read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. The Criminal Code is amended by adding the following after 
section 163.1: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>163.2 Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection 
163.1(2), (3) or (4), the court that convicts the person may, in 
addition to any other punishment imposed on the person, order 
that anything by means of which or in relation to which the 
offence was committed be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of 
the province in which the person is convicted, for disposal as 
the Attorney General may direct. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is a bit obscure for the average person, I will 
simplify.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this amendment to the criminal code is to make it 
possible to confiscate, by court order, and following a 
conviction, any material that has been used to commit a child 
pornography offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to properly take in the ramifications of the bill 
introduced by the member for Lethbridge, it is important first 
of all to have a thorough understanding of the implications of 
the offences listed under section 163.1, which have to do with 
the making, distribution or sale, and possession of child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1993, the criminal code contained no specific 
provisions relating to child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, as the result of the Butler decision, parliament passed 
Bill C-128, an act to amend the criminal code and the customs 
tariff (child pornography and corrupting morals).  Its aim was 
to amend the criminal code to expressly prohibit child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Butler decision, which was given in 1992, the supreme 
court had to decide on the constitutionality of the definition 
of obscenity as set out in section 163(8) of the criminal code. 
The court stated that pornography describing sexual acts 
involving children constituted the undue exploitation of sex, 
and accordingly the production and distribution of this type 
of pornography were prohibited by the provisions of the criminal 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although freedom of expression guaranteed under section 2(<I>b</I>) of 
the charter of rights and freedoms—fundamental freedoms such as 
the freedoms of thought, belief, opinion and expression, 
including the freedom of the press and other means of 
communication—was infringed upon as far as the supreme court is 
concerned, this infringement is justifiable under the first 
section of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the criminal code made no reference to the offence of 
simple possession of child pornography.  Bill C-128 therefore 
filled this legal void by adding specific provisions to the 
criminal code with respect to child pornography, including a 
definition of it and providing that the distribution, sale, 
production and possession relating to this definition were 
criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In adding the offence of simple possession, the aim of the 
legislator was to dissuade people from undertaking this sort of 
activity and thus further protect children against sexual 
exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in British Columbia, John Sharpe's acquittal—the 
decision drew attention to the urgent and growing problem of 
child pornography—sparked a general outcry right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only was this decision questionable, relating as it did 
pornography with freedom of expression, it also pointed out the 
weakness of the instruments available to the law in seizures of 
pornographic material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sharpe was charged with the offences in subsections 163.1(3) and 
(4) of the Criminal Code for possessing pornographic material 
involving children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this decision, the judge declared the section invalid because 
it infringed section 2(<I>b</I>) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and acquitted John Sharpe accordingly.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Justice Shaw, it was not clearly demonstrated that 
child pornography had direct harmful effects.  He also pointed 
out that freedom of expression is an important value, that an 
individual's personal effects relate to that person's particular 
character and personality and that banning mere possession has 
an impact on a highly intimate and private aspect of a person's 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following on the Sharpe case, a motion relating to child 
pornography was brought before the House. 
That motion, by what was then, Reform Party, called for the 
government to immediately the move to use the notwithstanding clause 
in order to maintain the ban on the simple possession of child 
pornography as set out in subsection 163.1(4), which had been struck 
down by the Sharpe decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reiterating its attachment to the social values condemning child 
pornography, the Bloc Quebecois expressed its conviction that, 
although this issue needed to be addressed, it was premature to 
immediately invoke the notwithstanding clause and that justice 
ought to follow its course to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The 
Bloc Quebecois therefore opposed the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only this past January 18 did the supreme court hear this 
controversial case. 
The supreme court decision, which is about to be released, will 
attract the attention and interest of everyone.  Let us recall 
that the supreme court stipulated in 1992, in Butler, that “The 
overriding objective of s. 163 is not moral disapprobation but 
the avoidance of harm to society, and this is a sufficiently 
pressing and substantial concern to warrant a restriction on 
freedom of expression”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that the justices of the supreme court  will 
rule along the same line in this case, justifying the attack on 
guaranteed charter rights and quashing the British Columbia 
Appeal Court judgment.  The similarity with Butler leads us to 
believe that this will be justified under section one of the 
charter, given the potential of irreparable harm to the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, section 164 of the code provides for the seizure, 
under certain conditions, of pornographic material, but this 
section has a very limited application.  Only copies of a 
publication or copies of a representation or written material 
may be seized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-321 is to make it possible to seize 
everything that was used to commit an offence.  Accordingly, 
under this new legislation, it would be possible to seize such 
things as the computer used to download the pornographic 
publications, the printer, the camera or anything else that made 
it possible to make, distribute, sell or possess the child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are increasing numbers of organized networks for the 
distribution of pornographic material and their activities are 
made easier by the explosion of telecommunications technologies, 
which make access almost universal. 
Anyone, including children, has access, which is why it is 
important to put even more energy than ever into fighting these 
networks and giving the courts the tools they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only must the final product, whether copies of a publication 
or copies of a representation or written material, be seized, 
but so must everything used to produce and distribute this 
pornography.  Only thus can we hope to help destabilize these 
networks and weaken their production capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois pointed out during the debate held in the 
fall of 1999, it is imperative that section 163.1 stand, but 
what is also needed are tools that allow material to be seized, 
for the safety and dignity of our children.  This is precisely 
what—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys,

important to complete a process that has been under way in terms 
of dealing with child pornography.  As he has indicated in his

overlooked, I suspect inadvertently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to recognize that the initiative brought forward by 
the hon. member for Lethbridge was previously brought forward by

think his concerns are inappropriate.  I do not think he actually 
read the bill, because had he read it he would not have said what 
he did in the House of Commons.  My friend from Lethbridge said 
he was open to suggestions and that we could amend the 
legislation if that is what is required if we need to improve it, 
but just to toss it out because somebody has some concern about 
some wording is inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that this bill could penalize 
the employers of those weird people who use the Internet to 
download child pornography while they are at work.  The 
legislation says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection 
163.1(2), (3) or (4), the court that convicts the person may, in 
addition to any other punishment imposed on the person, order 
that anything by means of which or in relation to which the 
offence was committed be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of the 
province— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that it uses the word may.  In other words, the court 
may do this.  No court in its right mind would say that if an 
employee of the House of Commons downloads child pornography the 
computers of the House of Commons will be forfeited.  It is 
insanity.  Give the judge some credit for making a reasonable 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary went on to say that perhaps the 
server could be forfeited.  Imagine any judge saying that because 
a person was using a particular server on their computer while 
they were downloading pornographic pictures of children, the 
server on their computer system would be forfeited.  It is just 
insanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the parliamentary secretary to at least read the 
legislation before he suggests that changes are required and 
notice that the word may is used and not the word shall. I see my 
friend the parliamentary secretary is back in the House of 
Commons.  Perhaps he will have a chance to clarify his error on a 
point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues in the New Democratic Party have been calling for 
this for a number of years.  We will inevitably and undoubtedly 
endorse the bill when it comes up for a vote after another two 
hours of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a personal perspective I have received many 
representations, not only about this legislation but about the 
whole issue before us.  I have had representations from the RCMP 
and other law enforcement agencies, from a variety of churches in 
my constituency, from the legal aid office and women's groups.  I 
have heard from lawyers who see this abuse on a regular basis in 
their courtroom work.  I have heard from a variety of unions, 
from the Kamloops and District Labour Council, from the chamber 
of commerce, from the regional district, from our mayor and 
council in Kamloops, and from a variety of non-profit agencies 
and associations.  Of course many citizens have written to 
members.  I suspect all of us have received a lot of mail on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should endorse this bill enthusiastically.  It should not be 
some serious debate, because who is in favour of child 
pornography?  Obviously no one in the House is.  We are dealing 
with some pretty unusual people to start with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Lethbridge pointed out, this has come to us 
from the Internet.  Internet abuse as he terms it is almost like 
a red light use of the Internet and the world wide web whereby a 
variety of pornography can be seen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect there is hardly anybody in here who has actually used 
a computer who has not come across a pornographic site.  Often 
they show up when we do not expect them.  A person may be 
interested in deer, for example, and may decide to look up 
Bambi.  If the person looks up Bambi, a pornographic site comes 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that kids all over the place are now being confronted 
with pornography by accident, let alone all the people we are 
talking about here, the child predators and people who prey on 
children.  Everyone now has easy access to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the parliamentary secretary to talk to his 
colleagues.  I suspect, from what I have heard on this side of 
the House, that we are supporting this private member's 
initiative.  I would like to think that he and his colleagues in 
the Liberal Party would also support it.  My goodness, what 
better way for the House to do something meaningful than to have 
every political party and the independents getting onside to 
discourage, in every way possible, people from using child 
pornography via the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary has a concern about wording he 
should bring forward an amendment.  That is what these debates 
are all about.  I know he is a thoughtful individual and I would 
encourage him to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the case has been made.  My hon. friend from Lethbridge, 
who pointed out from his research that 53% of all traffic on 
Internet deals with sex in some way or another, opens up some 
pretty interesting questions.  Today we are focusing on the abuse 
of the Internet when it comes to child pornography.  I think we 
need to do everything possible to deal with this, and this 
legislation takes us in that right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Lethbridge also reminded us that this does not 
deal with the root cause, the individuals themselves who, because 
of their physiological and psychological makeup, are people 
who prey on children, who are pedophiles, people who are using 
the national and international sexual chat line to consciously 
victimize young people.  We have to do whatever we possibly can 
to stop this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today my friend from Lethbridge brings forward a private 
member's bill that will close the gap somewhat.  I hear from 
parliamentary secretary that the Liberals have some concerns, but 
I hope we can rectify those concerns by a simple amendment to the 
legislation or perhaps through regulation.  After all, the 
legislation simply provides the overall umbrella.  It is the 
regulations that flow from that which would be helpful. It is 
fair to say that no judge will suggest that we confiscate 
someone's computer because some individual in his or her employ 
decided to download some child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party are pleased with anything 
we can do to stop the victimization of children in our society, 
whether it is the issue of child poverty and the suffering that 
causes children or the issue we are talking about today, the 
misuse of the Internet for child exploitation. We are very 
strongly behind any initiative to that extent.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK172">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-321, 
an act to amend the criminal code to provide for the forfeiture 
of property relating to child pornography crimes, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-321, an act to amend the criminal 
code to provide for the forfeiture of property relating to child 
pornography crimes, introduced by the member for Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly this is a timely and important bill, and a bill that 
all members of parliament should be able to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to allow a court that convicts a 
person of an offence under section 163.2 of the criminal code 
concerning child pornography, to order the forfeiture of 
anything used in committing the offence or related to the 
offence. 
This legislation is needed for the safety and the protection of 
every child in Canada.  The legislation resulted from a court 
case in British Columbia in which the court ruled that an 
individual had the right to possess child pornography, something 
that the PC Party does not agree with. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1400
<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original decision in the Sharpe case was appealed to the 
British Columbia Supreme Court, which upheld its ruling of January 
1999.  Following the court decision, the PC Party justice critic, 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, called on the 
Minister of Justice to immediately refer the matter to the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  Since the supreme court was ultimately 
going to hear the case, the PC Party wanted to expedite this 
process and ensure that children in Canada had the full 
protection afforded by the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in February 1999 the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough said to the Minister of Justice: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—most Canadians were shocked and outraged in the wake of a B.C. 
justice's ruling dismissing charges of possession of child 
pornography as unconstitutional. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an urgent need for clarification for law enforcement 
agents, the judiciary, and all Canadians.  The protection of 
children afforded by section 163 of the Criminal Code should be 
paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Justice do more than simply intervene in 
the B.C. appeal and will she reference the Sharpe case to the 
Supreme Court of Canada immediately? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the results of that.  However, the matter is finally 
before the Supreme Court of Canada and we await the decision of 
the court.  If the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada does 
not overturn the original decision allowing possession of child 
pornography, the PC Party would support the use of the 
notwithstanding clause.  This would suspend the decision for five 
years and allow parliament to introduce legislation to make 
possession of child pornography an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an obvious radical action, but without question, given 
the heinous nature of this crime, radical action is required. By 
the way, this position has enormous public support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is also supported by the Canadian Police 
Association.  The 30,000 members of the police association have 
publicly outlined their support for this legislation and the 
importance of ensuring that anything used in the commission of an 
offence under the child pornography provisions could be ordered 
forfeited by the court.  The Canadian Police Association noted 
that this provision would include seizure of computer equipment 
used in the offence.  As the Internet is a source of child 
pornography, this legislation would enable the law to keep pace 
with technology and recognize the role that the Internet plays in 
such offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a case where the need to protect those most vulnerable 
in society must supersede the rights of the individual.  The 
Parliament of Canada has the duty to use every avenue available 
to protect society and especially children from sexual predators. 
We support the bill introduced by the hon. member for Lethbridge. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I know my time is short this afternoon but I think 
we have heard some excellent commentary on the bill on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat troubled, though, to hear the comments from the 
Liberal member opposite reflecting the government's position on 
the bill.  Primarily, it seems the one concern that the 
government has about the bill is the fact that someone may use 
someone else's equipment in purveying or getting hold of this 
grievous material and therefore the person who owns the equipment 
would be held criminally responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the only reason the government is considering not 
moving ahead on this important initiative, it is a very weak one. 
In Canada today we have laws in place that allow for the 
forfeiture of equipment and all that went into propagating hate 
propaganda.  If we can do it for hate propaganda, why can we not 
do it for child pornography? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examples in other parts of the world.  The United States 
has very significant forfeiture legislation which has been used 
to forfeit property, houses and things with relation to this kind 
of crime.  Therefore it can be done and it has been done in other 
types of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say we cannot move ahead on this because we have some 
confusion about who might be held responsible because of who owns 
the equipment is a complete sham, I would suggest, and a real 
disappointment.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues that come to the House that we have 
different positions or, but I do not think we have on the issue 
of child pornography.  We owe it to the Canadian people, those 
who are watching and those who are concerned about this issue, 
to show some unity on this, move quickly and make Canada a 
place in the world where there is a zero tolerance policy for 
child pornography.  This is one incremental step to move us that 
much closer to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disappointing to hear the government say that it wants to 
put up some little roadblock to stall this when it could move 
ahead, particularly when we had the minister say that 
she wanted to move ahead with legislation to tighten up the whole 
cyber-stalker situation whereby people are luring children into 
this on the Internet.  It is an excellent initiative.  What an 
excellent time to integrate this improvement, plug the loop-hole 
that was missed and solve both problems at the same time.  I 
encourage cabinet and members opposite to rethink their position 
and integrate this as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had that experience myself when I brought forward a private 
member's bill to the House.  It allowed children's organizations 
to have access to the pardoned records of convicted pedophiles. 
We had unanimous agreement on this side of the House.  The 
cabinet voted against it, but the majority of backbench Liberals 
voted with the bill.  Eventually it went to committee and we had 
everybody onside.  Then the government brought forward a bill 
much like mine, we made improvements to it, it went through the 
Senate and has now become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House there is agreement on this issue that in Canada we 
should have a zero tolerance policy.  This bill is timely and is 
the kind of thing we can all agree on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that in the committee meeting, and I believe the hon. 
member opposite also remembers, we all decided to integrate my 
bill into the government bill, make improvements and 
send it back to the House with a recommendation that it go 
forward and become law.  It was one of the few times that 
everyone around that table gave a round of applause and a cheer 
went up because we knew that we had done the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, to the House and to all who are 
listening that we quickly move on this bill.  Let us do the right 
thing.  Let us get it done and move ahead for all those people 
who have been concerned about the Sharpe case, which is still 
pending after almost two years, and who have been waiting to hear 
that possession of child pornography remains illegal in 
this country.  It has been a shame for so long. Then 
all those people, almost 500,000 of them who signed those 
petitions that I delivered to the House, will start to see the 
House move on this issue and move quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the Sharpe decision will come down in the next few 
days.  We have had enough doors being opened for child 
pornography in Canada.  There is agreement in the House.  There 
is clearly agreement across the land that we do not want it in 
Canada.  Let us work together to make sure that we see that 
agreement acted upon and the doors closed as quickly as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I look around the House today and I do not think there 
is a single member of parliament in this place who would say that 
they were in favour of kiddie porn, or in favour of pederasts or 
any of that type of stuff that would be condoned by these types 
of activities.  For the folks back home, I do not think there is 
anybody here who would support kiddie porn.  If there is, I want 
that member of parliament to raise his or her hand.  No, I did not 
think so.  The question then comes down to what is the best way 
to deal with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I commend my colleague from Lethbridge for having brought 
this forward.  He mentioned in his speech, and others touched on 
it, that one of the ways to potentially deal with this issue is 
to try to regulate the Internet.  That is an incredibly unwieldy 
proposition and is next to impossible.  Our ability to try to 
restrict some website in the United States and somebody in Canada 
from having access to it is very difficult. Even trying trying 
to restrict it within the country would be difficult as well.  We 
all know how quickly these things are growing and how much the 
Internet is taking off by leaps and bounds.  That is just one 
aspect of this.  I think that would be very difficult to do. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1410"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1410
<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect, though, is the whole idea of the forfeiture of 
property, of seizing the tools of the trade of these people who 
engage in child pornography.  If they are engaging in child 
pornography and are using computers for those purposes, surely it 
makes absolute sense to seize the tools of the trade.  It would 
make it all that much more difficult for them to do so.  If we 
take away the computers it probably would go a long way toward 
stopping their dalliances on the Internet and their spreading of 
the material.  If we take their digital cameras or whatever they 
happen to use, if we seize their ability to capture visible 
images, it would go a long way toward ending the dissemination of 
material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who go to great trouble and cause problems by somehow 
obtaining visual images of the sexual exploitation of minors 
could be processed under law and convicted for having done what 
they did.  Let us imagine the oddity of their keeping the 
material and possibly selling it to others or somehow making a 
profit from what they have done by distributing it to other 
individuals who share their predilections.  That would be not 
right.  I do not think any MP in the House thinks that would be 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only point the government brought forward in this 
consideration is if somebody worked for a company and used a 
computer there to download or somehow distribute such images.  It 
is a pretty weak case.  I put the issue to the people at home who 
are watching today.  It is not a fair analogy or something that 
would serve as a real roadblock for the legislation to carry 
forward.  It is something that the government's representatives 
on the streets of the country, the police, say is the right way 
to deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the parliamentary secretary must be willing sometimes to 
step aside from his academic or theoretical and abstract 
considerations with regard to some of these issues and listen to 
his own deputies, his own people on the street, the ones who deal 
with pornographers on a day in, day out basis, make it their 
lives and spend decades trying to hunt down some of these 
criminals.  Surely listening to them makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary cannot listen to police officers 
who deal with the criminal investigation of pedophiles or child 
pornographers, to whom can he listen?  Would he take the word of 
somebody in the Department of Justice, some lawyer worried about 
some particular nuance, the crossing of a <I>t</I> and dotting of 
an <I>i</I> with regard to a clause, or of somebody who deals with 
child pornographers and pedophiles on a regular basis and sees 
the sick work they do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers enforce this aspect of the law.  They probably 
have a far better understanding of its reaches and consequences 
than the parliamentary secretary could ever dream of, and certainly 
more than whoever it is in the Department of Justice with whom he 
consults on these matters.  I ask him to pay close attention to 
what police officers have to say in this regard and to give due 
consideration to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to wrap up by saying that my colleague, the member for 
Lethbridge, has done commendable work.  It is noble of him to 
have listened closely to police officers who work in this very 
area and to have come up with legislation.  Once again I applaud 
the idea that rather than trying to regulate the Internet, which 
is an incredibly difficult and possibly impossible task, we focus 
on the tools of the trade of pornographers and pedophiles and go 
after them instead.  He may be able to provide more resources to 
police officers, those people on the beat that the parliamentary 
secretary does not seem to want to listen to in this case, so 
that they can go ahead and do the good work they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that the parliamentary secretary and the government do the 
right thing in this regard.
