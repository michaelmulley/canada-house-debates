	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Question No. 24 will be answered today.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 24-<B>Mr. Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, 
Lib.):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What docking facilities, operated by the Department of Transport, are used to 
provide ferry services to islands in Canada and what are the costs of operation, 
maintenance and repair of such facilities (<I>a</I>) in dollars and (<I>b</I>) as a percentage of 
similar costs for all docking facilities owned and/or operated by the department 
in Canada?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Transport Canada advises as follows.
<P>
	Ontario is the only province in which Transport Canada operates 
docking facilities to provide ferry services to islands.
<P>
	In the Ontario region of transport there are five ferry operations 
that provide services to islands. The five ferry operations are listed 
and pertinent information is included.
<P>
	Tobermory to South Baymouth (Manitoulin Island): Manitoulin 
Island is accessible by Highway No. 6 of the provincial highway 
system, therefore the residents of Manitoulin Island do not depend 
solely on the ferry for access to the mainland. Because of the 
highway access, the Manitoulin Island operation may not be a good 
example for a cost comparison. It should also be noted that the 
ferry to South Baymouth is operated by the province of Ontario, 
Owen Sound Transportation Company Ltd. and it operates for only 
six months of the year.
<P>
	The following maintenance and repair costs have been incurred 
at the Tobermory/South Baymouth sites:
<P>
	Tobermory/South Baymouth:
<P>
	1990-91	Wharf repairs	$4,500<BR>
 	1991-92	Wharf repairs	$129,200<BR>
 	1992-93	Wharf repairs	$396,300<BR>
 	1993-94	-	-<BR>
 	1994-95	-	-<BR>
 	1995-96	Electrical Repairs	$500
<P>
	Kingsville to Pelee Island/Leamington to Pelee Island: The Pelee 
Island residents rely solely on the provincially operated ferry for 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2214"> 2214 </A></B>
<P>
access to the mainland. The operator  of the ferry operations is the 
Owen Sound Transportation Company Ltd.
<P>
	The ferry structures at Pelee Island, Kingsville and Leamington 
were rebuilt just recently in a joint federal-provincial government 
agreement that was made under ministerial agreement signed in 
December 1992 by Transport Canada and the Ministry of 
Transportation and Communication. The project started in 1992 
and was completed in 1995. The Transport Canada share for this 
project is shown below:
<P>
Kingsville Ferry Terminal	$2,285,000<BR>
Leamington Ferry Terminal	$3,663,000<BR>
Pelee Island Ferry Terminal	$4,868,000
<P>
	Millhaven to Stella: The Amherst Island residents rely solely on 
the provincially owned ferries for access to the mainland. The 
ferries are operated by the twonship of Amherst Island. The 
following maintenance and repair costs have been incurred at the 
Millhaven and Stella sites:
<P>
Millhaven:	1990-91	Timber crib repairs	$22,000<BR>
 		1991-92	Wharf repairs	$46,000<BR>
 		1992-93	Wharf repairs	$359,000<BR>
 		1993-94	Wharf repairs	$356,000
<P>
Stella:	1991-92	Wharf repairs	$34,000<BR>
		1994-95	Wharf reconstruction	$37,000<BR>
 		1995-96	Wharf reconstruction	$443,000
<P>
	Wolf Island to Cape Vincent, New York: The Wolf Island 
residents rely on two ferries for access to mainland. The Kingston 
ferry provides year round service; however, Transport Canada 
provides no infrastructure for this operation. The Horne's Point 
ferry is a privately operated international ferry to Cape Vincent, 
New York. The following maintenance and repair costs have been 
incurred at the Horne's point ferry structure:
<P>
Wolf Island:	1991-92	Wharf repairs	$39,000<BR>
 		1994-95	Wharf repairs	$50,000<BR>
		1995-96	Wharf repairs	$432,000
<P>
	Moosonee to Moose Factory Island: Moosonee school children 
rely on the privately owned ferry for transportation to and from 
school each day. The ferry operates from ice out, usually the first 
week of June, to freeze up, usually the last week of October each 
year. Also the ferry service provides access to the hospital that is 
located on Moose Factory Island. The alternative access methods 
to the island are freighter, canoe, helicopter and in the winter, cars, 
trucks and snowmobiles.
<P>
	The following maintenance and repair costs have been incurred 
at the Moose Factory site:
<P>
1990-91	Annual service contract	$14,250<BR>
 1991-92	Annual service contract	$25,250<BR>
 1992-93	New timber floats	$23,000<BR>
 1992-93	Annual service contract	$8,750<BR>
 1993-94	Annual service contract	$23,000<BR>
 1994-95	Float modifications	$2,500
<P>
	In all cases mentioned above Transport Canada owns the main 
structure for the ferry operation, but it does not own the ramps for 
the loading and unloading of vehicules and passengers. Part (b) of 
Question No. 24, making a percentage comparison to other marine 
structures may not be a fair comparison because the structures are 
substantially different in load requirement and overall size. Also, 
the location of a structure can have a dramatic effect on the yearly 
maintenance cost, i.e., ice conditions, wind and wave action, as 
well as current speed or flow.

<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In support of 
the Chair's decision, I would like to quote citation 246(3) in the 
fourth edition of Beauchesne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>246. (3) The guiding principle in determining the effect of an amendment 
upon the financial initiative of the Crown is that the communication, to which 
the royal demand of recommendation is attached, must be treated as laying 
down once for all (unless withdrawn and replaced) not only the amount of a 
charge, but also its objects, purposes, conditions and qualifications. In relation 
to the standard thereby fixed, an amendment infringes the financial initiative of 
the Crown, not only if it increases the amount, but also if it extends the objects 
and purposes, or relaxes the conditions and qualifications expressed in the 
communication by which the Crown has demanded or recommended a charge. 
And this standard is binding not only on private members but also on ministers 
whose only advantage is that, as advisors of the Crown, they can present new or 
supplementary estimates or secure the royal recommendation to new or 
supplementary resolutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I trust this answer is acceptable to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, this excerpt from Beauchesne's 
explains the absolute limits to which the opposition is subject in a 
debate such as the one on unemployment insurance reform. Given 
the fact that you reject the amendment, your interpretation of the 
article just read implies that in no way can our proposed 
amendments have the effect of changing the amounts of charges 
and expenditures, even though the main point of the debate on the 
unemployment insurance reform concerns precisely this issue.
<P>
	This extreme constraint means that the opposition can only refer 
to the current act, since the primary purpose  of the bill is to lower 
contributions for workers earning between $39,000 and $42,400, to 
eliminate contributions from major corporations regarding such 
amounts, thus reducing the tax base, to increase the tax burden of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2216"> 2216 </A></B>
<P>
those who currently do not pay unemployment insurance 
contributions by making them pay such contributions, and to force 
these small earners who will now pay contributions to make up for 
the $900 million shortfall, for the gift that the government is giving 
to major corporations and workers earning between $39,000 and 
$42,000 per year. Indeed, the idea is to make up for this loss by 
making those who currently do not contribute pay premiums, that 
is people who work between one and fifteen hours per week, even 
though most of them will not be eligible for unemployment 
benefits. The rest of the reform provides for cuts, so as to meet the 
objective of $1.9 billion set out in the budget. You will understand 
that, in this context, the opposition is bound and gagged, utterly.
<P>
	This bill, whose title shamefully refers to employment 
insurance, provides absolutely no assurance to workers that they 
will have a job even if they collect benefits, which is not a sure 
thing; in fact, no one is certain to collect benefits, because there is 
no right of appeal regarding employment benefits.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The bill's title does not even correspond to reality. Moreover, we 
claim, and we have every evidence to support our claim, that not 
only does the bill not guarantee a job, nor promote job creation, but 
also that it is anti-job.
<P>
	It does not promote job creation because it reduces interregional 
subsidization. It will make the poor regions even poorer. When I 
talk about regions, I mean the regions with seasonal work and high 
unemployment rates. I mean the Gaspé peninsula as well as the 
Atlantic provinces in general, but also the Montreal area.
<P>
	I would like to read from a brief submitted by some very 
important people, Robert Morrissey, the minister of economic 
development and tourism, and Jeannie Lea, the minister of 
education of Prince Edward Island. Their brief states: ``In Prince 
Edward Island, the net loss in unemployment insurance benefits 
would thus add up to over $15 million and increase to $24 million 
by 2001-2002. Such large losses have a major impact on an 
economy as small as ours, although Prince Edward Island ranked 
first for job growth in 1985''.
<P>
	Even though the cuts are somewhat reduced by the amendments, 
cuts are the hallmark of this bill. They will have an impact on the 
whole economy. If the minister of the economy in Prince Edward 
Island, a province that ranks first in job creation, can claim his 
province cannot cope with $15 million in cuts, what could be said 
of cuts in the Montreal area, where they will represent $500 million 
if the 1994 cuts are taken into account?
<P>
	This is the equivalent of the definitive closure, in just one region, 
of dozens and dozens of businesses. The impact on the economy 
will be staggering, and the social impact will be just as severe, 
because those who are excluded, many of whom do not get 
benefits, will be forced to make greater contributions.
<P>
	That is what they told us time and again. They also expressed 
their opposition through demonstrations and sometimes desperate 
protests. We can say one thing: If the government felt it had to 
make minor amendments, to the tune of $365 million on total cuts 
of almost $2 billion, it is because of the despair expressed in those 
demonstrations.
<P>
	We should not forget that those who were able to take part in 
demonstrations were people who were organized and could see the 
immediate impact on a whole area. Isolated individuals who have 
unstable jobs, who fear for their job or are already unemployed, 
and those who are on welfare, feel helpless in their isolation and do 
not know how to join in demonstrations. What we have here is a far 
cry from an employment insurance plan.
<P>
	That is why we, in the Bloc Quebecois, want and urge the 
minister to take the time to develop a real reform that will not 
attack those already in trouble, like Prime Minister Chrétien used 
to say-I am sorry, I should not be using his name-the former 
Liberal Leader of the Opposition, who was Jean Chrétien, the 
present Prime Minister, about a previous reform that was much less 
drastic than this one, this so-called reform that has already made 
$2.4 billion in cuts in unemployment benefits since 1995.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Thus we will show the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development how they should take great care of 
that instrument, which was most effective during the 1981-1983 
recession and the most recent one, but which will be less and less 
so because its stabilizing effect will be less and less effective. This 
is true of the economy as a whole, but even more so of individuals.
<P>
	How many people in our society do not even have minimum 
security? Their only security is unemployment insurance, which 
allows them to continue hoping to get another job. Therefore, we 
have no right to change overnight this essential instrument of social 
and economic stabilization.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on the bill regarding employment insurance.
<P>
	Over the past two years, the government has carried on extensive 
consultations in relation to matters of social policy, in particular 
the question of the unemployment insurance system which will 
now be called employment insurance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2217"> 2217 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very fitting that the new name of the system is employment 
insurance. We do not talk about having death insurance although 
we only get that insurance when we die. It seems reasonable not to 
call it unemployment insurance since the idea to be reinforced is 
that of people having employment, not unemployment. We want to 
assist people in achieving employment, which is what this bill is all 
about.
<P>
	The bill is about helping people to get jobs. It is also about 
strengthening work incentives. I do not believe this bill is perfect 
which is why I am glad that the human resources development 
committee over the past number of weeks has had a chance to look 
into the bill, to hear witnesses and to discuss possible ways to 
change it.
<P>
	Two other members and I have brought forward amendments. 
There are over 200 motions to amend the bill. I believe many of 
them will go through and will improve the bill substantially. It is 
important that fairness is ensured in the system through these 
changes.
<P>
	This bill will also help workers adjust to changing economic 
times. One of the most important changes to the employment 
insurance system will be the process of counting hours of work 
rather than counting weeks of work. That seems to be a more 
reasonable and accurate way to measure work. Most people work 
according to the number of hours per week.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada this change will mean that the vast majority 
of workers, for example, those in seasonal industries who often 
work more than 35 hours a week-some as much as 70 hours per 
week-will now get full credit for the hours they work. That is a 
very important change that will benefit people in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is also important to realize that under the new bill every hour 
and every dollar counts toward people's benefits. That is a change 
from the past. Before, whether you had 16 hours a week or 80 hours 
a week, it meant the same thing. That is surely not an accurate way 
to measure work or what will be insured. The new system will 
improve on that substantially.
<P>
	For example, consider a person in the construction industry, 
which is usually a seasonal industry. During the summer months, 
the heavy months of work, people will often work up to 70 hours a 
week. People in that sector will benefit from these changes. A week 
in which they work 70 hours will mean the equivalent of 2 weeks 
toward eligibility.
<P>
	One of my original concerns about the bill was the way it dealt 
with the divisor. The divisor is the number of weeks by which 
people's income is divided to determine what is their income.That is then multiplied by 55 per cent to determine what their  
benefits are.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The problem I had with that was that under the original bill in the 
highest unemployment regions people were required to work three 
or four weeks beyond the eligibility period. Let us say it was the 
equivalent of 12 or 14 weeks. In the 12 week areas they would have 
to work the full 16 weeks, and about 17 weeks in the 14 week areas 
in order to get the full benefit, whereas in the areas of lowest 
unemployment where it would be easiest to get additional work 
they would have to work no further weeks of work.
<P>
	It is similar to saying that in the areas where it is toughest to get 
additional work, that is, the areas of highest unemployment, an 
incentive is needed to get additional work and there is supposedly 
no need in the areas of highest employment where it is easier to get 
additional work. It would have meant hardship for the people in 
Atlantic Canada and in other high unemployment regions across 
the country. I felt it was very important that we remove that kind of 
hardship from the bill.
<P>
	By the same token, there were various groups, even unions in 
some cases, who came forward to say that it was true that there 
were some people who, after getting their 12 weeks of eligibility, 
would stop working. They would arrange to get themselves laid off 
or whatever. I do not think it is a big number of people but they 
exist. We have been told by those people and others that an 
incentive is needed for people to work a little extra, to ask them to 
stretch a bit but not to ask them to go off a cliff.
<P>
	I put forward the idea that instead of having the addition of four 
weeks in the highest unemployment areas and the addition of zero 
weeks in the lowest, it should be a flexible eligibility plus two 
weeks period for the divisor.
<P>
	This is a complicated subject. Many people will find it a little 
complex and hard to understand. The point is that it will be fairer 
across the board for all Canadians. It will mean that the divisor 
period will follow the rate of unemployment.
<P>
	As the unemployment rate in an area goes down and it becomes 
easier to find work, people will have to work a little longer to get 
their full benefit. As the unemployment rate in an area goes up and 
it gets harder to get those extra weeks of work, they will have fewer 
weeks to work, maybe one or two, obviously depending on the 
nature of the unemployment rate, to get that full benefit.
<P>
	That is an important measure. It will have a cost to it. It will 
mean $95 million will go back into the economy. It is a very 
important measure particularly in the areas of highest 
unemployment which would have been unduly harshly impacted on 
by the bill as originally written.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2218"> 2218 </A></B>
<P>
	I am delighted the government has accepted my proposal. The 
minister has put forward an amendment which requires a royal 
recommendation since it involves the spending of funds. He has 
also put forward proposals by my friend from 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury and by one of the members from 
Toronto.
<P>
	He put forward an amendment in one case regarding the gap or 
the question of weeks of zero employment. This would have been 
very problematic in some areas. There was another relating to 
exempting people in low income families from the intensity rule. 
That is a very important measure. The other measure will give 
people who are working while on UI a credit toward their next term 
on UI and a credit in relation to the intensity rule.
<P>
	Those are very important measures which will substantially 
improve the bill. I do not claim that this system will be perfect. I 
have never seen a government system that is perfect. I once heard 
someone say that the thing about all human institutions is that they 
have human failings. We are probably never going to create a 
perfect institution.
<P>
	The idea is to improve the situation as much as possible. 
Certainly, the change from a weeks based system to an hours based 
eligibility system will dramatically improve the employment 
insurance system for the majority of people who are claimants in 
my region. That is very important.
<P>
	There was another thing that was very important to me about this 
bill. When I first learned about the proposals on this bill last 
summer, one of my biggest concerns was that there was a reduction 
in the amount of funding going toward this. I recognize that there 
was an increase in the cost of the program from $8 billion 10 years 
ago to $20 billion today.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	My constituents have said that people should not be making high 
incomes year after year and also drawing as much as $10,000 in UI 
year after year. People are very strongly against that. I told the 
Minister of Human Resources Development it seemed to me that if 
we were going to change the system, the way to do it was to take it 
out of the high end, not the low end.
<P>
	The result is that people in low income families will end up 
getting about 14 per cent more because of what has been brought 
forward with the family income supplement. It is a very important 
progressive measure in the bill. It will mean that those low income 
families who depend on unemployment insurance will get a boost, 
a little more than the regular 55 per cent that others will get.
<P>
	It also means that for the vast majority in the middle the system 
will be maintained in a very positive way. But the fact is, for those 
who make $50,000 or $60,000 a year there will be a reduction 
because the employment insurance benefits of those people will be 
clawed back.  The vast majority of Canadians will strongly support 
that change. It is one I certainly support. This is a very progressive 
measure.
<P>
	We saw changes to the unemployment insurance system by the 
previous Conservative government which simply slashed and cut. 
It increased the number of weeks required to work and cut the 
amount of benefits and that was it. That was not the proper 
approach. The system needed vast reform which we have done. It 
will be a very strong and much better system.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
this bill which has come before the House probably represents one 
of the most technical of all the pieces of legislation we have had to 
deal with in this session to date. Indeed, the social and fiscal 
implications for same will be felt for many decades to come.
<P>
	Certainly the amendments the Reform Party of Canada is 
bringing forward will add a positive element to the debate. In terms 
of reasoned amendments, we have put forward 10. I mention that 
because I do hope members on the government side will look at the 
amendments we bring forward in the true spirit of co-operation, but 
also with the intention of participating in the debate with some 
reasoned thought and proposals which we feel do have validity in 
today's workplace.
<P>
	I would like to read into the record some elements of the 
definition of unemployment insurance, as our party sees it. The 
whole definition of unemployment insurance has changed radically 
under the bill. We have moved away from the notion of true 
insurance based principles. It is important for us to acknowledge 
that fact.
<P>
	The employment insurance bill which we continue to debate 
today has taken us very far away from what UI was intended when 
it was originally designed. Today, as we have heard from hon. 
members on the other side of the House, EI is thought of as an 
income supplement and not as an insurance.
<P>
	The Liberal minister of labour in 1940 when he was supporting 
the concept of individuals caring for their own unemployment 
situation, quoted from a report that went way back to 1919 when 
Manitoba Chief Justice Mathers said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend to the your government the question of making some 
provision by a system of state social insurance for those who, through no fault 
of their own, are unable to work, whether the inability arises from a lack of 
opportunity, sickness, invalidity or old age. Such insurance would remove the 
spectre of fear which now haunts the wage earner and make him a more 
contented and better citizen.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2219"> 2219 </A></B>
<P>
	I do agree with the sentiments of the then labour minister who 
was concerned that UI be used to get people from one job to 
another, to support them for that short transition time before they 
went into the other job.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	The minister of labour at the time was also concerned that UI 
would never become a way of life for people and that measures 
would be taken which would indeed avoid people becoming 
heavily reliant on that kind of subsistence. To make his point he 
quoted from a report by the Civil War Workers of Great Britain 
who said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-how much unemployment there will be and over what period it will last is 
impossible to forecast. But, whatever it be, there must be a great deal of 
unemployment which can only be dealt with in one of two ways: either by a 
considered scheme of insurance-or by state doles, hurriedly and 
indiscriminately issued when the moment of crisis arrives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There can be no question which is the better way. State doles may lead 
straight to pauperization. A well devised scheme of insurance preserves the 
self-respect of the worker and assists and encourages them to supplement it by 
provision made industrially through an association.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is exactly this original intention of what unemployment 
insurance was meant to provide and what it was meant to mean that 
has slipped away from us in these major changes the Liberal 
government is bringing to the House today and on which we will 
vote in just a few days.
<P>
	For many in Canada today, UI has indeed become a way of life. 
For too many people UI is that dole to which the then labour 
minister referred. With the new changes to UI the Minister of 
Human Resources Development has announced there are over $1 
billion of training programs for areas of high unemployment. This 
is exactly the kind of dole that history in the past has repeated and 
cautioned us to not endorse.
<P>
	As I was reading the executive summary of the bill, I was struck 
by a number of elements. The first one that made me certainly 
question the relevancy to unemployment insurance and work was 
the statement that ``income support is provided in a way that 
reinforces work''. I have asked questions on that statement many 
times and there is no one who has suggested or has even come close 
to explaining exactly how income support can provide a way to 
reinforce work. To me they are two discrete and very different 
things.
<P>
	The executive summary went on to say: ``It also permits 
simplification of the reporting requirements for employees and 
premium collections''. I am going to read from a very real life 
example which is from the Canadian Restaurant and Food Services 
Association. We are seeing that indeed simplification is not on 
when it comes to this industry.
<P>
	The result of the change with respect to the conversion to an 
hours based system from a maximum weekly insurable system has 
major financial implications for employers and especially part time 
employees in Canada's food service industry because so many of 
our part time students work in this area.
<P>
	Using the 1996 premium rate of .0413, human resources 
development officials have estimated the cost to this one industry 
alone, the food service employers, to be $35 million. This is 
certainly higher than what the Canadian Restaurant and Food 
Services Association had originally estimated. It represents a 17 
per cent increase on employer contributions of approximately $211 
million.
<P>
	Once again I ask: How does the statement ``it also permits 
simplification of the reporting requirements for employees and of 
premium collection'' really have any relevancy here when we 
understand that the impact of first dollar coverage on individual 
food service companies is going to fluctuate substantially 
depending on the percentage of part time employees working less 
than 15 hours per week? The nature of the reporting has become so 
complex that an analysis of this indicates that the employer is 
going to actually see an increase in employer premium costs from 
15.7 per cent to 72.6 per cent.
<P>
	That conversion to an hours based system not only alters the cost 
structure of some companies disproportionately, it also results in 
competitive distortions within the industry. It also creates a huge 
backlog of extra effort administratively for these businesses. That 
is something which I believe requires a great deal of clarification 
on the part of the Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I understand my time is coming to an end, but there is another 
contradictory statement here. We look at two terms here: wage 
subsidy linked with reduction of dependence on income support. 
Those two statements are made in the same paragraph in the 
executive summary. I hope that over the course of this debate I will 
be able to come back to these elements of the executive summary 
because they are not the same thing. They are contradictions in 
terms. They also have great implications for the unemployment 
insurance scheme as it has been developed by the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	On that note, for this time, I will close.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-12.
<P>
	I would like to make some comments at this stage on the changes 
proposed to the original bill and in particular to the costs associated 
with the changes.
<P>
	It is important to focus on the amendments which were made in 
committee. They are based on all the hard work that the committee 
has been involved in, going back two years when the committee of 
human resources development was sent across the country to hear 
the views of Canadians, then when the bill was introduced in its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2220"> 2220 </A></B>
<P>
first phase to where we find ourselves today. It is some 140 days 
since we have had hearings and went clause by  clause in 
committee. We find ourselves in the House today dealing with 
amendments at report stage of this bill.
<P>
	The increased costs of the three main amendments to Bill C-12 
that have been accepted by the government will be offset by 
adjustments in other areas. The amended bill will still mean that a 
total of $1.2 billion will be saved by the year 2001-2002 which is a 
gross savings of $2 billion minus the $800 million that will be 
reinvested in re-employment measures.
<P>
	Hon. colleagues should by now be familiar with the amendments 
proposed because the members who have proposed them, at least 
from the government side, have been very up front with them, have 
sent them across the country and to their own constituents.
<P>
	The first amendment is the provision to lessen the impact on 
workers in all industries who have gaps in their work and earning 
patterns. The fixed period for calculating benefits under the 
original proposal was considered to be too harsh for workers in this 
situation.
<P>
	Now all claimants will be able to use a full 26-week period prior 
to making a claim to calculate average earnings. Average earnings 
over this period, excluding gaps, will determine the level of 
benefits. What it means is that workers could have several weeks of 
breaks in employment during this 26-week period without having 
their benefits reduced due to these gaps in employment. This 
change will increase benefit payouts by about $246 million for 
workers with unstable work patterns.
<P>
	The second amendment changes the way the average is arrived at 
and the way the benefit is calculated with those with only the 
minimum number of weeks. My colleague in the Liberal Party 
spoke to that issue which is what we call the divisor.
<P>
	Under the original proposal the divisor was set at three or four 
weeks above minimum entrance requirements in high 
unemployment regions and between zero and two weeks above in 
low unemployment regions. Therefore, individuals in high 
unemployment regions with the least opportunity for finding 
additional work exists would have been greatly penalized by these 
measures.
<P>
	However, the purpose of having a divisor that is higher than the 
minimum qualifying requirement is to encourage people to take 
extra employment and try to work more than just the minimum 
required to qualify.
<P>
	However, a balance between providing incentives and ensuring 
fairness had to be found. With the amendment of my colleague 
which is supported by the government and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, I believe we have been able to do that.
<P>
	Consequently, the government has agreed to an amendment that 
will set the divisor at only two weeks plus the minimum number of 
weeks necessary to qualify in all regions, that is, a minimum 
divisor which ranges  from 14 to 22 weeks depending on the 
unemployment rate in the region. It will thereby retain the 
incentive to work, but will be fairer for those in truly difficult 
situations. People will have a 26-week period in which to find the 
weeks needed to maximize their benefits. This proposal will have a 
positive impact on benefit payments for workers in high 
unemployment regions and little impact elsewhere across the 
country. The new divisor will increase benefit payouts by about 
$95 million.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The third main amendment is the new intensity rule. Under this 
rule people who draw on the system year after year will see a 
modest reduction in benefits. All future claimants who have 
received 20 or more weeks of regular benefits within a five-year 
period, beginning with the new bill when it is passed into law, will 
have the weekly benefit rate of their next claim reduced by 1 
percentage point, from 55 per cent for every 20 weeks they have 
been on claim. The maximum reduction will be 50 per cent of 
weekly earnings for someone who has received more than 100 
weeks of benefits over a five-year period.
<P>
	The amendment the government has accepted is to exempt from 
the intensity rule those individuals with very low incomes who 
have children. That threshold has been set at $26,000 or less. 
Approximately 350,000 claimants qualifying for the family income 
supplement will not be subject to this rule. We should keep that in 
mind when some 2.4 million Canadians collect unemployment 
insurance each year. This exemption of the intensity rule for some 
350,000 people is a significant improvement. It is a way for the 
government to ensure that the poorest of the poor are not affected. 
Quite frankly, they do not need an incentive to work. Being poor, I 
am sure, is enough incentive for anyone to try to find a job.
<P>
	While the intensity rule will reduce weekly benefits somewhat 
for those who use the system frequently, those with the lowest 
incomes who are most in need are protected. It will increase benefit 
payouts by about $24 million for 188,000 claimants in low income 
families who otherwise would have been affected by the rule.
<P>
	Taken together, the three amendments will increase the payouts 
to individuals under the employment insurance program by roughly 
$365 million over what was proposed in the unamended Bill C-12. 
That shows how important committee work is. When members 
make proposals, even though they have a significant cost factor, 
when proven to be fair to the people we are trying to help and 
protect, the government has reacted very favourably.
<P>
	Now for the other side of the ledger, the changes that will be 
made to tighten up the system to reduce expenditures to offset the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2221"> 2221 </A></B>
<P>
increased payouts I have just mentioned. Those have to be put in 
perspective.
<P>
	The scope of potential cost reductions is very wide. For example, 
if 50 per cent of EI claimants collect just one week fewer benefits 
the savings would be $300 million in one year. Think of it. One 
week with no benefits for individuals who happened to find an 
extra week of work would save the system some $300 million 
which could be used in other areas.
<P>
	What the government is planning to do is tackle three 
longstanding problems of the old system in order to reduce costs 
and to make the operation of the system fairer for all those who 
contribute to it. One of the major problems is that there has been an 
inefficient early use of all means available to help claimants get 
back to work as quickly as possible. In too many cases there is a 
tendency to simply fill out the forms and mail out the cheques 
without a concerted effort to ensure that the individual claimant has 
help to find other employment. That will no longer be the case in 
employment offices across the country. Now the question will not 
simply be: ``Where do we mail the cheque?'', it is going to be, 
``What do we need to do to get you back into the workforce right 
now?''
<P>
	In addition to other services provided to those who are looking 
for work, a new and ongoing series of group information sessions 
will be provided to claimants in specific categories. These include 
claimants in demand occupations. For example, those who have 
skills that employers are looking for, repeat claimants, past fraud 
claimants and those affected by structural changes who may face 
long periods of unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	At these sessions claimants will be informed of all the services 
available to help them get back into the workforce rather than 
remain on benefits. These include the electronic hiring hall, which 
we have all heard about, and will include the computerized job 
search system which was introduced in the last number of years.
<P>
	Approximately 400,000 unemployed workers every year will 
qualify for a very flexible and innovative series of new measures 
which will help more people get jobs. These include wage 
subsidies, income supplements, self-employment assistance, skills, 
loans and grants and community job partnerships.
<P>
	These changes in the bill are intended to save a significant 
amount of money. It is estimated by the year 2001-2002 if we get 
more proactive in helping people find a job, we can recoup the 
finances put back into the system with the three amendments that 
the members have made and the government has accepted.
<P>
	That is the rationale for these amendments at this point. I hope to 
speak more on those amendments as the day goes on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we have finally made it. We still had not had the 
opportunity, four months after the introduction of the bill, to 
examine this issue in detail, but we will now be able to do so thanks 
to the Bloc amendments included in the first group of motions. 
How can the bill before us be entitled an Act respecting 
employment insurance in Canada, when all it provides for really is 
a lot of amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act?
<P>
	Let me try to explain. During the 1993 fall election, voters told 
us that they thought employment should be the first priority of the 
federal government. They wanted seasonal workers to have the 
opportunity to work during the winter, they wanted workers 
between 45 and 50 years of age affected by technological change to 
have access to other jobs thanks to productivity gains, and they 
wanted female workers to be able to make the most of their 
potential and skills.
<P>
	The government took the message the Canadian voters sent it 
and turned it into what is now improperly called an Act respecting 
employment insurance in Canada. As we have heard this morning, 
some members believe that this bill will encourage people to work 
a bit longer. They started with a bill and said: ``We will call it 
employment insurance''. An employment insurance ought to help 
everyone get some work and help workers who lose their jobs find 
another one as soon as possible, so that their full potential is used.
<P>
	Instead, what we have is a bill where workers who lose their jobs 
get their knuckles rapped, since they are told they will be 
encouraged to work longer, because if they do not, they will get no 
unemployment insurance. This is a punitive approach that is out of 
step with the current employment situation in Canada.
<P>
	This title was given to the bill in answer to the public's expressed 
wish to make full use of human potential, but the bill is just a 
smoke screen, since its content has nothing to do with reality. The 
reality is that this reform bill offers no guarantees in terms of jobs. 
It also denies the workers the benefit of an income between jobs.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance was established in 1935. I would like 
to quote what Prime Minister Bennett said about it in a speech: ``A 
series of measures that are part of a comprehensive plan aimed at 
reducing the present social and economic inequities and at 
distributing more equitably the benefits of capitalism between the 
different groups in our society and the various regions will be 
submitted to you''. This is the basis of the UI program as we know 
it today.
<P>
	Now, let us look at the content of the employment insurance bill, 
to see if it still meets that goal. Canadians and Quebecers can be 
proud of that goal. Experts who appeared before the committee told 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2222"> 2222 </A></B>
<P>
us that the UI  program is the best program to stabilize the economy 
during a recession.
<P>
	The amendments to the UI program being brought in by the 
government will do exactly the opposite: they will reduce this 
stabilizing effect and it will be a step backward that will eventually 
lead us to a situation similar to that of the Depression of the 1930s. 
The UI program was established at that time to help us overcome 
the crisis and to soften the effects of recessions. I will give some 
examples of the adverse effects of this bill.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The first thing that is not good for job creation is the lowering of 
maximum insurable earnings. We are encouraging businesses, big 
corporations in particular, by giving them a present, to hire people 
who can earn more than $39,000, who can do lots of overtime, 
because above $39,000 businesses will not pay premiums anymore. 
So given the choice between hiring someone at $39,000 and asking 
him to do more than $10,000 worth of overtime in one year and 
hiring a part time worker, what will the company choose? To 
realize economies of scale, the big corporation will say: ``Instead 
of paying $10,000 to 10 part time employees, we will pay overtime 
instead, which will make for corresponding savings in terms of 
unemployment insurance premiums we will not have to pay''.
<P>
	When a gouvernment suggests such measures in a bill, it cannot 
call it employment insurance. In fact, it is an anti-employment bill. 
We cannot give such a title to a bill. At least, the government 
should have had the decency to consider it as a series of 
amendments to the Unemployment insurance Act, and let us 
determine whether or not they are in accordance with what the 
people want.
<P>
	Another significant element is that everybody will have to pay 
premiums from now on, starting with the first hour of work. The 
principle of making everybody insurable can be interesting, but it 
means that many people, including students, will pay premiums.
<P>
	We heard representations by restaurant owners associations, 
people who are responsible for McDonald's franchises and others, 
throughout Canada, and who cannot be accused of not trying to 
protect the economy. They told us it would have a major negative 
impact on student employment. Once again, there is a negative 
impact on employment. So, we cannot say it is an employment 
insurance bill.
<P>
	The other element, maybe the most tragic one, at least in my 
riding, is the way they are killing regional economies. Next year, in 
my riding, the changes will take away $10 million from the 
economies of Kamouraska, Rivière-du-Loup, Témiscouata, Les 
Basques and the surrounding area. In Lower St. Lawrence, it will 
be $20 million.
<P>
	And you would have me believe that those cuts will create 
employment? How could that be? How can the government 
guarantee that these savings will be used to create new jobs? There 
is no way it can because it is using the UI fund to supplement its 
budget. It is using it to show the world that Canada's deficit is not 
that high, but that does nothing for job creation. So, it is not an 
employment insurance bill but an anti-employment bill, a bill 
representing a step backwards for all unemployment insurance 
rules. I for one think it is unacceptable.
<P>
	Another example of the negative impact of the so-called 
employment insurance bill, which is just an amendment of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, is the rule prescribing 910 hours of 
work for new entrants to the labour force. Just think, previously, a 
new entrant needed 300 hours of work to be eligible, that is 20 
weeks at 15 hours a week. From now on, it will be 910 hours.
<P>
	What effect will that have on new entrants, on young people 
entering the labour market? After trying for a year to accumulate 
910 hours, young people who just graduated from school in applied 
ecology, in animal health, in tourism, in recreation or in any other 
field related to seasonal industries will realize that this 910-hour 
requirement cannot be met. By imposing such a requirement, the 
federal government is encouraging those people to do clandestine 
work and is forcing them onto welfare.
<P>
	Do you think you are encouraging high school, college or 
university students to work when you tell them that the job they 
will get after graduating will lead them straight to welfare? This 
situation is unacceptable, and it is totally misleading to say that this 
legislation is about employment insurance.
<P>
	What should the government have done instead? It should have 
introduced a true reform and not seize this opportunity to tighten 
all eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance. For this 
to be a real employment insurance bill, the government should 
have included in it the right or the obligation to set a goal for 
reducing unemployment, just as it did for the reduction of the 
deficit. It said: ``We will bring the deficit down to a certain 
percentage of the GDP''. If the government really wanted to 
address the problem of unemployment, should it not have included 
in this bill a goal for reducing unemployment so that all 
government action could be geared toward this goal? There is no 
such thing in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Are there measures in the bill to encourage job-sharing? Are 
there employment oriented tax incentives? No. All the government 
has come up with is a technical committee to evaluate the effects of 
taxation on employment. Before you know it, we will be in the next 
recession and we will still not have found any solution, although 
we will have had the opportunity. If the object was to come up with 
an employment insurance  bill, to define and produce rules such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2223"> 2223 </A></B>
<P>
that businesses are encouraged through taxation to keep 
employees, to train them, to ensure that they will continue to work 
for them rather than leave.
<P>
	It should also have included incentives to reduce overtime. But 
the opposite is true, as I explained with respect to maximum 
insurable earnings. Here again, there is nothing favouring job 
creation, in particular by reducing overtime.
<P>
	Another thing that could have been done was to increase the 
effectiveness of training. This means doing the right things in the 
right places. Why can the government not understand that people 
throughout Quebec are saying that the waste in this sector is 
outrageous, that the fact that both governments are operating in the 
same sector is unacceptable?
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are indicating to me that my time is up. I 
will conclude in one minute by saying that this bill is not an 
employment insurance bill, but a bill to amend the Unemployment 
Insurance Act, unfortunately for the worse, as the basic criteria are 
no longer even met. The result is that unemployment insurance is 
becoming a luxury in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
expecting to speak a little later today in this debate. But seeing that 
our friends across the way, and those next to us, have decided to 
pass, I shall jump in now.
<P>
	It is somewhat strange to see the Liberals, now they are in power, 
adopting an attitude so completely opposite to their attitude when 
in opposition. Without going over all of them we could say this is 
unkept promises week.
<P>
	It would be worthwhile repeating a certain number of points 
relating to unemployment insurance. First of all, I would like to 
quote the present Minister of Human Resources Development, 
during the debate on the Borrowing Authority Act on May 1, 1989. 
He said: ``The point I am trying to make, which many of us will 
have to look at seriously, is the whole notion of trust and 
credibility. Canadians are prepared to share the burden, if they 
think it is being done fairly. Unemployment insurance, family 
allowance, and old age pensions are a sacred trust. We must not 
allow the trust of Canadians to deteriorate to a point where they 
become cynical. I have listened to people talk about New Zealand, 
the United States, and about other countries and how they do it. 
This country is very special in how it deals across the board with 
men and women in every part of the country. There are basic 
standards, basic programs, universal programs, and programs that 
allow people to deal with their future with some degree of 
security''. Those are the words of the present Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	Better yet, I will read from a 1993 letter addressed to the 
Mouvement Action-Chômage by the present Prime Minister, who 
was the Leader of the Opposition at the time. I think the whole 
thing needs to be read.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for your fax indicating your opposition to the legislative measures 
taken by the government to change unemployment insurance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have my assurance that the Liberal Party shares your concerns about this 
attack on the unemployed, and we also do not believe that the recent superficial 
amendments change the fundamentally unfair nature of these measures in any 
way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I shall skip the next paragraph since it only gives statistics. He 
goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In light of the gravity of this crisis, the Liberals have called upon the 
government-Conservative at the time-to take steps to encourage economic 
upturn and job creation. Yet, according to the Minister of Finance, he will not 
only continue the same taxation, monetary and trade policies which have 
plunged us into this recession, but will also dump on the unemployed under the 
pretext of reducing expenditures. . . .</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Liberals are appalled by these measures. By reducing benefits and penalising 
even more workers who voluntarily quit their jobs, the government shows it 
cares very little about the victims of the current economic crisis. Instead of 
addressing the problem at its core, the government picks on the unemployed. 
Besides, these measures will have disturbing consequences because they will 
discourage workers from reporting harassment cases and unacceptable labour 
conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, rest assured that Liberals will continue to demand that the 
government withdraw this unfair bill. As Leader of the Opposition, I appreciate 
your taking the time to let me know your position on this issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	This letter is signed by the current Prime Minister. It was signed, 
it is not something he said on television. As we know, the Prime 
Minister is rather inconstant in that regard, but it is there, he signed 
it. I do not know if I can call him by his name. I cannot, but the 
letter bears his signature.
<P>
	I also reread several speeches. I could, for instance, talk about 
the speeches the current chairman of the human resources 
development committee made in the House. If I may, since you are 
now in the chair, Madam Speaker, I would like to refer to a 
statement you made in February, when you said that if the bill 
remained in its present form you would not be able to support it. 
You are now in the chair. I simply wanted to mention it.
<P>
	If you felt uneasy about this bill I can tell you that many 
members from the maritimes were-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I would 
remind the hon. member that the Chair is not to be involved in this 
situation. Please continue your debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I wanted to take every precaution, 
but if it still creates a problem, I withdraw my words if that is 
necessary.
<P>
	Nevertheless, even after the amendments, I question the 
members opposite because, last week, we had 40 hours of debate in 
committee, three quarters of which concerned the motion on time 
allocation we opposed. We opposed it because we wanted to use all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2224"> 2224 </A></B>
<P>
our time to  study this important bill. I recall especially clause 2, 
which contains the definitions.
<P>
	To prove the merit of our point of view, I pointed out that a 
number of clauses required more than five minutes just to read 
them. I did not go very far. I chose clause 5 to make the simple 
point that it took over five minutes to read it. In fact, it took me 12 
minutes to read clause 5. So we fought over this and that was the 
end of it.
<P>
	This is the second time in this legislature, under this Liberal 
government, that the work of a committee has been gagged. Here 
we are at report stage. Unfortunately, we were told that the 
opposition was not making any amendments. Out of the 
considerable number of small amendments we submitted-I just 
want to point this out-, only one-I know because it was 
mine-on ``community agency'' was agreed to, despite all the 
hours we spent trying to respond to the minister's invitation to 
present amendments. All the amendments by the member for 
Mercier and the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup were 
defeated.
<P>
	Obviously, all the government amendments were accepted. My 
amendment concerned only two words. The three amendments 
presented by the Liberals have a budget impact; we are told that 
there are $365 million in improvements. I say, so much the better. 
However, a half measure is a compromise. Something that is 
unacceptable is unacceptable.
<P>
	Just to make a point-you cannot be half pregnant. You are 
either well and truly pregnant or you are not. When a measure is 
unacceptable, it is not by improving it somewhat that you make it 
more acceptable. You just make it a little less bad, that is all.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	So this is more or less what we were offered. I also remind the 
House of what was done last week, concerning another bill, to 
make the maritimes accept the GST agreement. A $960 million 
goodie was given to offset GST, in the hope of making the 
maritimes support the bill.
<P>
	I could quote speeches of present government members when 
they were in opposition. There are many of them and I could as 
well remind them of all those who came before the travelling 
committee and submitted briefs. I even call on Liberal Party 
members to ultimately reconsider their project. Since I have only 
30 seconds left, it is important to recall the Prime Minister's letter. 
Please read it again and think about it while there is still time. This 
is an unfair, regressive and anti-job measure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this is a sad 
day. The debate on the Unemployment Insurance Act-now called 
employment insurance by the government-is coming to an end. I 
am trying to find out exactly where in the documents before me, in 
Bill C-12, the way jobs will be created is defined.
<P>
	I cannot see it anywhere. That is why I cannot understand why 
they want to change the name. I think the purpose of this bill is 
rather to change the old Unemployment Insurance Act. To call it 
employment insurance is deceitful. I have publicly and repeatedly 
proclaimed that this has nothing to do with employment insurance. 
Rather, this bill-whose real purpose is to reduce operating costs, 
benefits, the number of beneficiaries, who are the victims of the 
lack of jobs-is a kind of deficit insurance for the government.
<P>
	Let me explain. I have certainly said so before, but I will say it 
again. Sometimes, when you say something often enough, people 
in this House eventually understand. With the serious-and 
hidden-cuts it has made, the government is going to save nearly 
$5 billion on the backs of victims of the lack of jobs. The governing 
party was rather straightforward about it. The purpose of this bill is 
solely financial. They should have called it deficit insurance. I 
think Canadians would understand that, they would see that the 
government is trying to address the deficit. Instead they save 
money at the expense of the unemployed and call it employment 
insurance. This is not making much progress.
<P>
	Yet, as my colleagues have often pointed out many of the 
members across the way used to be form the opposition. I suppose 
they were closer to their constituents then. I suppose they listened 
more then. So, what happened the night of October 25, 1993? If I 
am allowed a joke, should not the members opposite carry the 
warning ``best before October 25, 1993'' since these elected 
representatives are making cuts on the back of their constituents?
<P>
	I am saying that because I feel a little sad. I am looking at the 
members from the maritime provinces, I know that many of them 
were paid a visit by their constituents during the holidays. I can see 
a few smiles, but I know that things got pretty rough some 
evenings, and these members were not smiling then. I fear for them 
when they go back to their constituencies for the next recess. 
People watch TV, listen to the news and they can see that not too 
many changes have been made to this bill. They can see that the 
much criticized irritants are still in there for the most part. I cannot 
understand why it remains so.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	I would like to mention something which just came out in the 
media-since he is no longer a member of this House, I can 
mention his name. Mr. Brian Tobin, the former fisheries minister, 
is said to have made the following statement: ``The reform of 
Unemployment Insurance, which is aimed at reducing benefits paid 
out to claimants, deals a severe blow to Atlantic Canada where 
thousands of fishermen, loggers and other workers are relying on 
this federal program to supplement their seasonal income''.
<P>
	I have not had the time to read the whole thing yet, but we know 
how high and mighty Mr. Tobin can sound;  I am happy to see that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2225"> 2225 </A></B>
<P>
he has now come to his senses and appears ready to stand up for 
people in his province. Is he now going to preach common sense?
<P>
	He has acknowledged that people who go on UI have to do it to 
supplement their income because there is no other way. Naming a 
few noble occupations, he recognizes that in the maritimes people 
cannot work year-round at their job.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you and I, since we are stuck here in Ottawa, 
we cannot fish to feed ourselves. We cannot cut our own firewood. 
Somebody else has to do it for us. Why is it that these people are 
being hurt? Will each one of us here think about it when we light a 
fire in our fireplace tonight? Will each of us think about that the 
next time we buy fish? Will we think about those who will be 
bludgeoned by this bill and, as fellow Canadians and consumers, 
will we say: well, fish was not too expensive today and the federal 
government is really picking on fishermen.
<P>
	I want to warn all consumers and all fish eaters, especially now 
that spring is back and that the lobster season is upon us. I like to 
give the following example: the next time you go out to buy lobster 
or fish, would you be ready to pay five times the current price for 
the product? If you are not ready to do so, I warn you that there will 
be serious social upheaval. Those who agree to catch and sell the 
fish, those who cut the wood for your fireplace, are limited to about 
ten weeks of work in the year, not because they are lazy, but 
because nature makes it so.
<P>
	How many times will we have to repeat it? I can only feel sorry. 
How come people dare to say the truth only when they get out of 
the House, out of government? Who is the real boss in this 
business? Who? How come, when people cross over to the other 
side of the House, they do not see things in the same light? When 
will Canadians and Quebecers have representatives in this place 
who will use common sense and listen to the population, whatever 
happens?
<P>
	All the people we heard, the unions, said: ``Yes we recognize that 
something should be done''. They were willing to lend a hand. I 
acknowledge that as opposition we protested, but we also tried to 
lend a hand. What is truly missing is the partnership, the spirit of 
co-operation, which is necessary for a far reaching reform. The 
government needs co-operation, the government needs everyone to 
believe that the program is being changed for the good of 
everybody.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	To participate, people need to see a spark. They need to know 
that they will be listened to. They have to feel that, at the end of the 
process, they will not be scorned, that maybe the government will 
succeed in meeting part of its objectives and, as for themselves, 
they will see  something in the bill that they recommended. But 
such is not the case now.
<P>
	Therefore, you will understand that on each and every motion I 
will get up in this House, as long as the government will allow me, 
and express my disagreement loud and clear. I hope that eventually 
people across the floor will understand. Between individuals of 
good will there is always the possibility of an agreement. I will 
continue to play the parliamentary game, to hold out my hand, but 
eventually the people will remember what is going on and they will 
let the members on the other side know when the time comes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the important Bill 
C-12.
<P>
	Before I start, I would like to give sincere congratulations on 
behalf of the members of the Bloc Quebecois caucus. I would like 
to congratulate my colleagues, the hon. members for Mercier, 
Lévis and Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for the remarkable work 
they have done and continue to do in denouncing this bill.
<P>
	I am not telling you anything new by saying these colleagues 
have worked day and night. Day and night, that is saying 
something. Indeed, they were subject to the insult of the guillotine 
by this federal government.
<P>
	What we are talking about here is once again the credibility of a 
government. With all the outcry surrounding the GST across 
Canada, which has led to Sheila Copps' resignation, we see once 
again that, depending on whether you are in opposition or in 
government, the language is different. About us, you could say: 
``You, of the Bloc, we could give you exactly the same attribute''. 
No, Madam Speaker, because we, of the Bloc, were elected here to 
defend the interests of Quebec, and that is why we present 
candidates only in Quebec, in order to play our role of 
representatives of the interests and defence of Quebec.
<P>
	We will not be able to contradict ourselves once we are in 
opposition and once we are in power, because we will always be in 
the opposition for the time we are staying within Canada.
<P>
	I would like to go back to some statements that were made 
earlier by members of the Liberal Party. On February 18, 1993, the 
hon. member for North York, while in opposition, was protesting 
against the first unemployment insurance reform by the 
Conservatives and mentioned in a speech he made here, in the 
House of Commons, a demonstration that had taken place in 
Montreal at minus 25 degrees. ``Those were not lazy, freeloading 
people. They were not sitting home watching videos or skiing in 
the Laurentians. They were demonstrating against an unfair 
government that does not have a plan to help them get back to 
work.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2226"> 2226 </A></B>
<P>
	To continue quoting the hon. member for York-North: ``We were 
shown the real world that day at the demonstration, a world of 
frustration, anger and hopelessness. The government's response 
has been scornful and insulting. The government called the 
demonstrators separatists.''
<P>
	The last person who called demonstrators separatists was Sheila 
Copps, the former member for Hamilton East. It is therefore 
obvious how scornful this government is. This was doubly evident 
in the statements made by the present Minister of Human 
Resources Development, then Minister of Transport, at an official 
dinner in West Park, when he commented on the whole issue of 
railway labour negotiations. Today, this same person is expected to 
protect the interests of the unemployed and, to some degree, the 
financial interests of workers. He stated:
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Railway workers with grade eight or nine education cannot be 
blamed for negotiating excessive labour contracts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This same person is now Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Is this not edifying? This statement was an insult to 
the 62,000 railway workers in Canada. This same minister was in 
opposition on May 1, 1989. It was an insulting thing to say. After 
that, should one wonder why Canadians have lost faith in 
politicians and politics? Why are Canadians so fed up? Well, faith 
and credibility must be deserved, they cannot be bought. Deserving 
them takes years, but they can be destroyed in a few moments. Ask 
Sheila Copps, she knows something about it.
<P>
	This same Minister of Human Resources Development said on 
May, 1, 1989, and I quote: ``The point I am trying to make, which 
many of us will have to look at seriously, is the whole notion of 
trust and credibility. Canadians are prepared to share the burden, if 
they think it is being done fairly. Unemployment insurance, family 
allowance and old age pensions are a sacred trust. We must not 
allow the trust of Canadians to deteriorate to a point where they 
become cynical. I have listened to people talk about New Zealand, 
the United States, and about other countries and how they do it. 
This country is very special in how it deals across the board with 
men and women in every part of the country. There are basic 
standards, basic programs, universal programs, and programs that 
allow people to deal with their future with some degree of 
security''.
<P>
	After that, how can we have faith in this minister, who is 
responsible for getting this reform through and who has the 
effrontery to call it employment insurance, when no 
encouragement is given to employment.
<P>
	I do not want to use the time of my colleague for Québec, who is 
our critic on women's issues, but I remind her of what appeared in 
the daily <I>Le Soleil</I> this morning. I am sure she has read it. On page 
A-10, on the subject of unemployment insurance reform, the title 
reads: ``Women get it''. The article goes on to say: ``A coalition of 
women's groups is criticizing the unemployment insurance reform 
on the grounds that it would put part time workers-primarily 
women-at a disadvantage. The new method of calculating 
eligibility for benefits would limit these workers' access to the 
plan, according to the coalition, at its press conference held on May 
1. According to a spokesperson for the Fédération des femmes du 
Québec, people working fewer than 35 hours a week and women 
seeking maternity benefits will lose out''.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that the Bloc Quebecois is not 
opposed to social program reform. It defends the consensus 
reached in Quebec to the effect that the province alone must be 
responsible for manpower and job training. In order for it to do so, 
Quebec must take control of all manpower policies and budgets. 
They must be the responsibility of the Government of 
Quebec-unconditionally.
<P>
	Until there is political sovereignty in Quebec, our party will 
continue to call for the withdrawal of this anti-worker, backward 
and anti-development legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this morning to speak to Bill C-12. I have done so on 
several occasions and I would have liked the government to accept 
the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois to improve this 
piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	No later than yesterday, in a committee, I met the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women; she told me this bill was good for 
women, sensitive to people working part time and that they were 
going to benefit more from UI.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to speak this morning because, as my 
colleague for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans said, yesterday, 
women, major women groups in Quebec and Canada, the 
Fédération des femmes du Québec, the National Action Committee 
on the Status of Women, the Canadian Daycare Association, the 
National Association of Women and the Law condemned this 
unemployment insurance reform. These women came to tell the 
government this bill was going to penalize women. Why? Because 
69 per cent of women have part time jobs. Of these 69 per cent, 40 
per cent could not find a full time job and 20 to 30 per cent have 
family responsibilities. They are the ones who are going to be 
penalized.
<P>
	The Secretary of State responsible for the Status of Women 
claimed to be very sensitive to women's  economic situation. She 
cited alarming figures on women's poverty, on equality between 
men and women, since we know that it is men who hold full time 
jobs, who usually work more than 35 hours a week and who will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2227"> 2227 </A></B>
<P>
receive UI benefits. Linking benefits to the number of hours rather 
than the number of weeks will penalize this category of working 
women-and working men since young people are included.
<P>
	Second, part time employees working the same number of weeks 
will receive benefits for a much shorter period. Their benefits will 
be reduced and they will have to work for longer periods.
<P>
	What about women who work less than 35 hours a week? For 
women working in part time jobs for 15 weeks, one year will not be 
long enough to qualify for unemployment insurance. Part time 
workers will pay the same premiums as full time employees, but 
their benefits will be only half of those received by full timers.
<P>
	This government should be ashamed of introducing this bill; it 
does not care about women's economic situation, about the 
situation of women who work part time, about the situation of 
women who had to spend several years away from the workplace. 
What will they have to do to qualify? What will these women and 
young people going back to work or looking for their first job have 
to do? They will have to work harder in an economic context where 
jobs are scarce.
<P>
	Those who work part time may do so by choice, but they may 
also be unable to find full time jobs.
<P>
	What about those who will have to change jobs periodically 
because they cannot get full time employment? They, too, will be 
penalized. Why? Because they will not be lucky enough to hold full 
time positions.
<P>
	This bill would create two classes of workers. That is why 
women are outraged by it and want to condemn it. This is a major 
setback for the status of women. Requiring people to work 
twenty-six 35-hour weeks makes it twice as hard for them, and 
women will not be able to meet that requirement; it will mean 910 
hours of work a year, at a time when, as we all know, it is hard to 
find a full time job.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Quite often, people will have to work for more than one year just 
to qualify. That is why I am very pleased to see that other 
organizations besides the Bloc have made the same analysis, 
organizations that the government might find more credible than us 
and that will be able, we hope, to convince the government that its 
bill, in its current form, will not help to improve the fragile 
financial situation of both women and young people.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the government of the loss of the 
Canadian advisory council on the status of women, which could, on 
a day like today, point out to the government that it is going in the 
wrong direction. In  fact, I reminded the minister as recently as 
yesterday that it was her government that abolished this major 
advisory council that could recommend government priorities on 
the status of women.
<P>
	There are two categories of unemployed workers. Members of 
the first one who often claim unemployment insurance benefits 
will be penalized. Their benefits will be reduced by 1 percentage 
point for every 20 weeks. So, they will have to work longer for less. 
In the meantime, the government is setting aside for itself a very 
generous $5 billion fund at the expense of contributing employees 
and employers. Employees thought they were insured, but that 
insurance no longer exists because the federal government, which 
does not contribute to the unemployment insurance fund, is 
keeping these $5 billion to reduce its deficit or to give out a few 
small grants as it pleases in order to make its presence felt in the 
provinces.
<P>
	The government is also insensitive to the consensus in Quebec to 
regain control over the budgets for manpower training. In fact, it 
used the name employment insurance to interfere even more in job 
training and policy control. This is exactly the opposite of what was 
requested by Quebec's social and economic community, and that 
includes not only the Bloc Quebecois, not only sovereignists, but 
also federalists who want a true employment policy.
<P>
	To create a true employment policy, one must have the necessary 
budget. This government increases its spending power, which is a 
shame since unemployment insurance is funded by the provinces 
but it is the federal government that tells the provinces what kind of 
programs and what kind of measures must be implemented to help 
those who cannot find a job.
<P>
	I would like this government to respect the purpose of 
unemployment insurance, which is to ensure that workers will 
receive benefits while they are without a job. In tough times, we 
should do the opposite. If we did not have any money, if we did not 
have a surplus, I would understand why the government would 
want to establish such criteria, but not when it is keeping $5 billion 
to spend as it pleases.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the report stage of Bill C-12, an 
act to amend the employment insurance act.
<P>
	I want to speak on the intensity rule. The government believes 
steps had to be taken to protect the integrity of the employment 
insurance system, to ensure the millions of workers who contribute 
premiums continue to have confidence in a system which is both 
equitable and sustainable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2228"> 2228 </A></B>
<P>
	In seeking a solution which is fair and balanced I have proposed 
two very necessary amendments to Bill C-12. I am pleased to stand 
before the House today to report on these two amendments and to 
encourage opposition support for these two necessary amendments. 
These amendments will increase fairness and will help those 
people most in need. Those are the people the opposition members 
also should care about.
<P>
	The first amendment I proposed would exempt claimants in 
receipt of the family income supplement from the intensity rule. 
This would affect claimants and families with annual earnings of 
$26,000 or less.
<P>
	The second complementary amendment would see the provision 
of a credit to those who receive a reduced benefit as a result of 
working while on claim. An example of this would be if individuals 
claimed benefits for 24 weeks but due to working while collecting 
benefits their actual benefits are reduced by 50 per cent. These 
individuals would then be assumed to have accumulated only 12 
weeks of benefits for the purpose of the intensity rule. Therefore 
the next time they file for employment insurance benefits they 
would not be affected by the intensity rule.
<P>
	When considering this legislation we examined carefully ways 
to introduce reforms that are fair to people facing hardships. We 
tried to maintain incentives that would encourage people to take 
work when it is available, while at the same time ensuring all 
regions in the country are treated fairly and equitably.
<P>
	It is worthy to note that to achieve this balance and fairness 
minimal cost is involved. We sought a way to ensure this 
legislation would help those people most in need. Other 
amendments to Bill C-12 will bring changes to the gaps in 
earnings, to the divisor, which will mean people with low incomes 
and in high unemployment regions are not punished for 
circumstances often beyond their control.
<P>
	As a part of this package of amendments, my colleagues agreed 
with me the intensity rule change was necessary. I believe that rule 
was treating too harshly low income families, particularly those 
living in high unemployment regions. Under the original proposal 
the intensity rule would reduce the benefit rate by 1 per cent for 
every 20 weeks of regular benefits collected in the past five years 
up to a maximum of 5 per cent.
<P>
	The family income supplement will benefit 350,000 Canadians. I 
consider this supplement to be one of the many positive features of 
this legislation. It will ensure that claimants most in need of 
assistance will have the means to fulfil their family 
responsibilities. It will mean that low income claimants, perhaps 
with young families, will be able to obtain employment insurance 
benefits worth up to 80 per cent of their work income instead of the 
55 per cent normal benefit rate.
<P>
	Having fought for and won the inclusion of this basic income 
benefit level for low income families, I did not want to see this 
value undermined. We did not want to subject vulnerable members 
of our workforce to an intensity rule that would erode the value of 
their benefits by as much as five percentage points.
<P>
	Studies show that 188,000 claimants, ,or 54 per cent, receiving 
the family supplement would be affected by the intensity rule.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	While accepting the importance of maintaining the integrity of 
our employment system, it is important that we exempt family 
supplement recipients from the intensity rule, therefore protecting 
those Canadians most in need. To my mind, any family living on an 
income of under $26,000, which is the threshold for the family 
income supplement, has because of its difficult circumstances, 
sufficient incentive to take whatever work is available.
<P>
	The object of this reform is to help Canadians find and keep 
work. By exempting them from this rule, these claimants would on 
average see their total benefits increase by $128. Overall benefit 
payouts would increase by $24 million.
<P>
	The family supplement, by providing a somewhat larger benefit 
to low income claimants with children, will mean a bit of extra 
money available for those individuals to spend on such things as 
child care, in order to participate in employment benefits or to take 
additional training that would lead to a good job.
<P>
	We have also recognized the intensity rule is meant to provide an 
extra incentive for people to work as much as they can. It is a 
reality that many people work while they are collecting insurance 
benefits. Over a period of time claimants on EI may collect half of 
what they are entitled to because they may have earnings from part 
time work or small jobs.
<P>
	Under the initial bill, if a claimant collects 50 per cent of what 
the claimant is entitled to collect while on EI for 24 weeks, the 
entire 24 weeks would count when the intensity rule is applied to 
this person's future claim. We have agreed this part of the intensity 
rule is not only unfair but is an unintended disincentive to work. 
My Liberal colleagues have agreed with me on this.
<P>
	My second amendment to Bill C-12 would give people credit for 
work while on claim. By changing the intensity rule to account for 
work while on claim, we are encouraging claimants to accept 
whatever work is available, whenever it is available. This 
recognizes the principle that no matter how little or how much 
work is actually available, it has to pay people to work.
<P>
	The vast majority of people would rather be working than 
receiving benefits. I see this change to the intensity rule as a 
positive and fair measure. Claimants subject to  the intensity rule 
who work while on claim will earn work credits which will be 
prorated to reduce the impact of the intensity rule on future claims. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2229"> 2229 </A></B>
<P>
This amendment will encourage a trend toward a greater work 
effort creating more jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	These amendments agreed to by my Liberal colleagues show that 
if we fix the gap, if we adjust the divisor, if we change the intensity 
rule, we will have a better bill. We will do something for 
Canadians.
<P>
	I am encouraging support from my opposition colleagues. We 
will come a long way to increase fairness in the employment 
insurance system both to individuals and to regions, to provide 
additional incentives to work, recognizing the lack of work 
opportunities in high unemployment regions.
<P>
	An amended Bill C-12 with the gap, the divisor, the intensity 
rule all amended will create a system that will help create more 
jobs, that will help get more people back to work, that will support 
the federal job strategy. An amendment to the intensity rule will, 
most of all, create a system that is fairer for those in the workforce 
and for those who are not.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to please support these amendments, which 
will make this a fair and equitable bill for all Canadians in the 
workplace.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, here 
we are again discussing Bill C-12, a bill which in committee was 
subjected to time allocation, or at least limited debate. I would not 
be very surprised if we came up with another time allocation 
motion some time today to speed this bill along.
<P>
	The name has changed. I suppose that was thrown in as a sort of 
an appeasement to the Reform Party. We kept saying 
unemployment insurance should be more like employment 
insurance. It should be more like insurance.
<P>
	The Liberals said ``maybe we will just change the name and that 
will give the illusion that we have actually made an insurance 
policy out of this, that the emphasis now will be on employment 
rather than on unemployment''.
<P>
	Insurance means insurance whether it is called unemployment or 
employment insurance. That is perhaps the reason the bill should 
go back to the drawing board. Maybe we can get it right. In its 
present form it does not really resemble insurance in any way.
<P>
	Let us talk about insurance in the manner with which most 
Canadians are familiar. If you operate a motor vehicle, for instance, 
provincial law requires automobile insurance be purchased and 
maintained. If you have accidents regularly or if your car is stolen 
and you have to utilize insurance, you will find your rates will be 
increased according to the compensation paid by the insurance 
company.
<P>
	If it were a true insurance policy, why would it include training 
programs and make work programs that really are not make work 
programs at all? Anybody who benefits from the make work 
programs as they stand now are the bureaucracies.
<P>
	As far as training, we have heard from our colleagues in the Bloc 
they are most anxious to take over the manpower training 
provincially. If the government were to seek this, it would find the 
provinces agree that job training would be an area in which all 
provinces would be interested.
<P>
	When I asked the minister of HRD last December about changes 
to the delivery of the training programs, he said we really should be 
transferring resources to the people, to the private sector, to 
communities.
<P>
	If the minister agrees with that philosophy, if the provinces are 
willing to take on the training, if the private sector is willing to get 
involved, what is the stumbling block? The opposition certainly is 
not holding the government up on this. Why does it not go ahead 
and transfer these properties to the provinces where they would 
readily be accepted?
<P>
	How does the minister reconcile the department's continued 
involvement in training programs when the Prime Minister 
announced that labour training programs would be the sole 
responsibility of the provinces? This is very difficult for me to 
understand.
<P>
	A group of people in the fast food industry in my constituency 
wrote to me. They were very concerned about some of the 
provisions in this bill. One constituent basically said his costs will 
increase significantly if Bill C-12 becomes law. It is well on its way 
to becoming law.
<P>
	This operator employs around 90 people, many of whom are 
students, part time workers. They are still going to school. Part of 
the idea is that they earn enough money to defray part of their 
university tuition. He said: ``My customers are very price sensitive. 
I will have no choice but to cut back on employee hours and reduce 
the number of new hires in my business''. He went on to say that 
implementing this payroll tax runs counter to the government's job 
creation objectives and is inconsistent with its position that payroll 
taxes kill jobs. As a matter of fact the government's position is that 
by reducing the premiums by five cents per $100 of wages earned 
that thousands of jobs would be created.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	In light of the fact that the fund is predicted to increase to an $8 
billion surplus this year, why will the government not reduce the 
premiums by $1 per $100 and create millions of jobs? I am using 
the government's map here. If one reduction of five cents per $100 
will create so many jobs, why not create 20 times as many jobs? 
Why not go that route?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2230"> 2230 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and other members of the government 
have admitted that the real killer of jobs is high taxes. Taxation is 
the killer of jobs. This gentleman who runs a fast food business in 
my constituency agrees with that statement but he cannot 
understand why the minister, the committee and the government 
does not see fit to reduce payroll taxes even more, bearing in mind 
that there will a huge surplus in this fund.
<P>
	What possible reason could the government have to maintain 
such a high surplus? It says that times are not going to stay as good 
as they are. Perhaps the government is just creating a cushion for 
the downturn in the economy and the resulting jobs that may be 
lost. I do not know about that. Perhaps some creative bookkeeping 
is going on there. It seems to me that there never is a time when 
there is a surplus that one can actually put one's finger on. These 
surpluses seem to flow back and forth, and mostly forth into 
general revenue.
<P>
	We are confronted today with over 200 amendments. If we 
debate those amendments one at a time, it is certainly going to take 
a lot of time. However, it will be time well spent. We should be able 
to debate this bill so that we actually dissect it. Eventually we will 
wind up putting it back together in a form that will be acceptable to 
Canadians, not only to the people who have to use UI from time to 
time but to those people who are employing the workforce of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak today with great regret and sadness at the direction being 
taken by Bill C-12, an act respecting employment insurance in 
Canada.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to speak about this government. The 
federal government has brought in time allocation, allowing only 
10 hours to study these numerous amendments to a regressive, 
anti-employment, poverty creating bill whose effects are complex.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	This government wants to rush its reforms through on the backs 
of workers and the poor, while relieving the more fortunate 
members of our society of the social and financial burden. Its often 
arbitrary measures, which do not respect the democratic right of 
opposition members, make it more difficult for us to do the job for 
which we were elected.
<P>
	I would also like to draw attention to an excellent article that 
appeared today in <I>Le Devoir</I>, that is a very good analysis of the 
situation that Bill C-12 will create. This article says that the reform 
is part of a policy that consists in using the unemployment 
insurance fund to finance a growing number of activities other than 
the payment of benefits.
<P>
	I invite the public to take the time to read it. It will give them a 
very good idea of what Bill C-12 is going to mean for us.
<P>
	The article can be broken down into eight sections: 1) 
constitutionality; 2) federal jurisdiction; 3) federal disengagement; 
4) the federal government's financial participation; 5) the 
disadvantaged; 6) a regressive tax; 7) the provinces' responsibility; 
and 8) the conclusion.
<P>
	I will read parts of the article to give members an idea of what it 
is about. First of all, this article was written by lawyers specializing 
in social law, meaning that we can easily use it as a reference. On 
constitutionality, the article says: ``The employment insurance bill 
is part of a policy which consists in dipping into the unemployment 
insurance fund to finance a growing number of activities other than 
payment of benefits. Not only is this injurious to a growing number 
of contributors' right to benefits, but its constitutionality is far 
from certain as well''.
<P>
	In the second part of the article, to which I would give the title 
``federal jurisdiction'', we can read the following: ``In 1940 when 
the provinces consented to having this social insurance scheme 
placed under federal jurisdiction, as an exception, the 
constitutional amendment was to be precisely worded so as to turn 
over to the federal level only the creation and administration of an 
unemployment insurance plan''.
<P>
	The third part deals with federal disengagement. It speaks of 
``disengagement of state responsibility with respect to the 
unemployed, coupled with a growing use of the unemployment 
insurance account for purposes other than payment of benefits''.
<P>
	The fourth part deals with financial participation: ``In 1977, 
various measures relating to job sharing, job creation and training 
were introduced into the legislation, and these were funded from 
the financial contributions of the federal government to the UI fund 
for the purpose of paying for those measures in future''.
<P>
	Succinctly, what the article tells us is that the federal 
government sloughed off its responsibility at some point. Initially, 
it was paying for the measures it imposed upon us, while now it no 
longer contributes to the UI fund. Only the employers and 
employees do.
<P>
	On the subject of the disadvantaged, we can read as follows: 
``Moreover, a 1990 study commissioned by the Quebec department 
of manpower and income security concluded that female single 
parents were particularly affected by these legislative changes to 
the unemployment insurance program. A large number of these 
women would have to go on welfare''.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Regarding the regressive tax, they write: ``By using UI 
premiums to pay for things other than benefits, the federal 
legislation turns them into a regressive tax due to the fact that the 
maximum pensionable income is  $29,000 a year. With regard to 
provincial responsibilities, not only does the federal government 
interfere in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2231"> 2231 </A></B>
<P>
areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, such as manpower and 
social assistance, but it does it with money collected as UI 
premiums, and not through its spending power. When it comes to 
unemployment insurance, Parliament's responsibility is to collect 
premiums in order to compensate insured workers should they be 
become unemployed. It cannot use this money for other things, 
thus depriving contributors of the protection they are entitled to''.
<P>
	The conclusion reads as follows: ``This new direction taken by 
the plan is more harmful to certain members of society. From now 
on, some will be excluded from the plan, among them a majority of 
women and young people. Because of their precarious position at 
the bottom of the labour market scale, women and young people 
are especially affected by the current restructuring of the labour 
market, which has resulted in higher unemployment. Any decrease 
in basic UI coverage, especially tightening the eligibility criteria, is 
particularly harmful to these groups''.
<P>
	In short, these experts, these lawyers specialized in social law, 
give a very good summary of all the elements, all the cases brought 
to your attention. The bottom line is that Bill C-12 will do much 
more harm than good.
<P>
	This sums up the many hours the Bloc Quebecois spent 
questioning the government. Why? Why introduce a bill aimed at 
cutting benefits, a punitive bill that does not take the new labour 
market into consideration? Why reduce the insurable maximum 
earnings from $42,380 to $39,000, at a cost of $900 million to the 
fund? Why? Why should workers earning $39,000 or less and their 
employers be the only ones sharing costs between them, especially 
since the surplus is being used to reduce the deficit?
<P>
	Why introduce this fixed period mechanism to determine 
earnings, if not to cut benefits? Why introduce the intensity rule, if 
not to penalize workers whose jobs are not permanent and who are 
having a hard time making ends meet by working on contract or 
taking temporary, part time or, again, seasonal jobs? Why cut 
insurable weekly earnings and annualize premiums?
<P>
	This unfair, regressive, anti-employment bill creates poverty and 
discriminates against women and young people. It creates a strong 
tendency to increase overtime and cut wages at a time when the 
social and economic impact will be devastating. It completely 
overlooks the strong growth in self-employment. If the bill changes 
the system's name from unemployment to employment insurance, 
why is the $5 billion surplus being used for something else than job 
creation?
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill is a faithful reflection of this government. 
It touches on everything yet solves nothing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise at this 
time because of what I see are points raised by members opposite 
which are off the mark especially relative to manpower training. I 
want to set the record straight as it relates to Bill C-12.
<P>
	The Government of Canada does recognize that labour market 
training is a responsibility of provincial governments, linked to 
their responsibility for education.
<P>
	The proposed employment insurance act, Bill C-12, provides for 
a range of employment measures which opposition members well 
know are to help unemployed Canadians find and keep work. These 
measures could include: wage subsidies, income supplements, 
support for self-employment, partnerships for job creation and skill 
loans and grants. In line with the government's commitment to 
training, skill loans and grants will only be implemented with the 
consent of the province concerned, including Quebec.
<P>
	This bill is a major step beyond the path of the UI program of the 
past. It focuses on jobs in providing unemployed workers with the 
tools they need to get back to work. One of the great strengths of 
the bill is that it clarifies more than ever before federal 
responsibilities in this area. It commits the federal government to 
work in concert with the provinces and territories to help people 
find jobs.
<P>
	With employment insurance, the federal government will phase 
out training purchases, apprenticeship programs, co-operative 
education and workplace based training. Any employment measure 
that involves training such as skill loans and grants to individuals 
will only be used in a province with the province's consent.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will seek formal agreements with 
each province on the design and delivery of the new employment 
benefits to harmonize these with provincial programs and eliminate 
overlap and duplication. These agreements might take many 
different forms depending on the priority of each province. If a 
province wants more control, the bill allows the federal 
government to delegate administration of federal employment 
measures to a province or even to fund provincial programs in 
place of federal ones if they achieve the same results.
<P>
	Results are what really matter to Canadians, no matter who 
delivers the employment benefits. Flexibility, co-operation and 
partnerships are the key to getting results.
<P>
	Employment insurance through Bill C-12 allows new 
partnerships to develop and evolve for the future. It will lead to a 
more effective labour market development better matched to local 
market realities. It will get rid of wasteful overlap and duplication. 
It will focus all our resources and energies on the real challenge at 
hand, helping Canadians find and keep jobs. That is the  important 
purpose of manpower training. It is to give people the skills so they 
can have the skills in place to attract business to their province and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2232"> 2232 </A></B>
<P>
regions, and then have the opportunity to take on those new jobs in 
the marketplace of the future.
<P>
	Canadians want their governments to work together. 
Employment insurance reflects the commitment of the 
Government of Canada to work with the provinces, a commitment 
to a federalism that will work for all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the hon. member for Malpeque, but I did not understand the 
allusion he made to the bill at the beginning of his comments. I will 
simply remind him that, when his government formed the 
opposition and the former Conservative government proposed an 
unemployment insurance reform, Liberal members made a big fuss 
to show that they could not support the Conservative government.
<P>
	Today, this bill includes just about the same measures. Today, the 
Liberals feel that these changes are appropriate, while before they 
fought them tooth and nail. This is a case of double standard; the 
Liberals' outlook changes depending on where they sit in this 
House. Such is the true face of this government.
<P>
	When legislation is introduced, it should apply to all concerned. 
However, this bill will not apply to all jobless people in this 
country, since more than half of them will not be eligible for 
unemployment benefits. More than half are excluded. What will 
happen to these people?
<P>
	These 50 per cent will find themselves in pretty dire straits, and 
will include people from all groups, including young people, 
women and single parent families. Again, what will happen to 
these 50 per cent of unemployed people who will not be eligible for 
unemployment benefits? They will end up on the welfare rolls, of 
course.
<P>
	And who will have to pay for this reform? The taxpayers in every 
province concerned. Consequently, in Quebec and elsewhere in 
Canada, governments will have to increase social assistance 
budgets to deal with this new problem.
<P>
	If the bill is passed, it will be disastrous for the country as a 
whole. Year after year, my region and my riding win the prize for 
the highest unemployment rate in the country. On behalf of my 
constituents, I have to say that enough is enough. We can no longer 
tolerate this situation.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance issue has much more to do with 
the current lack of jobs. Did the members opposite propose 
programs, initiatives or ways to create jobs? No. The government 
prefers to introduce measures such as this one, which, incidentally, 
will not cost it  anything, since employers and employees are the 
ones making direct contributions to the unemployment insurance 
fund.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Of course, all the money collected does not necessarily go to 
those to whom it belongs, the people who contributed. A fair 
proportion of it is even used to reduce the deficit and the debt of our 
country. That is something the people in my riding will not put up 
with. What the people want most is a bill or programs that will 
create jobs. The bill before us does not deal with the real challenge 
we face concerning our social programs. The real challenge is, of 
course, to create jobs.
<P>
	How do you expect our young people to complete their education 
in a decent fashion if we do not make it possible for them to find a 
good job when they graduate, not a precarious and low paid job like 
we see too many of these days, but a worthwhile job? They should 
be able to get jobs that will allow them to work enough hours to 
earn a decent salary, enough to pay back their student loans and live 
normally. By that I mean being able to take on new responsibilities, 
such as having a family of their own and being able to provide for 
their children's education. I do not mean having children just for 
the sake of having children and not giving them anything, or just 
leaving them with a debt and deficit; I mean giving them the 
collective tools they need to grow and prosper.
<P>
	In my region, this bill has been criticized by community, 
humanitarian and social groups, by workers, by unions, by less 
organized people, by everyone. Does the government not hear all 
these people? Despite what the government would like the public to 
believe, these people are not all extremists, they are not all 
militants and they are not all lazy. They are not all separatists 
either. There are federalists who have opposed this legislation.
<P>
	Why are we unable to reach those people across the way? Why 
do they not listen to their hearts instead of engaging in a reform that 
will involve so many technicalities that the most experienced 
officials will have difficulty finding their way through them? They 
will have difficulty solving problems that are submitted to us on a 
regular basis. We are the ones who deal with people who have 
problems and who do not know where to go to be treated fairly.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to share with you an experience from the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. Alcan workers there have 
implemented a formula that creates jobs, and I urge the government 
to take advantage of that experience. It is a job sharing formula that 
will create, in the short term, close to 110 jobs and, of course, many 
indirect jobs.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2233"> 2233 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	If the job sharing formula initiated by Alcan workers was 
applied to all businesses of 20 employees or more in Quebec, it 
could create 120,000 direct jobs.
<P>
	The government could follow this example and implement a job 
sharing formula without dipping into the unemployment insurance 
fund. We could then spend the unemployment insurance fund 
surplus. I am sure all Canadians would support such measures 
which would help us create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak at report stage of Bill C-12 
concerning unemployment insurance, or, if you prefer, to use the 
government's misleading terminology, the bill concerning 
employment insurance.
<P>
	At this stage, I would like to remind you of the Bloc's position 
concerning unemployment insurance reform and its 
transformation, as if by magic, into an employment insurance 
program. Like the majority of Quebecers, like the majority of 
Canadians who have already demonstrated their dissatisfaction 
with the planned reform throughout the country, like the witnesses 
who appeared before the human resources development committee, 
75 per cent of the witnesses, 75 per cent of the briefs submitted to 
the committee, we are strongly opposed to Bill C-12.
<P>
	We are asking, and we will continue to ask until the last possible 
minute, because that is what Quebecers and Canadians want, that 
this bill be withdrawn, scrapped, and that there be a real 
unemployment insurance program, a real program concerning the 
job market, a real comprehensive policy combining the income 
security needed by men and women who may find themselves 
unemployed, which can happen anytime to anyone, with job 
training and active employment measures.
<P>
	In other words, it is important to come up with a real 
unemployment insurance reform corresponding to the present job 
market, and to ensure that people who find themselves in this 
unfortunate situation are able in the short or medium term to 
re-enter the job market with lasting results.
<P>
	What the reform presents us with is not really that. We are faced 
with an unfair bill. A regressive bill. An anti-employment bill. We 
are faced with a bill with the potential to create more poverty than 
it alleviates.
<P>
	Changing a bill's name from unemployment insurance to 
employment insurance is easily done, but the reality is that 
employment has never been a concern of this government. The 
precarious job situation has never been the focus in any way of this 
government's concerns, nor has the unemployment situation been 
the object of any really serious efforts by this government.
<P>
	How can this government have any real credibility, when even 
the Prime Minister stated some months ago to a select audience in 
Toronto that he considered Canada's unemployed to be lazy 
beer-drinkers?
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	How can we think that this government can focus in any way 
whatsoever on the situation of the least advantaged in society, when 
only a few weeks ago the Minister of Human Resources 
Development told us that those demonstrating their displeasure 
with the government were extremists, separatists? I would remind 
you that such displeasure was being shown even in his own riding, 
that there were demonstrations in his riding, unless of course his 
constituents include sovereignists and separatists, or were 
supported by them.
<P>
	But for him it boiled down to that: people were extremists 
because they would not stand still to have their legs chopped off, as 
Bill C-12 proposes, or separatists, or what the Prime Minister 
called lazy people who ought to be out working instead of 
demonstrating. So that is the vision of this government as far as the 
most disadvantaged members of society are concerned.
<P>
	This bill which, among other things, raises the number of hours 
worked required in order to collect UI, while decreasing the 
amount of benefits considerably, ought to simply be withdrawn. 
The government must admit that it has made a mistake with this. It 
needs to get back to the drawing board, to rework a real 
employment insurance plan, one which suits the work force's 
needs.
<P>
	The other day, I was listening to the Minister of Economic 
Development for PEI, Robert Morrissey. He said that for Prince 
Edward Island alone, the loss of revenue for the 1996-97 fiscal year 
would be $15 million. This is a disaster for such a small province.
<P>
	I was discussing this issue with my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup and, according to him, the Lower 
St. Lawrence area, where under-employment is most serious, will 
lose $20 million this year if the minister's bill is implemented.
<P>
	I remind the House that last year this government had already 
deprived Quebecers and Canadians of about $2,4 billion by 
shamefully slashing UI funds, benefits paid to the most needy in 
our society.
<P>
	Bill C-17 we considered last year was less harmful than the 
reform proposed today, so you can imagine the results if it is 
implemented. I remind members that, in Quebec alone, some 
46,000 people were totally excluded from the labour market last 
year because of the policy of restraint already announced in the 
finance minister's budget.
<P>
	I find unacceptable that a government which ran on the promise 
of job creation and supposedly on the basis of a social vision for the 
most disadvantaged, could take 46,000 people out of the labour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2234"> 2234 </A></B>
<P>
force with the stroke of a  pen, by adopting brutal measures that did 
not meet the needs of the most needy of our society.
<P>
	Meanwhile, this government prides itself on having built up 
surpluses in the UI fund. It boasts about accumulating a minimum 
of $5 billion annually from employers' and employees' 
contributions. What is this government doing with this $5 billion, 
when it has dipped into Canadians' and Quebecers' pockets, 
literally robbed them of more than $2 billion since last year along 
with another several hundred million dollars this year with new 
measures? During this time, it takes an accumulated surplus of $5 
billion annually to reduce its deficit so that the Minister of Finance 
appears to be a good manager by controlling the course of the 
deficit. This way of operating is unacceptable.
<P>
	And when things start to heat up, and the lid on the pot is lifting, 
the government has three courses of action. It tries to buy people, 
just as the Minister of Finance did recently with the three maritime 
provinces when he offered $961 million for a pseudo reform of the 
GST, which has really left his government squirming of late.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	When buying people does not work-I hope the people of the 
maritimes will not be foolish enough to swallow the GST reform, 
take $961 million in compensation and permit a reform that will 
spell catastrophe for their community in the coming years-this 
government becomes cynical, gets carried away and tries to trick 
people as to its intentions or its actions.
<P>
	We heard all that was said by the Minister of National Defence in 
response to questioning on the many scandals in his department 
and by the Prime Minister in an attempt to convince us, Quebecers 
and Canadians, that he had resolved the problem of the GST, when 
the problem remains intact, even with the resignation of the Deputy 
Prime Minister. And when that does not work either, the 
government has a third approach to getting or trying to get people 
to swallow what it is pushing and that is by gagging the opposition 
and this Parliament.
<P>
	Since last week, we have been gagged three times and thus 
prevented from debating, until basic issues like Bill C-12 die.
<P>
	The first gag was applied to this bill, and the time for members' 
debate in the House of Commons was limited. This time serves to 
help Quebecers and Canadians, who are being had by this 
government, understand that it says one thing and does another. 
The second was applied to Bill C-31, which included a section on 
the scandalous agreement between the federal government and the 
three maritime provinces on the GST. The third was applied to 
human rights, and a gag was also imposed on that debate yesterday.
<P>
	This way of operating is unacceptable and we are voicing, 
through this analysis at report stage of Bill C-12, our 
dissatisfaction with the intentions of the government  in its 
shameful reform of the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this bill and have an opportunity to correct the 
record. I feel it necessary also to reflect on the comments of my 
colleague opposite. At some point all discussion has taken place. 
Canadians expect government to get on with the business of doing 
business. I do not think closure in this case is an unacceptable 
measure.
<P>
	Some questions have been raised about why the government is 
funding employment measures through the employment insurance 
fund. It is important that people recognize that these are active 
measures that help Canadians prepare for, find and keep jobs. 
These measures are a long term investment in the reduction of 
unemployment which I believe are a legitimate way to spend 
contributions collected from employers and employees.
<P>
	The federal government is mindful of the responsibility it has to 
safeguard the EI fund. Therefore there are some legitimate 
eligibility requirements. There is access to the fund. Ceilings to the 
fund will be put in place, and checks and balances to make sure 
there is an accountability framework to ensure monitoring of the 
results. Some of the consolidated revenue fund moneys will be 
available for groups or individuals who may not be eligible for EI 
funded measures such as youth and aboriginals.
<P>
	There are two other areas I will speak on, the issues that have 
been raised with regard to the new employment insurance system, 
and how it will impact on women and low income parents. A great 
deal of misinformation has been spread on this issue.
<P>
	Let us set the record straight and get some facts on the table. 
Mothers and low income people will benefit from the employment 
insurance system the government is proposing to put in place. 
Employment insurance is much more inclusive than the old system. 
Under EI, all part time work will now be insured, which is a major 
boost to women who comprise nearly 70 per cent of the part time 
workforce.
<P>
	For the first time about 270,000 women who hold down part time 
jobs of fewer than 15 hours each will have their work insured. 
Under EI all the hours count toward a claim. Consider women who 
work at several jobs, perhaps three jobs of 13 hours a week each. 
Their take home pay would be based on 39 to 40 hours. They will 
be fully insured if they suddenly become sick or they take parental 
leave or should they lose one or two of those jobs. For those women 
who just work 13 or 14 hours a week that income is critical to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2235"> 2235 </A></B>
<P>
success and the livelihood of their family. They too if they lose that 
job will have EI benefits. That family will continue to have a  
source of income while she goes out and looks for a second job.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	EI provides opportunities for women to increase their work by 
lifting that 15 hour glass ceiling. Some people want to work more 
than the 15 hours but some employers restrict part time workers to 
fewer than 15 hours to avoid having to pay premiums. That is not 
acceptable.
<P>
	EI provides special help for mothers and low income parents. It 
recognizes the importance of providing income protection to 
women who are raising families. The family income supplement 
for low income families with children will raise weekly benefits up 
to 80 per cent of average earnings. By the year 2001 when EI is 
fully implemented, they will receive 12 per cent more than they do 
today.
<P>
	The changes which I am going to discuss next are as a result of 
one of the backbenchers who has made a difference here in the 
House, the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore. She brought in 
several worthwhile amendments at the committee stage and she 
should be commended for her work on that front.
<P>
	Because of the amendments of the member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore the intensity rule will not apply to 108,000 
women who receive the family income supplement and have a 
history of past use. The intensity rule reduces the benefit rate by 1 
per cent for every 20 weeks of regular benefits claimed over the 
past five years.
<P>
	Because of the amendment of the member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore single parent families, most of whom are 
headed by women, with incomes below $26,000 will receive an 
average of 13 per cent more benefits under EI. More women will be 
able to continue working while on claim. All claimants will be able 
to take temporary work and earn at least $50 a week without 
reducing their benefits. We provide that encouragement to people 
to add to their family income.
<P>
	Women who earn $2,000 or less a year will have any premiums 
they pay refunded through the income tax system which is another 
important change.
<P>
	EI will mean that more mothers and low income families will be 
eligible for employment benefits to help get them back into the 
workforce. I am constantly faced with cases in my riding where 
people cannot get back in. They do not have access to those 
opportunities because they were not receiving in the past.
<P>
	Women who return to work after caring for children will have 
access to EI special employment benefits if they have collected 
parental benefits or maternity leave in the past five years. Under EI 
women who have exhausted an EI claim within the past three years 
will be eligible for help through these active employment benefits. 
About 45 per cent of social assistance recipients currently in  
Canada will meet these eligibility requirements. These will make a 
difference for people. EI's employment benefits will help low 
income Canadians and women re-entering the workforce to acquire 
the skills that they need to find work.
<P>
	Jobs for Canadians is the fundamental objective of our federal 
job strategy. We campaigned on jobs and growth. We are trying to 
create an environment where businesses can go out and create jobs, 
where people can get themselves skilled so they can be the best 
employees and they can find meaningful work.
<P>
	These employment benefit measures that we are talking about 
have been field tested with great success. They are proven to help 
women who have been unemployed for long periods to get back 
into the workforce and increase their earnings. The best social 
security system we have in this country is a job. These tools will 
help women to boost their earnings. They will contribute to their 
job stability and blaze new trails in non-traditional occupations.
<P>
	For example, the targeted wage subsidies to employers can help 
level the playing field for people facing disadvantages in the 
workforce, like women. Studies show that this approach does work. 
It can mean an increase of $5,000 a year on average in earnings. Of 
course child care support will be available for women receiving 
employment benefits. That is something I welcome as great news.
<P>
	One of the things we talked about was the employment benefits 
and how this new system will help people get jobs. About 400,000 
unemployed workers each year may qualify for new employment 
insurance benefits, things like these wage subsidies or 
self-employment assistance, things that have been tested and 
proven to help people get back to work.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Part II of Bill C-12 sets out the basic principles for these 
employment benefits and measures but they will be highly flexible. 
They will be easy to use. They will be easy to adapt to an 
individual's needs and circumstances. They will focus first and last 
on getting results no matter how they are delivered.
<P>
	That is something all members of Parliament face every day in 
their constituencies. Some remarks from people are: ``I am just 
falling through this system. I just missed this eligibility 
requirement. If only I had this, then I could take this program. I am 
taking a program that is completely unspecific to what I want to do 
in the future but it is the only thing I am qualified for and my 
family needs this income''.
<P>
	These EI changes will make a difference to them. The old 
programs as I have implied are rigid, inefficient or just do not 
work. They will be eliminated. Instead, we will have a simpler set 
of tools designed to work at a grassroots level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2236"> 2236 </A></B>
<P>
	Importantly, and I think constituents are looking for this kind of 
co-operation, we are putting the old turf wars behind us and 
concentrating together with the provincial governments on getting 
Canadians back to work. Bill C-12 commits the Government of 
Canada to work in concert with provincial and territorial 
governments in delivering employment benefits to Canadians.
<P>
	New partnerships in delivery arrangements will match 
employment measures to local labour market needs and will 
eliminate the overlap and confusion over delivery by different 
levels of government. That will mean more effective help for 
unemployed Canadians. Is that not what we are here for?
<P>
	Bill C-12 also sets the foundation for a better, more effective 
national employment service, the information and advisory service 
that currently helps about two million Canadians a year. A stronger, 
automated job information and labour exchange will tell people 
where the jobs are. More effective job search services will help 
insurance claimants return to work as quickly as possible.
<P>
	This is the kind of employment insurance system Canadians 
want and it is the kind of system they need. It is more active. It will 
get results. It is what Canadians have been asking us for. It is an 
affordable, stronger, modernized system that focuses on jobs. It 
will do a better job of helping Canadians. It will help to keep 
Canadians working. Surely that is the fundamental objective of the 
federal government's jobs strategy and something all of us should 
be committed to.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to pass this bill with great speed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on this bill at report stage and also 
to join forces with the Bloc members who worked so courageously 
on the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
	This appears to be ``forget about past promises week'' for the 
government. After the GST and after a free vote on such a 
fundamental piece of legislation as the one adding sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination, when the 
government had promised a party vote and instead let its members 
vote freely on the bill, now we are asked to swallow hard and let 
this unemployment insurance reform be rammed through the 
House.
<P>
	I am pleased to join in the debate because, on April 9, I held a 
special information day in my riding on UI reform. About fifteen 
organizations took part in this review of the reform, based on 
government material. Most groups told us that this reform could in 
no way be considered a possible basis for changes to the plan.
<P>
	As usual, the government would have us believe that it is driven 
by the determination to reform social programs. However, this was 
not part of its election  platform. Sometimes, you have to read 
between the lines instead of only looking at broken promises such 
as the scrapping of the GST; the Prime Minister does not seem to 
know that scrapping does not mean harmonizing, he remains the 
only one to believe he is right when his own finance minister and 
deputy prime minister, under public pressure, have made amends.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Besides, a very interesting statement of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was quoted in <I>La Presse </I>of March 16, 
1996. The article said: ``The Minister of Human Resources 
Development is willing to consider all the women's groups' 
concerns about the unemployment insurance reform, but he warned 
everyone that any amendment to the plan would have to be 
implemented within the existing financial framework''. There you 
have it: what counts is the financial framework and not the reform. 
The article went on to say: ``The government intends to fully 
respect the financial parameters set for the unemployment 
insurance reform''.
<P>
	Before I talk about unemployment insurance as such, I would 
like to say a few words about the five proposed measures which 
will replace the 39 back to work programs.
<P>
	All the organizations I have consulted reminded me that there is 
a certain amount of cynicism, if not hypocrisy, in this amendment. 
In the throne speech, it was said that the federal government was 
committed to transferring the responsibility for vocational training 
back to the provinces.
<P>
	We reminded the government about the consensus in Quebec and 
about the minister who, at the Quebec conference on economic 
development, tried to call the Quebec organizations to order, even 
saying that the Conseil du patronat du Québec was not part of the 
consensus. The consensus is very real and it applies not only to all 
vocational training measures but also to all active unemployment 
insurance measures.
<P>
	Therefore, it must be said again that, first of all, the official 
opposition and all interested parties in Quebec want Quebec to 
have exclusive jurisdiction over all vocational training and 
manpower training policies.
<P>
	All the organizations consulted said it is clear that the purpose of 
the reform is to cut a further $2 billion, and that this government is 
behaving exactly like the previous Tory government: it is cutting 
social programs in order to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	When he announced $300 million worth of changes in the 
amendments, he said that would be offset by stronger re-entry 
measures. If he had so much confidence in his measures for 
re-entry into the labour force, why would he cut unemployment 
insurance? The number of unemployed would go down by itself 
and so would program costs. But no. He has so little confidence in 
his measures that he will cut the program anyway, to be sure  to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2237"> 2237 </A></B>
<P>
save $2 billion. These measures are not fair and should be 
condemned.
<P>
	As to the insurance program, it is clear to us that it is a social 
program reform done at the expense of the neediest in our society, 
that is the unemployed, welfare recipients, the young, women and 
new entrants. On the whole, the unemployment insurance reform, 
as proposed, is unfair, regressive, job-killing and poverty-inducing. 
Eligibility requirements have been tightened. In order to be eligible 
to the program, people now have to work 420 and 700 hours, 
instead of 180 and 300 hours, more than double what it was.
<P>
	For their part, new entrants to the labour market will need three 
times as many hours of work, that is to say 910 hours, to be eligible 
for the program. There are therefore two categories of unemployed: 
ordinary unemployed and frequent unemployed. And it no only 
applies to the regions; it also applies to people in Montreal, to self 
employed workers and part time workers.
<P>
	I started in the labour force in a weekend corner store job to pay 
for my studies, and I feel affected by that. We are not talking only 
about workers in the regions, Montreal will also be affected by 
these measures.
<P>
	Those who received payments in the past will see their benefits 
reduced from 55 to 50 per cent, in negative increments of 1 per cent 
for each 20-week period of benefits previously received. On the 
one hand, we are told that every hour of work will count, even the 
first 15, to allow these workers to have access to unemployment 
insurance but, on the other hand, we are making eligibility rules so 
tough they will not have access to the program.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	It says that the first $2,000, those who earn $2,000 and less 
during the year will be able to receive a tax refund. The weakest, 
the neediest in our society will have to finance the federal 
government for one year. How nice. People will have to work 
longer to receive less benefits and for a shorter period. It is the low 
income people who will suffer the most from the implementation 
of these measures.
<P>
	As for setting maximum insurable earnings at $39,000, that is 
another nice measure. The workers who earn the most will be given 
a tax cut because they will no longer have to pay premiums above 
the $39,000 threshold, but the people who work 15 hours or less 
will be taxed. Strangely, the premium cut for some people is 
roughly equivalent to the new premium for others. That is strange. 
And to top it all off, this measure is being called a job creation 
measure.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has said it 
well; business people would do well to have employees earning 
more than $39,000 work overtime, because they will no longer 
have to pay premiums, rather  than hiring a part time worker for 
whom they would have to pay premiums. That is regressive and 
anti-employment. The more the worker will earn money, the more 
his premium rate will decrease, because he will no longer pay any 
premiums after reaching $39,000. That is a gift from workers who 
earn more than $2,000, but who are unable to qualify because of the 
number of hours and of the other measures, to workers who earn 
more than $39,000. A real nice gift.
<P>
	The cap of $39,000 on maximum insurable earnings is also a gift 
to capital intensive businesses, at the expense of labour intensive 
businesses. It is more interesting to have fewer employees than to 
have more. Finally, small businesses are being penalized.
<P>
	The reform encourages people to do overtime. The idea is to 
reduce the work week to reinforce job creation. This bill goes 
totally against the current. The unemployment insurance reform 
will put undue pressure on the reform of employment, which is 
already precarious. Jobs, jobs, jobs, a lot of jobs will be cut. Nice 
program.
<P>
	The new measures, by reducing the benefit rate, by taxing 
workers starting from the first hour, by establishing more stringent 
eligibility criteria while making certain people ineligible, are also 
contributing to an increased transfer of the unemployment 
insurance clientele toward social welfare. And the government is 
dumping its responsibility in the provinces' backyard, as it did for 
transfer programs. The Liberal government is not taking its 
responsibilities. This is ``forget about past promises week'', the 
week of consummate hypocrisy. Good show.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate on the amendments to the former 
Unemployment Insurance Act which, ironically, as everyone 
knows, will now be called the Employment Insurance Act. This in 
itself is indicative of the government's cynicism, a government 
with a long experience in that area. This is a textbook illustration of 
how supposedly serious and responsible commitments made by 
this government during the 1993 election campaign were never 
fulfilled. Indeed, this is another perfect example of the Liberals 
modus operandi.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Before going any further, I want to congratulate my fellow Bloc 
colleagues who worked very hard on this issue, particularly the 
hon. member for Mercier, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, as well as my friend and 
colleague, the hon. member for Lévis, who worked literally day 
and night to fight this cynical bill, which goes against public 
interest.
<P>
	Several members have already said, and so will others, that this 
is an unfair, regressive and anti-employment measure. It has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2238"> 2238 </A></B>
<P>
nothing to do with employment  insurance. It does not promote job 
creation: it promotes poverty.
<P>
	This measure is quite simply patterned on what the 
Conservatives intended to do, had they remained in office. It is 
based on the most petty neo-Liberal movement, a movement that 
targets the poor and excludes an increasing number of people, not 
only in Quebec, in Canada and in America, but all over the world, a 
movement that must be scrutinized, analyzed and criticized, 
because a measure such as this one, given what is involved, will be 
followed by others, even though it goes against public interest, or 
the interest of humankind, as Victor Hugo said.
<P>
	We can never overemphasize the fact that this is a cynical 
change. My comments will deal more specifically with one aspect 
of this major overhaul that is not only of local interest, in fact it is 
more of a technical nature. I am referring to the restructuring of the 
employment centres network, more specifically the UI and 
employment offices in my own region of Mauricie. My speech is 
for my constituents in the riding of Trois-Rivières who are the 
victims of an arbitrary, irresponsible and indefensible measure, all 
this because of the fluke election of the Liberal candidate in the 
riding of Saint-Maurice, who is now the Prime Minister of Canada 
and who was before the member for Beauséjour.
<P>
	The member for Beauséjour, who was Leader of the Opposition 
at the time, back in March 1993, wrote to a movement for the 
defence of the poor in the Montreal region, regarding the attitude of 
the Conservative government, whose example he now follows. The 
letter, dated March 26, 1993, had the official letterhead of the 
office of the Leader of the Official Opposition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Liberals are dismayed by these measures. By reducing benefits and 
penalizing even more those who voluntarily quit their job, it is obvious that the 
government cares little about the victims of the economic crisis. Instead of 
going to the root of the problem, it targets the unemployed. Moreover these 
measures will have disturbing consequences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what the former member for Beauséjour and Leader of 
the Opposition, who has since become the member for 
Saint-Maurice, the riding next to mine, wrote in March 1993. This 
is totally beneath contempt. The proposed measure is unfair to 
residents of the Mauricie, since it targets people who are already in 
trouble. Those who are unemployed, who are on welfare and who 
want to improve their lot must work at it, they must go the 
employment centre. However, in the case of the Mauricie region, it 
was decided that the regional centre, which was formerly in 
Trois-Rivières, would be moved to Shawinigan. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	If you look at the Notice Paper, you will see that I asked four 
questions on this issue. I will read these questions, regarding which 
I hope to get an answer soon.
<P>
	The first one is: ``Can the Minister of Human Resources 
Development indicate what recommendations  were made, by the
<P>
committee analysing the restructuring of service points in Quebec, 
on the advisability of locating the regional Canada Human 
Resources Centre in Shawinigan or in Trois-Rivières?''
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Here is the second, No. 21 in the Order Paper of March 12, 1996: 
``Can the Minister of Human Resources Development tell me 
whether representations or interventions were made by officers, 
employees or other persons from the Privy Council or the Office of 
the Prime Minister to officers, employees or officials from Human 
Resources Development Canada, in order to ensure that the 
regional Canada Human Resources Centre would be located in a 
municipality in the constituency of Saint-Maurice rather than in 
Trois-Rivières?''
<P>
	Question No. 22: ``Can the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tell me whether, as part of its restructuring of service 
points in Quebec, Human Resources Development Canada carried 
out comparative studies on the advisability of locating the regional 
Canada Human Resources Centre in Shawinigan or in 
Trois-Rivières and, if so, what where the findings of those 
studies?''
<P>
	And fourth and last, Question No. 23: ``Can the Minister of 
Public Works and the Minister of Human Resources Development 
tell me the rent and rent-related costs of the Human Resources 
Development Canada premises in the Bourg-du-Fleuve building on 
rue des Forges in Trois-Rivières, as compared with the anticipated 
costs of the Department's moving to, arranging, and settling into 
new premises to be located in the Shawinigan area according to the 
government's plan?''
<P>
	According to what I have been told, the government will be 
answering these questions in the next few days. We would hope 
that, upon receiving these questions, both political and 
administrative staff understood that the government's proposal to 
locate the human resources centre in Shawinigan rather than in 
Trois-Rivières is contrary to the public interest, that this decision is 
unfair and shameful, and that this project is cynical and shameful.
<P>
	Not only was it made without consultation, but also it is contrary 
to the opinion of every group that reacted to it in our area. The 
mayor of Trois-Rivières has fought a good fight, followed by the 
Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Senior Citizens and the 
regional federation of caisses populaires. Moreover, some 25,000 
citizens indicated their disapproval of that project in writing. Based 
on the information at its disposal, the public service union also 
decried this project. It does not make any sense, it goes against the 
best interests of the public, it is a disgrace, and we will continue to 
condemn this project.
<P>
	Particularly as the hon. member for Saint-Maurice was kind 
enough to tell his voters last week, in his latest householder, that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2239"> 2239 </A></B>
<P>
the new regional centre will open its doors in his riding, but more 
precisely in Shawinigan-Sud. Those of you who are familiar with 
the area will know that it will also serve residents of the 
Saint-Maurice riding. Because the focal point in that riding is 
Shawinigan and not Shawinigan-Sud, constituents of the hon. 
member for Saint-Maurice will have to go from Shawinigan to 
Shawinigan-Sud without adequate public services to get them 
there.
<P>
	We believe, and the minister responsible for regional 
development in Quebec also knows it full well, that this decision is 
unjustifiable. The minister also knows this is a totally arbitrary 
decision that does not take into consideration the history of the area 
or the travel pattern of residents. We will never stop decrying what 
we believe is still only a project, because we still hope the final 
decision has not be taken yet.
<P>
	According to the information we have, officials are not aware 
that a decision has been taken. Everyone believes this is still only at 
the planning stage and we hope the government, and the Prime 
Minister who is behind all of this, it is pointless to try to deny it, 
will see reason and make a sensible and wise decision. Given his 
age and his vast experience, he should be able to set things straight 
and see to it that the people of the Mauricie region have access to 
all the services they are entitled to.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a procedural concern. The bill has gone to committee and yet 
it still comes back to the House with a horrendous number of 
amendments. I believe there 220 amendments, which gives one 
cause to wonder when a bill is not a bill and whether the House of 
Commons is actually rewriting the bill. It makes one wonder what 
actually happened in committee to resolve some of these 
difficulties which would have provided a more streamlined bill for 
the House.
<P>
	I am also concerned with the name change of the bill. I have two 
concerns. The first is about changing the name from 
unemployment to employment. I also question the term insurance. 
If changes were to be made, why was the term insurance not 
included?
<P>
	With regard to the contents of the bill, we have started in practice 
to move away from the concept of insurance. The insurance 
policies of today are sophisticated tontines, things from our past. 
This does not seem to be a true insurance policy as was originally 
conceived to address the needs of the unemployed. It was originally 
intended to get us over that period of time until we could get back 
into the world of employment. I question whether we are actually 
discussing an insurance concept.
<P>
	The change in terms from unemployment to employment 
reminds me of the health care realm in which we have a health care 
insurance policy. I am very pleased to see it is still addressing the 
concept of illness. When I am ill I know I have a health insurance 
policy that will allow me to get the kind of treatment I need. When 
the concept was changed in health care from an illness to a wellness 
approach, it was specifically applied to the department, not 
necessarily the actual insurance component of the health care 
regime.
<P>
	The same principle is being used here, but it is not being applied 
to the department; it is actually encroaching on the insurance 
program or a program of the department. By changing the term 
from unemployment to employment we are expanding the 
parameters of this jurisdiction. We are getting more officially into 
things like education and health care. We have already tended to 
move that way with training programs.
<P>
	We may be going further down the road toward duplicating 
services that should be provided by other jurisdictions. The health 
component involved when a person is unemployed should be under 
the health care organization.
<P>
	I have some difficulties in changing the term unemployment to 
employment. It could be interpreted in ways that lead to a great 
expansion of services under this insurance act. This would take us 
further away from a true insurance policy.
<P>
	Another concern I have is with premiums. We tend to establish 
categories based on geographic location or income, and we address 
those in need, which takes me one step further. Regardless of 
financial position, when we are suddenly employed there develops 
a need. When we work we develop a lifestyle our income will 
support. When that income is gone it has an effect on our lifestyle. 
We become in need to maintain it. I do not think that is what we are 
talking about here.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	We should maybe look at Maslov to identify what needy means. 
I tend to think of needy as the basic principles which come out from 
Maslov such as food, shelter and clothing. These are essential to all 
people. When it comes to looking at benefits, this is the 
classification that should be front and centre. When we speak of 
needy, what is immediately conjured in one's mind is that 
somebody is needy in one of those three area, versus just saying 
needs. Whatever our income, we develop an appropriate lifestyle 
and when the income is no longer there, we are in need to maintain 
that lifestyle. That is a totally different issue than what we are 
talking about here.
<P>
	It is becoming extremely technical. I am still struggling with my 
income tax. It is at a point now where I am not capable of doing it 
myself and I have to shop around for  the best deal in town. We are 
beginning to get a similar process here by coming up with various 
categories, conditions in various areas of the country, income and 
so on. There are all these different categories. We should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2240"> 2240 </A></B>
<P>
looking at the elimination of some of these categories, not the 
creation of more, while addressing the basic needs of the 
unemployed.
<P>
	One category that jumps to mind immediately is the regional 
category. Obviously there is a financial difference, depending on 
the area of the country, for example north-south. It is more much 
more expensive to meet the basic needs of food, shelter and 
clothing in the north than it is in the south. I am sure if we address 
that in relation to the benefits, obviously there would be a monetary 
difference.
<P>
	We can look at maternity benefits before and after birth. I do not 
see the rationale of differentiating between a natural parent and an 
adoptive parent. A baby is a baby, and it does not matter whether a 
baby is adopted or born of natural parents. That child still has the 
same needs. I was under the impression that these maternity 
benefits were originally applied to address those needs of the child 
because the mother is in the working world. That does not change if 
it is an adopted child. The baby still needs the adoptive mother just 
as the natural mother would be needed.
<P>
	I would like to get back to the insurance component. I looked at 
the auditor general's report of 1994. He quotes from a study the 
Department of Finance. He refers to unemployment insurance as a 
disincentive to employment.
<P>
	I do not see anything in this act which would really discourage 
people from going on unemployment insurance. I agree with the 
auditor general and I would like to see some of the amendments 
pass. Some definitely address this issue. We could stand here all 
night and illustrate various examples where the unemployment 
insurance act has been taken advantage of.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	There are some major concerns. The name change is one. By 
going from unemployment to employment we are expanding the 
parameters of what is to be provided under that. A rose is a rose by 
any other name; I may be misquoting, but it is still unemployment 
insurance no matter what we call it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to rise today, not to say that this is a 
good bill but to give some support mainly to the three Bloc 
members. I am talking about the hon. members for Mercier, 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup and Lévis, who, for almost two 
years now, have been fighting long and hard on behalf not only of 
their constituents but also of all the people of Quebec and an 
important part of the people of  Canada, for those who will fall 
victim to this unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	This is totally absurd. We are faced with a government that is not 
living up to its promises, as we have seen many times this week. 
Liberals had promised to scrap the GST, but they did not deliver. 
The Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister promised to vote as 
a party on the issue of sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination, but they did not keep their word.
<P>
	On the one hand, they do not keep their promises and, on the 
other other, they do things they did not promise to do. Among other 
things, they are undertaking a reform of the unemployment 
insurance system even though, as mentioned by my colleague for 
Trois-Rivières, the Prime Minister, when in the opposition, fought 
against the unemployment insurance reform proposed by the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' fight goes back to the fall of 1994 when the 
Minister of Human Resources Development started a huge 
consultation process throughout the country on a reform proposal.
<P>
	We could speak of reform then because we did not know yet 
what would come out of these consultations or what kind of a bill 
would finally be introduced in the House of Commons. So 
Canadians were consulted. Our three colleagues travelled across 
Canada with the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development. In the end, 80 per cent of the witnesses heard by the 
committee were against the reform proposal as it was then 
formulated. More eager to please the government than the people, 
the standing committee prepared a report, which, of course, was 
not in accordance with what the people consulted had said. That is 
why the Bloc Quebecois presented a dissenting report.
<P>
	Since then, especially since the 1995 budget speech, we have 
seen a series of government measures aimed at pulling the 
government out of fields of activity where it had been present for 
many years. In many cases the Bloc Quebecois supported such 
measures, and I am thinking in particular of the privatization of 
airports and air traffic control. We agreed on the principle.
<P>
	In the present case, the government is doing exactly the opposite. 
It has not contributed one cent to the unemployment insurance fund 
since 1991. So if there were one sector the government could 
privatize and where it could say to employers and employees: 
``Since you are the only contributing to it, we are asking you to 
manage the unemployment insurance program'', it is this one.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Why is the government doing the opposite in other sectors, for 
example with navigation aids? The Coast Guard is trying to get 
users pay the bill. Why did the government not do the same with 
unemployment insurance? For a very simple reason, the 
government  discovered, following the 1995 budget, in which there 
were important cuts to UI eligibility and benefit payment criteria, 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2241"> 2241 </A></B>
<P>
unemployment insurance has become an extremely productive cash 
cow. Therefore why privatize such a cost effective program?
<P>
	It will even further reduce benefits so that claimants will receive 
lower payments, and make it more and more difficult to receive 
unemployment insurance by imposing stricter conditions. 
Furthermore, it will make sure that everybody pays into it, even 
those who do not have the slightest chance of receiving benefits 
one day.
<P>
	Realizing this was an extremely important revenue source, the 
government would have us believe it is reforming the 
unemployment insurance program. But what is it truly doing? It is 
in fact draining the UI fund in order to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	This bill will have extremely harmful results. Because it is afraid 
Canadians will discover more harmful features, the government 
decided to limit debate. A time limit was imposed on the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development so the government 
could steamroll passage of this bill.
<P>
	The bill will have extremely negative consequences particularly 
because it is going after the people most in need, those who are 
most vulnerable. It is an attack against seasonal workers and part 
time workers, which necessarily means women because they 
represent a high percentage of that category. It is an attack against 
entrants and immigrants who have been here for a few years and 
who, for cultural or other reasons, obviously have more difficulty 
than others entering into the labour force.
<P>
	The most vulnerable workers will be affected the most. They 
will be forced to contribute to unemployment insurance from their 
very first hour of work. This, in itself is not bad. We could even say 
it is a good measure had the government not already raised the 
eligibility criteria. These people are forced to contribute from their 
very first hour of work, but the eligibility notch is raised so high 
that we can be sure many contributing workers will never be 
eligible-some say one million of them.
<P>
	Making part time workers, students and so on contribute will 
bring $900 million into the unemployment insurance fund, and 
what makes that measure so perverse is that it will allow the 
government to give that money to the richer workers. We must 
remember that maximum insurable earnings, which were set at 
$42,500, will be lowered to $39,000. That means that the 
government took $900 million in the pockets of the poorest 
workers in order to give it to the wealthiest, when it could have 
raised that maximum instead. It was at $42,000. Why not set it at 
$50,000 or $60,000? It chose not to. It preferred to take the money 
from the poorest workers, those most vulnerable. For that reason 
alone, this bill is a perverse and antisocial measure and,  
unfortunately, if it is passed, we will have to pay a social price for it 
in the years to come.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this 
bill which will help many Canadians help themselves. There are 
going to be very positive results.
<P>
	When members speak about employment insurance, sometimes I 
do not think we tell enough. It is not just workers who will be 
affected by this new income support system. The business 
community will also be affected. From the testimony before the 
standing committee we know that for the most part business is 
quite supportive of employment insurance.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to explain to the hon. 
members some of the implications of EI for people in business. 
Employment insurance is one component of the government's job 
strategy. The government has made it abundantly clear that its 
number one priority is to create a positive economic climate in 
which the private sector can generate growth and create jobs.
<P>
	There are a number of strategies to fulfil that commitment. 
Among them are some of the provisions in Bill C-12. Since it is the 
business community, especially small business, that creates jobs in 
this country, it is vital that EI measures enable business people to 
do just that.
<P>
	The government has heard on more than one occasion that the 
effect of escalating UI premiums discourages job creation. 
Business has seen increased premiums as a tax on jobs, a tax the 
government imposes during a recession, which is obviously the 
worst time that this could happen. However, it has no choice. It is 
obligated by law to pay benefits when the UI account is running a 
deficit. That same obligation will apply with the passage of Bill 
C-12.
<P>
	The answer is quite clear. When the economy is doing well a 
reserve will be built in the EI account. In that way funds will be 
available to pay for benefits during a downturn in the future and 
premiums will remain stable. Premiums will not have to rise when 
business can least afford them because there will be a cash reserve 
to draw on.
<P>
	Some members opposite have criticized the government's plan 
to build a reserve in the EI account. They come up with bogus and 
misleading statements about how the government is going to use 
the reserve to pay down the deficit, which is not true because the 
reserve has no impact on the deficit over the long term. Insurance 
funds can only be used for purposes spelled out under the act: 
insurance benefits, employment benefits and their administration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2242"> 2242 </A></B>
<P>
	There are positive signs for the business community. When 
economic indicators are positive, business is better able to preserve 
jobs during tough economic times and create new jobs when there 
is an upswing in economic activity. In the future we must ensure 
that these fundamentals are always there.
<P>
	I hope all members agree that we want a stable premium rate for 
the new EI program. Let us look at the implications of the proposed 
new rates which is down from $3 last year to $2.95 this year. With 
this rate, more than two-thirds of small firms will pay the same or 
less in premiums during 1996 compared to 1995.
<P>
	While a decision is yet to be made, when EI brings in first dollar 
coverage in 1997, and premium rates are reduced further, the 
impact on small businesses will be even more beneficial.
<P>
	While the Minister of Finance has assumed a $2.90 rate in 
1997-I hope it is much less than that-for planning purposes in 
the last budget, the actual rate will be set at the end of this year.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	As well, as stated by the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business, about 30 per cent of their membership, small and 
medium sized businesses, will also benefit from the premium 
reductions associated with the reduction in the maximum insurable 
earnings.
<P>
	The government has not forgotten these small business people 
who will experience some adverse affects because of this new 
legislation. These hard working men and women will be helped to 
adjust to EI through a two-year premium relief program. The 
program will begin in January 1997. It will coincide with the 
introduction of first dollar coverage and the calculation of MIE 
earnings on an annual basis. Here is how it will work.
<P>
	An employer whose UI premiums in 1996 are less than $30,000 
will be eligible for a premium rebate. Employers who face an 
increase of more than $500 can have up to 50 per cent of the 
increase rebated in 1997 and up to 25 per cent in 1998 to a 
maximum of $5,000 a year rebate. This measure will provide 
premium relief to about 30,000 small businesses. This year the 
reduced premium rate and the lower maximum insurable earnings 
will save business $730 million in premium payments.
<P>
	As well, individual employers will pay $520 million less in 
premiums in 1996, enabling them to retain more of their income 
which also helps the business community.  It gives people more 
spending power. Those are significant savings and members 
opposite should give them due consideration.
<P>
	The business community is also pleased with the proposed 
employment insurance system because it goes a long way toward 
reducing the administrative burden of the current UI structure.
<P>
	Beginning in 1997, premiums will be collected based on total 
earnings and total hours from the first dollar and the first hour. That 
means employers will no longer have to track weekly wages and 
hours and maintain very complex files in order to determine when, 
and how much, premiums are payable each week.
<P>
	As well, business people describe the record of employment as 
an absolute nightmare to administer. I have spent many hours late 
at night filling out ROEs. I would probably make a small mistake 
on some line and whether I did or not, the government always 
seemed to be sending them back.
<P>
	The present system has been a real nightmare. The one-page 
form comes with a 35-page instruction manual. The weekly 
reporting system often means that employers must report earnings 
differently than their own pay periods. It has been a jungle.
<P>
	Under the EI, the record of employment will be more like an 
employer's payroll. Employers will only have to report an 
employee's first and last days of work, total earnings and total 
hours. As well, the ROE can be used for post-audit verification.
<P>
	With the changes I have outlined, plus the other provisions of 
Bill C-12, it is estimated that once fully implemented, the new 
employment insurance system will reduce administrative costs for 
businesses by between $100 and $150 million annually. That is a 
lot of money that could be used to create sustainable employment.
<P>
	I am absolutely certain that once people get through a period of 
adjustment, employment insurance will prove to be one of the most 
productive pieces of legislation that this House has ever passed. It 
will be good for business and, in turn, it will be good for Canadians 
who are striving to become self-reliant, contributing members of 
the community.
<P>
	To close, I would like to quote Tim Reid, president of the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, during his appearance before the 
standing committee: ``We are pleased to see that the government's 
overriding goal in revamping the unemployment insurance 
program is very much in line with the Canadian Chamber's 
business expansion and jobs for Canadians''.
<P>
	I encourage the opposition parties to quit misleading Canadians 
on the benefits of Bill C-12. I encourage them to get behind this 
progressive legislation.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to what the government is calling 
employment insurance, which I consider not only unemployment 
insurance, but, alas, an unemployment guarantee. Let me explain 
why.
<P>
	One element of the bill before us proposes to lower maximum 
insurable earnings from $43,000 to $39,000.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	This will have major macro economic effects, which I have 
never heard mentioned either in this House or in committee. You 
are no doubt aware that people earning more than $39,000 but less 
than $43,000 will have more disposable income, whereas at the 
other end of the spectrum, the low wage earners, who in the past 
were not insured, now will be. But, they will be because they will 
be contributing to unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Their disposable income will shrink. When we look at individual 
cases, this seems insignificant. However, when we look at the big 
picture, at the figures as a whole, we realize we are talking about 
hundreds of millions of dollars, indeed billions of dollars coming 
out of the pockets of low wage earners and going into the pockets 
of high wage earners. This will mean macro economic 
consequences for retailers, businesses and industry. Let me 
explain.
<P>
	The low wage earners, with less disposable income now, will 
spend less, not for luxuries, they never had the means anyway, but 
for life's basic necessities. The high wage earners, with more 
disposable income, generally, will be able to buy luxury items.
<P>
	What does this mean? How will this flow of money affect 
Canada's economy? Very simply, the economies of provinces with 
more low wage earners will centre on immediate need products, 
whereas in the economies of the provinces with higher wage 
earners, business and industry will develop around luxury items. 
Regions will become polarized based on people's average salary.
<P>
	What this bill is doing is shifting wealth, and we have to face the 
fact, because incomes are not equal coast to coast. There are 
regions in Canada, in Quebec, less well off than others, where there 
are more low wage earners than in other regions where there are 
high wage earners.
<P>
	With this new plan, the government if transferring several 
billions of dollars from areas with only low income earners to areas 
with high income earners.
<P>
	I ask you: What do you think this is going to lead to in three, five 
or ten years? Poor areas will become poorer and the rich ones will 
become richer. The laws of macro-economics are that simple and 
obvious. You cannot play with these numbers and believe that the 
results will be simple and easy to arrive at.
<P>
	I have never seen in a committee, or in the House, someone 
showing us an econometric model of the  consequences of the 
implementation of this system. One should not rush into such a 
decision. This is not the kind of decision you want to make hastily, 
and yet this is exactly what this House is going to do with this bill. 
There will be consequences.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The government is going to push some regions into poverty to 
the benefit of others which will get richer. When a country creates 
poor and rich regions, eventually it does not maximize its potential. 
It will eventually have to pay a price for it because rich areas will 
have to help keep poor areas economically active. The law of 
consumption, the great law which allows businesses to sell goods 
to consumers, will be faced with an impossible equation.
<P>
	You see, if people can no longer afford to consume, how will 
businesses be able to produce goods and make a profit? Somebody 
forgot that businesses cannot afford to be only profitable, efficient 
and productive, they also need a market. Their market is made up 
of people like you and me, people who are listening to us and who 
have to earn a living day in and day out, and be left with enough 
money to be able to treat themselves to some of the niceties of life. 
And yet, what we are doing with this bill is transferring billions of 
dollars from the pockets of the poor into the pockets of those who 
are better off.
<P>
	Let us imagine for a moment that the government is 
implementing one of the recommendations made by the Bloc 
Quebecois and that everybody contributes to the UI fund regardless 
of any maximum insurable earnings. We would then be able to keep 
the UI fund in the black and provide adequate benefits to those in 
need, while reducing premiums and correcting inequities between 
the haves and the have-nots, between prosperous regions and 
disadvantaged regions. This solution would not be nearly as 
harmful and may even have a positive impact, while those who 
introduced this bill clearly did not assess its potential negative 
consequences.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about seasonal work. Seasonal industries 
represent an important component of the Canadian economy from 
coast to coast. If you attack the seasonal industry in a region or in 
all regions, you will weaken-not you personally, Mr. Speaker, but 
the government, which I am addressing through you-the country's 
economy as a whole.
<P>
	The bill before us may well undermine seasonal work. Any 
weakening of seasonal work would have negative consequences for 
the regions affected. Preventing this essential component of our 
economy, which provides us with fruits and vegetables at certain 
times of the year and offers us winter sports, from running properly 
would hurt the Canadian economy as a whole.
<P>
	As consumers, seasonal workers who can no longer support 
themselves throughout the year will have less to contribute to the 
Canadian economy. As a result of this  reduced consumption, a 
business somewhere will be stuck with surplus inventory and 
forced to cut production and then to lay off non-seasonal workers. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2244"> 2244 </A></B>
<P>
We see what this could lead to. Sooner or later, attacks against 
seasonal work will become attacks against permanent jobs.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	We are falling into a bottomless pit. It is not the first time this 
government and the previous one have committed basic errors in 
strategy. I will not talk about former minister Lalonde's national 
energy policy, a catastrophe for which we are still paying the price 
today. I will not talk about those policies which, year after year, 
have led us into a hole that is $560 billion deep.
<P>
	I will talk about what we are doing here today, which is gambling 
with a sum of about $16 billion. In essence we are gambling 
because, until now, no other country in the world has dared take the 
measures we are about to take, that is to estimate insurability not 
based on the number of weeks worked, but based on the number of 
hours. What will be the consequences? I do not know, nobody here 
knows, and not only does it concern me, I find it totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Before going any further with this bill, the government should 
have the decency to build a comprehensive econometric model to 
measure the consequences of this legislation. Then we could make 
the necessary adjustments or the necessary change of course, as the 
case may be, to achieve the desired results.
<P>
	Only 40 per cent of unemployed Canadians are covered by the 
unemployment insurance plan, which is not much. It is not an 
employment policy. In a case like this, I can only wish the 
government not only withdraw its bill, but that it withdraw from 
the area of employability and transfer this responsibility to the 
provinces, especially Quebec which has been waiting for that for a 
long time. It is ready to assume this responsibility with policies that 
will be beneficial not only to Quebec, but to the rest of Canada as 
well.

named the Ontario Region Outstanding Young Farmer for 1996.
<P>
	While still in high school, Mr. Streef established in 1977 Streef

	It is refreshing to see young farmers rising to meet the challenge 
of today's marketplace. Mr. Streef has shown that hard work does 
pay off and serves as example to other young farmers planning an 
agricultural career.

	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first 
principle of the Reform Party of Canada as stated in our blue book 
is: ``We confirm our commitment to Canada as one nation and to 
our vision of Canada as a balanced federation of equal provinces 
and equal citizens''. I affirm that belief. This is why I was so deeply 
offended at the attempt by CBC Radio to portray my comments to a 
radio station in my riding as being discriminatory against gays and 
lesbians.
<P>
	I wish to assure the House I believe that gays and lesbians have 
exactly the same rights as every other Canadian.
<P>
	For whatever reason, CBC Radio decided not to include in its 
report the following statement: ``I don't say that you have to sit at 
the back of the bus or that you can refuse to hire them on the basis 
of their homosexuality. I don't think that is acceptable. But they  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2245"> 2245 </A></B>
<P>
have the same protection under the charter and the human rights act 
as all other Canadians''.
<P>
	I also said in the same interview: ``We don't accept or encourage 
discrimination against anybody because they are homosexual or 
they are gay''.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government has put its fleet of 13,000 hopper 
cars up for sale and has begun a process to establish the criteria on 
which bids will be accepted. There are a number of things that 
should be considered.
<P>
	First, the government has to realize that the critical issue in this 
process is the allocation of these cars. Although ownership is 
important, it will take an efficient system of moving those cars to 
grain collection points and then to port to make the issue of actual 
ownership relevant.
<P>
	Second, since it is clear that producers are going to be asked to 
pay the full cost of the existing fleet as well as the replacement 
costs as the fleet ages, it is important for the government to realize 
that producers are justifiably correct in their demand to be included 
in the ownership and allocation process.
<P>
	Third, it is important that the government indicate whether its 
intention is to make money off this sale or if its intention is to 
relinquish jurisdiction and influence over the cars.
<P>
	The criteria for the sale and for the bidders will depend on the 
answer to that question.

the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada announced her resignation as

<P>
	The resignation of Canada's Deputy Prime Minister is yet

<P>
	First, the member for York South-Weston was kicked out, and

last two years the government has commissioned no less than three 
studies into the movement of grain through west coast ports, but 
nothing has changed as a result of all this work.
<P>
	Workers, farmers, producers, shippers and manufacturers are 
worried. Work stoppages cost millions of dollars. Markets are lost 
and reputations are damaged. The clock is ticking. Is the 
government willing to stand by and wait until there is another 
labour disruption requiring back to work legislation for the

<P>
	There is an option. The west coast ports inquiry recommended 
final offer selection arbitration as a tool for settling 
labour-management disputes.
<P>

control. Give labour and management the mechanism to solve their 
disputes and meaningful settlement will result.

Child Find Canada's annual Green Ribbon of Hope month. 
Canadians are asked to wear a green ribbon as a symbol of hope for 
the safe recovery of missing children.
<P>
	The green ribbon of hope originated at Holy Cross Secondary 
School when Kristen French's friends and teachers wore the green 
ribbon to express their hope for Kristen's safe return. Sadly, 
Kristen did not return.
<P>
	It is every parent's nightmare to learn that their child has been 
abducted. Yet for too many families this nightmare becomes a 
reality. In 1995, 55,749 children were reported missing in Canada. 
This includes children who were abducted by a stranger, by a parent 
and children who ran away.
<P>
	I represent a community which has been forever scarred by the 
tragedy of a missing child. Christopher Stephenson was just 11 
years old when he was taken and lost his life at the hands of his 
abductor. For the Stephenson family the horrors of child abduction 
have left a permanent mark. We must make every effort to ensure 
that another family does not experience the same trauma which the 
Stephenson family has had to endure.

	Heading into its 44th season, the Stratford Festival has become a 
true success story. While most arts groups rely heavily on 
government funding, only 8 per cent of the festival budget is 
derived from government funds. This funding is minimal compared 
with the estimated $100 million in economic benefits derived from 
the festival for the city of Stratford and the over $25 million in 
taxes generated for the governments.
<P>

This can be the case if they apply under the faint hope provisions

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister made some rather startling remarks 
this morning. I would like to raise them with a member of the 
government.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that politicians cannot be held to all 
their election promises, because of what he called acts of God. The 
Prime Minister added, with regard to his government's failure to 
settle the GST issue: ``Sometimes, in the course of a mandate, you 
run into situations where you cannot deliver the goods''.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister or whomever speaks on 
his behalf on this day of crisis for the government. Are we to 
understand that the Prime Minister is finally admitting that he and 
his government missed the boat in the matter of the GST and were 
unable to deliver the goods?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in 
1990, Quebec signed a harmonization agreement with the 
Government of Canada. This said, it was far from clear whether the 
new government would continue the process.
<P>
	With the first Campeau budget, the Government of Quebec not 
only made it very clear, but in fact put measures in place that 
eventually resulted in total or near total harmonization of the 
Quebec sales tax and the federal tax.
<P>
	Now, if I understand the hon. member, because, really, an event 
changed the game since the election, as we have to admit, does the 
member think the federal government should have created a 
completely different tax that could not be harmonized with 
Quebec's tax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance has days when he is effective in 
this House, but this really is not one of them. I thought, however, 
that he had already prepared to take over for the Prime Minister, 
but I realize this is not the case.
<P>
	My question is serious, and I do not want an answer from him on 
the Quebec sales tax or on anything else. I want him to answer my 
question. Are we to understand, when the Prime Minister says that 
politicians should not be forced to sign contracts to keep their 
promises, what I  would like to know is, in saying this, is the Prime 
Minister referring to the fact that, as far as the Liberals are 
concerned, politicians can say whatever they like during election 
campaigns and then invoke an act of God to justify their inability to 
deliver the goods?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
admit I am just as guilty as the Leader of the Opposition, but being 
effective does not always mean getting excited. I think it is possible 
to have a debate and be effective by responding calmly to a 
question.
<P>
	Obviously, when Quebec, representing 25 per cent of the 
population, decided to harmonize, it put the federal government, to 
some extent, in the position of not being able to harmonize any new 
tax it developed with Quebec. The Quebec Minister of Finance, Mr. 
Landry, told us at the meeting of finance ministers that we must not 
come up with another tax, because it was important for Quebec and 
its economy to have a harmonized tax. So this is what we did.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	So I think the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me that 
we did the best thing for Canada's economy and, specifically, for 
Quebec's economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a limit. The government is in a full blown crisis of 
confidence. The Minister of Finance, a few days ago, apologized 
for failing to deliver the goods. The Deputy Prime Minister had to 
resign because she did not keep a promise. The Prime Minister 
keeps saying he kept his promises and, this morning, he tried to tell 
us that sometimes we should let politicians make promises and not 
keep them.
<P>
	I ask the government represented here by the Minister of 
Finance-it is not my fault there is no one else here to answer 
questions-whether the Prime Minister, in doing so in this day of 
crisis, wanted to acknowledge outside the House of Commons that 
the government was unable to keep its promises?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, do 
the members of the Bloc who said they would resign if the 
referendum did not pass intend to resign?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let him find such a statement, just for the fun of it. We 
have said we would be here until the referendum goes through, and 
it will go through some day. We, unlike others, can live with the 
statements we make. The problems are not on this side of the 
House, but on the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Four out of seven!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Do not worry about the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. We will find some nice statements he 
made about the GST in the days he debated the issue with Mr. 
Wilson. His turn will come.

<P>
	Last week, the Minister of Finance recognized that his 
government had make an honest mistake by promising to abolish 
the GST. He cannot deny it, we heard him on every TV channel. 
His leader was not too pleased, but the minister said it. In fact, 
during his career, he has made many statements that did not please 
his leader. Last week's admission was unquestionably one of them.
<P>
	Today, following the resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister 
and his leader's flip-flop, I ask the Minister of Finance if he stands 
by his statement of last week that his government, and himself as 
Minister of Finance, made an honest mistake by promising to 
abolish the GST? Does he maintain his statement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
not only maintain that statement but, when I made it, I was 
speaking on behalf of the government. That statement was 
endorsed by the government.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to praise the courage and integrity 
of the hon. member for Hamilton East, Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Sheila Copps. I am also extremely 
confident that she will be back here after June 17, exactly in the 
same seat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is another example of a statement made by the 
Minister of Finance that will not please his leader. The minister just 
told us that he spoke on behalf of the government. That is what he 
just said. Speaking on behalf of the government, he said: ``The 
government made a mistake when it promised to abolish the GST.'' 
For three or four days now, the leader of the same government has 
been saying that there was no mistake. This is a good one.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I would like to know who speaks on behalf of the government. Is 
it number three? Number two is gone because she had talked too 
much. Who speaks on behalf of the government? Which version is 
right: that of the Minister of Finance, or that of the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister speaks on behalf of the government, the 
Minister of Finance speaks on behalf of the government, all cabinet 
ministers speak on behalf of the government. Not only that but, as a 
government, we speak on behalf of all Canadians, including those 
who live in Quebec. We speak for a country that is one and united.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Sheila 
Copps resigned because she broke an election promise to 
Canadians on the GST. The Prime Minister tried to tell us yesterday 
that Ms. Copps had to go because she overstepped the red book.
<P>
	During the last election the Prime Minister promised Canadians 
time and time again that he would abolish the GST, kill the GST, 
scrap the GST.
<P>
	What is the difference between Sheila Copps' promise to scrap 
the GST and the Prime Minister's promise to scrap the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the member for Hamilton East, the former Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, stated her position with what we all thought 
was an enormous amount of courage.
<P>
	What she stated was that the measures taken by the government 
in terms of the sales tax were in keeping with the statements in the 
red book but that in certain of her statements during the election 
campaign she had gone beyond that.
<P>
	In those circumstances, because she is a person of tremendous 
courage, she resigned her seat in order to demonstrate that courage 
and credibility before the people of her riding.
<P>
	Yesterday on television we saw elector after elector in her riding 
state their great confidence in Sheila Copps. There is no doubt that 
on June 17 the people of Hamilton East will demonstrate their 
recognition of the great courage, the great credibility and the great 
integrity of the member for Hamilton East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a week 
ago it could have been described as courage. One week later it is 
convenience. It has nothing to do with courage.
<P>
	On September 10 the Prime Minister stated quite clearly: ``There 
will not be a promise in the campaign that I will not keep''. That is 
the campaign, not the red book.
<P>
	On the campaign trail the Prime Minister promised Canadians he 
would abolish the GST. The Deputy Prime Minister made the same 
promise and resigned because she did not keep it.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister now admit that he, like Sheila Copps, 
broke his campaign promise to the Canadian people on the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the member, a representative of that party, talk about 
courage, credibility and integrity when the former chief whip of 
that party, who made a statement that cast dishonour upon every 
one of us in the House, refused to resign?
<P>
	What did the former chief whip do? Did he resign his seat? No. 
What he did was resign as chief whip. That party changes chief 
whips every week.

<P>
	Page 22 of the red book was not good enough for the Prime 
Minister on the campaign trail and it was not good enough to keep 
Sheila Copps on the front benches.

the promises he made during the last election? How can he expect 
Canadians to believe that his promise to abolish the GST was 
different from the promise made by Sheila Copps?

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to today's newspapers, the federal government 
intends to show up in court on May 13 to question the right of 
Quebecers to decide their own future.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice confirm this morning's news reports 
to the effect that Ottawa is about to intervene in court on May 13 to 
question the right of Quebecers to decide their own future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, for a long time now, the federal 
government has been following the situation with regard to Mr. 
Bertrand's litigation. In his case, Mr. Bertrand has raised several 
constitutional issues of great significance. So, it is important for 
the federal government to examine the case and the issues, and that 
is what we are doing.
<P>
	I hope to be able to make a recommendation to my colleagues in 
the next few days. We have not made any decision yet, but we are 
examining the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is interfering with the most legitimate 
right of all Quebecers to decide their own future.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Justice justify such a decision, because 
he did say that he would make it, when shortly before the last 
referendum he stated that the right of the  Quebec people to express 
their will concerning their own future was a political position and 
not a legal issue?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the substance of the Bertrand 
litigation has to do with constitutional issues. It is passing strange 
to suggest that the Attorney General of Canada would be 
disinterested in constitutional issues. The Government of Quebec 
brought a motion and has taken a legal position in relation to the 
issues in the action.
<P>
	It is part of my responsibility as chief law officer of the federal 
government to look at the issues in that case and to recommend to 
my colleagues and to the Prime Minister a position in relation to 
the case. This is not interfering with the expression by the 
population of Quebec of its will or its position on a question. This 
has to do with constitutional and legal issues, the very substance of 
the Bertrand litigation. That is the reason we are looking at it and 
preparing ourselves to decide.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, under the finance minister's plan to hide the GST in 
Canada he has added to the list of taxable items things like 
children's clothing, wheelchairs, books and medication.
<P>
	Before they were elected the Liberals claimed they cared and 
would not tax these things. Why did they stop caring once they 
were elected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously when we have 10 different retail sales taxes across the 
country resulting in different tax bases we have to start somewhere. 
The general understanding was that we would start with the one 
common base which existed across the country, the federal sales 
tax base.
<P>
	We made it very clear in negotiations with the provinces that we 
were prepared to examine this whole area and we will do so.
<P>
	I have a little difficulty with the question from the member of the

expand it to, food, pharmaceuticals and various other things?

so proudly in the budget, still true?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government is not increasing its tax take. The rate stays 
at 7 per cent. The federal base stays the same. As a result of this 
there is no increase in revenue to the federal government.
<P>
	If we look at what is happening in Atlantic Canada, there is 
obviously a substantial decrease in the tax rate as it applies to 
Atlantic Canadians.

<P>
	We also learned today that the President of the Treasury Board 
and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs have also 
recommended to the Prime Minister that he challenge the right of 
Quebecers to decide their own future.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that, by denying the people of 
Quebec the right to decide their own future, his government is 
demonstrating that it has nothing to offer Quebec and that the grand 
plan for national reconciliation is nothing more than a big hoax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the federal government has no 
intention of preventing the people of Quebec from expressing their 
position on these matters. This is not why Mr. Bertrand launched 
his suit. Let us be clear about Mr. Bertrand's case. He began it as a 
private citizen, and he raised important constitutional questions.
<P>
	As the Attorney General of Canada, it is my responsibility to 
prepare and to give advice to the Prime Minister and to my 
colleagues on the question of participating in this case. In fact, the 
federal government has been made mis en cause by Mr. Bertrand. 
We are therefore already involved in the case before the courts. In 
the days and weeks to come, we will be examining the matter and 
deciding whether we will participate actively with the other parties 
before the court in order to determine the important points in the 
case.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr.

give such a long winded non-answer to a very simple question. 
Does the government intend to challenge the Quebec referendum or 
not?

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

the Bertrand litigation. The court documents revealed that what is 
in issue is the constitutional validity of l'avant-projet de loi. That is 
the issue before the court, and it raises questions of legal 
significance.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. The finance minister in 
Alberta has argued that the federal minister is lowing the GST rate 
in Newfoundland to 5.5 per cent by throwing a billion dollar 
subsidy at the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Is the minister planning to give a break to the rest of Canada by 
lowering the tax rate on the GST to 5.5 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the transition funding provided to Atlantic Canada does not 
represent a cut in the federal sales tax rate. That rate remains at 7 
per cent from coast to coast.
<P>
	This a cost sharing with the Atlantic provinces. They pick up the 
first 5 per cent loss on their own provincial sales tax revenue. But it 
a cost sharing over four years. In other words, this is transition 
funding. It ends at the end of four years. It is not permanent.
<P>
	The kind of rate cut that the member is talking about would be a 
permanent rate cut. Obviously he is comparing an apple and 
orange. I am sorry but it is not on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
sounds like fruit salad to me. Even if I could not sing, for a billion 
dollars I could learn to harmonize too.
<P>
	The pay-off to the Atlantic provinces is unfair. It taxes the rest of 
Canada in order to subsidize taxation in another area of the country.
<P>
	When will the finance minister admit that this is not a business 
deal, it is a political deal? The harmonization deal asks other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2252"> 2252 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians to keep paying 7 per cent while  people in another part of 
the country pay only 5.5 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
try as he might, the hon. member is not going to be able to make 
this stick.
<P>
	It was not the federal rate that came down. It was the provincial 
rate that came down. The provincial rate came down because the 
Atlantic provinces, albeit using a certain amount of transition 
funding, are absorbing that cut and expect to make it up as a result 
of increased activity.
<P>
	Let us take a look at what is being said here. The government is 
providing transitional funding on a four-year basis on an average to 
the three provinces of $250 million a year. A cut in the national rate 
from 7 per cent to 5.5 per cent would cost about $4.5 billion a year.
<P>
	What the hon. member is asking for is the equivalent of $250 
million transition funding leading to a $4.5 billion cut which is 
simply nonsense. The fact is in B.C., it would be $725 million and 
in Alberta it would be $485 million. The numbers simply do not 
stand up.

	This minister is responsible for promoting competition. Yet, 
over the last month, the price of gasoline has increased by more 
than 25 per cent.
<P>
	To protect consumers just as the American government is doing

of the Minister of Industry to give an order to the director of 
competition is seldom used. In fact, it has been used only once in 
Canada.
<P>
	At this time, we do not have enough information to justify such 
an order, but if the member wants to ask questions to the director, I 
think he will be appearing before the industry committee.

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the

issue directions to hold investigations every time somebody made 
an allegation.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, there have been a number of 
situations with respect to gasoline prices that have been 
investigated by the director of the competition bureau. That has 
led, in recent months, not only to charges having been laid but 
successful prosecutions under the provisions of the Competition 
Act.
<P>
	The director has also established a 1-800 number so that 
consumers who have concerns about gas prices can make those 
concerns known directly to the bureau of competition so that action 
can be taken where it is warranted.

<P>
	B.C. salmon stocks are rapidly shrinking. Fraser River stocks are 
almost gone and this year's Alaskan catch will severely hurt our 
northern runs. One would think the government's plan would 
include a strategy to save the salmon but it does not. The minister 
of fisheries is fiddling with licences while the B.C. fishery burns.
<P>

preserve salmon stocks in British Columbia or not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
will be aware that a parliamentary committee has been considering 
the plan and it does involve consideration of a long range strategy.
<P>
	In fact, as a result of fruitful discussions between the minister, 
the parliamentary secretary and the main stakeholders in British 
Columbia in the salmon industry, the parliamentary committee will 
be hearing expert witnesses in the next week. It will be advising on 
the development of a strategy.
<P>
	We are faced with two problems, an immediate short run, a 1996 
problem that is near crisis dimensions, and a long range one. There 
are all these matters. For one month there has been a continuing 
process of discussion with the main stakeholders. Continuing 
input, including input from the hon. member, will all be part of the 
final plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the delegation to 
which the minister's representative refers has told the committee 
and the members of Parliament that the measures in the Mifflin 
plan will not conserve salmon in British Columbia. The minister 
admitted as much in the House yesterday in response to a question 
from this party.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	His admission flies in the face of what the minister said when he 
announced the plan in March. He emphatically told British 
Columbians that conservation was the overall objective, and now 
he admits it is not.
<P>
	Why is the government spending all its bloated bureaucratic 
energy on a plan that does not stop the pie from shrinking, but just 
gives bigger pieces to fewer people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
too selective in his recourse to witnesses. We have heard many 
people, many strongly in support of plan, many critical. The 
government is open to a dialogue, to discussion, and we are 
considering all these matters.
<P>
	As far as the industry is concerned, it has been made clear by the 
minister that the first priority is the conservation of the fish. But the 
good health of the industry is dependent on conservation. Let us get 
through 1996, then 1997-98 will be a more normal season.

	Further to yesterday's discussion, it is becoming abundantly 
clear that the government's CPP hearings are a sham and that the

payroll tax.
<P>
	Consider the structure of the hearings. Only Liberal MPs are 
allowed to sit on the panel. Only one MP, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance, is attending all of the 
hearings, and this one MP has already said that he advocates an 
immediate doubling of the CPP payroll tax from 5.5 per cent to 10 
per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister admit the obvious? The fix is in on these 
hearings.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance and I 
have had many discussion about this to ensure that the process 
from the federal government's point of view is properly conducted.
<P>
	To correct the impression left by the hon. member, the member 
of Parliament who is representing the Government of Canada is the 
chairman of the industry committee but is certainly no longer the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, and is actually 
acting our behalf.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Even with the flexible federalism being practised in this country, 
it would be impossible for one federal member of Parliament to put 
the fix in with 10 provinces and the territories. This is a 
co-operative arrangement. It can only be changed, as I recall off the 
top of my head, with the agreement of seven of the provinces, 
representing 70 per cent of the Canadian population. Not even the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre can put that kind of a fix 
in.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
despite the hon. member's remarks to me, I would like to read into 
the record a statement made on April 14 by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre who said: ``My own view is if we 
reorganize the program and stabilize the contributions at 
somewhere in  the range of 10 per cent, it would be a more 
adequate solution''.
<P>
	This amounts to an additional 5 per cent payroll tax taken from 
the pay cheque of every Canadian from coast to coast. Will the 
minister state for the record that he will not implement this, the 
worst of all possible scenarios?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I keep trying to reassure the 
hon. member that it is not going to be a unilateral decision of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	There is another side to the coin. When the hon. member who 
was involved in the hearing process expressed his views, I have no 
doubt he was saying that, depending on the need to maintain an 
appropriate level of support for recipients of the Canada pension 
plan in the future, there will have to be some hard decisions made. 
That was his view. As indicated in the quote, it was a personal view. 
However, his personal views will have to be seen through the prism 
of all of these hearings, with all of the provinces being involved.
<P>
	At the end of the process, whatever the recommendations may be 
of the government and the various provincial governments 
involved, it will be brought to the House where all members will 
have an adequate and appropriate opportunity to express their

because of their violent conduct, are at a high risk to re-offend by 
harming others after their release from prison. These proposals 
would empower the court to impose periods of supervision as long

<P>
	The response to that initiative, led by the Government of 
Canada, was less than warm. Governments across the country, 
practically without exception, said that although they recognized 
the need for child care, they wanted to make sure the Government 
of Canada understood the jurisdictional questions and that 
whatever the Government of Canada did it would be compatible 
with what the provinces saw as their needs and based on their 
capacity to provide resources.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member we have had conversations with 
representatives of all governments across the country. We believe 
there is a very good opportunity to continue to play a national role 
in the provision of child care.
<P>
	I look forward to working with individuals and groups, people 
who are interested in this matter, as well as with provincial 
governments to ensure the Government of  Canada plays a 
significant but acceptable role in the provision of child care support 
across the country.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your giving me the floor so early. Our proceedings are 
moving faster and faster, exactly the reverse of what we are used to 
from the government.
<P>
	Regarding this bill, before oral question period, I was listening 
to my colleague, the member for Portneuf, with whom I share the 
same views on the negative consequences of unemployment 
insurance. At the end of my speech, I will have the opportunity to 
be more specific as to its impact on the area I represent, namely the 
south shore, the area of Bellechasse.
<P>
	Obviously, when we talk about unemployment insurance, it 
always brings us back to the history of the Canadian Federation, to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2256"> 2256 </A></B>
<P>
the constitutional background of  this whole issue. I will go back to 
a time when my father had just turned 30, in 1938, and a new 
session was starting; 10 years later, I had the pleasure to be born, 
coming into a world of unemployment insurance. I will read 
something I wrote several years ago.
<P>
	In 1938, at the start of the new session of Parliament, the 
government mentioned in the throne speech that it was seeking the 
co-operation of the provinces to amend the British North America 
Act to give the Canadian Parliament the necessary power to 
implement a national unemployment insurance plan.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	The governor general added:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``My ministers hope that the proposal may meet with early 
approval in order that unemployment insurance legislation may be 
enacted during the present session of Parliament''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That was in 1938. In fact, as early as November 5, 1937, the 
federal government had contacted the provincial governments and 
asked them their views on the principle of an amendment to the 
British North America Act that would give unemployment 
insurance to the federal authority.
<P>
	It must be remembered that there was no amending formula at 
the time. We will see the somewhat twisted and strange way in 
which the federal government acted to take over control of 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	So, in 1937, a detailed proposal was submitted to the provinces; 
in March 1938, the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island had totally 
agreed on the amendment proposed by the federal government. As 
for the Government of Ontario, it had given its agreement in 
principle without expressing its views on the text submitted by the 
federal government. Only Alberta, New Brunswick and Quebec 
had refused to agree to the constitutional amendment.
<P>
	It must be remembered that in 1938 the Union Nationale 
government, under Mr. Duplessis, whose favourite theme was 
respect for provincial autonomy, was certainly not about to agree to 
such an amendment. The Government of Quebec was undoubtedly 
willing to assume responsibility for unemployment insurance in 
due course, according to the wishes of the voters.
<P>
	However, after the provinces in question rejected its proposal, 
the federal government did not go ahead with its plan. According to 
the statements made by the then Prime Minister of Canada, 
Mackenzie King, especially in 1938-39, although the federal 
government did not want to enshrine in a constitutional agreement 
the principle that constitutional amendments should be approved 
by  the provinces, it was not willing to go ahead with its proposal as 
long as there was provincial opposition to it.
<P>
	What happened? On June 25, 1940, Prime Minister Mackenzie 
King made the announcement in the House of Commons that all 
nine Canadian provinces had finally approved the amendment 
proposed by the federal government. Quebec had elected a new 
government, the Godbout government, in 1939. Ernest Lapointe, 
the minister, got involved in the election campaign, saying that the 
Liberals were the only guarantee against conscription. As members 
may recall, they did not keep their promise, giving the green light 
to conscription for Quebecers and ignoring the results of the 1942 
plebiscite. Even today, in 1996, our questions to the government 
remain unanswered: Would it respect Quebecers' democratic vote 
on the same issue today? The question remains unanswered, as it 
was in 1942, when the plebiscite results were ignored.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec at the time paid dearly, losing the 
1944 election, which saw the Union Nationale return to power. The 
government paid the price, but it was already too late. No 
amending formula, no public ratification. How did this happen? 
Through telephone calls-or telegraph messages at the time-or 
simply through an exchange of letters.
<P>
	In eight out of the nine provinces-as members may recall, 
Newfoundland was still a Dominion at the time, a status which 
Newfoundlanders may or may not regret-only the cabinet had 
conveyed its approval in a simple letter. A two cent stamp to say 
they agreed with a constitutional amendment. Only the British 
Columbia legislature formally approved the amendment. In only 
one out of the nine provinces was the amendment voted on by 
members of the legislature.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Then there was a letter most likely signed by the clerk of the 
executive council that said: ``Yes, let us amend the Canadian 
Constitution''. In a strong position because of this letter, the House 
voted an address to the Imperial Parliament asking for some 
amendments to the Canadian Constitution. It is important to note 
however that, following a decision made two years earlier, on June 
17, 1936, this was one of the rare occasions where the Supreme 
Court of Canada stated 1936, that the employment and social 
insurance act was ultra vires the powers of the federal Parliament, 
hence recognizing provincial jurisdiction over this area. The 
decision of the Supreme Court was sanctioned by the Privy Council 
in 1937, on January 27, 1937, to be specific.
<P>
	These dates have to be mentioned, because in constitutional 
matters, as we have often heard and as my grandfather used to say, 
the Supreme Court is like the leaning tower of Pisa, it always leans 
the same way. Nothing has changed. It was the same in the 1930s, it 
was the same at the beginning of the century, and it all started in 
1875, when that court was first established.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2257"> 2257 </A></B>
<P>
	To come back to what the Minister of Justice said earlier, when 
he told the House that he wants to intervene in litigation dealing 
with Quebec issues and with the fundamental right of Quebecers 
to self-determination, I sure hope that the last word over the future 
of the people of Quebec will remain in the hands of those, in 
Quebec, who have the right to vote. The right to self-determination 
is a question of legitimacy that cannot be restricted by any outside 
influence.
<P>
	Following this brief overview-I have many more pages I could 
read on this, but I will refrain from doing so-of the situation in an 
area like mine, that goes from the Beauce region to the beautiful 
riding of Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, from the St. Lawrence 
River to the Maine border, I can tell the House that the legislation 
before us will hurt. The same as in all the regions. The regions will 
be hit hardest. Members who represent other areas have also 
expressed their point of view.
<P>
	It will be tough on seasonal workers, and there are a lot of 
forestry workers in my riding who, because of the production 
calendar in this industry, work a limited number of months every 
year and will be hard pressed to work the required number of hours 
to become eligible for UI benefits. They will then have to resort to 
welfare. Once workers get a taste of welfare, it is hard to get them 
all back to work.
<P>
	In general, people in my area are not very rich. They are poor 
financially, but their wealth is in their heart, in their fundamental 
values. These are people who want to work, who like to work, who 
do not complain for no reason but who want to enjoy the same 
benefits as other Canadians do. However, these are people who, 
because of what I would call the unemployment insurance map, are 
included in regions that are not to their advantage.
<P>
	When I see that, for unemployment insurance evaluation 
purposes, the people of Sainte-Apolline, in my riding, a community 
of less than 1,000 people where unemployment is high, where there 
is a forest management co-operative, are in the same group as the 
people of thriving communities such as Saint-Jean-Chrysostome or 
Saint-Romuald, in the riding of Lévis, I can say there is a problem 
with human resources development in Canada. We should look at 
this and draw up a new map that reflects reality.
<P>
	People who live in the RCM of Montmagny and in the RCM of 
L'Islet have a lot more in common with people who live in the 
RCM of Kamouraska than with those who live in the RCM of 
Desjardins or of Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, which do not have the 
same dynamic and the same prosperity.
<P>
	We have to be careful with statistics. What do we do when we 
want to get statistics? We interview people. We ask them questions 
about their income, about their employment status, about their 
employability. We make sure to come by when people are not 
around, when  young people are not around. I have to say that in 
several parishes in my riding, especially in the southern part, near 
the state of Maine, the employment rate among young people is 
extremely low and these people have left that part of the riding in 
droves. And the ones who come back are almost sure not to find a 
job.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	So we have to look closely at these numbers. I agree with the 
views expressed by my colleagues in the official opposition and I 
will vote accordingly on the proposed amendments at report stage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you 
have seen, this debate has injected some passion into our Liberal 
and Reform friends. We have seen the number of people who have 
risen to take part in the debate.
<P>
	But, more seriously, it is with some surprise that we note that 
even with a debate as important as that on unemployment insurance 
reform, which, in several ridings represented by Liberal MPs, has 
led to very large demonstrations, these MPs, who were elected, let 
us not forget, to represent their constituents, nonetheless remain 
silent, probably to toe the party line yet again.
<P>
	These MPs are remaining silent in the face of a bill that will hurt 
all, or many, of the inhabitants of their ridings, especially the MPs 
representing remote areas, those representing the Atlantic 
provinces, those who should be aware of what is going on and of 
the demonstrations that have taken place in their ridings.
<P>
	I am very surprised to see how quiet these MPs are, but I would 
like to say ``well done'' to the members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
including the member for Mercier, who did an excellent job in 
bringing to the public's attention the hidden agenda, the effects of 
which would have been felt by the people of Canada and Quebec in 
a few weeks or months.
<P>
	I think it is thanks to the work of the hon. members for Mercier, 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup and Lévis, to name but a few, that 
we can now discuss here in the House, for one day or several, a bill 
the government tried to sneak by us. But thanks to the work of that 
committee, we have the opportunity to discuss it here.
<P>
	To start off, I would like to quote from a brief submitted to the 
committee, a brief Liberal members most likely wanted to shelve 
quickly. It was written by Jean-Guy Ouellet and Georges Campeau, 
who are not professional agitators or bad separatists, but lawyers 
specializing in social law, respectively lecturer and professor in the 
legal sciences department of UQAM.
<P>
	They say in this brief, and I quote: ``The bill on employment 
insurance-already the name is somewhat strange, and I will 
explain what I mean by that later-is part of a policy aimed at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2258"> 2258 </A></B>
<P>
using the unemployment insurance fund to finance an increasing 
number of  activities other than benefit payments. Not only is this 
policy to the detriment of the right to benefits of an increasing 
number of contributors to the system, but-and this is the most 
important thing-its constitutionality-as my colleague from 
Bellechasse was saying earlier-is far from being certain. By using 
unemployment insurance premiums, a surplus fund of $5 billion, to 
finance more than benefit payments, the federal legislation is de 
facto transforming these premiums into a regressive tax. Because 
of the capping of maximum yearly insurable earnings at $39,000, 
such a use of the unemployment insurance account is not only 
inequitable-the authors repeat-but its constitutionality is 
doubtful''.
<P>
	Further along in the text, we can read: ``The federal Parliament's 
jurisdiction in the unemployment insurance sector is to collect 
premiums in order to compensate people in case they become 
unemployed''. Not to meddle into all provincial programs. Not to 
try to reinvent programs sponsored by the Council for Canadian 
Unity. It is, I repeat, to collect contributions to cover those who are 
insured in the event of unemployment. This is the principle of fire 
insurance, of theft insurance. Not reinventing the wheel, not 
reinventing numerous programs.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The conclusion reads: ``It is therefore appropriate to wonder if 
this new direction the plan is taking, with its discriminatory effects 
on certain disadvantaged groups such as young people and women, 
does not also run counter to the equal rights protected by the 
Constitution''. First the authors question the constitutionality of 
Bill C-12, and second they question whether it does not infringe 
upon the equal rights protected by the Constitution.
<P>
	In closing they say: ``Instead of denouncing unemployment 
insurance fraud, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
would be well advised to check out the constitutionality and 
legitimacy of his bill before announcing it and passing it openly''. I 
believe this article clearly demonstrates the immoral nature of the 
bill presented by the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	A few years ago, the present Prime Minister himself condemned 
the unemployment insurance reform bill when it was introduced by 
the Conservative government of the day. Let us keep in mind that 
the bill in question was far more difficult and far more harmful to 
workers than the one introduced now by the Liberals. However, 
they call it employment insurance, but this is not the case. It is not 
employment insurance, it is still a piece of legislation that will 
mostly penalize seasonal workers, along with young people and 
women seeking first jobs. What should be done is to set a 
maximum percentage of unemployment that is acceptable, and that 
is not done  here. In this bill we should specify pro-job creation 
measures, and that is not done here.
<P>
	I will give you an example of the way it not only does not 
encourage jobs creation, but it contributes to increasing the number 
of people unemployed or on welfare and wastes public funds. As 
you will recall, not so long ago, six or eight months perhaps, the 
government decided to redistribute, reorganize employment 
centres across Canada. Only a few weeks before, not months but 
weeks, the Terrebonne employment centre, in my riding, had 
moved into brand new offices in order to meet federal standards. 
The federal government, through the Terrebonne employment 
centre, had to pay huge costs for moving, a ten-year lease, purchase 
of material and furniture. How much? Thousands or even millions 
of dollars? We do not know.
<P>
	Even before the official opening of the employment centre 
people there received a letter saying: ``Sorry, but we moved you a 
bit prematurely; the centre will be closing soon, but we do not 
know when exactly''. You can imagine the atmosphere these people 
in my riding who want to help people find jobs must work in. 
Instead, their morale is undermined by a letter informing them that 
in six months, eight months or a year the centre will be closed and 
they might have to move to Sainte-Thérèse, Saint-Jérôme or God 
knows where. Many of them could even lose their jobs. This is the 
kind of motivation this government is giving to its civil servants, 
who are asked to help people.
<P>
	I believe that if we want to help people find jobs, to reduce the 
unemployment rate, to find work for every Canadian, we should 
first make sure that government spending-I was about to say 
waste-is a little more effective and efficient.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	A small business with an annual turnover of $100,000 is 
supposed to have a business plan, which means a government 
should have one too. I will never accept that a government which is 
wasting money to take an employment centre, move it elsewhere 
while telling the employees concerned that their centre is to be 
closed after hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on it-and 
ruining the atmosphere they work in-I will never accept that such 
a government introduce a bill that is harmful, dangerous and unfair 
for Canadians.
<P>
	I say again for young people who, some day, will have to find a 
first job: if they unfortunately have to turn to unemployment 
insurance, the present system requires them to have worked 15 
hours a week for 20 weeks to be eligible. The bill introduced by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development requires that people 
work twenty-six 35-hour weeks.
<P>
	In other words, a message similar to the one sent to officials of 
the Employment Centre of Terrebonne is being sent to a number of 
students. It tells them: ``Go  to school, get an education but, let us 
warn you right from the start, if you have difficulty finding a job 
after, do not count on the federal government to help you, you will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2259"> 2259 </A></B>
<P>
be on welfare. We will never help you with our new laws and our 
new standards''. Given today's job insecurity, it is almost 
impossible for a student to work a minimum of 35 hours weekly for 
26 weeks in his first job.
<P>
	Therefore, on behalf of young people, of women, of people from 
the various regions, my colleagues in the Bloc and I oppose Bill 
C-12.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take part in this report 
stage debate on the employment insurance bill, Bill C-12. It is 
something I have great feelings about.
<P>
	We have talked about this bill for many months, some people 
longer than I have. Many people on both sides of the aisle have 
spent many long days, weeks and months getting this piece of 
legislation to where it is today.
<P>
	The government believes the object of the exercise is to make all 
aspects of the new employment insurance system fair and 
balanced. We have listened to the concerns raised in hearings by 
the parliamentary committee on Bill C-12 and we have responded 
by fine tuning the legislation to better respond to the reality of 
different job markets.
<P>
	Over the last number of months one of the very important issues 
that has arisen is how to deal with individuals who have gaps or 
breaks in their employment. For example, there are individuals 
whose work patterns consist of some steady weeks of work 
interrupted by some weeks of not working, and then more weeks of 
work. For these individuals setting a relatively short consecutive 
period of weeks worked on which to calculate possible benefits 
could mean very low benefits.
<P>
	The number of people affected is not very small. Approximately 
35 per cent of all claimants who apply for income each year are 
affected by these gaps. That means some 850,000 Canadians with 
irregular work patterns who deserve access to the same protection 
against job loss as do those in regular jobs fell into this category.
<P>
	Ten per cent of all claimants have gaps of four weeks or more. 
The average gap ranges from 2.9 weeks in New Brunswick to 4.8 
weeks in Manitoba. We feel it is not fair to those who, through no 
fault of their own, have not had that steady work prior to becoming 
unemployed. That is why the employment benefit will be 
calculated in a new way. It will allow all individuals to count back 
26 weeks to find their required weeks of work when calculating 
average income for employment insurance benefits.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	This will enable individuals to have gaps of between four and 12 
weeks without affecting their benefit levels. However, benefits will 
still be based on how much they earn in the 26 week period. This 
compromise of maintaining a fixed period of 26 weeks will 
maintain one of the central objectives of the new legislation, which 
is to increase work incentives while at the same time ensuring a 
better relationship between benefits paid and the normal pattern of 
earnings.
<P>
	The 26 week period helps workers with irregular work patterns 
in every region of the country and in all industries from 
construction to the service sector. We feel that this is very 
important. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians in all industries 
suffer this problem of gaps in their employment income. They 
work several weeks and then are off for several weeks. The 
government believes that individuals should not be unfairly 
penalized because of this. In seeking a solution the government has 
had to find a balance between these two objectives.
<P>
	First, a change had to be made to the old system so that there 
would be an incentive to work additional weeks if the work was 
available. In too many cases following the minimum weeks 
worked, an unemployment insurance claim was the first step 
toward finding replacement income rather than the last.
<P>
	Second, many individuals in very high areas of unemployment 
who work in seasonal industries simply do not have the 
employment opportunities which would provide them with the 
steady work necessary to claim an adequate benefit.
<P>
	It is doubly unfair in some cases. Many individuals who can only 
find the minimum number of weeks to qualify also have gaps due 
to the nature of their work, be it construction, the fishery, et cetera. 
Therefore, while all their hours worked would be counted in 
qualifying for benefits, some of their earnings would not be 
counted in determining the size of their weekly cheque.
<P>
	Bill C-12 will allow individuals to count every dollar they have 
earned over the last 26 weeks prior to their claim to determine their 
benefit. The amounts of their employment insurance cheques will 
be calculated by averaging the amount earned over this period.
<P>
	For instance, individuals in high unemployment areas will need 
420 hours, or the equivalent of 12 weeks at 35 hours a week over 
the past year, to qualify. To maximize their benefits they will 
require two more weeks of work to get the full 55 per cent of their 
weekly wage. An individual in a low unemployment area will need 
700 hours of work, or the equivalent of 20 weeks at 35 hours a 
week over the past year. To maximize their cheque they will require 
22 weeks of earnings over the 26 week period.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2260"> 2260 </A></B>
<P>
	The government believes this is a fair and balanced approach 
which strengthens the incentive to work while  at the same time 
providing equal treatment for those workers with gaps in their 
income. It also recognizes that individuals in low unemployment 
areas have more opportunities to fill the gaps with alternative work.
<P>
	In moving to the hours based system of calculating eligibility 
and benefits for unemployed Canadians, the government wants to 
ensure that every hour of work counts and that it pays more to work 
longer where the work is available. That is very, very important.
<P>
	The new system is much fairer for those who work part time and 
in seasonal industries. For example, those who work less than 15 
hours per week will now have their work insured. Under 
employment insurance, 90,000 workers in part time and seasonal 
jobs will now be eligible for benefits. Many will qualify sooner, for 
longer periods and will be able to insure more of their income than 
before. We think this is a great improvement.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Entitlement for benefit and duration of the unemployment 
benefit payable will be based on the number of hours worked in the 
last 52 weeks. Those in areas of high unemployment require 420 
hours as I have said. About 270,000 workers will qualify for an 
additional three weeks of benefits because they will be given full 
credit for all the hours they worked.
<P>
	Many people still have the problem of gaps in their employment. 
They work a few weeks, are off a few weeks and are back at work 
again. Addressing the issue of these gaps was one of the most 
important areas we dealt with and was a major concern of the 
committee and the government. The solution in the amended Bill 
C-12 is to allow all claimants to count back a full 26 weeks to find 
the required weeks of earnings.
<P>
	In closing I feel, as I know my colleagues do on all sides of the 
House, that we have come a long way and we have made many 
great improvements. Many people appeared before the committee. 
Even though many were opposed to the bill in general, I believe 
that after listening, talking, and participating in open-line shows 
they have seen we have done a great justice especially to the 
seasonal workers in bringing these amendments forward.
<P>
	I salute the people who brought the amendments forward. I thank 
the committee for all of its work. I look forward to the bill 
becoming law and to getting on with the process for the people who 
through no fault of their own have to use unemployment insurance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development come up with a bill entitled an 
act respecting employment insurance in Canada. I would suggest, 
as mentioned in the amendments, that it be called an act to amend 
the Unemployment Insurance Act because, outside of an  election 
campaign, can the government promise that this bill is going to 
create jobs? I do not believe it will.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the people in my riding, the citizens of 
Shefford and Granby, the two main cities I represent. I am always 
quite surprised to hear that the federal government intends to work 
in co-operation with the private sector and the provinces to 
collectively invest in job creation. You may have recognized an 
excerpt from the throne speech.
<P>
	This point is directly connected with the promises made by the 
federal government to strengthen the Canadian economy and the 
regions by withdrawing from programs aimed at helping 
businesses and by making deep cuts to the unemployment 
insurance program. In a way that is just as contradictory, in its last 
budget, the federal government announced plans, for 1996-97, for 
an unprecedented reduction of transfer payments to the provinces, 
and drastic cuts in social programs, especially unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	In its last throne speech, the government said that the economic 
situation was not as bad as it seemed in this country, and that if it 
was not much brighter it was the fault of private businesses. In my 
area, 6,000 people signed a petition circulated by the Granby board 
of trade, asking this government to keep the employment centre in 
Granby open. The government ignored it. We also have 
organizations such as the regional development council, trades and 
merchants associations, which are working very hard, and I believe 
it is unfair for the government to be blaming these people.
<P>
	Since the unemployed, students and welfare recipients have 
already been hurt by the reforms contained in last year's budget, 
the government should find other ways of getting money.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	When will the Liberal government admit frankly that it made a 
mistake in choosing to pick on the have-nots of our society and that 
now it is leaving it up to the more affluent classes to determine 
what they will contribute to the overall sacrifice. How will the 
government force the wealthy to do their share, now that the small 
taxpayers are overburdened?
<P>
	For 1996-97, the shortfall under the Canada health and social 
transfer will represent, for Quebec alone, $765 million in lost 
revenues for education, manpower training and other social 
programs. The unemployment insurance reform will cost 
Quebecers another $534 million in 1996.
<P>
	This represents a total of $1.3 billion that Quebec will not 
receive. The reduced unemployment insurance benefits mean less 
money for low income taxpayers. We all know that these benefits 
only pay for food, rent and other basic needs of life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2261"> 2261 </A></B>
<P>
	When the federal government says it will work in agreement 
with the private sector and the provinces, what does it mean? How 
will the government do that? What practical measures, what action 
will be taken? Will it simply impose on the private sector and the 
provinces its own rules and national standards?
<P>
	Let us take my region for example, and more specifically the 
case of Granby, the largest city in the federal riding of Shefford. 
Granby now receives $30,700 in lieu of taxes for federal offices. It 
is quite simple, if there were no federal government, things would 
not change much in my riding since Granby receives only $30,700.
<P>
	Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, with a population slightly smaller than 
that of Granby and a much slower growth rate, receives $5 million 
from the federal government in lieu of taxes. The amount is 
$643,000 in Saint-Hyacinthe. Imagine, $643,000 in 
Saint-Hyacinthe, and $30,700 in Granby. That is what the federal 
government means in our region.
<P>
	Not only do Granby and the region receive very little from the 
federal government, but now the government wants to cut a whole 
series of services and programs. Among other things, in Granby, 
the employment centre would be replaced by a service point. If this 
trend persists, there will be practically no federal services left in 
our region. Where is the rightful share of Granby and its region in 
the redistribution of wealth?
<P>
	The taxpayers of the riding of Shefford are tired of paying and 
getting nothing in return from the central government. However, 
Ottawa is right on one point: from now on, we have to rely on 
ourselves, on the energy and resources of our own regional 
business community, without any help from the federal 
government. That is already what we are doing. We are not relying 
on the federal government which is gradually pulling out.
<P>
	In the next few months, the action plan from Ottawa for the 
riding of Shefford will reduce by more than three quarters the 
number of employees in the Granby employment centre. It is 
ironic, but it is the truth, and I think it should be condemned here. 
Shortly, the majority of employees in the employment centre will 
be out of a job. The closing of this employment centre is an 
irrational, even indecent, decision. That situation is unacceptable. 
People and organizations in the area, including the Chamber of 
Commerce and the various municipalities in the riding, will never 
accept this situation.
<P>
	Soon, the city of Granby, the regional capital of my riding of 
Shefford, with more than 67,000 constituents, will have only one 
post office and one RCMP detachment left, plus two or three other 
points of reduced services.
<P>
	I will give the House another example, to show to what extent 
Ottawa is pulling out despite its promise to stimulate employment.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In 1994, $386,488 were allocated for job creation for students in 
Granby and the area. In 1995, these funds from the Department of 
Human Resources Development dropped to less than $207,000, 
that is a budget cut of almost half in less than a year. This year, 
prospects for students are a little more generous, $257,000, but we 
are far from what we had before.
<P>
	So, when Liberals promise to do more and better for the 
economy, they could not do worse. The federal government's 
apathy in Shefford is blatant. Even the Chamber of Commerce of 
Granby has proved it by circulating a petition, as I said earlier. It 
collected 6,300 signatures of people asking for that the 
employment centre in Granby be maintained, and that was refused. 
The petition was tabled here in the House and the response was 
negative. For this government, Granby and Shefford no longer 
exist, do not exist.
<P>
	The only thing Ottawa managed to do was to unite all social and 
economic stakeholders, no matter their political allegiance, against 
the federal government's reforms and especially against the 
proposed unemployment insurance reform. People in Shefford 
have a long memory and will remember this Liberal government 
that does not recognize them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that 
members of the Bloc Quebecois are joining together in defending 
this style of management, which goes against the interests of the 
people of Quebec in particular.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> And of Canada as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> And of Canada as well. But I, Mr. 
Speaker, am more interested in Quebec and not as concerned about 
what is happening outside Quebec.
<P>
	In my opinion, employment insurance is a kind of smoke screen 
put up by the government to show that its proposal will create more 
jobs than good old unemployment insurance. When one knows that 
the purpose of manpower training is to create jobs, one realizes that 
the federal government has no real intention of withdrawing from 
this area.
<P>
	I submit to the House that this bill allows the government not to 
create jobs but to create a new tax. In fact, the secretary of state 
responsible for finance stated a few weeks ago here in this House 
that the new UI fund will be much bigger than in the past, since 
premiums are higher and benefits lower. This fund will grow 
significantly. There is talk of billions of dollars within five years. 
The secretary of state even said that this fund would be used to 
reduce the deficit. This would make it a new tax, would it not? Let 
us be clear. We-at least in the Bloc Quebecois-are intelligent 
enough to understand this kind of thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2262"> 2262 </A></B>
<P>
	The secretary of state added that premiums were now higher 
so we can meet UI needs during hard times. May I remind 
members that we are living in hard times. I wonder how much 
the government will collect during good times. It should be quite 
a haul.
<P>
	The free trade agreement with the U.S. and the rapid 
technological changes of the last few years have turned 
employability and job requirements upside down.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	This means we must act very quickly in setting rules so that 
people can upgrade their skills in light of the new requirements 
resulting from technological change and free trade with the U.S. 
and other countries. This bill, this new UI reform, does not really 
address these issues.
<P>
	The other reason I disagree with this bill is that the Liberal 
government has never had much credibility, especially now, and we 
have a hard time believing in it. I was here in this House when there 
was a UI reform proposal and the Liberals were in opposition. I 
heard Sheila Copps and the ``rat pack'' condemning that UI reform 
proposal roundly. Yet, unlike today's reform, the one back then had 
it all over this one, as far as being just and fair is concerned.
<P>
	For these reasons, I think the government has no credibility 
whatsoever to manage the system. As employers and unions have 
said in the past, I say to the House that the government should 
partially privatize the management of UI and manpower training. A 
private UI system, like any private insurance company, should 
manage the UI fund, which, in fact, comes entirely from employers 
and employees.
<P>
	The board of directors would manage the system, and part of the 
training would be managed jointly by management and union 
representatives.
<P>
	Let me explain why we should proceed that way. Given that only 
employers and employees contribute to the UI fund, they should be 
responsible for managing it. This only makes sense. There would 
be much less waste, there would be much less grandstanding. Like 
any other insurance, it would be aimed strictly at protecting 
employees and meeting their needs.
<P>
	Here is another reason. If we make employees and employers 
more responsible, there is a chance they will manage everything 
better, otherwise they would have to bear the consequences and be 
forced to collect higher premiums.
<P>
	Currently, there are employers who tend to lay off employees too 
quickly. The minute something happens, they say: ``No problem. 
We will let them go. The unemployment insurance system will look 
after them''.
<P>
	If an employee misbehaves, if he is late a few times, if his wife is 
sick and he does not show up for work, his employer is sometimes 
quick to fire him. This, unfortunately, often happens too easily and 
too quickly.  Why? It is because employers count on the 
government or the unemployment insurance system to look after 
employees who are laid off.
<P>
	The same is true in the case of an employee who decides to not 
go to work because he feels he does not have enough holidays, 
because he is a little tired, or for any other trivial reason, or an 
employee who does not work well and does not care because ``if I 
lose my job, I can claim UI benefits''.
<P>
	By contrast, if the employee and the employer had to meet all the 
costs involved, they would be more responsible, if only to avoid 
having to pay increased premiums. And if they did have to pay 
more, they would be more careful in the future. Indeed, an 
employer would then think twice before firing an employee for a 
trivial reason.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	So, we could adjust more quickly and effectively if employees 
and employers could manage a private unemployment insurance 
fund, as well as part of the manpower training required to truly 
meet the needs of businesses, given the current and rapid 
technological changes, and given the free competition, particularly 
in North-America but also worldwide. This would result in an 
improved economy, something that is necessary, considering that 
way too many people are unemployed and live on welfare.
<P>
	For these reasons, I feel that we should soon set aside the 
unemployment insurance program and replace it with an insurance 
similar to any other type of insurance, whether it is private medical 
care insurance, life insurance, etc., particularly since 
unemployment insurance meets a daily need.
<P>
	Again, for these reasons, I strongly suggest to the minister that, 
if he wants a true unemployment insurance reform, he should 
withdraw from this program and give employers and employees the 
responsibility of managing their own unemployment insurance 
fund.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too am pleased to speak to Bill C-12, which will surely 
have an impact in rural communities of Canada and in a riding like 
mine.
<P>
	I would like to focus on two topics: seasonal workers and the 
number of hours they work, and the monitoring program that will 
be provided, first for the implementation of this new act and then, 
after its implementation, for evaluation of the results of this true 
reform of the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The old Unemployment Insurance Act had not been revamped 
for 25 years. Of course with changing times and an economy which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2263"> 2263 </A></B>
<P>
is taking some very different turns making it very different from 
what it used to be, it  was a must for the Government of Canada to 
modernize the act.
<P>
	Thousands of Canadians today are working long, hard hours 
without protection at all under the existing UI program. Why? 
Because they are working those hours for different employers and 
as far as UI is concerned, those hours do not count. Workers cannot 
get insurance unless they work at least 15 hours per week for a 
single employer. That is under the old system.
<P>
	The new employment insurance bill changes that. It bases 
eligibility on hours worked and not on weeks worked. Whether a 
person works 36 hours a week for one employer or two or more 
employers makes no difference. An hour worked is an hour 
worked.
<P>
	For example, seasonal workers often work long hours during 
peak season. Under this EI bill, about 270,000 workers will receive 
an additional three weeks of benefits because they will now be 
credited for all the hours in weeks they could not have used as 
qualifying weeks under the old system. It is a simple common 
sense change which is long overdue. Work patterns are changing in 
this new economy, which will be the second part of my 
presentation.
<P>
	Bill C-12 is a result of a lengthy and inclusive consultation 
process. The government listened to what Canadians had to say 
about income support for unemployed workers and the kind of 
employment benefits that would help people get back to work. EI is 
indeed a result of this.
<P>
	The government also relied on substantial amounts of research. 
Experts have looked at all aspects of how the old UI system 
worked. They know it can affect the behaviour of employers and 
workers in ways Canadians do not accept any more. It can lead 
people to turn down available work. It can lead employers to cycle 
people in and out of jobs. It is not because people do not want to 
work but because the system does not always work well.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	This new bill is designed to reward work effort. It strengthens 
work incentives and insurance principles. It also ensures fairness 
by ensuring an adequate income for those in need. We are talking 
about those people who make less than $26,000. They will receive 
a supplement.
<P>
	Research gives us good reason to believe that the EI approach 
will be successful. People who have criticized the bill have not 
been able to point to the same kind of thorough, objective analysis. 
Now we will go a step further with a thorough, vibrant process 
designed to tell us if our expectations are being met in practice, if 
behaviours are changing as much as we expect or even more.
<P>
	We will look at how the new system works in a dozen 
communities chosen to represent a range of labour market 
environments all across Canada, that is, towns  with different 
workplaces, disciplines and domains which will ensure a good 
cross-section of employees and employers and the kind of work 
they do for a more precise analysis. The Employment Insurance 
Commission will do its own research to monitor how individuals, 
employers, communities and local economies are adapting to the 
new Employment Insurance Act. We will see those results 
annually. Surveys of individuals, employers and community 
representatives will provide a third monitoring approach.
<P>
	These processes will give us the required feedback to adjust the 
program if the evidence shows that we need to. The commitment to 
monitor the impact of EI is yet another example of the 
government's goal for a system that is fair and effective in every 
sense of the term.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to take part in the debate and especially to speak in 
favour of seasonal workers who, in the past, did not fully benefit 
from the unemployment insurance system as it had been 
established. Many people were working long hours, but for short 
periods. This meant that they did not have the required number of 
weeks, but this new employment insurance legislation will deal 
precisely with this serious problem since, after July 1, the date this 
new act will come into force, every hour worked will count for 
unemployment insurance purpose. That will benefit some 270,000 
Canadians. It is extremely important that this figure be clearly 
pointed out in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to thank the hon. member for Mercier, as 
well as my colleagues from Lévis and 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, for the excellent work they did on 
this issue. Never before, during the last two years and a half, have 
we put so much work into a bill. Of course, we worked hard on 
other pieces of legislation, but particularly on this one. We did so 
for two main reasons. First, this legislation affects all the citizens 
from coast to coast, and especially the people in Quebec. Second, 
Bill C-12 goes directly after the poor and the destitute.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois has focused all of its efforts to 
try to reason with the government. We used some very solid 
arguments. I will not go over them again, we have mentioned them 
often enough. We have shown that this is not a good reform 
proposal. Today, I want to try to reach the hearts of my colleagues, 
and I hope they have some compassion left. In a democracy, the 
people are represented by those they chose to elect. But they have 
taken to the streets.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	They do not want a mini-reform, they want this employment 
insurance bill, as it is called, to be completely withdrawn. The 
people who have taken to the streets are not beer drinkers, not 
professional agitators  and certainly not cowards. Quite the 
opposite, these people are responsible citizens. But mostly, 
although these people want to work, they cannot find work year 
round. These are outstanding citizens. Some people in my riding 
and elsewhere have heard of Nelson Pilote, from 
Saint-Alexandre-des-Lacs, who is a tree harvester. In the 
summertime, he gets up at 4 a.m., brings 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2264"> 2264 </A></B>
<P>
his chain saw with him to the forest and works until 5 or 6 p.m. He 
works hard. He has a nice family, five young children.
<P>
	While he receives UI benefits, from the premiums he and his 
employer paid, he does not do any moonlighting. What does he do 
instead? Volunteer work. He coaches hockey and several other 
sports. He teaches young children and gives them a fresh outlook 
on life. He is not necessarily a PQ or a sovereignist partisan, but he 
puts his heart into it and he wants to live a decent life.
<P>
	In Amqui, he gathered, not by himself, of course, but with the 
help of a few unions, 5,000 people, who came to demonstrate and 
ask for the withdrawal of Bill C-12 now before the House.
<P>
	Also, I have a friend who is a bishop in Gaspé. He is not involved 
in politics either. He too joined the workers to ask, on behalf of his 
flock, that this bill be withdrawn because he knows that in Gaspé as 
in Matane and in Mont-Joli as well as in Amqui, people want to 
work but it is not so simple. Come and try to create jobs in our 
region! You will see that it is more complicated than you think.
<P>
	Members are also aware that forestry jobs are the least costly to 
create. The Canadian government cut its $6.5 million a year grant 
to the East Plan, which created jobs, good jobs. They cut it. They 
also want to cut funding for the Maurice Lamontagne Institute, 
where year after year researchers make discoveries that are 
published throughout the world.
<P>
	It seems to me that the government is cutting funding 
everywhere: for researchers who give hope to the young and for the 
most disadvantaged people, the poorest of the poor. And for women 
in our areas, especially the rural areas. Women who have seasonal 
jobs will suffer as well as seasonal and part-time workers.
<P>
	I do not want to go over all the arguments again. Members know 
quite well that in our areas as elsewhere in Quebec and in the 
Atlantic Provinces, it is almost impossible for someone who enters 
the workforce to accumulate 910 hours of work. Only a few will be 
able to do it.
<P>
	Yes, I appeal to my colleagues. Let us hope that our arguments 
will at least touch their hearts, if not their minds.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	It is not easy for people who want to work and who will no 
longer be entitled to this employment insurance, that back home we 
call poverty insurance, because that is  right where it will lead. 
Someone said to me: ``Do you know that if this employment 
insurance comes to our regions, people will be worse off in a few 
years than they were during the '30s''? They will turn to welfare, of 
course, but they do not want to. People want to work.
<P>
	You know, it is very hard on a person's morale to rely on welfare. 
I have known many men with families who, having lost their jobs 
and been on unemployment insurance for a year, have then 
unsuccessfully sought work and become completely discouraged. 
The whole family was affected. It is extremely hard for the 
children, and it then becomes society's problem. It is not just the 
individual's problem, the family's problem, but the community's or 
society's problem.
<P>
	This is why I am appealing to my colleagues. There is still some 
time left. They can still vote against Bill C-12. I ask them with all 
my heart to think about their constituents. There were 
demonstrations in the Atlantic provinces as well. If we want to 
represent our constituents properly, how can we not listen to what 
they have to say? I find this tragic.
<P>
	Of course, they can always say that if we do not listen to them, 
two years, six months down the road, they will throw us out. As 
you well know, Madam Speaker, in four or five years, a 
government in power can do a lot of stupid things, and you know 
that they have done their share. They are about to do it again. I 
think that this will be the worst yet, a terrible mistake, and it is 
workers, young people, women, in other words, the poorest 
members of our society, who will suffer the consequences. It is not 
just the individual who is affected, as I was saying earlier, but 
families, parishes, all of society. When apolitical people say that it 
does not make sense, I ask my colleagues across the way to sit up 
and take note.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I, 
too, am pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-12 to express a 
viewpoint which resembles that of my colleagues, of course, and 
also that of a lot of people in the riding of Témiscamingue. In fact, 
next Saturday, people will hold a demonstration in the streets of 
Rouyn-Noranda to show their opposition to this legislation, which 
will affect many of them.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves some questions. This legislation is 
called the Employment Insurance Act. That is awfully close to 
being false representation because it does not deal with 
employment in any way. The government wanted to change the 
name of the old unemployment insurance plan to show that it was 
proposing a reform involving significant changes. There are two 
ways to criticize this bill. It can be criticized for what is included in 
it, and for what was left out of it. Let me say at the outset that 
nobody can oppose the idea of modernizing our social programs, of 
adapting them and adjusting them to the reality of the 21st century.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2265"> 2265 </A></B>
<P>
	I will have the opportunity, in the second part of my speech, 
to talk about the measures that could have been included in this 
bill to undertake a true unemployment insurance reform for 
purposes other than those of the finance minister. But even that 
is not very clear.
<P>
	The first question I ask myself is, what is the real purpose of this 
reform? We know that after the first cuts made in the 1994-95 
budget, there was a $5 billion surplus in the unemployment 
insurance fund at the end of the year.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	There must be no mistake, the fund is not in a state of 
catastrophe. There are revenues of $5 billion more than there are 
expenses for unemployment insurance. Obviously, people will say 
there were years when there was a deficit. If we look cumulatively 
at it, since its inception and as we know it today, the unemployment 
insurance fund has a surplus of about $1 billion. In 1996, another 
$5 billion will be added to this surplus.
<P>
	It cannot be said that the unemployment insurance plan was in a 
catastrophic state. However, the Minister of Finance made sure, in 
all sorts of ways, that he could take out this surplus and use it to 
lower his deficit. With most of his other reforms not giving any 
results, apart from his cuts in transfer payments, the minister 
decided to use the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund to 
provide a certain amount of revenue to reduce his deficit in the 
short term.
<P>
	People have not got the time to put a magnifying glass to every 
government program. However, the unemployment insurance fund 
is supported by contributions from employers and employees. The 
Minister of Finance puts no money from the consolidated fund into 
it. It is paid for by employers and employees. So, to use this surplus 
is to steal from the unemployment insurance fund, it is to impose a 
sort of tax on employment. If that is what they want to do, let them 
say so. Let them cut contributions and add an employment tax to 
pay stubs. Let them explain the real things, because that is what is 
happening.
<P>
	We could discuss the surplus for a long time, but I also want to 
speak of one measure in particular which goes against the present 
trend. Many people wonder about the way the job market is divided 
up. Many workers do a lot of overtime, while many people who 
could work are unable to find a job. How could the work be divided 
more fairly? Such a thing will not happen unless the government 
takes a number of courageous steps, sending out very clear signals 
that this is what it will support.
<P>
	In this bill there is one measure which reduces maximum 
insurable earnings from $42,000 to $39,000. Concretely, this 
means that when people earning more than that do overtime work, 
the employee and the employer-but particularly the 
employer-will not have to contribute anything to unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	Put yourself in the employer's shoes. You have a job to be done, 
and you have a choice between paying a new employee, who will 
have to pay into the unemployment insurance fund-as will 
you-and paying someone who already works for you and for 
whom you will not have to make a contribution, if the work is done 
in overtime. If all of the social responsibilities of employers are 
defined in this way, there is a very clear message: Get people to do 
overtime, do not hire anyone new, it is more cost-effective that 
way.
<P>
	The objective of people in business-legitimately and 
understandably so-is profit, personal accomplishment and so 
forth. If there is no clearer guidance, if they are not helped to 
discipline themselves a bit in this area, they will never of their own 
accord say that they are ready to divide the available work. It is our 
responsibility as legislators to ensure that policy orientations 
correspond to our realities.
<P>
	This bill could have provided a good opportunity to modify 
contributions in the opposite direction, making sure it was more 
advantageous to hire new people than to pay a lot of overtime, too 
much in some cases. It must be understood that, in the medium 
term, employers would notice that those working slightly fewer 
hours were less tired, with fewer work-related accidents, and thus 
lower worker compensation contributions, and so on. But this 
requires a signal, something to set them off in the right direction, 
and there is no such thing in this reform.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I referred to the things that are lacking in this bill. I remember 
that during the debate over the free trade agreement-which I 
wanted, promoted and strongly believe in-there was a lot of talk 
about the adaptation it would necessarily bring about. For weeks, 
years now, we have heard about massive layoffs, job cuts in many 
companies. Often they are people who had held the same job for 
15, 20, 25 years and who now, at 40 or 50, are unemployed, with 
many productive years left in them; as members of the labour 
force, their everyday life would be more stimulating and they could 
contribute to society.
<P>
	Why are these people, who held a job for a long time before 
losing it now when we are entering a new era where technology is 
becoming more specific, not treated differently? Why not consider 
longer training or rehabilitation programs for these people and why 
not keep them much longer on UI?
<P>
	I do not mean for the federal government to put in place its own 
training programs, far from it. Another thing lacking in this bill is 
the transfer of this area to the Quebec government and to the 
provinces wanting it, such as Quebec where the consensus is very 
obvious, and lengthening the entitlement period. You cannot go 
overnight from the textile industry to computer science, 25 to 30 
weeks are not enough.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2266"> 2266 </A></B>
<P>
	We must be realistic. I say it again, nothing in this bill 
guarantees that our unemployment insurance plan will be better 
adapted to the realities of the years 2000, namely changing jobs 
often, many human tragedies for those who had held a job for a 
long time and who will have to work in new sectors. There is 
nothing to this effect in the bill.
<P>
	During the minute and a half I have left, I would like to go back 
to manpower training because I find nothing more frustrating than 
seeing someone come to my office and say: ``I am unemployed, I 
would like to take a course. I read in the paper that the 
unemployment insurance, or some other organization, was offering 
a course''. To know whether he is eligible or not, I have to ask him 
56,000 questions: ``Are you on UI? Have you ever been on UI? Are 
you on welfare?''
<P>
	This situation is due to the fact that there are two levels of 
government with their own structure giving their own courses 
according to their own criteria. Obviously, since it is managing the 
unemployment insurance program, the federal government's 
objective is to target the unemployed. For its part, the Government 
of Quebec, which is responsible for social assistance, gives priority 
to welfare recipients. And in all of this, people without any income 
are nobody's priority.
<P>
	That is a major problem that we will not be able to resolve as 
long as there are more than one level of government responsible for 
this matter. In Quebec we resolved this problem a long time ago. 
We decided that it would be the Government of Quebec, but some 
people here are stubborn, as they say; they have a hard time getting 
the message, which is very clear in Quebec and which was repeated 
during the last socio-economic summit.
<P>
	So, for all these reasons, we cannot support such a bill, 
absolutely not, and I conclude by inviting the people back home in 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the Témiscamingue riding, and especially 
those from Rouyn-Noranda-where there will be a demonstration 
this Saturday-to come and join us in condemning this 
manipulation of the unemployment insurance account and this bill, 
this so-called reform totally lacking in vision for the future, for the 
years 2000.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise today and 
speak in support of Bill C-12.
<P>
	I do not think anyone in the House would argue that to maintain 
the status quo is a non-issue. I believe the modernizing of our 
employment insurance system is a crucial part of the government's 
job and growth agenda.
<P>
	The changes we as a government have brought forward more 
accurately reflect what works best in today's economy. EI will 
continue to provide Canadians with basic income protection, as it 
does under the current  system. It will also include a range of new 
employment measures to help people find work more quickly. In 
short, it is a system designed more effectively to meet the needs of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I will focus my remarks today on how the bill will affect those 
who work in the seasonal industries. Bill C-12 will ensure that up 
to 500,000 part time and seasonal workers who were not covered 
under the old rules will now be insured. About 45,000 seasonal 
workers who currently are not eligible for UI benefits, despite 
paying premiums, will become eligible under the new hours based 
scheme. Some 270,000 workers in seasonal industries will receive 
an additional three weeks of benefits.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-12 also commits to a number of important active 
employment measures, including wage subsidies, earnings 
supplements, self-employment initiatives and job partnerships.
<P>
	In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants seasonal workers make 
up a large and very important part of the local economy. Those 
employed in seasonal industries work extremely hard. If members 
were to talk to any one of the people in my riding I have spoken 
with they would say that if there were work year round they would 
be glad to take it. The reality, however, in many rural communities 
is quite different. Through no fault of their own people do not 
always have access to full time year round employment.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to meet with many groups and 
individuals in my riding to discuss this issue. In our conversations 
they expressed to me some serious concerns about how 
employment insurance would impact those who work in the 
seasonal industries. They asked me to bring the message to Ottawa. 
They said we as a government must ensure any changes are fair and 
do not unduly target those employed in seasonal industries.
<P>
	I, like many of my Atlantic caucus colleagues, brought that 
message to Ottawa. I am pleased the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has listened and responded positively to these 
genuine concerns. The end result is a system that is both fair and 
balanced, a system which will allow more seasonal workers to 
qualify more quickly for more weeks of benefits.
<P>
	One of the most serious concerns I have heard in recent weeks 
was how will the government deal with individuals who have gaps 
or breaks in employment, those whose work patterns consist of 
some steady weeks of work interrupted by a few weeks of 
unemployment and then more steady weeks of work.
<P>
	For constituents in Annapolis Valley-Hants this is a real 
concern. For instance, the agriculture sector is the backbone of our 
economy. However, this means for many people there will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2267"> 2267 </A></B>
<P>
plenty of work available in the  spring and fall but there may be 
gaps in their employment during the summer months.
<P>
	I have also heard similar concerns from constituents who work 
in the fishing industry. For these individuals, setting a relatively 
short consecutive period of weeks of work on which to calculate 
possible benefits could mean very low benefits. The number of 
people who would have been affected is not small. It is 
approximately 35 per cent of all claimants who apply for income 
benefits each year. That means nearly 850,000 Canadians with 
irregular work patterns deserve access to the same protection 
against job loss as do those with regular jobs.
<P>
	In my home province of Nova Scotia the average length of gap is 
over three weeks. Therefore it is not fair to those who through no 
fault of their own have not had steady work prior to becoming 
unemployed. I am pleased the minister has adopted the 
recommendations of the standing committee to count back a full 26 
weeks to find the required weeks of work when calculating average 
income for EI benefits.
<P>
	This will allow individuals to have gaps of between four and 
twelve weeks without affecting their benefit levels. Benefits will 
still be based on how much one earns in the last 26 weeks.
<P>
	This compromise of maintaining a fixed period of 26 weeks will 
maintain one of the central objectives of this new legislation. It will 
increase work incentives while at the same time ensuring a better 
relationship between benefits paid and the normal pattern of 
earnings. This 26-week period significantly helps workers with 
irregular work patterns in every region of the country and in all 
industries from agriculture to the service sector.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Many people in seasonal industries earn relatively low incomes. 
As well, they may live in communities that offer relatively few 
opportunities or have relatively few skills that would lead to better 
paying work. I believe that the new EI system will more effectively 
respond to their needs.
<P>
	Strong efforts have been made by the government to protect low 
income workers in seasonal industries by focusing on higher 
income workers for the savings that are essential to EI. Low 
income people in these industries will also benefit from a new 
system that focuses on helping people get work and creating 
incentives for people to take all the work that is available. Simply 
put, every hour worked will increase an individual's eligibility for 
benefits.
<P>
	A key feature of the new system is the family income 
supplement. This supplement is meant to top up benefits in order to 
reflect family circumstances. It will bring total insurance benefits 
up to as much as 80 per cent of a person's average insured earnings. 
Across Canada, 350,000 claimants in low income families with 
children will be eligible for the supplement. Many will be in the  
seasonal industries and many will be in my riding. In Atlantic 
Canada alone the family income supplement will benefit 54,000 
low income families.
<P>
	Thanks to the efforts of the members of the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development, I am pleased to say that those 
who are receiving family income supplement will be exempt from 
the intensity rule. I believe this is consistent with the government's 
overall efforts to redirect assistance to those who are most in need. 
This is the Liberal way.
<P>
	These are just a few of the many positive elements of the 
legislation. I am pleased that the concerns of seasonal workers have 
been positively addressed in the legislation. I believe that Bill C-12 
will be good for seasonal workers, good for the people of the riding 
of Annapolis Valley-Hants, and good for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Manpower Training.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a long attachment to questions of the economics of 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I was one of the first scholars in Canada to produce evidence that 
the imposition of generous unemployment insurance benefits raises 
the rate of unemployment.
<P>
	All through the post-war years until the early 1970s, American 
and Canadian unemployment rates moved very much in unison. 
They never diverged by more than one-half of a percentage point. 
But in 1972 the system in Canada became much more generous 
with respect to the amount paid when people became unemployed 
relative to the wages they were earning, the number of weeks 
necessary in order to become eligible, the number of weeks paid 
after one became unemployed. Our system was one of the most 
generous in the world.
<P>
	Studies have been done to explain why these differences between 
the Canadian and U.S. unemployment rate developed in the early 
1970s and have since widened and now have settled at 
approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. It is not possible to explain 
these differences by differences in monetary policy, fiscal policy, 
exchange rate policy, any of the traditional measures.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The one that dominates the results of attempts to explain these 
differences is the generosity of our unemployment insurance 
system. This generosity has reduced an enormous amount of lost 
output. The idea of having a generous system is very laudable. 
There is no denying all of the arguments made by the speakers from  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2268"> 2268 </A></B>
<P>
the Bloc Quebecois. The more generous the system is the better off 
are the people who are receiving the money.
<P>
	As people who are concerned with the welfare of all Canadians, 
what are the consequences of these generous benefits and the 
resultant increase in the unemployment rate? I have estimated that 
as a result of this increased generosity, a 3.5 per cent higher rate of 
unemployment existed than would have been if we had stayed at 
the levels at which we were in 1972. Then our national output 
would be over $11 billion higher.
<P>
	The tax take alone on that $11 billion higher income would be 
$3.5 billion. The deficit would be cut substantially and a lot of 
workers who are now unemployed would be employed.
<P>
	When looking at reform of the unemployment insurance system 
it is necessary to do something in addition to what the Bloc 
members have been saying in all of their speeches. If 
unemployment insurance benefits are cut, if the cost of being 
unemployed is raised, certain people will be hurt. That is true. 
However, if that is done benefits are provided to all Canadians. The 
most obvious one is that the unemployment rate would be lower. 
Another is that output would increase and taxation revenues would 
go up.
<P>
	What has to be done is consider adjustments to the present 
system which would bring about these gains in output and 
reductions in unemployment at a cost which would not be too high. 
I have four measures which I believe would be widely and readily 
acceptable to Canadians in order to gain these benefits.
<P>
	The first and most obvious is that the system can be made less 
generous. Maximum benefits equal to 53 per cent of previous 
wages offered by our system now are at or very near the top of 
benefits paid by all industrial countries. However, generosity over 
the UI system also depends on the ease with which workers become 
eligible, how long they can receive benefits, what industries are 
covered, and so on.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that in recent years the system's 
generosity has been reduced substantially. That was one of the 
conclusions reached at a recent conference held here in Ottawa. 
Some analysts suggested that it may now be no more generous than 
it was before the 1972 reform.
<P>
	The pre-1972 levels are not necessarily ideal and further cuts in 
generosity should be considered as long, and I emphasize this, they 
do not impose undue hardship on the neediest.
<P>
	The second measure I believe that Canadians would accept and 
which would bring huge benefits involves tougher measures 
against fraud. I have always treated with some scepticism the 
results of internal audits made by the system which found 
fraudulent claims to be about 1 per cent of all benefits paid. How 
did the investigators discover what are deliberately hidden 
practices? What incentives do they have to show that their 
bureaucratic  and political bosses are running a system that permits 
lots of fraud?
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	There is evidence that my scepticism may be warranted. In the 
equivalent of a social science experiment, five U.S. states recently 
introduced systems for the positive identification of people making 
welfare claims. It is difficult to forge ID cards in numbers tracked 
by computer. They found that fraudulent claims were between 8 
and 15 per cent of welfare payments according to a letter published 
by the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on April 8, 1996.
<P>
	I have a question on the Order Paper for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. In the spending estimates of the national 
accounts, I discovered that last year the amount of money 
recovered from fraud in the insurance system rose by about 3.5 
percentage points or several million dollars.
<P>
	I have asked the minister to explain why, in one year, there was 
such a dramatic increase. Was it because new measures were 
undertaken? What was the cause? Certainly it could not be 
explained by people suddenly becoming 3.5 per cent more 
fraudulent than they were before.
<P>
	The third measure I would recommend is the elimination of 
specific types of abuse. I am very careful not to call them fraud. I 
talk about abuse.
<P>
	All of us have heard about entire school boards announcing in 
April that the teachers and other employees of the school board 
would be laid off in June after classes stop. As a result of this, 
eligibility for unemployment insurance is established. In 
September, these people get rehired. That is an abuse of the system. 
It was never intended.
<P>
	We know the story that the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development was bringing forward all the time. Automobile 
workers were constantly negotiating contracts that involved 
unemployment insurance benefits in their pay package. Those 
kinds of things can be made illegal completely and directly.
<P>
	Finally, for those people who see this program and would like to 
have a more elaborate explanation of what is going on, there are 
measures available for reducing gradually the abuse that is taking 
place by permanent transfers to seasonal industries.
<P>
	It makes no sense that the rest of Canadian workers, some of 
them poor, in areas other than those benefiting, that seasonal 
workers should be receiving, consistently year after year, six times 
the amount of money that they pay in premiums.
<P>
	I have some ideas on how to do this. The paper is available. 
Please write to me at the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address the House on Bill C-12.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2269"> 2269 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is the culmination of a two-year effort on behalf of 
the government to change, to clarify and to improve, hopefully, 
the unemployment insurance system of this country. It has been 
a very long time coming.
<P>
	The people of Canada had their first look at this bill last 
December. Some parts of it were greeted with a great deal of anger 
in some areas. One of the things that really upset members of 
Parliament and seasonal workers in particular was the calculation 
of benefits and what became known as the gap. They were also 
upset with the divisor rule, which reduced their benefits a great 
deal, as well as with the intensity rule, which would penalize 
people who worked in seasonal industries.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	It is unfortunate that in Canada we have winters. We do not fish 
or farm in the wintertime. Neither do we have much of a tourist 
industry in the wintertime. Most of our nation consists of seasonal 
industries manned by seasonal workers. They are full time workers 
in seasonal industries. To penalize them, which was the message 
they received last December, would be a very unfair way to treat 
them.
<P>
	With the change in the cabinet, the new minister undertook to 
rectify those situations. The minister of HRDC comes from an area 
which has seasonal labour, whether it be fishing, forestry, mining, 
tourism or whatever. A large percentage of the workforces in New 
Brunswick and in P.E.I. consists of seasonal labour. In my riding of 
Egmont almost 50 per cent of the labour force is seasonal. To 
penalize them, as we would have been under the bill which was 
introduced in 1995, was unfair and the new minister recognized 
that.
<P>
	The minister and the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development put a lot of work into improving the bill. They 
worked very long hours. There are a lot of amendments which 
came from members of the Atlantic caucus and also from members 
of the Ontario caucus, the Manitoba caucus and the B.C. caucus. As 
I said earlier, the country is made up of seasonal industries due 
mainly to its geography.
<P>
	I compliment the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury. He put an enormous amount of time 
and concern into rectifying the bill. I also compliment my 
colleague from Malpeque who made an amendment which will be 
introduced later on that will improve the bill.
<P>
	The main problem with the old bill was the gap. When a seasonal 
worker applied for unemployment insurance they had to count back 
consecutively 14 straight weeks to calculate their benefit. 
Oftentimes there was no work at all. Even though an individual 
qualified to apply, they did not have 14 consecutive weeks. In an 
extreme case a person could have one week and 13 zeros. That is 
how ridiculous the previous proposal was.
<P>
	We tend to ignore or forget that there was quite a protest against 
these parts of the bill. Whether it was in P.E.I., New Brunswick, 
Quebec or Ontario, people came out to help us make these changes 
in the bill. I was glad to see them demonstrate their support for the 
changes we were proposing. They made sure we held to our word 
that we would change the gap, the intensity rule and the divisor.
<P>
	Once a person's seasonal employment is finished, whether it is 
in August or October, they can go back 26 consecutive weeks. If 
their 14 weeks, or their 12 weeks in the case of Prince Edward 
Island, is within that 26 week period, they will receive full benefit 
for the contributions they have made.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	This will take care of the vast majority of seasonal workers. 
There will be a few who slip through the cracks. As with any new 
legislation there is always improvements that can be made. Even 
though they may not be made in this bill, in the future amendments 
can be made to protect those people who fall through the cracks.
<P>
	There may be a year of adjustment for some people who apply in 
July for unemployment insurance benefits. When they take the 
previous fall's work weeks, coupled with the spring work weeks 
and then apply for unemployment insurance in July, these people 
will be left out. They will have a year of adjustment which may be 
tough.
<P>
	On the intensity rule, it is not a perfect solution. However, if we 
had all kinds of money to apply to every problem we have I 
suppose we would never get out of debt or never get our deficit 
under control.
<P>
	We have to credit the minister for going back to cabinet and 
securing funds which will take care of the cost of the gap, the cost 
of the intensity rule and the cost of the divisor rule. When we add it 
all up there is about an extra half billion dollars put into the bill 
over the past month.
<P>
	The intensity rule now is that if someone is a repeater but their 
household income is $26,000 or less they will not be penalized. 
Depending on their dependants, they may be able to qualify for an 
extra amount of money because they are a low income earner. 
Those with higher incomes will be penalized 1 per cent a year for 
five years, which is still money and still a penalty. I believe it 
should still be recognized that $26,000 in this day and age is not a 
great amount of money and these people should not be penalized.
<P>
	UI was never designed to support somebody who is making 
$60,000 or $70,000 net income. With the clawback that situation 
will be rectified to an extent where in five years' time someone 
making $48,000 will still be eligible to draw UI. Over that they will 
not be able to draw UI. I do not think anybody can argue with the 
fairness of that stipulation in the bill.
<P>

<P>

	I know there are a lot of other things that can be said about 
the bill. I compliment the committee again for all its hard work,

Malpeque and Hillsborough, who have devoted a lot of their time

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the amendments proposed 
by the Bloc Quebecois. I am pleased to speak to these amendments 
because I have always thought that in politics, especially when 
talking about social programs, words are not meaningless.
<P>
	I do not think we will have many opportunities to see, in this 
Parliament, a word as daring and as inappropriate as the one 
proposed by this government which, with its inflated ego, with all 
the superlatives and the artificial pride it is capable of and with the 
strength of its weight, has the audacity to call this bill that is before 
us today, and that has been before us for a number of weeks, the 
Employment Insurance Act.
<P>
	Can you imagine that Canada, a country which, if we look at the 
statistics, has a dismal unemployment rate and where poverty is a 
problem-the National Council on Welfare reminded us of that last 
month when it encouraged us to invest $15 billion to fight against 
poverty-can you imagine that Canada is talking about 
employment insurance?
<P>
	The government is talking about employment insurance with a 
kind of impudence that is unacceptable for parliamentarians. What 
we are saying is that we will talk about employment insurance 
when and only when the government has finally set the stage for 
job creation.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	And what do we see today? There have never been so many 
unemployed people. There have never been so many people 
wanting so much to work than at this time, and we know many in 
our ridings.
<P>
	Each of us has a public voice. Each of us represents people. I 
represent the riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. This riding is in 
the Montreal area, which has a far higher unemployment rate than 
the national average. Yet, today, the government would like the 
Bloc Quebecois to be part of this play on words. But we are 
vigilant, we know what these words mean and we will not support a 
bill that, even in its title, could suggest conditions are there to 
create jobs. We do not accept that and we will never accept that as 
long as we live.
<P>
	Let us look at the premise on which the debate started. Did the 
government ask the human resources development committee to 
suggest ways to develop a number of strategies leading to full 
employment, with what that implies in a system where there are 
two levels of government? That is not the premise on which the 
debate started. The debate started with a $2.3 billion cut.  We 
cannot forget, when we analyze this bill, that it aims first and 
foremost to rationalize, that is, to balance public finances. Of 
course, we are not against balancing public finances, but we are not 
convinced it must be done at the expense of the unemployed.
<P>
	We are in the presence of a government that, with a quite 
appalling regularity, it must be recognized, has tried over the last 
few years-since the Liberals have been in power for almost three 
years-with each of the successive budgets the finance minister 
has tabled in the House, to make cuts that were aimed at people in 
our society who need help.
<P>
	You know what the views of the hon. member for Mercier are in 
this regard, how she and our colleagues who worked with her on the 
human resources development committee propose to put people 
back to work. That is what we should be talking about. But the 
premise we must start from is not a sense of brinkmanship, a 
burden of $2,3 billion. This is not the way to hold a successful 
debate that will allow us to set the stage for full employment.
<P>
	I do not know whether you had the opportunity to read the Fortin 
report. I did. According to Mr. Fortin, since 1990-I must be 
honest with you-the various attacks against unemployment 
insurance, which limit access to benefits, have exerted pressures in 
the order of $1 billion on Quebec's public finances. This statement 
was not made by the hon. member for Mercier, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve or the hon. member for Verchères. The 
economist Fortin-who is not known for his support of 
sovereignty, who is not a friend of the Bloc Quebecois-tabled a 
report saying that repeated attacks against unemployment 
insurance by restricting eligibility to the program had exerted such 
pressures on Quebec's public finances that the Quebec government 
had to spend another $1 billion.
<P>
	What is happening? I am surprised that this government does not 
understand. It is refusing to hold a debate on the real question: How 
can we create jobs in the conditions that will prevail in the year 
2000 and the year 2005? How can we set the stage for full 
employment? Some countries have succeeded.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	True, those are not continental countries. True, those countries 
are not as vast as Canada. True, those countries do not have two 
levels of government obstructing each other. But the question 
remains. The real issue we face in each of our ridings, whether in 
the scenic Lower St. Lawrence region, where you may be thinking 
of spending your next vacation, the riding of the Minister of 
Immigration, or the riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, is that 
people are looking for jobs. And what is this government proposing 
to them? You may nod in agreement, but the fact remains that there 
is nothing in the bill before us that would help create jobs.
<P>

<P>
	Again, what the opposition finds unacceptable is that there 
should first have been a debate on the way to overhaul social 
programs and to set the stage for job creation, but not with a sword 
over our heads, not with the burden the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development had to carry: cutting some $2 
billion beforehand. This is not the end of the fiscal year.
<P>
	It is as though a CEO trying to determine what human resources 
he will need in the coming years was told he had to juggle with a 
$250 million burden in taxes of all kinds.
<P>
	The exercise was flawed from the beginning and the official 
opposition cannot accept that even the title of the bill is confusing 
to the point of suggesting to people that this legislation includes 
measures to stimulate employment.
<P>
	Let us talk about the philosophy of the bill. Madam Speaker, I 
know you like philosophy. Let us take a look at the philosophy 
underlying the bill. Do you think that consideration was given to 
the fact that there are honest people out there who are actively 
looking for work? How do you explain that the government 
targeted in a blatant and totally inconsiderate manner the so-called 
frequently unemployed, as if life was like a career plan, and as if 
people, over the last five years, had deliberately chosen to put 
down on their resume: ``I collected unemployment benefits on two, 
three or four occasions''.
<P>
	What is the logic behind the idea of penalizing people because 
they used a program which they funded without government 
assistance? Indeed, all those who are listening must know that, in 
1992, the government completely withdrew its financial support to 
the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	This is quite the paradox. The government wants to limit 
eligibility. It tells people: ``If you are frequently unemployed, if, in 
the last five reference years, you had the audacity of collecting 
unemployment insurance benefits for more than 20 weeks, it is just 
too bad. For each multiple of twenty, the benefits to which you 
would otherwise be entitled will be reduced by one per cent''.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are telling me my time is up, but let me say 
I am still quite upset by all this and I hope to speak again on this 
issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to say a few words this afternoon on Bill C-12, the 
legislation to create an employment insurance system in Canada.
<P>
	I have been associated with the efforts to modernize and reform 
Canada's unemployment insurance system for some 12 years. I was 
a civil servant between 1984 and 1988 in the department which 
preceded the human resources development department in the area 
that was  working on unemployment insurance reform. For the last 
eight years as a member of Parliament I have represented a 
constituency in which unemployment insurance is a very important 
part of the local economy. I have been associated with many of the 
efforts to reform the UI program and changes that have been made 
to that program over the last eight years.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Most recently, as the chair of the human resources development 
committee I travelled across the country examining the views of 
Canadians on the reform of Canada's social security system. I had a 
chance to talk to many Canadians about the need for UI reform and 
the direction the UI reform process should take.
<P>
	Bill C-12 has gone through a great deal of study by the 
Government of Canada, by both the current and previous ministers 
responsible, as well as members of the House, notably the members 
of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. It 
represents a major step forward in the difficult task of reforming 
Canada's system for insuring Canadians against unemployment, 
for providing Canadians with support and creating conditions for 
stable employment and job security in a rapidly changing world.
<P>
	While the changes which are represented in the employment 
insurance bill do not completely provide the kind of employment 
insurance we will need to confront our problems in the 21st 
century, they do go a very long way toward improving and 
modernizing the present unemployment insurance system. Let me 
make a few brief important points about what the legislation does.
<P>
	Basing the new system on hours and not on weeks will create a 
much more flexible employment insurance system which, in 
today's job market, will entitle people to employment insurance 
much more readily than in the past. It will be fairer to seasonal 
workers. Many of them have concentrated weeks of work in a short 
time of the year. If they do not acquire the 12, 13 or 14 weeks under 
the existing system whether or not they work long hours during 
those weeks, often they do not qualify for unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	Changing the formula to hours allows seasonal workers easier 
entitlement and in a shorter period of time. It will also allow 
workers who can only get part time work to use those hours to build 
toward their entitlement. Previously in many cases if workers did 
not work 15 hours a week, they simply did not qualify for 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	It is an improved system because it will provide a much broader 
coverage for the labour force. It covers every hour worked, not just 
for those individuals who work a minimum of 15 hours a week. 
Providing broader coverage not only allows more people access to 
the employment insurance income benefits which are part of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2272"> 2272 </A></B>
<P>
program but it also allows more people to have access  to the tools 
for re-employment which are also part of the legislation.
<P>
	Those tools for re-employment are now only available to people 
who are getting unemployment insurance benefits. That has created 
a great deal of confusion and distortion in areas where people 
would like to take advantage of training programs but do not 
qualify for unemployment insurance. They are unable to access 
that benefit. Under this new system those benefits will be more 
broadly available. More support will be provided for individuals to 
take advantage of those tools to get back to work.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	This new system introduces the notion of allowing people to 
accumulate and build their entitlement. That is a very powerful 
incentive to creating more stable and long term jobs especially in 
those parts of Canada where it is more difficult to create jobs.
<P>
	The notion of allowing people to accumulate entitlement is in 
various parts of the bill. It starts with the basis of hours worked 
rather than weeks worked as a unit of account. The intensity rule is 
a very astute amendment by the member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore. It allows for people who are repeat users of 
benefits and who would have their benefit levels reduced through 
the intensity rule, that by working more hours during that period of 
unemployment they can build back up their entitlement thereby 
delaying the effects of the intensity rule.
<P>
	A number of features in this program are directly suited to 
people with low incomes. It will give them an opportunity to have 
more than the 55 or 57 per cent of their earnings replaced through 
this new system. Through the family income supplements which 
are part of the new employment insurance system, people with low 
incomes will be able to have a larger portion of their incomes 
replaced. That is one of the progressive features of the system.
<P>
	The new system recognizes the regional differences and the fact 
that in many parts of the country jobs are much harder to find. The 
system is regionally differentiated in order to take that into 
account. The important thing we all have to know in this House is 
that the fundamental purpose of this legislation has to be to create 
the conditions for jobs and job creation especially in those parts of 
Canada where jobs are difficult to create.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance system cannot be a barrier or 
obstacle to creating jobs. If it does that, and the old system has 
done that, then we are fighting against ourselves. We are working at 
cross purposes and we are not providing the environment 
Canadians want and need in order to have the jobs that will provide 
secure incomes for the 21st century. That is why this system is an  
important improvement to the existing unemployment insurance 
system in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-12, which is of great importance to 
everyone, and to support the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our 
three colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois, the members for 
Mercier, Lévis, and Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, for their 
extraordinary handling of this issue.
<P>
	Throughout Canada, throughout Quebec, when I meet with 
ordinary people, with unions, they congratulate the Bloc Quebecois 
for the extraordinary work we have done on this very important 
subject. When I meet with unions in which I worked for 19 years, 
they are proud of the work done by our party.
<P>
	It goes without saying that I am strongly opposed to this 
regressive, discriminatory, anti-employment, anti-worker, 
anti-union bill. I do not have words to describe it. It astounds me 
that the government remains completely insensitive to popular 
demonstrations and to the potential for indignation mentioned 
earlier by my colleague for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	I think that we have not yet seen the full potential for indignation 
and revolt of the people of Canada and of Quebec with respect to 
this bill, which will mean unprecedented reductions in UI coverage 
in Canada.
<P>
	Yesterday, this bill was described as organized theft, because it 
would tighten eligibility requirements, reduce benefit periods, 
lower benefits, and, at one point as well, we saw increased 
penalties for infractions. We know, for example, that the initial 
penalty for voluntary termination of employment was not what it is 
today. Today, anyone who leaves their job voluntarily pays a heavy 
price under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	The United Nations has declared this international year for the 
elimination of poverty, but I know of no initiative by this 
government to fight poverty in Canada and in Quebec. On the 
contrary. Poverty is growing rapidly in most sectors of society, 
because I think the government's tendency is to listen only to 
business. This bill is a poverty creating bill.
<P>
	In my riding of Bourassa, approximately one third of the 
population is unemployed. This is a much higher rate than in the 
rest of Canada, much higher than in Quebec and Montreal Island 
generally. Sometimes, I wonder if it would not be better if the 
unemployment insurance fund were to be managed by some other 
organization.
<P>
	I lived three years in Belgium. The unemployment insurance 
system in that country is managed by the unions. It did not cost the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2273"> 2273 </A></B>
<P>
state anything. Benefits are much higher. The benefit period is 
much longer than in  Canada. I think that, in Canada, businesses 
and unions could manage at least part of the system, since 
employers and employees are the ones who pay into the fund.
<P>
	Since 1990, the government has not paid a penny into the 
unemployment insurance fund. However, it uses the surplus, now 
reaching $5 billion, to help reduce the deficit. In my view, the trend 
nowadays in the unemployment insurance area is to cut, to get in 
line with the United States, where the system is much less generous 
than in Canada or other countries that have signed NAFTA.
<P>
	I think it is important not to pass this bill. Yesterday was May 1, 
International Workers Day, but let me tell you that no one in 
Canada and even in the world was in the mood to celebrate.
<P>
	In Sainte-Thérèse, Kenworth just closed down: 900 jobs lost. 
What did the federal government do? Nothing. On the other hand, 
the Quebec government is prepared to provide financial assistance 
to this company to upgrade the Sainte-Thérèse plant and to develop 
the training program for the employees.
<P>
	The CAW, the union, is prepared to sign a collective agreement 
and agree to labour peace at least for five years.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I take this opportunity to salute the labour federations in Quebec, 
the CLC and all unions for the extraordinary job they have also 
done on unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Yesterday, naturally, people rose up against this bill. They are 
furious with the government, which is endlessly cutting 
everywhere, in social programs and especially in the area of 
unemployment insurance. Bill C-12 hits part time workers 
particularly hard. Most part time workers are women; sixty-nine 
percent of people working less than 35 hours a week are women.
<P>
	This bill discriminates against women. I am pleased women in 
Canada are reacting against this, as they did last year in Quebec. 
They are organizing a march from Vancouver and the Atlantic 
provinces. It will begin May 14 in Vancouver and May 19 in Saint 
John, New Brunswick. They will reach Parliament Hill June 15, 
and I think all Bloc members will be there to support the legitimate 
demands of women: an increase in the minimum wage, the 
continuation of social programs and funding for day care.
<P>
	Bill C-12 also discriminates against immigrants. You know, 
sometimes when immigrants come here with a temporary work 
permit they are not entitled to unemployment insurance, because 
they are not residents of Canada. However those who have just 
immigrated here must work 910 hours before being entitled to 
unemployment insurance and not 300 hours as before, despite their 
willingness to work.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I strongly oppose this bill and I ask the 
government to declare war on unemployment and not on the 
unemployed, as is the case at the moment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to talk about the reforms to the 
unemployment insurance program and the development of the new 
employment insurance scheme.
<P>
	Now would be a good time to reiterate that this reform is based 
on a number of broad, general principles to which the government 
is appropriately adhering. No doubt the best social security 
program a Canadian can have is a job. We have to keep that in mind 
in everything we do. At the end of the day the best way to ensure 
the security of individual Canadians is to ensure they have jobs.
<P>
	We have to realize, as we certainly do in my part of rural Canada, 
we need to create an environment within which the small business 
sector can create wealth and employment.
<P>
	This program goes a little further than that. There are proactive 
measures within the employment insurance program to help with 
the creation of jobs. We see proactive measures such as wage 
subsidies, the self-employment assistance program, which I have 
seen work well in my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka, the 
earning supplement and job creation partnerships.
<P>
	Job creation partnerships are of particular importance in a rural 
riding like mine where we have an opportunity to marry the need to 
provide experience for individuals who are temporarily out of the 
workforce with programs that will pursue economic development 
within our communities.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This combination of providing experience for people while they 
work on projects to help develop the economy of my rural part of 
the country, although applicable across the country, is an excellent 
approach to achieving the principle of maintaining support for 
individuals who find themselves unemployed. At the same time, it 
creates the infrastructure and the environment where long term 
jobs can be created and people will be able to find sustainable 
employment.
<P>
	One of the things we have come to realize in dealing with 
reforms to the unemployment insurance program is that the 
situation is very different today than it was 30 years ago. At that 
time much of the employment created was of a temporary, cyclical 
nature where because of a downturn in demand for a short period of 
time an individual might find himself unemployed for two, three or 
four months.
<P>
	Today that has changed significantly. Much of our employment 
is not the result of a temporary decline but because an industry or a 
job may no longer exist.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2274"> 2274 </A></B>
<P>
	The need for a properly operating employment insurance 
program goes far beyond creating income support. It needs to 
address the whole issue of creating long term employment. 
Obviously this assists by working on infrastructure and by helping 
communities develop long term economic development goals.
<P>
	The program deals directly with the small business community. 
In my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka it accounts for almost all 
the jobs. It accounts across Canada for most of the new job 
creation.
<P>
	It is important that we realize components in this reform 
program will assist the small business men and women who work 
every day in the riding to create wealth and employment for my 
constituents. The whole idea of creating a surplus in the UI fund is 
so we can have a stable UI rate and do not end up with a recession.
<P>
	There is at least one economist in the House now who knows full 
well the very wrong thing to do during a recession is increase 
premiums to pay for the increased demand on UI.
<P>
	What makes far more sense is to ensure we have a surplus so that 
when there is an extra demand during an economic downturn we 
will not have to exacerbate that demand by increasing UI 
premiums. This happened during the last recession.
<P>
	We have also helped small business men and women with a 
number of other measures connected to this plan. We have a far 
more simplified system. Small business people become very 
frustrated, and rightly so, when they spend more time on 
paperwork and on adhering to regulations than they do doing their 
jobs and what they do best, creating wealth and employment.
<P>
	This program, particularly the conversion to an hourly rate from 
a weekly rate, significantly reduces the administration cost to the 
small business community. This is a very positive step.
<P>
	We saw a decrease in the premium rate business will have to pay. 
This is a positive step. Those types of taxes are job killers. It is 
positive that we are able to modify that rate, as is the whole idea 
that the maximum insurable earnings rate will give a break in terms 
of taxation to the small business community.
<P>
	It is clear what we are trying to do with this reform. We are 
recognizing absolutely that the world of the 1990s is very different 
from that of the 1960s. It is not only an issue of income support, 
although that is very important and this program deals with that. 
This is an issue of making sure long term job creation occurs.
<P>
	We are doing that by providing individual workers with a 
number of tools in this program. The committee had an opportunity 
to review those and we enunciated many times in the House that 
they are very positive initiatives. They will help individuals 
acquire the skills and experience they need to move into areas of  
employment that are long term and sustainable. On the other hand, 
an economic environment has been created that will allow the 
small business community to create wealth and those jobs which 
unemployed individuals need.
<P>
	This is an excellent reform. The members of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development have worked hard 
on this bill over the last few months. I congratulate them and I look 
forward to seeing it passed in the House.

doubt for one minute that some of them would suppress free speech 
in this place if they could.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2275"> 2275 </A></B>
<P>
	Most of my Liberal colleagues across the way will decry this 
motion by saying that it is disrespectful of goals behind notions 
such as employment equity. It is often the people that support 
affirmative action who are the real promoters of discriminatory 
practices within Canadian society. They regularly avoid 
accountability or the need to intelligently debate the issues of 
discrimination and fairness, resorting instead to screams of racist, 
bigot and extremist. So entrenched is their ideology that they are 
incapable of assessing the damage to society some of their policies 
have done.
<P>
	Section 15(2) of the Constitution is a good example. Let us look 
first briefly at section 15(1). Section 15(1) states: ``Every 
individual is equal before the law and has the right to the equal 
protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, 
in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or 
ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical 
disability''.
<P>
	So far that is pretty good. Section 15(1) enunciates a legal 
principle that is fundamentally sound. All of us are equal and 
should be afforded equal protection from discrimination under 
Canadian law. Even vertically challenged MPs with a New Zealand 
accent like myself are protected from discrimination by section 
15(1). The authors of section 15 should have left it at that.
<P>
	The purveyors of politically correctness and social engineering 
could not just leave it at that. In their zeal to make some Canadians 
more equal than others, in their misguided attempts to correct the 
wrongs of days long since past, they came out with section 15(2) 
which reads: ``Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program 
or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of 
disadvantaged individuals or groups, including those who are 
disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, 
religion, sex, age or mental or physical ability''.
<P>
	Basically if we strip away the niceties, section 15(1) says we are 
all equal and section 15(2) says that programs like affirmative 
action and equal opportunity make some Canadians more equal 
than others because of their race, their gender and so on. This is 
<I>Animal Farm</I> all over again.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	It surely must be clear even to the most fanatical defender of 
affirmative action that giving a specific group of people special 
rights automatically reduces the rights of some other group. These 
programs which are supposed to encourage equality actually end up 
discriminating against individuals who are not part of the favoured 
group.
<P>
	In essence, the program sends a message that it is a waste of time 
applying for a reserved position. To the persons who are given the 
special consideration, the condescending message is: ``Since you 
cannot hope to make it on merit alone, we will lower the 
requirements  for you''. The whole notion is insulting and 
demeaning. It is completely demeaning to those who it purports to 
help and those it excludes.
<P>
	In all of my discussions with people who could be identified as 
visible minorities, I have never yet met one who wanted to get a job 
based solely on the fact that they belonged to a special group or a 
targeted group for affirmative action. They want to get a job based 
on merit just like the rest of us do.
<P>
	In other words, even most of the people who are supposed to 
benefit from the special treatment do not want it. That is why a 
recent survey of the public sector, the public service in Canada, 
found such unwillingness for people to self-identify their ethnic 
origins.
<P>
	The basic premise of affirmative action programs is highly 
insulting and is sometimes even racist. I thought the days of Mrs. 
Parks in Selma, Alabama were long gone, but no. There are 
actually government sanctioned programs and legislation in place 
in Canada which makes it legal to refuse people employment 
because of their colour or gender. I will talk about that a little more 
later. This is a sad state of affairs because it borders on contempt 
for those Canadians who truly support the principles of equality 
and merit.
<P>
	Let me use an analogy which explains the problem by reference 
to the Olympic Games. If Olympic events had affirmative action 
and equal opportunity programs in place, the scenario would be 
something like this. The International Olympic Committee would 
implement a program which would allow anyone to compete in the 
100 meters who could run it in, let us say, five minutes. Now there 
is not much challenge in that so it would be a pretty open field.
<P>
	However, when the race is finally run, the person who won the 
race with the fastest time would not necessarily get the gold medal. 
Instead, the gold medal would be awarded to the fastest person who 
belongs to a traditionally disadvantaged group regardless of 
whether they won the race or not. Merit would not be a factor. 
Frankly, it would not take more than one set of Olympic Games for 
top athletes to work out that they were wasting their time with a lot 
of training and would simply give up entering the race. It would be 
equally demeaning for those who were winning the medals because 
they would feel they were not receiving it on merit.
<P>
	This type of situation is exactly what happened to a Canadian 
named Timothy Juliette. He recently graduated from a civil 
aviation mechanical engineering course with a near perfect 3.98 
grade point average. Subsequent to that he was denied entry into a 
Department of Transport training course which would have 
allowed him to pursue a career in his field. He was denied access to 
the course because he was not a member of a disadvantaged group. 
More to the point, he was denied the opportunity because of his 
gender and skin colour, in this case white and male.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2276"> 2276 </A></B>
<P>
	Sadly, it is all quite legal and constitutional under the present 
system. Section 15(2) actually allows for programs which 
discriminate against persons who are not women, aboriginals, 
persons of colour and persons with physical limitations. It is the 
height of hypocrisy for the government to claim that it is working 
against discrimination while at the same time discriminating 
against people who do not fit into its quotas or hiring goals.
<P>
	The worst thing is that some of the most vocal of the promoters 
of affirmative action are so blinded with ideology that they will not 
or cannot see how intolerant, bigoted and extremist their demands 
really are. Some of the most vocal act as if they have been chosen 
by God to be the sole possessors of tolerance, compassion, 
understanding and intellect, when in fact they exhibit all of the 
symptoms of intolerance, a lack of compassion and understanding 
and an inability to see the truth.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	A homosexual support group demonstrated against the Prime 
Minister outside the House yesterday because he permitted a free 
vote on Bill C-33. The very group the Prime Minister is trying to 
help demonstrated its intolerance by indicating that it wanted the 
Prime Minister to force MPs to vote a specific way.
<P>
	Members of this group need to take a look in the mirror at the 
reflection of their own intolerance and bigotry. Instead of trying to 
rationally discuss the issue with those who are voting against Bill 
C-33, they showed fanatical intolerance. No wonder they drive 
people away from their cause.
<P>
	That group thinks it should be immune from accountability and 
that its version of tolerance and understanding would be to force 
those MPs to vote the way it says. It is lip service tolerance, and as 
I said, those people need to look at the reflection in the mirror of 
their own intolerance from time to time.
<P>
	I listened yesterday to the member for Vancouver Centre. She 
told us of the dreadful discriminatory experiences she endured as 
she struggled to become a doctor. I can understand how she would 
become very bitter and angry from those experiences. However, we 
cannot correct the problems of the past by focusing that anger and 
bitterness into revenge on others who had nothing to do with the 
injustices. To do so is to sink to the same despicable level as those 
who have discriminated against her.
<P>
	On Tuesday evening in West Block there was a reception for a 
group of Rotary Club students who had won a trip to this region 
through a competition. While I was at the reception I was 
approached by some young white males, students who were 
studying hard in the hope of getting good jobs.
<P>
	They wanted to express their concerns to me about the 
discrimination they felt working against them every time  they 
applied for jobs. Does the member for Vancouver Centre really 
want to hurt these young people? Does she really want to single 
them out for discrimination and denial of jobs because of the sins 
of the past? Could she look into their eyes and tell them that no 
matter how great their merit, their places must be filled by people 
from designated groups? Could she tell them they must be denied 
employment because they were born male and white?
<P>
	Does she really think she can build tolerance and understanding 
this way? Logically the only long term outcome from that can be a 
backlash which would destroy all the gains made by teaching 
tolerance and understanding.
<P>
	Education is the tool we must use, not discriminatory legislation. 
It was the state that legislated black people to the back of the bus in 
Alabama. It was the state that legislated discrimination in Germany 
and identified people by race, as this government is doing in the 
census this year. Everywhere discrimination has flourished, it has 
flourished because the state legislated that discrimination. Now it 
has happened and it is getting worse in Canada.
<P>
	The member for Yorkton-Melville, who sits beside me in this 
House, worked for several years on an Indian reservation. Like the 
member for Vancouver Centre, he knows exactly what it is like to 
experience racial discrimination. Right here in Canada, under the 
noses of the members opposite, a white male living and working on 
an Indian reservation lived in fear for his life. I hope that at an 
appropriate time this member will repeat his story for the benefit of 
the people in this House.
<P>
	Section 15(2) did not protect him from discrimination because 
legislation cannot change attitudes or enforce tolerance. It cannot 
enforce understanding. Only education changes attitudes and 
builds tolerance and understanding. In this regard I will refer to an 
incident which took place in the House earlier in the week.
<P>
	On Tuesday morning the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore, 
who is black, was visibly very angry after reading a newspaper 
report which claimed that the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan 
had made some discriminatory remarks under questioning by a 
reporter.
<P>
	The member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore crossed the House and 
came among the Reform benches. She was yelling very loudly and 
was clearly very upset. It was impossible to determine exactly what 
she was saying. A fair bit of shouting went on back and forth 
between Reform members and the member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore. I was quite disturbed and distressed by the 
entire experience.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	How much better it would have been if the member, before 
passing judgment on the basis of hearsay and a  newspaper story, 
had demonstrated the tolerance and understanding she asks others 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2277"> 2277 </A></B>
<P>
to display by approaching the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan 
and saying ``is this really how you feel? Is the newspaper story 
correct? Is there some what we can correct this problem?''
<P>
	If the member truly believes in promoting tolerance and 
understanding in these matters she must treat others as she expects 
them to treat her. This is a two-way street, and her goals will not be 
attained by screaming at those who can help her achieve these 
goals.
<P>
	I am quite sad that I have to convey this message through a 
speech. I do so only because she appears hostile to any other 
discussions.
<P>
	Unfortunately section 15(2) of the Constitution is helping to 
create an aura of anger and intolerance in the workplaces of Canada 
and I sincerely believe we would be better off without it.
<P>
	As I said, I found the incident in the House this week very 
distressing. I found this entire week very distressing. I very much 
want to be part of a good and logical debate about important issues 
facing the country. I do not like being immersed in the aura of 
anger and intolerance which filled this place over the last few days.
<P>
	I take the issues of racism and discrimination very seriously. 
Last year I attended a two day anti-racism conference in my riding 
so that I could listen to the concerns of those who had been affected 
and investigate whether there was any racism in my riding. I also 
advertised in one of my regular weekly reports for the <I>North Shore 
News</I> for any examples of racism that existed in my riding so that I 
could intervene and try to resolve the problem.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that not a single example of racism has been 
reported to me in the almost three years I have been an MP. My 
constituents, like the majority of Canadians, are a tolerant lot quite 
capable of avoiding discrimination without the government's 
interfering in the process.
<P>
	On the other hand, can we count as racism the fact that some 
school students in Richmond, B.C. have complained recently to the 
media that they cannot get jobs in their community because they 
are not ethnic Chinese and do not speak Mandarin or Cantonese? 
Perhaps the member for Richmond should begin addressing the 
problems in his riding. Can we count as discrimination the 
examples reported by white males who feel they did not qualify for 
job opportunities because they were not members of an identifiable 
group?
<P>
	It seems these problems, which some might call reverse racism 
and reverse discrimination, are a direct result of section 15(2) and 
its associated affirmative action programs which, instead of 
eliminating discrimination, have simply transferred the 
discrimination from one group to another.
<P>
	Two wrongs do not make a right. Let us get rid of these 
discriminatory actions of government and let us get rid of section 
15(2). Let us concentrate on education as the weapon against 
discrimination.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have a speech but I do not think I will be using it to any great 
extent. I would prefer to answer the comments put forward in such 
a callous and outrageous fashion by the member across.
<P>
	He is blaming the government that the motion is non-votable. 
That decision is not made by the government. It is made by an 
all-party committee which agrees through consensus which 
motions are votable. If members of his own party do not agree it is 
worth our time, I do not suppose we should either.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I was in the House the other day and I witnessed the hurt and the 
pain expressed by the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore at the 
remarks made by the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, remarks 
that were all over the newspapers.
<P>
	Her feelings matter. Her feelings are important. She has worked 
hard all her life in the face of discrimination, in the face of 
adversity, to build her community, to bring tolerance to society and 
to show all Canadians we all have a place in this country regardless 
of our race, regardless of our religion, regardless of the colour of 
our skin.
<P>
	To have this lifetime of work shamelessly put down, shamelessly 
put to the side by the callous remarks of the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan is not acceptable. Her conduct in the 
circumstances was quite reasonable in comparison to members of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	The deputy leader and the leader would not condemn the actions 
of the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan but glibly sat by, saying it 
is all right, it does not really matter, it is not important. They say he 
really did not feel that way. He did feel that way. On December 14, 
1994 he made the same comments in a Nanaimo paper. That is 
twice. He does feel that way. It does hurt the hon. member.
<P>
	After that, after the apologizes were made-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, on a 
point of order. The member is making statements that he knows 
how the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan feels.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That is not a 
point of order, hon. member, and you well know it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> After the apologies were made yet another Reform 
member, the member for Athabasca, on a radio program in his 
riding said he thought minorities should be discriminated against. 
A number of other Reformers were quoted as agreeing with the 
position of the hon. member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2278"> 2278 </A></B>
<P>
	We have heard concerns expressed not by this side of the House 
but by members of that party about the extremism that exists 
within that party. It is not us. Their very own people are worried 
about it. These people were caned into submission in a caucus 
meeting. How is that for free speech? How is that for allowing 
everybody to express how they feel?
<P>
	It is little wonder the hon. member suggests there is not a single 
example of racism that has been brought forward to him so that he 
could fix. Everybody who would be subject to racist activities 
knows he would not be the one to fix it.
<P>
	We talk about a bill before the House that has brought an 
amendment to the charter of rights and freedoms to outlaw 
affirmative action, something that would make it so that we could 
not have affirmative action and programs to fix an alleviate the 
conditions of people who are less advantaged.
<P>
	We just get finished celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end 
of a terrible period in our history. How did that period start? It 
started with talk. It started with the systematic marginalization of 
minorities, the people the majority thought did not matter. It went 
through action. We all know where it ended. Let us remember 
history. Fifty years is not a long time. Fifty years is not long enough 
in the evolution of humanity to think these kinds of things could 
never happen again.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	That is why we must all be vigilant and persistent and continue 
our efforts to ensure equality within this great nation, to see that all 
citizens, regardless of race, regardless of colour, regardless of 
religion, are free to enjoy this country. We can all work together to 
build a better society in which people will be free from the types of 
comments and actions we have been witness to this week.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Where is Jag Bhaduria?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It was not because there was anything wrong 
with him. It was what he did.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is time we 
recognized the House needs to run more smoothly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. With respect to the 
motion before the House, the bill is not in order. I suggest we not 
support this piece of legislation. I think it is within all our hearts 
and desires to ensure that all people in this society have 
opportunity.
<P>
	This is not about special opportunity, this is about equal 
opportunity for all Canadians. We must ensure we use the types of 
measures which will fix the historical problems of the past. We 
must ensure that some time down the road in our future we can all 
have opportunities to succeed in the jobs of our choice. We must be 
willing as a society to take measures to protect all individuals, 
whether because of race, ethnic origin,  colour, religion, sex, age, 
mental or physical ability. We must allow all of these people 
opportunities in society.
<P>
	Words are very important. Words can hurt or words can heal. It is 
time all members of this honourable House realized the import and 
the power of words. Let all we say and all we do bring dignity, 
respect and honour to all Canadians and to our shared values of 
tolerance, working together and justice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member for North Vancouver has tabled motion M-141 before 
this House, which shares the same political philosophy as Motion 
M-154 by the Reform member for Wetaskawin, which we shall be 
debating within a few minutes. Motion M-141 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support the 
elimination of section 15(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, as it derogates from 
the principle of equality enunciated by section 15(1) of the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and, that the government should work towards enhancement of 
equality in the workplace by ending the discriminatory hiring programs that 
have resulted from the affirmative action provisions of section 15(2).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Sections 15(1) and 15(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, to which 
the hon. member refers, address the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and more specifically the rights to equality within 
Canadian society. These two sections, which have been in effect 
since April 1985 and which the hon. member wishes to have 
eliminated, read as follows, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to 
the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in 
particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subsection (2) deals with positive action programs the member 
for Vancouver-North would like to see abolished, and reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as 
its object the amelioration of conditions fo disadvantaged individuals or groups 
including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic 
origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Whether the member for North Vancouver likes it or not, this in 
fact does not preclude legislation, programs or activities aimed at 
improving the conditions of disadvantaged groups based on the 
personal characteristics of the individuals making up these groups.
<P>
	The member wants to maintain subsection 15(1), which 
reaffirms that everyone is equal before the law and entitled to equal 
benefits and equal protection under the law, but he also wants to 
eliminate subsection 15(2), which in his view contradicts 
subsection 15(1); in other words, he wants the government to put 
an end to  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2279"> 2279 </A></B>
<P>
programs facilitating job equity through hiring programs the 
member calls discriminatory.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada handed down 23 decisions 
regarding section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, some are better known, such as the Thibaudeau case 
dealing with making support payments part of income. Others, 
such as the Andrews case, are precedent setting. This case dating 
back to 1989 led to the drafting of an interpretation code for cases 
dealing with equality rights. In that case, the appellant was 
successful in contesting the need to be a Canadian citizen to be 
called to the Bar Association of British Columbia.
<P>
	Mary C. Hurley, a researcher for the Law and Government 
Division of the Library of Parliament, conducted an in-depth study 
on equality rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms: section 15 as interpreted by the Supreme Court of 
Canada in its decisions.
<P>
	According to Ms. Hurley, the framework established in the 
Andrews case has so far been used as an authoritative guide in this 
matter and the Supreme Court's flexible analysis of the first 
section-of which the hon. member for North Vancouver wants a 
rigid, legalistic interpretation-provides for greater judicial 
restraint in making legislative choices in so-called socio-economic 
cases in which the government must weigh competing groups' 
legitimate demands for limited resources. But all these arguments 
are too subtle for the hon. member for North Vancouver.
<P>
	In her outstanding analysis, Ms. Hurley goes on to say: 
``Equality is a comparative notion perceived in relation to other 
people's social or political situation. Consequently, a law is not 
necessarily flawed because it makes distinctions. Legislative 
classifications must be made so that a modern society can be 
administered. For the purposes of section 15, discrimination is 
defined as an intentional or unintentional distinction based on 
motives linked to personal characteristics of the individuals or 
groups affected, which imposes disadvantages or burdens others do 
not have to suffer or bear, or deprives them of benefits or 
advantages available to others.''
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	All this information and all the arguments I have cited in 
describing the legal analysis framework on which section 15 of the 
1982 Constitution Act is based do not meet with the approval of the 
hon. member for North Vancouver, who is reacting like a real 
political dinosaur and whose notion of equality refers to the basic 
reflex of fighting for life, in which the law of the jungle should 
replace the entire social infrastructure modern Canadian society 
has given itself in the 20th century.
<P>
	On the contrary, affirmative action programs for historically 
disadvantaged groups promote equality in the workplace, to which 
the hon. member is referring. This  equality in the workplace is 
parallelled by subsidies, especially to new businesses, aimed at 
helping them get over some crucial growth stages. At the collective 
level, social programs are designed to give everyone equal 
opportunities. As for transfer and equalization payments, their 
purpose is to help the have not provinces. All these policies seek, to 
various degrees, to correct inequalities that are part of nature and 
that influence the evolution of life in a society.
<P>
	The hon. member would want to eliminate graduated taxes and 
go back to the natural or wild state. Social darwinism no longer has 
a place in modern society. Abolishing all assistance and equal 
opportunities programs would lead to anarchy by marginalizing 
several groups in society.
<P>
	I understand the member's reaction. He is from western Canada, 
a young land, a new frontier. These descendants of pioneers have 
learned to rely on themselves alone. However, as a country matures 
and evolves, it develops its structure while also defining its social 
mission. Historically, most of the oldest European countries have 
had the strongest leftist tendencies, even though the state of their 
public finances sometimes forced them to go back to a more 
centrist position. We must evolve. Equal opportunities often reflect 
a country's degree of evolution and civilization. Achieving a 
balance between the economic and social components is a complex 
task. We must work at it in a gradual way, not through sweeping 
changes as advocated by the hon. member for North Vancouver.
<P>
	If we try to abolish all assistance programs for people, many 
poor individuals or groups will lose hope or rebel. In this context, if 
the Reform Party rejects any form of gun control, is it because its 
members feel threatened by all those whom they deprived of any 
hope to improve their lot?
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask the hon. member to give this some thought, 
to mature a little bit, and to show us the level of civilization to 
which he can rise. What live in an advanced country of 30 million 
people, at the dawn of the 21st century, not in Dawson City in 1898.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise tonight to speak in 
reply to private member's motion No. 141.
<P>
	In his motion the member for Vancouver North asks that the 
government support the elimination of section 15(2) of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is the section of the 
charter which allows for actions to balance the inequality in 
Canadian society, including the promotion of equality of 
opportunity in the labour marketplace.
<P>
	The member states that section 15(2) of the charter derogates 
from the principle of equality that is  enunciated in section 15(1) of 
the charter. The dictionary states that the word ``derogate'' means 
to stray from. Therefore, the member seems to be concerned that 
section 15(2) of the charter strays from the intent of section 15(1). 
Just for the record, 15(1) is the section of the charter which ensures 
all Canadians equality before and under the law and equal protec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2280"> 2280 </A></B>
<P>
tion and benefit of the law without discrimination. It is one of the 
fundamental principles on which the charter is based.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	To address the member's motion, as far as this government is 
concerned there is absolutely no contradiction in wanting to ensure 
equality for all Canadians, as section 15(1) does, while at the same 
time having the capacity to act in cases where there is a need to 
correct inequality of opportunity for which section 15(2) provides.
<P>
	It is exactly by being able to implement measures in support of 
disadvantaged groups that we do guarantee equality in Canadian 
society. This is the kind of equality that section 15(1) of the charter 
of rights and freedoms calls for and the kind of equality that makes 
Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live.
<P>
	Over the years this government and other governments before it 
have been willing to act when it was necessary to improve 
conditions for certain disadvantaged groups or individuals. This is 
a very legitimate function of responsible government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are proud of our performance and of our support of the 
Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms, including the traditions 
that it reflects. We particularly support the provisions of the charter 
that advocate equal opportunities for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Because we believe that section 15(2) is a necessary part of the 
charter in support of equality, we are not in favour of seeing it 
eliminated.
<P>
	The member's motion also calls on the government to end 
discriminatory hiring programs that result from affirmative action. 
Once again, those of us on this side of the aisle would remind our 
colleagues in the third party that promoting equality of opportunity 
does not mean discrimination for or against anyone in the 
workplace. It does mean however acting in a manner to ensure that 
there are no barriers in place which might deny some individuals or 
groups from having full and equal access to the same job 
opportunities as others in the same society.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall the work we did last fall to introduce 
and to pass Bill C-64, an act respecting employment equity. 
Perhaps this is the sort of affirmative action the member from 
North Vancouver is referring to in his motion.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-64 is not to promote discriminatory hiring. 
The purpose is quite simple and quite clear. It is to remove the 
systematic barriers that prevent qualified people from working, the 
kind of barriers that have nothing to do with merit or personal 
capability but have come about because of informal practices and 
rules that have developed over the years and can impede open 
access to job opportunities.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-64 was not and is not to impose any kind 
of discriminatory hiring program or quotas, nor does it require 
employers to hire anyone who is not qualified to do a particular job. 
The bill specifically excludes hiring quotas or arbitrary numerical 
employment goals as being unreasonable.
<P>
	There are no quotas, there is no hidden agenda, there is no 
reverse discrimination in our approach to employment equity. 
Merit remains the basic principle for hiring and there is no question 
about that. Anyone who reads the bill will see it.
<P>
	It is also important to note that Bill C-64 was supported by a 
clear majority of members of this House, including the official 
opposition. Its advantages were carefully considered and 
recognized on the floor of the House, during committee hearings 
and more broadly by many Canadians.
<P>
	It was during committee hearings that we heard some of the 
strongest endorsements of the principles of employment equity and 
of the value of equality in the workplace. Many of these comments 
came from the business community, including the business 
community in the member's home province. The business 
community understands that the world in which Canada does 
business is changing, that Canada has to be enlightened and 
forward thinking, that we need to be well positioned to attract and 
to employ the best and brightest people we can.
<P>
	It is not just employers who support the principles of 
employment equity. Labour representatives have spoken in support 
of the direction we are following with employment equity in 
Canada.
<P>
	The market is not always fair and equitable. It does need some 
guidelines and direction from time to time. We feel it is the 
responsibility of government to recognize when that time is and to 
show the appropriate leadership. This government has done that.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	On balance, there appears a strong consensus across the country 
in support of what we have done. Business, labour and others 
support our approach to employment equity and the equality of 
opportunity in the workplace that it represents. There is a strong 
consensus, except from the party opposite.
<P>
	There are still those who choose to ignore the evidence, 
including positive comments from the business  community, from 
labour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2281"> 2281 </A></B>
<P>
representatives as well as from many others who have gone on 
record as supporting the principles of employment equity.
<P>
	For those of us living in the real world, the very competitive real 
world of the 1990s, we know there are significant advantages to be 
gained from diversity in the workplace and by an enlightened 
approach to employment equity.
<P>
	I invite my hon. friend opposite to consider the advantages. I 
also remind him that the government remains committed to its jobs 
and growth agenda. The underlying goal is still to get Canadians 
back to work. As the economic program continues to contribute to 
this goal there will be more jobs available.
<P>
	Employers will continue to seek out the most qualified 
candidates for these jobs. Merit will remain the central 
qualification for hiring. The member for North Vancouver and his 
constituents should be reassured that the government is not doing 
anything to change that.
<P>
	We do not need to abolish section 15(2) of the charter, as the 
member for North Vancouver has asked us to do. We need to get on 
with creating the kinds of partnerships that will increase the job 
opportunities for everyone.
<P>
	Eliminating section 15(2) of the charter of rights and freedoms 
will not contribute to achieving the goal of this member. I do not 
support the motion to this effect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I address this motion. First, I 
will make a few comments.
<P>
	What is the essence of discrimination, racism, prejudice? Is it 
not when a label is pinned on somebody, when they are simply 
considered as part of a group? I find it interesting that the members 
pay lip service to this kind of anti-discriminatory measure while 
they practise it, even at the highest level.
<P>
	I would like to give an example of our own Prime Minister. The 
Prime Minister was on a platform with four black members of his 
caucus. Instead of remarking on the contributions those members 
of Parliament made, the Prime Minister said that he was impressed 
with them because they smiled a lot.
<P>
	If that was not bad enough, he went on to say something, 
possibly unintentionally, with regard to one of the black members 
of his caucus, a very fine person, a parliamentary secretary. Rather 
than mentioning the role she played behind the scenes, the Prime 
Minister explained that she was the woman who trotted behind him 
as he went into question period.
<P>
	It is obvious that blacks have a long way to go in this country if 
even our own Prime Minister refers to their smile and their ability 
to trot behind him into the House of Commons. I think that is 
deplorable.
<P>
	For members to start throwing comments at us and pinning 
labels on us is the essence of prejudice. They  ought to look in their 
own backyard before they start doing some of these things. It is too 
bad that I have to bring up examples like this. When are people 
going to start looking at themselves and look at the whole issue?
<P>
	We have to look at ourselves on an individual basis. We will only 
overcome this problem on an individual basis. We will not do it by 
legislation, by putting people into categories. I wonder how 
Liberals feel about the comments their own Prime Minister makes.
<P>
	Now I will address the issue with which we are dealing. I feel 
very strongly about this because I have been the subject of 
prejudice and discrimination from time to time. I will not give 
examples today. However, my constituents feel very strongly about 
what I am going to say today.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	My first taste of unfairness and reverse discrimination imposed 
by federal government departments, federally regulated industries 
to Canadian workers happened to come in February 1995 when I 
learned that the RCMP training academy in Regina would train 426 
new cadets in 1995. But the top brass, the people who running the 
show, decided that 112 of them would be aboriginals, 112 would be 
visible minorities, 95 would be women. That is 74 per cent of the 
total number of new recruits.
<P>
	When my constituents heard about this they were outraged. I am 
appalled that the federal government can run such a blatantly 
discriminatory and racist affirmative action program and then have 
the nerve to call it equality.
<P>
	I ask the members of the House: how can Canadians be assured 
that these are the best police officers for the job? Time after time 
the merit principle on which all public sector hiring should be 
based takes a back seat to the applicant's race, the colour of his or 
her skin, his or her gender. When Bill C-33 is rammed through the 
House this week or next, hiring quotas will be based on each 
applicant's sexual preferences and behaviour.
<P>
	This one example proved to me and my constituents that 
political correctness is rampant, even in the RCMP. The federal 
government is gambling with the safety of the public. Think about 
it. The Liberal's hiring quotas are a higher priority than public 
safety.
<P>
	Canadians are more concerned about having the very best RCMP 
officers patrolling our highways and streets than they are about the 
colour of their skin or whether they are a man, a woman or a 
homosexual. If I am wrong, I am sure I will hear about it.
<P>
	To this end in the last sitting of Parliament I introduced motion 
M-356 which I would like to read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2282"> 2282 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact legislation 
which would repeal the federal Employment Equity Act, guarantee the right of 
all federal job applicants to be evaluated solely on the basis of merit, and 
withdraw all federal funding from all affirmative action programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When Parliament was arbitrarily prorogued for purely political 
grandstanding, my motion bit the dust and I reintroduced it again in 
March.
<P>
	Motion 141 which we are debating today and put forward by my 
hon. colleague for North Vancouver would remove the 
constitutional authority that allows the government to have an 
employment equity act in the first place. This motion proposes to 
eliminate section 15(2) of the charter of rights and freedoms 
because it permits the government to discriminate.
<P>
	Section 15(1) of the charter says: ``Every individual is equal 
before and under the law and has the right to equal protection and 
equal benefit of the law without discrimination''.
<P>
	It is followed by section 15(2) which states that subsection (1) 
does not apply if: ``the law, program or activity that has as its 
object the amelioration of the conditions of the disadvantaged 
groups or individuals''. That section 15(2) of the charter of rights 
and freedoms says that it is okay for people, companies or the 
government to violate equality provisions of the charter just so 
long as they only discriminate against Canadians who are not 
members of so-called disadvantaged groups.
<P>
	I would like to get back to the example of the RCMP for a 
moment. About the same time the hon. member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam released information which showed that 
RCMP members who are visible minorities and aboriginals are also 
given preference in transfer placements and assignments so that 
they can be near their family and their own community. I have 
heard of many RCMP officers who have been denied transfers to 
even their home province, let alone their own home town.
<P>
	How do these officers feel when their colleagues are being given 
special treatment because of their race? Police officers have a 
tough enough time without the hiring and transfer practices of the 
force creating resentments among the ranks. Dividing people into 
categories simply does not break down barriers. It puts more bricks 
on the walls that divide us. That is what it does.
<P>
	I believe in true equality. The most important criteria for hiring 
any employee is that he or she is the best person for the job. If all 
the qualifications of the two applicants are equal, then I do not 
mind giving certain people a break. But these quotas actually 
promote outright discrimination. It must undermine the 
confidence, the self-esteem, the credibility of RCMP officers to 
know they got their job because they are aboriginal, or they are 
female, or because of the colour of their skin, not because of their 
qualifications necessarily. It is just like it affects an MP who is 
appointed by the Prime Minister because she is female.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	How must applicants from a minority group feel whenever they 
meet another officer or a member of the public? Do they ask 
themselves: ``I wonder if they think I got this job because I was the 
best person for the job or if they think I got it because of the colour 
of my skin or because I am a woman?'' That is the kind of thing 
that happens in reality.
<P>
	Employment equity and affirmative action are just legalized 
racism and sexism. The Liberals think the only way to achieve 
equality is by discriminating. These government policies and laws 
can do nothing but divide us. I will do everything in my power to 
see that they are reversed.
<P>
	The government is trying to stamp out discrimination by 
discriminating. It is trying to enforce equality by violating the 
charter's equality rights. It does not even matter that the individual 
receiving the special status and special rights may not be 
personally disadvantaged, only that he or she is a member of the 
disadvantaged group.
<P>
	We can all experience discrimination. I have had that 
uncomfortable experience myself. Have you ever heard so much 
doublespeak, Madam Speaker? George Orwell's <I>Animal Farm</I> has 
come to life right here in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. This has all been cultivated by the Liberal government. 
Under its stewardship this is a growth industry. It is promoting this 
kind of thing, the very opposite of what it intends.
<P>
	Now that the government has given itself this power to 
discriminate against Canadians, the power to override the equality 
provisions of the charter, Statistics Canada has come up with a 
question on this year's census that is blatantly racist. The 
bureaucrats have found the ultimate make work project. If they can 
identify more people in each of the so-called disadvantaged groups, 
they can justify more money for more affirmative action programs 
so they can discriminate against the rest of us even more.
<P>
	I am sure the House is familiar with this. The affirmative action 
bureaucrats tell Statistics Canada they need more information 
about racists. Statistics Canada complies with the request. On May 
14 the census will ask 20 per cent of randomly selected Canadians 
to define their race and the colour of their skin. Then recipients of 
the census will be able to choose from 10 categories including 
white, black, Latin American, Chinese.
<P>
	If persons find the question racist and insulting, the government 
has the power to fine them $500 if they do not answer the question 
correctly. Statistic Canada says that the information is used to 
administer programs such as employment equity and that all the 
responses will be kept strictly confidential. What they should be 
saying is that it is a blatantly racist question that has no place in the 
national census.
<P>
	The government has the onus to prove that what it is doing is 
effective. It has never ever done that. Any law  that is passed in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2283"> 2283 </A></B>
<P>
House should be proven to be effective or it should be repealed. 
That is what we are proposing with this motion.
<P>
	In conclusion, what gives people dignity and confidence and the 
feeling that they belong? Certainly it is not by being segregated 
into groups. It comes through being recognized for who you are and 
what you have accomplished.
<P>
	Last Saturday I met with Grassroots Indian people in Saskatoon. 
The Reform MP from North Island-Powell River was the only 
other MP who was also there. The reporters covering the story 
commented that it was very interesting that the MPs who had been 
given a certain label as being racist were the only ones who showed 
up at this gathering of about 60 people. We sat there all day and 
listened to their concerns. We are representing those people in the 
House.
<P>
	It is these things that break down barriers. The barriers will be 
broken down on an individual basis by doing our part to look at the 
people, each one as an individual, and being special and not 
belonging to a group. We will be accepted by society by the 
contributions we make and our achievements, not by other means 
which most people perceive as being discriminatory.
<P>
	I hope this government will take this to heart.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support the rights 
of all job applicants to be evaluated solely on the basis of merit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: The way this motion piggybacks on to my colleague's 
previous motion it would appear we had it orchestrated that way, 
but I assure members it is simply the luck of the draw that it turned 
out that way.
<P>
	Reformers are quite up front about where we stand on issues. 
Sometimes we are accused of not being politically correct, but we 
represent the interests of the grassroots, not the political elites.
<P>
	While this motion stands in my name, it comes right from 
Reform Party policies. Our policies are the culmination of the 
grassroots process that starts in small  communities within our 
ridings, then moves to the constituency level and then to the 
national assembly.
<P>
	When election time rolls around Reform Party policies are ready. 
There will not be any surprises for Reform Party supporters or 
candidates thanks to the democratic process we follow. Liberals 
should follow our example instead of allowing a few advisors to 
publish another red book that will be tossed aside as soon as the 
votes are counted anyway.
<P>
	Reformers believe that all Canadians are equal by virtue of their 
shared humanity but are not equal in terms of ability, preference 
and discipline. Canadians who wish to pursue a certain vocation 
should not face barriers of discrimination, and those with ability 
and discipline deserve the rewards of hard work.
<P>
	Under the charter of rights and freedoms 1982, which has been 
quoted extensively tonight, every individual is equal before and 
under the law and has a right to the equal protection and equal 
benefit of the law without discrimination based on race, national or 
ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical 
disability.
<P>
	Without a doubt this is the most important part of the charter. 
The authors, however, nullified this section by adding section 15.2, 
giving the government the right to pass affirmative action 
programs. Despite this contradictory clause and despite the fact 
that employment equity is deemed to be politically correct, it 
carries a stigma and a presumption of racial or gender inferiority. 
The reality is equity programs do not remove sex and racial bias 
from the workplace. They institutionalize them.
<P>
	There was a time when the abilities of women and minorities 
were not recognized, but times have changed; this is not 1929. 
Employment barriers for women, minorities and the disabled have 
outlived their usefulness and are now in danger of creating new 
forms of discrimination. This government was so concerned about 
appearing more politically correct than its predecessors and 
capturing the hearts and votes of special interest groups that it 
introduced Bill C-64 in December 1994.
<P>
	The government hoped it would divert attention away from the 
real problems of Canada, namely the $580 billion national debt.
<P>
	Bill C-64 extended and superseded the 1986 Employment Equity 
Act. It now covers the public service, crown corporations and 
federally regulated private sector employees working in banks, 
airlines, railways and telecommunication companies. In a really 
invasive move it was extended to all businesses with over 100 
employees that receive federal contracts.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	While Bill C-64 does not apply specific quotas, the inspectors, 
auditors and those administering the legislation can make compa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2284"> 2284 </A></B>
<P>
nies comply with numerical  goals. What are numerical goals? 
Numerical goals are really quotas in disguise.
<P>
	The government ignores polls showing employment equity has 
lost support among Canadians. It ignored evidence presented to the 
Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Persons 
with Disabilities by credible witnesses.
<P>
	For example, here is what Mark Pickup, a victim of multiple 
sclerosis, had to say when he appeared before the standing 
committee: ``You cannot legislate someone to accept me because I 
happen to be disabled any more than you can legislate someone to 
love me. That achieves nothing. To try to legislate such things 
achieves condescension at best and hostility at worst. I do not need 
more of either. I need less of both''.
<P>
	Did the government listen to what he had to say? It ignored Mark 
Pickup, as it ignored thousands of other disabled and aboriginal 
people who told the committee the old act did not serve them well.
<P>
	Last June during the Ontario election campaign even the 
provincial Liberal leader promised to scale back the provincial 
affirmative action law, calling it adversarial, bureaucratic and 
expensive to administer. Ontario voters subsequently elected Mike 
Harris who promised to do away with employment equity laws. He 
kept his promise; but then, he did not have a red book of broken 
promises like my friends across the way.
<P>
	In October 1995 the European Court of Justice ruled that quota 
schemes for jobs and promotions violate European equal 
opportunity laws. In the United States three decades of affirmative 
action programs are being scrapped.
<P>
	The government employment equity law is an insult to women, 
to minorities and to the disabled. In the government's attempt to 
atone for the past, it is trampling on the present and compromising 
the future.
<P>
	A Reform government would treat people equally and would not 
punish today's generation for the wrongs of previous generations. 
Managing diversity goes beyond the narrow confines of 
employment equity. We have to create a fair work environment that 
recognizes and attempts to meet the needs of all employees.
<P>
	The role of government is not to set terms and conditions under 
which private companies hire employees. It is time to let common 
sense prevail. A diverse workforce is a plus for any businesses. The 
market will dictate the diversity of the staff. They will do it on their 
own and they certainly do not need the hassle of excessive 
government red tape.
<P>
	For some reason the Liberal government assumes that anyone in 
the four designated groups is disadvantaged. That presumption is 
patronizing, unfair and unrealistic.
<P>
	Why does the government presume it has to legislate fairness? 
Does the government have the corner on  morality? On March 21 
the president of treasury board said that in one year the 
participation of women in the public service rose to 47.4 per cent 
from 44 per cent, that almost two-thirds of the 14,000 employees 
hired were women, and that 56 per cent of the employees promoted 
were women. That is a reflection of changing attitudes and a new 
reality.
<P>
	I want to believe they were hired or promoted on the value of the 
work they performed and not on the basis of artificial quotas. The 
public service is staffed by skilled, competent women who deserve 
to be rewarded for their excellence, not for their gender. They 
deserve better from their employer than patronizing tokenism.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	With promotion becoming the next logical step in the equity 
quest, we have to ensure we do not find a new way of perpetuating 
the Peter principle. Long ago the philosophy behind employment 
equity was to raise awareness. That has happened. Now we have to 
let the competitive forces of the workplace take over.
<P>
	I am a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development. For the last two years we have been examining 
employment insurance. We hear about the need for programs to 
help people who have given up looking for work and that the job 
market is bleak. It is bleak enough without adding the unfair burden 
of numerical quotas.
<P>
	The government created a new category of disadvantaged, young 
white males. My colleague has referred to the quotas imposed on 
the RCMP. During a career fair in the high school in my home town 
recently there were some young males who had expressed an 
interest in joining the RCMP. They were told they had better seek 
another line of employment.
<P>
	Unemployment for young males aged 15 to 24 in March was 
17.4 per cent. The rate for young females at the same time was 13.1 
per cent, a difference of some 4.3 per cent. There is no question 
there are too many unemployed youth. The best way for the 
government to help unemployed Canadians is not through harmful 
equity programs but by balancing the budget, reducing the billions 
of dollars of debt and lowering taxes.
<P>
	Special concessions undermine morale and respect. Somewhere 
along the way the notion of fair play vanished.
<P>
	Immigrants who arrived in Canada over the centuries, our 
ancestors, came here because they saw this as a land of freedom 
and opportunity. The time has come to move into the age where all 
Canadians are considered equal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
speak tonight on Motion No. 154, put forward by the hon. member 
for Wetaskiwin.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2285"> 2285 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion states that the government should support the rights 
of all job applicants to be evaluated solely on the basis of merit. 
This motion is redundant. It is too narrow in scope. We as a 
government do not support it.
<P>
	Our current practices already embody the fundamental principle 
of merit. It is a merit based principle which has contributed to the 
world class level of the public service we have in Canada. Merit is 
the basis of the competitive process across the federal government, 
a process which has produced the most capable and professional 
public servants who well serve the government and the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	When individuals join the public service and when they compete 
for opportunities within the public service they do so on the basis 
of merit. To suggest otherwise undermines the integrity of the 
selection process and its outcome.
<P>
	Clearly merit is the fundamental concept which, when applied to 
individuals who are appointed to the public service, is the best 
option. This principle is enshrined in the Public Service 
Employment Act. The act provides for an appointment in 
accordance with merit, subject to some very small exceptions 
mandated by Parliament.
<P>
	For example, in certain special situations the act requires that we 
give priority to placement of employees whose jobs are declared 
surplus or who face layoffs. The government believes these 
exceptions are essential to the efficient and meritorious hiring 
within the public service.
<P>
	The government is a responsible employer. It must be able to 
attract people of high quality in the future so that Canadians 
continue to benefit from one of the best public services in the 
world. The motion does not recognize this need. The motion is a 
straight-jacket and we cannot support it.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	Hiring in the Public Service of Canada is governed by the 
Employment Equity Act. This motion does not recognize that the 
important principles of employment equity and merit are 
compatible and essential to ensure that Canadians have access to a 
qualified public service that is representative of all Canadians.
<P>
	Our framework legislation is designed and enshrined to ensure 
that our staffing procedures and systems are free from systemic and 
attitudinal barriers. In Canada this means that only qualified 
persons, no matter what their race, origin, colour, sex, age or 
disability, can be recruited into the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
	To ensure these important principles are respected, Parliament in 
its wisdom has given authority to the Public Service Commission 
to correct historic imbalances in the representation of designated 
group members within the public service. This is designed to 
ensure that Canadians have access to the public service and that it 
represents all Canadians. A smart organization will hire  the 
brightest and the best whether they are aboriginals, women, visible 
minorities or persons with disabilities.
<P>
	As the President of the Treasury Board said recently when he 
tabled the main estimates, we have a dedicated and efficient public 
service. We want to treat them fairly and we want them to be 
motivated and feel valued for the work that they do. The Public 
Service of Canada has always been known for its competency, 
integrity and hard work. We are confident that the men and women 
of the public service will continue to display these qualities of 
professionalism. The principle of merit is the cornerstone of our 
ability to recruit the brightest and the best.
<P>
	Our existing legislative framework is a far better guarantee of 
the quality of the public service than the restrictive motion 
currently under consideration by this House. In short, Motion No. 
154 is too confining and restrictive to be supported by this 
government. It does not recognize the importance of the merit 
principle and other access and representation principles that 
Canadians expect this government to apply in order to maintain a 
qualified and representative public service. All smart organizations 
hire people of all colours, religions and races. I cannot imagine that 
the Government of Canada would want to do otherwise.
<P>
	In my riding of Bruce-Grey we try to represent a cross-section 
of the population. The very name of Bruce-Grey reflects this. 
Bruce is the Scottish part and Grey is the English part. I am a real 
anomaly. There are not many minorities. The minority we have in 
our police force would be women. We tried to address this 
imbalance and I am proud to say I was the mayor who hired our 
first woman officer. Now we have three or four and the imbalance 
is being addressed.
<P>
	Systemic imbalances have to be addressed because people 
within society need to know that they have opportunities. As I said 
to the police chief, maybe if we froze time and started over with 
various proportions of all the different people then people would 
not be competing.
<P>
	I understand we are in stressful times and in a period of profound 
change with respect to the job situation. However I am confident as 
one of the best nations in the world we have the ability to make sure 
our young people are looked after and to make sure that every 
person in our society is represented. Equal opportunity for all is 
what makes Canada the best country in the world.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member for Wetaskiwin has moved Motion M-154, which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should support the rights 
of all job applicants to be evaluated solely on the basis of merit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2286"> 2286 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion moved by the hon. member is self-evident. All job 
applicants should be evaluated on the basis of merit. I agree with 
the hon. member on this point: every job applicant should be 
evaluated as objectively as possible, on the basis of merit and 
solely on the basis of merit. In fact, this is a fundamental principle 
in human resources management.
<P>
	But to evaluate job applicants on the basis of merit and solely on 
the basis of merit does not always work. Several groups in our 
society are penalized and not evaluated on the basis of merit by 
their employers. This type of discrimination is usually based on 
their sex, their culture, or the fact that they belong to a visible 
minority or have a physical handicap.
<P>
	This is exactly why the federal government, the provincial 
governments and major corporations had to act and set up 
employment equity programs. Market forces unfairly penalized 
some groups in our society.
<P>
	It is easy to apply the basis of merit to job applicants, but without 
deliberate interference in favour of some of the target groups, 
individual merit is no longer the only element to be factored in, 
since women, natives, the handicapped and members of visible 
minorities are penalized to start with. This is why these four groups 
were designated as target groups for employment equity purposes 
by the federal government in 1992.
<P>
	In December 1992, an amendment to the Financial 
Administration Act provided the employment equity programs 
within the federal public service their statutory authority. However, 
the basic elements of the employment equity programs remained 
the same as the ones listed in the 1986 Treasury Board policy on 
employment equity. It is important to note that the legislative basis 
for the employment equity program precedes the election of the 
current Liberal government.
<P>
	Merit in the awarding of a position must be based on an objective 
system of evaluating positions. A system of evaluating positions 
must describe and measure the levels of complexity, responsibility, 
knowledge and working conditions associated with each position as 
objectively as possible.
<P>
	But this objective mandate must be accompanied by a social 
mandate within an organization, and this social mandate is 
generally fulfilled in the field of human resources management 
through the creation of employment equity programs.
<P>
	The beauty of all this is that the economic and social aspects are 
inextricably linked and mutually complementary. Thus, 
employment equity programs allow talented individuals, members 
of target groups, to make their mark at last, with the help of the 
recruitment and promotion policies set up in the wake of these 
programs.
<P>
	These people come to light and make an exceptional 
contribution to their employer that they would never  have been 
able to make without the existence of employment equity policies, 
because members of their particular group were excluded from the 
outset by the predominant or corporate culture of their 
organization.
<P>
	We will not be supporting Motion M-154 brought forward by the 
member, because evaluation for a position solely on the basis of 
merit must not override the federal employment equity policy 
introduced in 1986 and recognized through legislative amendment 
in 1992. And in order for the principle of evaluation on the basis of 
merit to be as strong and objective as possible, the groups 
discriminated against from the outset must be recognized, so that 
the most talented applicants are selected, regardless of the group to 
which they belong. Recognizing merit alone would be short sighted 
and would be to lose sight of merit itself ultimately.
<P>
	Where have we got to with employment equity in Canada and in 
the various provinces, in the public and in the private sector? The 
situation varies from province to province. According to Morley 
Gunderson, Director of the University of Toronto's centre for 
industrial relations, who has looked at the situation in Ontario, the 
public sector and large businesses have raised their female 
employees' salaries by 20 per cent, in order to improve the 
employment equity situation.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	The corrections have been far more modest in smaller 
businesses. Initially, the only initiatives outside Quebec came from 
the federal government or businesses under federal jurisdiction. 
Quebec recognized male-female employment equity as early as 
1976, while five other provinces followed suit in the mid and late 
1980s. Equity here means equal pay for equal work.
<P>
	The public sector has led the way in male-female employment 
equity. Generally, large businesses have inaugurated pay equity 
programs, but this is far from being the case for smaller ones.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Independent Business is 
recommending, even to the Harris government in Ontario, an 
increase from 10 to 50 in the number of employees a business may 
have before it is obliged to establish an employment equity 
program. This would exclude two thirds of the workforce there.
<P>
	Clearly, salary discrimination is more common in the private 
sector. In the federal government, the cost of establishing pay 
equity is currently estimated at $1.5 billion, as the result of a 
decision by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It 
recognized the results and the relevance of the independent study 
requested jointly by Treasury Board and employee unions. The 
federal government has given itself the months of April and May to 
evaluate the back pay and salary increases that would affect the pay 
of 80,000 female employees.
<P>
	The Public Service Alliance of Canada contends that the federal 
government owes $1.5 billion to 80,000 women working in six 
<P>

classifications of jobs occupied predominantly by women, such as 
clerk, secretary and typist, key punch operators, librarians, hospital 
workers and educational support workers. The Alliance is calling 
for salary adjustments to be made retroactive to 1986.
<P>
	Some unionized workers are concerned that salary retroactivity, 
while legitimate, will result in further lay-offs by the government. 
The federal government has been revelling in employment equity 
terms for more than 10 years, but the court decision is continually 
being put off.
<P>
	Therefore we cannot support motion M-154 because it 
demonstrates short-sightedness with regard to professional or 
on-the-job performance. If we evaluate all job applicants solely on 
the basis of merit we risk eliminating at the outset talented 
candidates from discriminated-against groups. The present 
government should conform without delay to the court ruling and 
definitely do justice to its own employees in target 
groups-Natives, the handicapped, members of visible minorities 
and women-giving them the retroactive payments and raises they 
are entitled to.
<P>
	Only then will we see if the government can, for once, act on 
what it says.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this motion this evening. I congratulate my 
hon. colleague from Wetaskiwin for moving the motion and for 
ensuring that members of the House and Canadians everywhere are 
aware of the Reform Party position regarding employment equity 
and merit based hiring.
<P>
	There are two schools of thought when it comes to employment 
equity. The first is that legislative programs are necessary to fix the 
wrongs, especially past wrongs that were in the workforce. The 
second is that employment equity is flawed because it advocates 
hiring of individuals based on personal characteristics, not on 
merit. Obviously we have two schools of thought.
<P>
	Relative to these opposing views is the assumption of the need 
for some type of affirmative action or employment equity 
legislation. It was thought to be an appropriate method of 
addressing inequities in the workplace. Much has been written 
about the culture of work in this regard, yet I believe that inequities 
that are socially engineered do not explain the vastly dissimilar 
outcomes different groups experience in the course of their lives.
<P>
	The government attempts to dismiss the more complex 
elements, the nature of which is evident in Bill C-64. Conditions 
today are not what they were 10 or even 15 years ago. Empirical 
evidence and supporting information have shown that culture and 
education have more to do with gaps in the workplace than we may 
assume.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I will now highlight five points which express the Reform 
position as I believe it to be. First, all Canadians are equal before 
and under the law, and all workers have the right to be free of 
discrimination in the workplace. I believe that sincerely.
<P>
	Second, the marketplace will provide solutions to a 
representative workplace in the private sector. The hon. member 
for Fraser Valley West has spoken before in the House to this issue, 
and eloquently so. Businesses exercising appropriate management 
and personnel practices will hire people who relate well to and 
serve their customers well. That in itself should mean there will be 
openness within management to ensure employees have full access 
to all of the opportunities the workplace offers.
<P>
	Third, the role of government is to ensure equality of 
opportunity rather than to determine equality of employment 
outcome in the public sector or beyond the public sector. Equality 
of opportunity, that is the role of government, but government 
cannot ensure equality of outcome, and nor should it try.
<P>
	For example, when the NDP was in power in Ontario it made 
itself vastly unpopular by launching an expensive social reform, 
almost a revolution, in the midst of the deepest recession since the 
1930s. Businesses found many ways to circumvent the new law 
guaranteeing equal pay to women. They placed employees on 
contract, forced unpaid overtime and shorter work weeks and hired 
part time workers. The government's employment equity campaign 
aimed at hiring more women, often by posting advertisements that 
bar men from applying, made men very angry and resentful.
<P>
	Even Thomas Walkom, the Toronto <I>Star</I> fair minded Queen's 
Park columnist, called the decision to hire on the basis of race and 
sex wrong, unwise and unfortunate. Women should be given the 
nod when applicants are of equal merit, he argued, but excluding 
any group from applying is dangerous: ``The government has 
merely succeeded in creating a new victim, the able bodied white 
male''.
<P>
	The fourth point Reform puts forth with regard to employment 
equity is that the workplace should be free from arbitrary 
obstructions to hiring and promotion. Merit must be the sole hiring 
criterion. I believe this and evidence has shown that a majority of 
Canadians believe this also. That would mean Canadians generally 
do not support Bill C-64, the employment equity bill. Perhaps this 
is why the government has chosen not to proclaim the legislation. It 
is a question which remains and does linger.
<P>
	The fifth point is that employment equity legislation and 
measures which take away from merit based hiring are coercive, 
unfair, unnecessary and costly, and should be discontinued. To this 
end the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2288"> 2288 </A></B>
<P>
government could go one step down the road to properly 
addressing the issues of merit based hiring by repealing Bill C-64.
<P>
	One cannot address today's motion or Bill C-64 without 
addressing the issue of quotas. When is a quota not a quota? It 
would seem that a quota is not a quota when the former Minister of 
Human Resources Development calls it a numerical goal. 
Remember that minister was the chief architect for the 
government's social engineering plans for employment equity. He 
insisted numerical goals were aimed at getting a specified number 
of women, aboriginal, minorities or disabled, into certain 
industries and that these are not quotas even though the dictionary 
defines a quota as a proportional part or share required from each 
person or group for making up a certain number or quantity.
<P>
	Why does the former minister of HRD not speak clearly and call 
a quota a quota? Perhaps he does not like the word because the 
imposition of hiring quotas for disadvantaged groups in the U.S. 
has created an undesirable backlash among those excluded.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	I raise an interesting example from the United States. The 
American case study is curiously illogical and I believe raises 
questions about current hiring practices which do hint of those 
numerical targets.
<P>
	I use an example from a small California college. At this college 
a form was circulated to companies wanting to do business. The 
letters that accompanied the forms urged that they be filled out as 
quickly as possible: ``To allow us to continue to do business with 
you, equity information is being requested of all colleges''. Such 
colleges receive government assistance in the U.S.
<P>
	The supplier is required to list the percentage ownership of his 
business involving native Americans, blacks, Hispanics, Asian 
Americans and Asian Indians. To get first in line to do business 
with the college, any supplier must be 51 per cent owned by one of 
these minorities or have a business with management and daily 
operations controlled by one or more of the minorities. The same 
priority goes to businesses owned 51 per cent by women or whose 
management and daily operations are controlled by one or more 
women who own the business.
<P>
	A separate bureaucracy was created to monitor this. The 
penalties imposed are real as well. The form states: ``Any material 
misrepresentation will be grounds for terminating any contract 
which may be awarded and for initiating action under federal 
and/or state law concerning these false statements''.
<P>
	Should we not be more interested in ridding the workplace of 
such repugnant misrepresentation and unfairness? When looking to 
hire, should we not be more concerned with what the applicant 
knows or what he or she may perform or what are the merits of 
hiring her or him instead of using and applying filters which 
unnaturally dictate the outcomes of hiring practices?
<P>
	Simply put, the Reform Party wants everyone to be treated 
equally and fairly. We want everyone to have the same access to 
opportunities as the next person. What we do not want to see, 
however, is a situation in which we are dictating what those 
outcomes should be. Let us rather foster equitable hiring practices.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the chance to speak to this motion that, in the opinion 
of the House, the government should support the rights of all job 
applicants to be evaluated solely on the basis of merit.
<P>
	One might wonder why we would even need such a thing. I think 
most Canadians would accept that as a given. When applying for a 
job one should only have to say ``here is my job application, here is 
my merit, hire me based on what I can do for you''.
<P>
	I think most Canadians would say that sounds like the policy we 
should follow. Hiring by merit makes good sense from a business 
standpoint and an ethical standpoint. It also makes good sense in 
the workplace where workers would be able to say they were there 
because they merited the job.
<P>
	Unfortunately in Canada that is not always the case. I am 
thinking specifically of the exceptions to merit. Most people are 
hired on merit but there are exceptions where the federal 
government said the merit principle did not have to apply.
<P>
	The Federal Court of Canada stated in 1982 on the question of 
whether merit was important: ``The requirements of the merit 
principle are always the same. That principle requires that the 
selection be made according to merit, which means that the best 
person possible will be found for the various positions in the public 
service''. It said we should be hiring the best available person 
because that is what hiring by merit means.
<P>
	Unfortunately the federal government does not follow this 
practice. Those watching on television may be surprised to know 
that. The regulations governing the Public Service Employment 
Act stated there were four exceptions to this idea that one must hire 
by merit. I think everyone would suggest that people hired for any 
job, especially in our public service should be hired according to 
merit. There are four exceptions for which merit does not have to 
be proven because there are provisions in the law against 
discrimination, geographic limitations on the jobs, the appeal 
process for job competitions and the considerations of merit will all 
be set aside in the case of the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	We spoke about this earlier regarding section 15(2) of the 
charter. The merit principle, according to the court of  appeal ruling 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2289"> 2289 </A></B>
<P>
of 1982, can be bypassed to appoint someone based not on merit 
but on some of the affected categories in the Employment Equity 
Act. We can discriminate, we can limit the application as far as 
geography is concerned, we can make sure that no one can appeal 
the eventual job allocation. The considerations of merit, the most 
qualified, will be set aside.
<P>
	That is pretty serious stuff. Most people of both genders in all 
groups would say: ``I am going to win this job on merit. Doggone 
it, I can do it, I can handle it''. Right now over 50 per cent of 
university graduates are female. More and more post-graduates are 
from both genders but there is an increasing number of females. 
They say: ``I can handle this job on my merit. I can do it. I do not 
need help. I do not need a special deal. I do not need the standards 
lowered. I can do the job''. And they can. All of us know people 
from all groups of society who are very competent in their jobs, not 
based on the colour of their skin, not based on their gender, but 
based on their ability to do the job well.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we find that these qualifications I mentioned 
under the Employment Equity Act allow the merit principle to be 
bypassed. People can be appointed as the 1982 ruling suggested 
who are not the most qualified but perhaps just passed the 
minimum requirements and fell into a category.
<P>
	The designated groups according to the Employment Equity Act 
are aboriginal people, people of colour, females and people with 
disabilities. That is the description used. I do not like to categorize 
people that way but that is what the act does. It is pretty demeaning 
to say to somebody in one of those categories: ``I do not think you 
are quite good enough for this job. We are going to have to give you 
a special deal because you just are not going to make it on your 
own''.
<P>
	When we held the hearings on Bill C-64, the Employment Equity 
Act, there was a lieutenant colonel from the Canadian Armed 
Forces at the table. We talked about the idea of merit.
<P>
	The lieutenant colonel told me: ``I went from lieutenant to 
lieutenant colonel because I was the best in my class. There is no 
way I can command respect from the people who are working 
under me unless I continue to earn my job. I am the best in my 
class. I am going to be a full colonel someday too, because I am 
going to top my class the next time too. If they wanted to give me a 
promotion not because I am the best but because I am a woman and 
I need a little help, I would refuse. Furthermore, how could I 
command the men and women under me? Imagine my giving them 
orders: I know you have better qualifications than I do, but hop to it 
sergeant; you are taking orders from me. It will not work in the 
military. And frankly, I do not need it because I can do the job and 
qualify on my merit, not on the fact that I am female''. I hear that 
often.
<P>
	An interesting dilemma is that when someone is hired outside of 
merit not because they are the most qualified but because they fit 
into a category, there is no right to appeal. This is what happens. 
Say there are 100 applicants and a certain number of people from 
each of the designated groups. They will choose somebody from 
one of the designated groups for the job. When that individual is 
appointed, then someone else from that group, say an aboriginal 
person, will say: ``Wait a minute. That woman got the job. I am 
going to appeal. It is not fair. I deserve the job. I could beat her 
qualifications''. However, those designated groups are not allowed 
to appeal. Therefore, when someone from another designated 
group says: ``Wait a minute. I think I should have got the job,'' they 
will say: ``Sorry, there is no appeal''. It is preposterous.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	What about the geographic limitations? Normally in the public 
service there are certain geographic limitations of where an 
individual can apply for a job, where they live in relation to their 
work and those kinds of things. Not under this system. This system 
bypasses all of it.
<P>
	I am not saying that the federal government does not pay any 
attention to merit. Of course the government has testing and it has 
minimum standards. However, the Employment Equity Act 
subordinates the principle of merit. That is unfortunate.
<P>
	There are other things which spring from this. Under the current 
Nisga'a deal in British Columbia only people of one race are 
allowed to vote in their elections. The other people who live there, 
if they are not of the Nisga'a race, cannot vote. Other things happen 
with respect to aboriginal procurement contracts.
<P>
	We all want to see equality of opportunity for everyone. The 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women said in a letter which 
she sent to me on April 16 of this year: ``What we are working 
toward now is not the equality of opportunity but the equality of 
outcome. We will not make sure everyone has an equal kick at the 
cat,'' which we all want. ``We will make sure that the outcome is 
equal regardless''. That is not the merit system. That is not what 
Canadians want.
<P>
	This motion is wise. It promotes unity in the workforce and I 
urge all members to adopt the motion.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on April 24, 1996, I asked a question of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development concerning manpower 
training. The question related to an old issue which, hopefully, will 
soon be settled.
<P>
	In Quebec, there is a consensus that the whole issue of 
manpower training should be the sole responsibility of the 
Government of Quebec. This consensus includes people from 
every sector. It is rather unusual to see the Conseil du patronat du 
Québec, unions, the education sector and the government all agree 
on something.
<P>
	Manpower training, including employment measures, must 
come under the responsibility of a single government, so as to put 
an end to the annual waste of $250 million, which will persist as 
long as the current duplication by the two levels of government is 
not eliminated.
<P>
	Also, following the unemployment insurance reform, these 
activities will be totally funded through the unemployment 
insurance fund. Let us not forget that the unemployment insurance 
program was established almost 50 years ago so that people could 
have an income between jobs.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	However, with its unemployment insurance reform, the present 
government now wants to use that money to fund training programs 
in an area that is not under federal but rather under provincial 
jurisdiction. It is unable to give this responsibility to the provinces 
and makes the argument that, since unemployment insurance 
contributions are paid to the federal government, it cannot transfer 
these funds to the provincial governments because it is responsible 
for that money.
<P>
	I think there are two possible solutions. The first one is to ensure 
that contributions are really used to pay for unemployment 
insurance and for the federal government to withdraw from the area 
of manpower, leaving this responsibility to the provinces. In other 
words, that it get out of this tax field and let the Government of 
Quebec, or any other interested province, take it on.
<P>
	The other possibility, as we have already seen with other 
programs, is to ensure that there are agreements that are followed 
up by audits, and that leave the province ample room to 
manoeuvre. The question of manpower training therefore needs to 
be clarified, it seems.
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell us whether it is 
the government's intention to waive the requirement for an 
agreement with the province in order for people to be eligible for 
loans and grants. Somewhat perversely, the present reform says 
that the federal government may not provide funding unless there is 
an agreement with the province concerning the adult loans and 
grants programs.
<P>
	This measure has the opposite effect as well, because the 
province is caught in a bind. If it does not sign an agreement with 
the federal government or if, for instance, it does not accept the 
national standards the federal government might want to impose, 
its citizens may have to do without training programs. In my view, 
this is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	I would like to know if the government intends to simply 
withdraw from manpower training and let the provinces that wish 
to do so have full control over that area and develop effective 
programs to reduce the sectorial unemployment situation we are 
now facing in Canada and in Quebec, where we have about 500,000 
jobs available and almost 1 million workers unemployed but we 
cannot seem to match people to jobs.
<P>
	As the OECD, a renowned international organization, pointed 
out, we do not have effective training programs to help our workers 
adjust to the technological changes, because of all the various 
people involved in this area. Let me ask the parliamentary secretary 
if he can assure me that the government will reconsider its position 
on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to bring my colleague and the House back to the speech from the 
throne, a very important speech. I want to assure my colleagues 
from all provinces who are here in a dual capacity, not only 
representing their constituency but in some cases representing their 
province.
<P>
	The intent of the government is very simple, Madam Speaker, if 
you have read part II of the EI act which is in front of the House 
today and has been debated for over 140 days since its introduction.
<P>
	The intent of the federal government in part II is to negotiate 
with the provinces a withdrawal of manpower training within three 
years or earlier. At the same time it intends to look at the 
responsibilities it has to the unemployment insurance system and 
the fact that we have constitutional guarantees that relate to its role 
in that area.
<P>
	The government wants to make sure before it gets into 
negotiations with the provinces that there are some safeguards. 
This is a national fund and it is important to make sure that when it 
gets involved in negotiations that there are assurances and 
guarantees of results. This is one  area where the government 
would like to receive assurances from the provinces.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2291"> 2291 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time an appropriate monitoring system must be in 
place to make sure that the funds that are transferred to the 
provinces and the agreements that are signed give the government 
the results it is looking for.
<P>
	What are the results? The only reason why the government 
thinks this is an acceptable process is this. It wants to remove 
duplication because it is a factor and it is a cost. It will create 
efficiencies. The results of the system have to help men and women 
get employment and at the same time upgrade their skills and put 
young people into the system in areas where they believe they will 
best be suited in the changing environment.
<P>
	That is the answer to the question. All the member has to do is 
look at part II of the EI bill and he will know that the government is 
not going to be entering into provincial jurisdiction without the 
approval of the provinces.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10
